Johannes Kreidler hopes to question the concept of music copyright with a 33 - second song called " Product Placements " that includes no fewer than 70,200 samples — each of which must be cleared in order for the song ( listen below ) to be legally released .

Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
This will entail delivering 70,200 forms to German copyright authorities , which Kreidler intends to do on September 12 as a sort of performance art project to address copyright issues .
In the video to the right , Kreidler calls a representative of GEMA ( Gesellschaft für Musikalische Aufführungs - und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte , which translates loosely as " sound recording and mechanical duplication rights society " — somewhat like a German version of BMI or ASCAP ) and casually asks that the blank forms be sent to his house , then lays out his objective .
" All creative work uses third - party material , " Kreidler claims in the video ’s English translation .
" Given that the internet has made music instantaneously available on a massive , global scale , and that the progress of new , never - before - heard musical material in avant - garde music has reached its end , the ‘ product placements ’ performance aims to highlight the fact that certain questions arise perforce in connection with sound :
Who has ownership ? "
Kreidler goes on to explain that he hopes to demonstrate that current copyright law makes no distinction between legal and aesthetic ownership .
The piece can be heard via YouTube in the video to the right .
It ’s not the most listenable thing we ’ve ever heard , but could have been worse .
Kreidler points out that the theoretical limit on sampling in a song recorded at the standard CD quality of 44.1 kHz is 44,100 samples per second .
( At that point , each sample could be expressed mathematically as a number . )

There 's a moment when one of the two strong women at the centre of Good Intentions , a ground - breaking television drama series showing at prime - time on Israel 's Channel Two , leaves a voicemail for the other , who is preparing to drop her son off at the induction camp for the first day of his compulsory army service .
" I only wanted to wish you good luck for your son , " she says .
" I hope he will be safe . "
That would be unremarkable .
Except that the woman making the call is Amal , a Palestinian from Ramallah whose brother is paralysed from the waist down after being shot by an Israeli army patrol ; has just passed through a hated military checkpoint on her way home from work ; and is struggling to protect her own daughter from the perils and pressures of life under Israeli occupation .
Both women are chefs recruited for the series ' show within a show , a TV cookery programme with the – in the sceptical eyes of the unnamed channel 's bosses – outlandish idea of being co-presented by an Israeli and Palestinian .
The developing bond between them is strengthened by the implacable opposition each faces from among her nationalistic friends and family .
Tami's husband , who once shot an unarmed Palestinian during his army service , is angry and embarrassed at her cooking in public with the enemy ; the woman she runs a restaurant with , whose husband was killed on military service , leaves for a rival concern in protest at her doing the show ; and her son says that by working with a Palestinian she " weakens me as a soldier " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Across in the West Bank , Amal is facing problems as daunting and as intimately portrayed .
Her embittered brother regards his sister as a collaborator for working with the enemy even though she has taken the job to help provide for him .
" Is it co-existence food ? " he dismissively asks her as he angrily refuses a meal she has prepared for him .
Her 12 - year - old daughter is beaten up by her classmates .
" They said mother was co-operating with the Israelis and they have to kill her , " she tells her grandfather .
Mainly in Hebrew and Arabic – with subtitles in both – Good Intentions is what director Uri Barabash , the Oscar - nominated Israeli movie - maker who trained at the London Film School under Mike Leigh in the 1970s , justly calls a " breakthrough " for peak - time Israeli TV .
Although the popular Arab Work programme was recently aired on Channel Two , it was a sitcom in which the Arabs are Israeli citizens and the Israel - Palestinian conflict is wholly absent .
In Good Intentions it is omnipresent .
And with a steadily darkening storyline , scripted by the Israeli writer Ronit Weiss - Berkovich , this is no comedy .
But , says Barabash : " What is really important is that the most mainstream Israeli channel you can think of is showing at prime time once a week a drama series in which half the action is set in Ramallah , in Arabic and about a Palestinian family .
I 'm very happy and proud about it . "
As with the fictional cookery show , the channel 's network company Reshet took some persuading to run Good Intentions .
The inspiration for it came from the Parents Circle - Families ' Forum ( PCFF ) , a joint grassroots organisation of Israeli and Palestinian families bereaved by the conflict .
One of its most prominent members is Robi Damelin , whose 28 - year - old army reservist son , David , was killed by a Palestinian sniper in 2002 .
Ms Damelin , who believes " the occupation is killing the moral fibre of Israel " has for several years travelled widely at home and abroad presenting the PCFF 's message of mutual understanding in partnership with Ali Abu Awwad , a jailed Palestinian veteran of the first intifada , whose brother , Yousef , was shot dead by an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint and is now an advocate of non-violent resistance .
She regards Good Intentions as " a very unusual opportunity for Israelis to get a glimpse of the other side and vice versa , to see the human side of the so - called enemy " .
At one point the circle dashed off a proposal to USAID for a grant towards making a drama series .
" You can imagine how surprised we were when they said yes , " she says .
But while the US development aid contribution of about $ 750,000 ( £ 380,000 ) – between a third and half of the show 's total budget – certainly helped Reshet 's decision , Ms Damelin still believes it was " incredibly brave " of the network to air the show .
The PCFF also brought the cast to a meeting at which eight bereaved Palestinians and eight Israelis told their stories .
For Clara Khoury , the rising 31 - year - old Arab Israeli actress who co-stars as Amal , this was " really touching and powerful " .
She was especially affected by a young Palestinian woman from the West Bank , Shireen , whose civilian brother was shot and killed by Israeli forces .
" This person , so strong , gave me this encouraging power to get into this character , " she says , adding that even before that " I loved the idea of this series .
I accepted without reading it " .
The secret has been to set what producer Haim Sharir calls a " trap " for Israeli viewers who would normally switch off anything conflict - related – by making the story so emotionally involving that they are drawn into " understanding the other side " .
But while he and Barabash are irritated that putting it up against Euro 2008 kept the audience for the first five episodes down to around 600,000 , it has stuck by the eminently exportable series .
On the question of how far it can also penetrate the Palestinian audience , Khoury says the feedback she has had has been positive – including from friends in Ramallah .
And Al Jazeera has now expressed interest in airing the show – which would create a huge potential audience for it in the Arab world .
Sharir believes the story is one that the satellite channel " could live with if they are willing to show the other side just as we are " .

This is going to be an unusual blog post , because I will continuously update it with features that MySQL still has on top of PostgreSQL , which is generally considered to be more feature rich .
Some of these missing features can however hurt a lot .
I am including MySQL 5.1 in here , since eventhough its not yet released as GA , more and more people have started to use it in production .
At the same time I am also including 8.4 .
So in a way I am talking about what MySQL has on top of PostgreSQL by the end of the year .
I am not going to include stuff like auto increment if there is something that is more or less equivalent with SERIAL .
I am also not including features I consider unwise ( like REPLACE ) .
Finally I am skipping XML support , because I know both are working on improving the support , but I have not yet looked at it so closely .
So here it goes : Multiple charsets / collations in the same DB ( all the way down to the column level )
Choice of Row / Statement based replication to read able slaves ( PostgreSQL 8.4 is only going to offer log file shipping based cold slaves )
Event Scheduler ( PostgreSQL requires the external pgAdmin tool for this )
Hash / Key Partitioning ( PostgreSQL only supports Range / List , though I hear that 8.4 might catch up here ..)
Portable data files across OS
Pluggable storage engines ( even without a server restart )
Better 24/7 operations support due to less reliance on cleanup tasks ( aka VACUUM )
More control over the strictness via SQL_MODEs ( to some extend this is a disadvantage , because the global setting can be overridden in each session , making the life of DBA 's miserable , but generally I consider flexibility a good thing )
Some " softer " facts :
More readily available , at hosters and more importantly in " Enterprise IT " departments ( though MySQL is still usually not support , but at least its not forbidden )
More available OSS apps ( or at the very least more tested , even if the app relies on some abstraction layer to also provide PostgreSQL support )
A larger community ( everybody knows a bit of MySQL and its gotchas , there are more books and best practices blog posts etc. .. though PostgreSQL has less quirks to begin with )
Feel free to correct me , expand my list or provide any other relevant feedback in a comment .
Like I said I will update this post accordingly .
Update [ 03/06/2008 ] :
PostgreSQL also supports pluggable full text indexes .
Clarified point about VACUUM a bit .
Update [ 04/06/2008 ] :
Added a " soft facts " section and note about SQL_MODEs .

Less reliance on cleanup tasks ( aka VACCUM ) to be fair this one depends on the storage engine , and any MVCC implementation has to clean up stale old version records somehow InnoDB seems to have found a more transparent way with its purge thread that always runs in parallel in the background .
No need to schedule vacuum tasks in any way , stale rows are usually cleaned up " as soon as possible " in the background , but even this approach may lead to " interesting " situations if the purge thread is not able to keep up with version changes which can be triggered by high concurrency parallel updates or during * large * DML operations ...
link by Magnus @ 2008-06-03 13:06 CEST
You can certainly reconfigure the full text search in PostgreSQL without restart .
As for VACUUM , with the capabilities of autovacuum in 8.3 , most installations will not need to deal with manual VACUUM at all .
Finally , I assume you 're only counting in - core ( which does n't really work with the PostgreSQL development model , but that 's a different discussion ) - but if not , pgAdmin contains an event scheduling service .
( same goes for replication , of course , with several different external options )
link by Gregory Haase @ 2008-06-03 14:06 CEST
I have seen a lot of chatter about a replication solution in PostgreSQL , but to me that is only one of the two deal killers .
To the best of my knowledge , PostgreSQL still does NOT have the ability to upgrade in place .
If you have upwards of 100 GB of data , it not feasible to dump and re-import your entire database while sustaining only a minimal amount of downtime .
link by Lukas Kahwe Smith @ 2008-06-03 16:06 CEST
Autovacuum does solve a lot of the issues associated to PostgreSQL's MVCC approach .
Of course this approach does have its benefits ( for example a ROLLBACK should be less costly ) , but in terms of providing constant reliable 24/7 performance , the rollback log approach still seems like a plus in many situations .
That being said , there is limited support for inplace UPDATES using a feature called HOT since 8.3 ( released earlier this year ) :

FULLTEXT has been integrated inside postgreSQL core .
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/release-8-3.html
link by Lukas Kahwe Smith @ 2008-06-03 17:06 CEST
Right of course , the question was just if you can add / swap fulltext search algo's at runtime like you can do with the pluggable API in MySQL 5.1 .
According to Magnus this is possible so I will update the above accordingly .
link by Bill @ 2008-06-03 18:06 CEST
VACUUM sounds like it might have some advantages .
Innodb tables can be fragmented with a lot of inserts and deletes .
From looking at the docs , it sounds like Vacuum also reclaims the space and can be done with out locking anything .
I 'd like to see an inverse of this list showing the great things postgres does that wo n't be done in the next year for mysql .
link by Steffen @ 2008-06-03 20:06 CEST
Why do you think that REPLACE is unwise ?
link by Bill @ 2008-06-03 20:06 CEST
Replace does a Delete then an Insert .
It causes innodb table space fragmentation , because it always deletes .
Also some people sometimes forget that its not an insert or update and forget to populate fields that they are n't updating .
Let 's take a step backwards first to : http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul16/israel
Mossad spies ' jailed over New Zealand passport fraud .
This July 16th 2004 Guardian article opens with a blast : " The prime minister of New Zealand angrily denounced Israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected Mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a New Zealand passport .
The plot , which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years , provoked a furious reaction yesterday . "
That 's followed by a March 2005 Peace Researcher article , http://www.converge.org.nz/abc/pr32-123b.html
Israel Apologizes to NZ For Bungled Mossad Passports .
That reads " PR 30 ( March 2005 ) ran a lengthy article entitled " Mossad Spies Imprisoned In New Zealand : Our Passports Valued For Use By Israeli Covert Killers .
" To briefly recap ­ in 2004 , New Zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by Israel 's external Intelligence agency , Mossad , to secure NZ passports ( which are keenly sought after by those who seek hasslefree entry to most countries .
Mossad has a long track record of using fraudulently obtained passports of friendly counties , such as Canada , for its agents to commit crimes , including several murders , in countries throughout the world ) .
" The spy ring consisted of at least three Mossad agents working from Australia ( it later emerged that Australia secretly expelled an Israeli diplomat as a result of this scandal in NZ ) and one New Zealand Jew .
The ringleader , a Mossad agent , and the New Zealander got away to Israel .
The two other Mossad agents , Eli Cara and Uriel Kelman , were arrested in the act of accepting delivery of a fraudulently obtained NZ passport .
" They duly pleaded guilty to a single charge and served three months of a six month sentence before being deported back to Israel .
They were also each ordered to make a $ 50,000 payment to the Cerebral Palsy Association , as they had sought the passport in the name of an NZ cerebral palsy sufferer . "
Deep throat in Iraq According to a reliable source , these Mossad fake New Zealand Passports then showed up in Iraq .
That source 's source is inside the G2 Intelligence section of one of the commanding armies in Baghdad .
Some of the solders caught these Mossads with the New Zealand Passports on them .
The Mossad were subsequently ordered to be let go .
The plot thickens .
Our source talks with members of the 3rd Infantry Division and 4th Infantry Division who nailed the Mossads and ordered to let them go .
As a result , when these US Army personnel returned to the US , they left their army careers and refused to serve the likes of George Bush and Israel ?
What could their deeper reasons possibly be ?
Could it be that in fact the Mossad agents were caught with high powered sniper rifles , killing American soldiers to ' aid and abet ' the illusion that America was fighting a legitimate war in Iraq ?
I repeat , that the Mossad agents were assassinating American soldiers to support the illusion America was fighting a legitimate war in Iraq .
These Mossad agents were caught with IEDs ( Improvised Explosive Devices ) , according to our source , and very sophisticated detonation devices to kill American soldiers and otherwise set off " terrorist bomber " bombs anywhere they wanted those bombs to go off .
Some of these " terrorist bombers " did not even know they had a bomb in their cars .
It was planted by Mossad and then detonated when and where they wanted it to go off to kill as many as they could .
Some Iraqis have noticed their cars were not handling right and stopped to find out what the problem was .
The problem was they were driving a bomb , not just a car , but were not terrorists .
They had been set up to be terrorists when the Mossad had the vehicle where they wanted it to be .
Additionally , some of these Mossad agents were at Abu Ghraib prison and torturing Iraqis right along with US soldiers who had crossed that line under orders from Bush and Rumsfeld .
Some of those held at Abu Ghraib , later released , had their cars rigged to go off wherever , whenever the Mossad - a - tiers wanted them to go off .
In short , the Mossad was invited in to show American soldiers how to torture Arabs .
Lord knows they'd had enough practice in Palestine , or is it Israel ; oh well , less and less of Palestine and more and more of Israel everyday ?
See http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_3546.shtml
Paul Craig Roberts Are You Ready to Face the Facts About Israel ?
But these Mossad members were caught red - handed by our red- blooded American solders , just as the British SAS soldiers were caught with a carload of IEDs and detonation devices doing the same awful thing in the Basra area .
Both sets of events were hushed up in the news .
Bottom line , resign Career solders in our US Army , the source reports , came home after these events and resigned , refused to re-up and extend enlistments to serve in the US Army given the above events they witnessed .
What they saw obviously sickened their stomachs and souls , especially that a purported ally of the US would send in Mossad assassins to kill US soldiers , just to perpetuate the illusion that George W. Bush and his Zionist pals were conducting more than an obscene scam with the Iraq War .
The source would take solace , great solace , if those U.S. service men and women who witnessed any of these events would step forward and blow the whistle on them and on the cabal of ruthless Mossad who killed their own brothers .

One in five women in America are remaining childless throughout their lives , twice the proportion of a generation ago .
A new survey from the US Census Bureau shows that 20 % of women aged 40 to 44 were childless , up from 10 % in 1976 .
Though the report - which is based on figures for 2006 , the most recent year collected - stops at 44 , the number of women giving birth after that age is statistically nominal .
The trend towards having children later in life and the growing proportion of childless women is in tune with patterns across developed countries .
Fertility experts have been struck , though , by the steady decline in fertility in the US since the mid-1980s .
" The proportion of childless women has been increasing steadily by about one percentage point a year , " said Jane Dye , the report 's author .
The bureau 's statistics give no clue as to whether US women are consciously putting their careers before their families and remaining childless , or are experiencing fertility problems perhaps as a result of trying to become pregnant towards the end of their fertile years .
Dye pointed out that the figures do give a clear indication of women 's decision to have children later in life to allow them to complete their education and establish a career .
The tables show a spike in fertility among women with at least a bachelor 's degree in the 30 to 34 age bracket .
" Women are waiting longer to finish their education so childbearing starts later , " said Jennifer Manlove , a researcher specialising in teenage pregnancies with the organisation Child Trends .
Not only are highly educated women delaying pregnancy , but they are also more likely to remain childless .
The proportion of graduates or those with a professional degree without children aged 40 to 44 rises to more than one in four - 27 % .
That compares with just 15 % - less than one in six - for women who did not complete their schooling .
The findings also highlight the shrinking of the average American family .
In 1976 , women on average had 3.1 children , but that figure had fallen by 2006 to 1.9 children .
That is below the level of fertility needed to ensure a stable population - 2.1 children per woman is known in demographic jargon as " replacement - level fertility " .
Expressed another way , 30 years ago 59 % of women used to have three or more children , but that has also tailed off to just 28 % .
There is also a striking variation in the frequency of childless women according to their race or origin .
The proportion of white women , excluding those of Hispanic origin , who have no children is much higher than other groups at 23 % .
Hispanic women are the least likely to remain childless at 14 % , with black women at 16 % and Asian women at 18 % .
The report marks a huge stride in statistical understanding of fertility issues .
For the first time the data has been drawn from a massive sample of 3 m addresses across the US in the American Community Survey , allowing analysis of fertility annually and state by state .
The findings reveal , for instance , that Utah , Nebraska and Idaho in the middle and west of the US have the highest fertility levels while the north - east states of New Hampshire , Vermont and Rhode Island have the lowest .
Creating an Object - Editor Dialog or Class - Grid Programmatically
This document contains the following sections :
Common Graphics includes two types of interface objects that make it easy to browse and edit instances of classes .
The instances are typically stored in databases , but they do not need to be .
One of these interface objects is the class - grid widget .
This is a specialized grid - widget that has a column for each application slot of interest and a row for each instance that you tell it to display .
The other interface object is the object - editor dialog .
It has a standalone widget for each edited slot of a single currently - displayed instance , as well as a number of standard command buttons for displaying different instances and saving edits to them and so on .
To create these interface objects , you do not need to create the individual grid columns or widgets from scratch .
Instead , you specify a special expression as the edited - slots property of the class - grid or object - editor .
The edited - slots property is list of slot specifications .
Each slot specification is a list where the first member is the name of a slot to edit , and the rest of the list is a plist of attributes that indicate what sort of values are in the slot and what sort of widgets should be used to edit them .
A class - grid will automatically create its grid columns from this specification , and an object - editor will automatically create and arrange its widgets .
Typically you would pass an edited - slots list when creating either a class - grid or an object - editor , something like this :
:edited - slots '(( date - of - birth :edited - type ( : date : yyyy / mm/dd ) : label " Birth Date " ) ( favorite - color : edited - type ( : single - choice ( : red : green : blue : yellow ) ) : on- print capitalize - object : label " Fave Color " ) ( best - friend : edited - type ( : class - instance patient ) : width 140 ) )
Though writing a single edited - slots expression is easier than defining a set of widgets or grid columns , there are still a fair number of options to remember ( or look up ) .
To avoid even writing an edited - slots expression , an alternative is to use the IDE 's Class Interface Editor to specify the edited slots interactively .
This document covers the programmatic approach ; for the interactive approach see the doc page for the Class Interface Editor dialog .
The code below illustrates making a standalone class - grid and then an object - editor that contains a class - grid .
Most of the code here is actually for setting up some sample classes with instances .
This example uses an AllegroCache database , though that 's not necessary .
You may cut and paste the code from this document or load into an editor buffer from examples / cg/ object- editors - and - class - grids.cl .
( in - package : cg-user ) ;;;
This will load the CG module that uses AllegroCache ( which is ; ; ; not present in the IDE by default ) if it 's not loaded ; ; ; already , and also load the newest version of acache itself ; ; ; as well if needed .
( require - cg - acache ) ;;;
This will create a new AllegroCache database . ;;;
An open database is needed before we create instances ; ; ; of persistent classes below .
You could use a different ; ; ; path for the database if desired . ;;;
( This code would use an already - open database if there is one , ; ; ; so first make sure that you do not have an unrelated ; ; ; database open . ) ( unless db.ac:*allegrocache* ( db.ac : create - file - database ( merge - pathnames " tempdb / " ( sys:temporary - directory ) ) ) ) ;;;
We need to do a rollback if running through this demo a ; ; ; second time , because otherwise the previous set of instances ; ; ; will still exist .
But it does n't hurt to do it the first time ; ; ; too .
cg-rollback calls db.ac: rollback and then handles ; ; ; any needed side effects in any object - editors and class - grids .
( cg-rollback : confirm nil ) ;;;
Let 's define a test class for patients .
( defclass patient ( ) ( ( last - name :accessor last - name : initarg : last - name : index : any :initform " " ) ( first - name :accessor first - name :initarg : first - name :initform " " ) ( access : accessor access : initarg :access : initform nil ) ( date - of - birth :accessor date - of - birth :initarg : date - of - birth :initform " " ) ( unpaid - balance :accessor unpaid - balance :initarg :unpaid - balance :initform " 0.00 " ) ( friendly : accessor friendly :initarg : friendly : initform t ) ( favorite - color : accessor favorite - color :initarg : favorite - color :initform " " ) ( static - note :accessor static - note :initarg : static - note :initform " " ) ( best - friend : accessor best - friend : initarg : best - friend :initform nil ) ( prescriptions : accessor prescriptions :initarg : prescriptions :initform nil ) ) ( : metaclass db.ac:persistent-class ) ) ;;;
And make some test instances of the patient class .
( defparameter * patients * ( list ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Sarah " : last - name " Somebody " : date - of - birth " 1963/01/15 " : unpaid - balance " 34.89 " : friendly t : favorite - color : blue : static - note " Sarah is the first patient , but will get sorted toward the end . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Andy " : last - name " Anybody " : access : partial : date - of - birth " 1971/03/02 " :unpaid - balance " .09 " : friendly nil : favorite - color : yellow : static - note " This description of Andy is so long that it may cause a scrolling - static - text widget that holds it to scroll . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Alice " : last - name " Loom " : access : partial : date - of - birth " 1967/05/17 " :unpaid - balance " 729.95 " : friendly nil : favorite - color : blue : static - note " This is a rather unimportant note that 's not really about Alice at all . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Helen " : last - name " Nurble " : date - of - birth " 1959/04/29 " :unpaid- balance " 8844.22 " : friendly t : favorite - color : red : static - note " This field displays UNEDITABLE text . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Bill " : last - name " Nurby " : date - of - birth " 1948/04/29 " :unpaid- balance " 42000.03 " : friendly t : favorite - color : red : static - note
" It 's later than it 's ever been . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Higgledy " : last - name " Piggledy " : access : full : date- of - birth " 1968/06/12 " :unpaid - balance " 123.45 " : friendly nil : favorite - color : blue : static - note " I suspect that this is not a real person . " ) ( make - instance ' patient : first - name " Oof " : last - name " Noof " : access : partial : date - of - birth " 1958/02/15 " :unpaid- balance " 3600.00 " : friendly nil : favorite - color : red : static - note " What sort of name is Oof anyway ? " ) ) ) ;;;
Now we make each patient be the best friend of the previous ; ;; patient .
This points objects to each other by putting actual ; ; ; first - class objects ( class instances ) into the slots of other ; ; ; objects .
class - grids and object - editors have some interesting ; ; ; interface options for slots that contain class instances .
( do * (( patients * patients * ( rest patients ) ) ) ( ( null patients ) ) ( setf ( best - friend ( first patients ) ) ( or ( second patients ) ( first * patients * ) ) ) ) ;;;
This bit of code specifies two slots of the patient class ; ; ; that should be used to derive a " pretty name " for each ; ; ; instance of the class .
These pretty names will be ; ; ; printed in menus and in widgets that hold class instances . ;;;
If these slots are not set up , then objects will be print ; ; ; according to their print - object methods as usual , though ; ; ; these properties allow sorting by string slots without ; ; ; a lot of consing .
( progn ( setf ( primary - name - slot ' patient ) ' last - name ) ( setf ( secondary - name - slot ' patient ) ' first - name ) ) ;;;
Now that we 've set up a class with some instances , let 's ; ; ; create a class - grid widget for editing the instances . ;;;
This form makes a standalone class - grid that edits the patient ; ; ; class .
The : edited - slots specification here describes how to ; ; ; create a grid column for each application slot to display .
;;;
See the edited - slots property for a full list of the options .
( let* ( ( width 600 ) ( height 400 ) ( grid ( make - instance ' class - grid :column - header - height 40 :edited - class ' patient :edited - slots `( ;;
These columns edit simple strings of any length .
( first - name : edited - type ( : variable - char ) : width - in - chars 8 ) ( last - name : edited - type ( : variable - char ) : width 120 : sortable t ;;
The column header label would default ; ; to " Last Name " , so let 's change this one .
: label " Family Name " ) ;;
This pixmap column has an alist that maps application ;; values like : partial to names of pixmaps like ;; : key to display for each application value .
( access : edited - type ( : pixmap ( ( nil nil ) ( : partial : key ) ( : full : key - special ) ) ) : sortable t) ;;
These columns use CG 's template - string facility ; ; to restrict input to strings of a certain length ;; and with certain types of characters at each position .
( date - of - birth :edited - type ( : date : yyyy / mm/dd ) : label " Birth Date " ) ( unpaid - balance :edited - type ( : fixed - numeric 6 2 ) : template - allows - sign t : label " Unpaid Balance " ) ;;
A boolean type will be shown as a check - box .
( friendly : edited - type ( : boolean ) : sortable t : label " Friendly ? " ) ;;
Here 's a list of hardcoded choices that will appear ; ; in a combo-box .
( favorite - color : edited - type ( : single - choice ( : red : green : blue : yellow ) ) : on- print capitalize - object : label " Fave Color " ) ;;
This column displays a class instance , with a list ; ; of other selectable instances in a combo-box . ;;
Each instance will display its pretty name according ; ; to the primary - and secondary - name - slot that we ;; specified earlier .
( best - friend : edited - type ( : class - instance patient ) ;;
This is the list of patients that the user can ;; select as a new best friend .
;;
Alternative : Do n't pass this to make it offer ALL ;; patients that exist .
( That requires an AllegroCache ; ; class so that all instances can be found . ) :edited - instances ,*patients * : width 140 ) ;;
This column will indirectly access the birth date ; ; of the best friend of the patient on each row . ;;
The slot indicator is therefore a list of ;; slot names rather than a single slot name .
( ( best - friend date - of - birth ) :edited - type ( : date :yyyy/ mm/dd ) ;;
A subtle point :
This will make the column exactly ; ; fit the fixed - width string , rather than possibly ;; defaulting it larger to make the column header string ; ; fit on one line .
: width - in - chars 10 : label " Best Friend 's Birth Date " ) ;;
This column displays text that the end user ;; cannot edit .
( static - note :edited - type ( : static - text ) : width 160 ) ) ;;
This alternative would set up the rows when creating ;; the grid - widget , instead of adding them afterward ; ; as is done below . ;; : value * patients * : right - attachment : right : bottom - attachment : bottom : width width : height height ) ) ( dialog ( make - window : class - grid - example : class ' dialog : dialog - items ( list grid ) : interior ( make - box - relative 200 200 width height ) ) ) ) ( select - window dialog ) ;;
Add some class instances to the grid .
This set of instances ;; can be changed at any time .
Individual instances could be ;; added incrementally by calling add - class - grid - row .
( setf ( value grid ) * patients * ) dialog ) ;;;
---------------------------------------------------------- ;;;
An alternative to a class - grid is an object - editor dialog .
;;;
The one that we 'll make will include more data than that ; ; ; class - grid , so first we need to set up a few more application ; ;; classes with instances . ;;;
Define a second class for medications .
( defclass medication ( ) ( ( drug - name :accessor drug - name :initarg : drug - name :initform " " ) ( drug - price :accessor drug- price :initarg : drug - price :initform " 0.00 " ) ( drug- warnings : accessor drug- warnings :initarg : drug- warnings :initform " " ) ) ( : metaclass db.ac:persistent-class ) ) ;;;
Make some medication instances .
Each of these represents a product .
( defparameter * medications * ( list ( make - instance ' medication : drug - name " Lispitol " : drug- price " 23.89 " : drug - warnings " Associated with computer addiction . " ) ( make - instance ' medication : drug - name " Franzeril " : drug - price " 1.95 " : drug - warnings " May give Bill Gates a headache .

Use the drug - name slot for the pretty name of a medication .
( setf ( primary - name - slot ' medication ) ' drug- name ) ;;;
Define a prescription class , where an instance will point to ; ; ; the medication that it's for and also to the patient for ; ; ; which it is prescribed .
( defclass prescription ( ) ( ( medication : accessor medication : initarg : medication :initform nil ) ( patient :accessor patient : initarg : patient :initform nil ) ( refills : accessor refills :initarg : refills :initform " 0 " ) ) ( : metaclass db.ac:persistent-class ) ) ;;;
Generate some random prescriptions for each patient . ;;;
( Do n't worry about how this works ; we 're just setting up ; ; ; sample data here . ) ( do * ( ( count 0 ( 1+ count ) ) ( patients * patients * ( rest patients ) ) patient ) ( ( null patients ) ) ( setq patient ( first patients ) ) ( do * ( ( medications * medications * ( rest medications ) ) ( medication ( first medications ) ( first medications ) ) ( prescriptions nil ) ) ( ( null medications ) ) ( when ( or ( zerop ( random 2 ) ) ;;

( <= (+ ( length medications ) ( length prescriptions ) ) 2 ) ) ( push ( make - instance ' prescription : medication medication : patient patient : refills ( random 3 ) ) prescriptions ) ) ( setf ( prescriptions patient ) prescriptions ) ) ) ;;;
And now the astounding finale .
This last form creates ; ; ; an object - editor dialog with a separate widget for ; ; ; editing each interesting slot of its edited class . ;;;
The : edited - class and : edited - slots arguments here are ; ; ; basically the same as what were passed for the ; ; ; standalone class - grid above ; so this is a different ; ; ; view of the same data , but with some additional data . ;;;
This dialog also contains a class - grid for ; ; ; editing the list of prescriptions for the currently ; ;; displayed patient .
The grid 's columns are specified ; ; ; here as a nested : edited - slots specification inside ; ; ; the : edited - slots expression for the whole dialog .
;;;
( See the end of this form for the prescriptions . ) ( make - window : test : class ' object - editor : scrollbars : vertical : exterior ( make - box - relative 60 60 700 ;;

A layout - spacing object can be used to override some of ; ; the default spacing parameters .
: layout - spacing ( make - instance ' layout - spacing : layout - widget - spacing 4 ; ; this is the default : layout- outer- margin 12 ) ;;
Change this value to t to include a special grid at the bottom ; ; of the object - editor dialog that lists all of the edited class ' ;; instances .
: include - table - of - all - instances nil ;;
You can pass any subset of these standard buttons here . ;;
Or you could add your own widgets that call the exported ;; functions that these built - in buttons call .
:command-buttons '( : first- button : previous - button : next - button :last- button :select-button :search-button :save-button :revert- button :new-button : delete-button :commit-button :rollback-button ) ;;
This dialog will edit instances of the patient class .
: edited - class ' patient ;;
This tells the dialog to edit a specific set of patient instances . ;;
Alternative : Comment out this line to edit all instances ;; ( which would require an AllegroCache database so that ; ; all instances can be found ) .
: edited - instances * patients * ;;
Each entry in the large edited - slots property will create ;; a widget to edit the value in the named slot .

This : class - instance case will create a combo-box ;; whose range is a list of instances of the patient class .
( best - friend : edited - type ( : class - instance patient ) ;;
If * patients * is specified here , then that specific ;; list of instances will be the choices , and otherwise all ;; instances of the class will be used .

Alternative : Comment this line out to make it ;; offer ALL patients as the choices .

An indirection to a slot of the object in the best - friend slot .
( ( best - friend date - of - birth ) : edited - type ( : date ) : fixed - width - font t : label " Friend 's Bday " ) ;;
The prescriptions slot holds a list of the prescriptions ; ; for a patient , so we can shows those prescriptions in a ; ; class - grid by specifying the edited type as a ; ; table of prescription instances .
( prescriptions :edited - type ( :table-of- class- instances prescription ) ;;
These additional button widgets will allow the end user ; ; to create new prescriptions for a patient , or to delete ;; some of a patient 's prescriptions .

This nested edited - slots form determines which prescription slots ;; should be grid columns in this class - grid on this object - editor .
: edited- slots ( ( medication :edited - type ( : class- instance medication ) :edited- instances ,*medications * ) ( refills :edited - type ( : fixed - numeric 1 0 ) : horizontal - justification : center : label " Num Refills " ) ;;
These entries indirectly access slots of the medication of ; ; a prescription .

( ( medication drug- price ) : edited - type ( : fixed - numeric 6 2 ) ) ( ( medication drug - warnings ) : edited - type ( : variable - char ) : width 200 ) ) ) ) )
The aging of the U.S. population is translating into many more visits to doctors ' offices and hospitals , a reality that is taxing weak spots in the health - care system , according to a government report released Wednesday .
People made an average of four visits a year to doctors ' offices , emergency rooms and hospital outpatient departments in 2006 , a total of 1.1 billion visits .
The number of medical visits increased 26 % between 1996 and 2006 , significantly higher than the 11 % population growth during that period .
The population is aging , and older people are more likely to seek medical care , says Catharine Burt of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Health Statistics .
And today 's seniors make more visits to the doctor than older people did 10 years ago , she says .
" Older people represent a larger proportion of the hospital inpatient case load , " Burt says .
" They have more complications and have to have more done for them .
So that makes the job of the nurses and people taking care of hospital patients much harder than it was 30 or 40 years ago . "
Meanwhile , patients waited an average of about 56 minutes to see a doctor in the emergency room in 2006 , up from 38 minutes in 1996 .
The longer wait may be because more patients are going to a declining number of hospital emergency departments , Burt says .
But the statistic is somewhat misleading because it is affected by statistics from large urban hospitals where it 's not unusual to wait longer than an hour .
A typical wait is about 30 minutes , she says .
People usually do n't wait very long in smaller communities .
The most common reasons adults give for going to the emergency room include chest pain , abdominal pain , back pain , headache and shortness of breath .
The most common reasons for emergency room visits for children under 15 are fever , cough , vomiting , earache and injuries to the head , neck and face .
Other findings :
• Half of all trips to doctors ' offices were made by people with chronic medical conditions .
High blood pressure was the most common ailment , followed by arthritis , high cholesterol , diabetes and depression .
• Seven of 10 visits to doctors ' offices , emergency rooms and hospital outpatient departments resulted in at least one medication being either provided , prescribed or renewed for a total of 2.6 billion prescriptions .
Painkillers were the most commonly prescribed medication and the ones most used at primary - care facilities and in emergency rooms .
• The rate of knee replacement surgeries doubled for people ages 45 - 64 between 2000 and 2006 .

WATCH IT !
According to a post on the Official Google Blog , the search company is " pleased to let you know that Google search is also available over IPv6 . "
So far , big Internet destinations that have enabled IPv6 , the next generation Internet Protocol , have been far and few between .
This changed two months ago , as the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) , inventors of IP v6 , prepared for a night without IPv4 .
Hours before the IETF was scheduled to turn off the current version of the protocol that powers the Internet , Google made its search service available under ipv6.google.com .
As I noted in the article two months ago , the new IPv6 incarnation of Google 's homepage is a good showcase , but links for mail and maps pointing to non -IP v6 servers .
And the fact that ipv6.google.com is only accessible over IP v6 rather than over both versions of IP make hard to start using this version of the site .
In the blog post , network engineer Lorenzo Colitti and " IPv6 Evangelist " Erik Kline noted that current projections place IP v4 address space exhaustion somewhere in late 2011 , and while technologies such as Network Address Translation ( NAT ) can offer temporary respite , they complicate the Internet 's architecture , pose barriers to the development of new applications , and run contrary to network openness principles .
They even invoke the end - to - end principle , the most sacred of the IETF 's sacred cows .
( The principle says that you should n't try to do something in the middle of the network if it can only be done properly by the sender and the receiver , anyway . )
" We hope it 's only a matter of time before IP v6 is widely deployed .
We will be doing our part . "
This begs the question of when Google will add IPv6 capability to www.google.com proper , so that IP v6 users do n't have to do anything special to make use of the search giant 's services .
Unfortunately , this may take some time .
If Google sets up www.google.com with one or more IP v6 addresses , systems that have IP v6 connectivity will prefer to use IPv6 to reach Google rather than IPv4 .
Unfortunately , sometimes IP v6 connectivity is a good deal slower than IP v4 , or it does n't work at all .
When Vista finds itself without a local IP v6 router , it will try to generate an IP v6 address from its IP v4 address using the 6to4 mechanism .
If successful , it connects to the IPv6 Internet by " tunneling " IP v6 packets in IP v4 packets .
However , if these packets are filtered by a firewall , this leads to significant delays before the system realizes there is a problem and retries over IPv4 .
So websites that enable IP v6 for their normal front page risk unhappy users because " the site got slower . "
Anyway , Rome was n't built in a day , and a commitment to IP v6 from one of the most important web destinations is nothing to sneeze at .

The often deranged postings of yet another hacker , pretending to be an Astronomer , pretending to be a hacker who has written a book or two for O'Reilly Media .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Congressional Democrats on Thursday urged big oil companies to invest more of their record profits into boosting U.S. oil production and developing renewable energy instead of buying back their own stock .
Exxon Mobil , which reported on Thursday the biggest quarterly corporate profit in history at $ 11.7 billion ( 5.9 billion pounds ) , has bought back $ 16 billion of its stock in the first half of 2008 .
Other oil companies have also spent billions of dollars buying their stock , earning the ire of the public and many members of Congress .
“ We are writing to express our concern that you have used much of your record profits in recent years to buy back your own stock to enrich the value of your share price , rather than invest in oil exploration or production here in the U.S. or in the research and development of alternative energy sources that are demanded by U.S. consumers , ” the lawmakers said in a letter to the heads of the five biggest public oil companies .
The lawmakers , who wrote to Exxon Mobil , BP , Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and ConocoPhilips , criticized the companies for spending $ 194 billion on stock repurchases from 2004 through the first quarter of this year .
They pointed out that $ 194 billion was enough to give $ 2,000 rebates to every American family , make 5 million plug - in hybrid cars and build 3.5 million solar - powered homes .
Based on company filings , the lawmakers said only 5 percent of the total money the firms spent on re-buying their stock was spent on research and development , which may not even have focused on alternatives , while 30 percent of the stock buyback amount was spent on U.S. oil exploration and production .
“ Given today ’s strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production , we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the United States is a profitable strategy that will help our country increase its dependence on foreign oil , ” the lawmakers said .
A separate analysis from the Centre for American Progress said the $ 47 billion in just U.S. profits the five big oil companies earned in the last year was equal to $ 236 from every person with a drivers license in America .
“ Inside the boardrooms at the major oil companies , it ’s Christmas in July , ” said Sen.
Charles Schumer of New York , one of the lawmakers who signed the letter to the oil company executives .
India 's debt - ridden farmers committing suicide Despair at paying off loans leads many to commit suicide

Atthre , shown at her farm in February , became a widow after her indebted husband , Vishal , burned himself to death in mid-January on the family farm in Nashik , Maharashtra state .

On a recent afternoon , Seetabai Atthre heard a faint cry from the edge of a vineyard that her family has cultivated for more than 40 years .
Through the furrows , she found her husband , Vishal , smoldering on the ground next to an empty can of kerosene .
He had lit himself on fire and died three days later in a local hospital .
Atthre attributes her husband 's suicide to a $ 5,600 debt .
The farm located on the arid plains of northern Maharashtra state near the town of Nashik had not turned a profit in more than two years , and 65 - year - old Vishal could no longer secure a bank loan to pay off interest on the debt .
" This is wrong , and it 's killing us , " Sanjay Gangode said at a gathering of debt - ridden grape farmers in the region .
" There is no future here . "
While India 's economy surges forward on the crest of globalization , thousands of farmers are taking their own lives every year to escape mounting debt and an uncertain future .
According to the National Crime Records Bureau , at least 87,567 farmers committed suicide between 2002 and 2006 .
In Maharashtra state , there were 4,453 suicides in 2006 , the last year for which statistics were made available , an increase of 527 compared with 2005 .
Sharp increases have also been reported in Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh states .
Last year , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged more than $ 930 million in relief to bail out struggling Maharashtra farmers and " relieve the misery . "
Possible causes of suicides
Analysts cite several factors for the suicides , including crop failure due to agrochemicals and climate change , lower prices due to U.S. farm subsidies , state restrictions on export trade , and the dumping of surplus crops in an oversaturated domestic market .
" The phenomena of indebtedness will recur as long as policies to depress agricultural prices continue , " said Sharad Joshi , founder of Shetkari Sanghatana , a leading farmers ' rights organization .
Ironically , many farmers are facing a backlash of their own remarkable transformation .
In the 1960s , India underwent a green revolution in favor of high - yield farming to counter acute food shortages .
Plant breeding , irrigation development and the use of synthetic fertilizers ramped up production .
Today , India is a major exporter of rice , and the world 's second - largest producer of fruits and vegetables after the United States .
The changes caused higher operating costs and production that created a market glut exceeding demand at home and abroad .
To remain in business , many farmers were forced to take out loans at high interest rates .
Once credit had been exhausted , they turned to private lenders , who charged even more exorbitant interest rates .
And that 's when the suicides started , most activists say .
" Suicide has become so common that no one takes it seriously anymore , " said Giridhar Patil , an agricultural activist in Nashik .
Like Napa Valley
About a four - hour drive northeast of Mumbai , formerly Bombay , the agrarian communities around Nashik boast a Napa Valley - like mild climate and rich soil .
Fruit stands and onion warehouses line a highway that wends through a quiltwork of vineyards under a cloudless horizon .
Despite the ideal growing conditions , 53 farmers committed suicide in Nashik district last year , according to police records .
In an ironically tragic gesture , the majority drank pesticides .
In Umbarkhad , a small village located less than a mile from the Atthre farm , Parshram Athari plies the 5 - acre grape farm where he grew up .
At first glance , he and his family of five appear to be prosperous :
A two - story concrete home with a satellite dish overlooks the property ; the vineyard is hedged and well - irrigated , tended by day laborers who carefully pack export - quality grapes into stamped cardboard boxes .
Athari is also paying 12 percent interest on a $ 17,500 loan .
About 15 years ago , his farm produced 26,000 pounds of grapes per acre .
These days , an acre yields about 11,000 pounds , and production costs have quadrupled .
A hefty share is spent on fertilizers , whose harsh chemicals deplete soil nutrients , making it more difficult to regroup when a crop is lost to drought .
A tractor sits idle , a rusty relic from better days .
Athari also worries that he wo n't have enough money to send his eldest daughter to a good university or pay for her dowry when she marries .
" The ( laborers ) we employ are better off than we are today , " said Athari , who says he now has only $ 200 a month to cover household expenses .
" Our costs are going up and market prices are going down , so we do n't have enough to make ends meet . "
The same grapes he sells to wholesalers for 30 cents per 2.2 pounds can fetch as high as $ 2.50 in a Dubai supermarket .
The price imbalance is made worse if domestic prices rise , he adds , since the Indian government then bans exports , reducing potential profit and flooding the domestic market , which knocks prices down even more .
Such price volatility is a function of globalization , most critics say - and is especially unstable for cotton farmers .
As the world 's largest cotton producer , the United States provides massive subsidies that allow American farmers to undercut overseas competition by selling at an artificially low cost .
Moreover , many Indian farmers are now using genetically engineered Bt cotton seeds made by U.S. - based Monsanto Co. , which produce higher yields .
The seeds and fertilizer , however , must be bought each year , costing farmers thousands of dollars .
Debt waiver proposal
Not surprisingly , debt - ridden farmers have mobilized to support a debt waiver proposal that is floating around congress .
Mohan Dharia , a former commerce minister turned social activist , threatened a nationwide protest this month if demands for fairer crop prices were not enacted by the end of the month .
" Political parties can ignore farmers at their own peril , " he said .
The threat of widespread protests ended after Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced a $ 15 billion aid package for " small and marginal farmers " who owe money to state banks .
Nevertheless , many critics say Indian farmers need a long - term solution , not a one - time bail out .
" The government knows we will take out more loans in the end and fall in the same trap , " said Nivruti Dokhale , a Nashik onion farmer who is $ 8,000 in debt .

A report Wednesday indicating a marked decline in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. fueled a widening national debate over the Bush administration ’s policy of immigration enforcement through aggressive workplace raids .
The largest such enforcement action was in May in Postville , Iowa , where federal immigration agents descended on a meatpacking plant and arrested nearly 400 workers later detained in a building used to house cattle .
The administration began aggressively enforcing workplace laws after Congress last year failed to pass an immigration overhaul .
In the months since , thousands of workers have been arrested in scores of raids .
Conservatives have applauded the tactics , while critics have pointed to mistaken arrests of U.S. citizens , deaths of immigrants in detention and limited scrutiny of managers who recruit and hire them .

However , evidence that the strategy may have succeeded in reducing the number of illegal immigrants was presented in a report Wednesday by a group favoring tighter curbs on all forms of immigration .
The report by the Center for Immigration Studies , a Washington - based think tank , says that the number of illegal immigrants fell about 11 % between last August and May , from 12.5 million to 11.2 million .
The study was based on an analysis of census data and concludes that if that rate of decline is sustained , the number of illegal immigrants will be halved in five years .
Steve A. Camarota , the center ’s research director , acknowledged that the economy played a role in the decline but said that several factors pointed to enforcement as key .
For instance , the legal immigrant population continues to grow , while the fall - off in illegal immigrants began even before unemployment began rising .

“ It seems that increased enforcement has played a significant role , ” Camarota said .
Camarota also said the data suggested that many illegal immigrants were leaving of their own accord .
The decline in their number is much larger than the tally of those removed by the government , the report says .
“ It challenges the idea that there is no way to deal with the problem but for creating some kind of legal status [ for illegal immigrants ] , ” Camarota said .
“ And it seems you do n’t have to deport everyone . ”
Independent demographers said they also had seen a drop in the illegal immigrant population .
But some questioned the study ’s methodology , decline figures and underlying assumptions .

“ Our data are n’t inconsistent with the idea that people are leaving , ” said Jeffrey S. Passel , a senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center , a nonpartisan Washington think tank .
But he added : “ I do n’t see in my numbers anywhere near the decline he ’s talking about . ”
The immigration report was issued as Latino lawmakers gathered to condemn the administration ’s enforcement drive and announced plans to put a stop to the raids .
“ The president knows that we resolve nothing by taking these kinds of punitive actions , ” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez ( D - Ill . ) .

“ He says he wants comprehensive reform , yet all he does is enforcement , with no steps to legalize the status of those workers . ”
The Latino lawmakers said workers at the Postville meatpacking plant endured child labor abuses , sexual intimidation and safety violations .
Homeland Security officials compounded that abuse with heavy - handed methods , they charged .
“ I ’m going to be talking to my colleagues to put an end -- an end -- to these raids , ” Gutierrez said .
“ America is better , greater than these conditions which we have created in Postville . ”
He said immigration reforms must include a way for illegal immigrants to legally remain in the country .
However , he offered no further details on how Latino lawmakers would stop the raids .

Elsewhere on Capitol Hill , conservative lawmakers praised the value of immigrant “ attrition through enforcement ” and held up Wednesday ’s study as proof .
“ Enforcement works , ” said Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) , the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee , which oversees immigration issues .
Immigrant advocates dismissed the report .
“ There is nothing humane nor practical about creating a state of terror in immigrant communities aimed at driving millions of humble , hardworking people from our midst , ” said Frank Sharry , executive director of America ’s Voice , a pro-immigrant group .

Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who visited Postville last week decried working conditions at the plant and the absence of federal action against plant managers and owners .
Two lower - level managers have faced charges , Gutierrez said .
Homeland Security officials have defended the raid and its aftermath .
But Rep. Joe Baca ( D - Rialto ) , head of the Hispanic caucus , pointed to charges that the workers did not have proper access to lawyers and were pushed into guilty pleas .

“ The way the raids took place , ” he said , raising a copy of the Bill of Rights , “ you ’d think none of this was true . ”

War & Drugs : flying while you ’re dying
Hey , I ’m back !
For a few weeks there , the War Nerd was unhorsed , pulled over to the side watching life ’s rich convoy zoom by .
Thanks to the damn ungrateful Russian government , the old exile got shut down .
I was particularly pissed because I ’d just done my most Russia - friendly piece , a long respectful article about the Soviets ’ big victory in Manchuria in 1945 .
I was proud of that article .
I ’d spent weeks researching this campaign that nobody in the West even knows about , and if I do say so myself , I wrote it up pretty clear , pretty solid .
So I thought those Russkies would be happy , for once , if they ’re even genetically up to it .
But noooo !
Ames sent me some translated comments from Russians who ’d read my article in translation on Russian blogs , and I could n’t believe the bitchy comments .
One jerk said , “ The author is just trying to show that he knows a lot about Russia . ”
Gee , sorry , Ivan !
Next time I ’ll try to be more ignorant .
Truth is , I shoulda knowed the Russians would screw us over .
Look at the record and you ’ll see the Russians always treat their friends bad .
The Soviets handed over the membership lists of the whole Egyptian Communist Party to Nasser ’s secret police as part of a weapons - trading deal in the early 1960s .
They lived just long enough to sing “ The Internationale ” in falsetto while getting their teeth pulled out with pliers in Egyptian prisons .
With allies like Russia , you ’re nothing but a bargaining chip .
They hate themselves , so naturally they hate people who stand up for them .
You ’re better off being their enemy .
They respect that .
Half of them are still in love with Hitler , who wanted them killed off like gophers .
So from now on , it ’s no more Mister Nice War Nerd .
This new site , exiledonline.com , is going to be based in Panama , the sleaze capital of the Western Hemisphere , the homeland of one of the ugliest warlords ever hatched , Manuel Noriega .
Noriega used to be one of the biggest drug dealers ever to wear olive drab - and that ’s no mean feat , let me tell you , when you start looking into how many generals have dabbled in dope .
So I thought it ’d be fun to kick off the new Panamanian exiled with a look at war on drugs .
Not THE war on drugs , which does n’t even deserve to get called a war , any more than the war on poverty did , or the war on people picking their noses in public , or whatever public - service “ war ” they ’re pushing in unsaleable ad slots right now .
No , I ’m talking real war , as it ’s done with real drugs .
You can go back in history as far as you want , and you ’ll find warriors high as a bunch of blood - spattered kites , smiting and getting smit while buzzed out of their little minds .
Or you can go forward to the most high - tech military machinery and you ’ll find the people in those machines could n’t pass a urine test either .
Seems like war and drugs just go together , no matter what the DEA has to say about it .
The Vermacht ’s Vending Machines
Armies these days do n’t like to publicize their druggin ’ ways , so the truth only comes out when something goes wrong .
Like in April 2003 , when a USAF F - 16 dropped a 500 - pound bomb on Canadian troops near Kandahar .
Four were killed , eight wounded - nothing too serious - but you should have heard those Canucks whine about it , especially when it came out that the USAF pilot who dropped the bomb without noticing the Canadian troops ’ little red berets had been high on “ go pills , ” as the USAF calls its Dexedrine - that ’s “ speed ” for us mere civilians .
These namby - pamby Canadians claimed that having pilots flying around hour after hour , high on speed and itching to find a target for their ordnance was irresponsible or something .
It seems that the F - 16 pilot , Maj .
Harry Schmidt , had been told to “ stand by ” while the USAF command verified that the target was Taliban , not SCTV - but for some reason Schmidt was impatient , and dropped his 500 - pounder before he got clearance .
If you ever had to deal with speed freaks - and I did , the one summer I tried to make money for college working construction - you can imagine the conversation between Schmidt and his ground contract .
Schmidt would be jabbering a mile a second , not listening to anybody , pouring sweat and chewing his own cheeks off : “ Yeah yeah yeah , they ’re Taliban , of course they are , they ’re drinking Moosehead beer and wearing dumb little Maple Leaf badges and bitching about how dumb Americans are so of course they ’re Taliban !
C’mon , c’mon , c’mon , lemme blow ’em up !
What ’re you waiting for ?
You ’re so slow ! ”
When I was working the site - which was n’t long ; I only lasted three weeks - my job was lugging stuff up to a framer , Don , who started off every morning with a nice cup of coffee and two lines of crystal meth .
Don believed in working fast .
And talking fast .
Don was also totally insane , and had been on the bench press team at one of California ’s finest medium - security institutions , so I did my best to keep him in timber .
He was n’t much on waiting for permission , and eventually went back to his old cell block for hacking up his girlfriend with a framing ax , so I can kind of see where the Canucks are coming from on this one .
You definitely could argue that that stuff makes people a little trigger - happy .
If Don had had 500 - pound bombs available , he ’d have used them on the job , no hesitation : “ Yeah yeah yeah , we need a basement ??
I ’ll give you a fuckin’ basement , shithead , just stand back ! ”
So yeah , it ’s possible Schmidt was a little over - eager when he hit the release button , but you could just as easily blame the fact that he was National Guard .
Never trust a dentist with 500 - pounds of HE ; that ’d be my moral for the story .
Besides , they put up a special monument for those four Canadians in Kentucky , their names on it and everything .
It ’s like the damn Russians : these foreigners , they ’re never satisfied .
Most of the drugs soldiers like to take in combat are over toward the “ go pill ” end of the spectrum .
Well , I mean , duh !
What would you want to do , dose your troops with ecstasy before battle ?
From what I understand , ecstasy ’s for girls , or guy - girls , the whole “ I ’m a fucker , not a fighter ” demographics .
Give something like that to your troops and they ’d dance into battle all painted up with flowers on their faces , walk into machinegun fire with supporting fire from a formidable bank of giant speakers blasting house music at the enemy lines : “ Groove is in the heart ! ” closely followed by .50 caliber bullet , also in the heart .
Nope , ecstasy is the kind of drug you slip into the enemy ’s water supply , so they ’ll “ understaaaand what you meeeeeeean ” while you stroll onto the dance floor and slit their throats .
I have to say , though , I ’ve come across some cases where hippie - type drugs get used in battle by some pretty respectable warriors .
The classic example is the Scythians , sort of the Ukraine ’s pre-Hun Huns , who were like the first heavy - metal dudes , with leather pants and a real stoner way of passing the long nights : tossing a whole hemp bush onto the camp fire and inhaling deeply till they passed out .
Yet they were very good fighters , using the classic combination of composite bow and small , durable ponies to turn all kinds of urban armies into pincushions .
I ’ve seen plenty of stoners in my high - school days , but they did n’t seem like very good military material .
I guess pot was all the Scythians had , and it did n’t stop their natural bloodlust .
But it must have made for some real bad Cheech ’n - Chong post - battle campfire routines : “ Hey , did you see that Persian I shot in the eye ? ” Long giggle .
“ Yeaaaah , that was ….an’ he was all , ‘ Eeeeee ! Eeeee ! ” … and his horse was all , ‘ Neigh ! ’… funny shit , man … . ”
Damn , the nights must have been long out there on the steppe when da chronic was in da house .
So most armies prefer to go with the go - pills , not peacenik drugs .
Before speed came along , there was cocaine .
If you recall that great last scene in Scarface , with Al Pacino introducing those Bolivian roaches to his little ( 40 mm ) friend M203 , firing away even when he ’s been peppered with dozens of bullets , you can see why cocaine is such a morale booster .
Seems to work best in short - term intense combat situations where you ’re not too worried about fine distinctions , because it kind of encourages people to blast away at anything that moves .
It ’s real popular in West African irregular forces , along with speed .
The coolest , most military drug mix I ever read about is something they call “ brown - brown ” in West Africa , a mix of cocaine and gunpowder .
Now that is cool , snorting up gunpowder .
I have to tell you , the notion of getting high on that and running into an enemy village , firing from the hip - I can’t lie , that sounds pretty good to me .
Africans know how to have a good time .
Over here , seems like all people do on coke is dance around like a bunch of goons or come up with Hollywood ’s dumbest movie ideas .
Of course it all depends on what you can get , and what you ’re used to .
In Somalia they do n’t have coke , at least not that I ever heard .
What they ’ve got instead is khat , some kind of low - grade speed that comes in the leaves of this local shrub .
In Yemen , most of the population is on this stuff .
They say you ca n’t walk the streets there without squelching on big mounds of chewed khat leaves , and everybody has a big wad of the stuff in their cheeks like a nervous ninth - inning closer warming up in the bullpen .
They ’re Islamic as hell in Yemen but for some reason Allah ’s not against this stuff , maybe because it seems like it makes good warriors .
The Somali kids who zoom around in technicals lighting up enemy gangs are especially big on chewing khat , which is why people call them “ quick - quick , ” because of the way they jabber when they ’re high .
And of course it gives them extra encouragement to pull the trigger without waiting to see if it ’s a goat , an old lady , or a Canadian soldier in their sights .
Which is all part of what makes life in Somalia so varied and interesting , whether you want it to be or not .
Hitler ’s brain on drugs
Now , those plants , like coca and khat , they ’re for primitives , of course .
We over here in the developed world , well , we developed some stuff that makes that stuff look like grandma ’s chamomile tea .
The big breakthrough came when a German chemist synthesized amphetamine in 1887 .
God .
I love the Germans , I mean I love the Germans the way they used to be , pre-1945 , when they got gelded ( nice pun , huh , “ gelded ” ?
Cuz that ’s Germans now : Money but no balls . )
Back before ’ 45 , German scientists were working night and day to make the world a weirder , faster place , and this discovery was one of their biggest .
Unfortunately , nobody realized the possibilities of speed in combat in time for World War I , but by 1919 , Japanese chemists had come up with a water - soluble version , good ol ’ crystal meth , redneck work ethic in pill or injectable form .
So by the time WW II came along , every army was well - stocked with go pills .
The British used 72 million speed pills in the war , pretty impressive when you consider how bad they fought .
But the serious armies were also bigtime speed dealers .
The Japanese , who ’d discovered the stuff , started handing out speed ( “ Shabu ” ) like candy to the Imperial Forces , which actually explains a lot about why they were good at suicide charges but not so good at thinking through a tactical problem .
When the war was over , and lost , there was so much of the stuff left in the Army warehouses that Japanese civilians broke in and started popping speed to keep their minds off the fact that there was no food , no shelter , and the Emperor was n’t a god any more .
It ’s taken about 50 years to get them off the habit , and they say the Yakuza , the closest thing to a military elite Japan has these days , still has a soft spot for the ol’ speed .
Drugs make WW II a lot easier to get .
How did those huge armies fight so long and so hard , when people these days are so weak ?
Cuz , among other things , they were high , dude .
In fact , I never understood how either side could have stood up to the misery of a battle like Stalingrad until I found out that every damn soldier on both sides was high on speed .
Once you know that , Stalingrad is a whole lot easier to understand .
If you ’d given my construction - site boss Don a submachinegun and told him to hold our construction site to the death — and supplied him with enough meth for the duration — he ’d have been all for it .
And that ’s how the Eastern Front was fought : ten million insane speed freaks blasting each other at close range in frozen fields and blownup cities .
I bet they did n’t even feel it when they were hit , because I once saw Don , toward the end of the day , smash his own hand with the framing ax .
He hunched over , did n’t yell , went to his truck and came back in five minutes totally fine with it , sniffing a lot and talking real fast .
It was easy enough to figure out what his magic pain reliever was .
The rest of the week he worked with just a dirty bandana around the cut in his hand , till they threatened to fire him if he did n’t go to a doctor on the weekend .
The Nazi version of speed was called Pervitin , and when you read letters from German soldiers on the Eastern Front most of them are full of urgent requests for the stuff .
Weird to think about guys writing home to Mom and Dad asking for Meth , but those were different times , and there was nothing hippie - dippie about Pervitin .
It was a good , healthy work drug , just what Germans like , just what you need when you ’ve been ordered to hold an untenable position to the death , in the middle of a Russian winter .
For me and you , that might not seem like fun , but when I remember Don , I can see what a kick it must have been , as long as the Pervitin held out .
But man , what a Monday morning it must have been when von Paulus ’s guys were rounded up and marched to Soviet camps where the ration was one bowl of gruel per day if you were lucky — and no Pervitin , ever .
“ Bummer , man . ”
And if the Japs were handing out speed LIKE candy , the Wehrmacht was literally handing it out AS candy .
That ’s right — I love this , it ’s such a cute little cuckoo - clock touch — the Wehrmacht had special speed - fortified chocolate bars for pilots and tankers , called “ flyer ’s chocolate ” and “ tanker ’s chocolate . ”
I wonder what those candy bars looked like — little cartoon figures of happy pilots waving from their Me-109s , grinning away with big pupils and chocolate stains on their jumpsuits , while they strafed refugee columns .
The Soviet solders had their own speed , which they called “ Vint . ” I was surprised to find that out , because you think of Stalin ’s guys as being so strait - laced , but of course they loosened up on a lot of stuff once the Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow , and I guess the drug laws relaxed along with the ban on religion .
From what I ’ve read , this “ vint ” was cheap stuff , not as good as the Pervitin , so when Soviet soldiers captured Wehrmacht forces , the first thing they did — well , most of the time the first thing they did ws shoot ’em all , and you ca n’t really blame - em — but the very next thing they did was search the bodies for Pervitin .
The postwar West German economy missed a major opportunity there : they should have gotten Col .
Klink to build on the brand identification they ’d won on the Eastern Front and sell the stuff to the Warsaw Pact nations with some slogan like , “ The stuff that made Stalingrad fun ! ”
The one time you do n’t want to be using speedy stuff in wartime is when you ’ve got serious strategic thinking to do .
That did n’t stop Hitler , who was getting daily Pervitin injections himself .
You can understand that little weirdo a lot better , in fact , if you realize what a little tweaker he was : “ Poland !
Yes !
France !
Yes ! Now Russia ! ” “ But Mein Fuhrer , ze situation is not qvite ze same … ”
Aw , fuck that old - lady whining , Jodl , I ’m high as an edelweiss and loaded fer bear !
After we take Russia we give the Sun an ultimatum : you shine on Deutschland all year or we invade !
The Jews are buying up all the good real estate on the Sun anyway ! ”
That was Adolf ’s brain on drugs , a tiny little egg frying up real hard .
The postwar era meant that Germany was condemned to downer drugs for a long time and the speed fad moved west .
JFK was on the stuff most of the time , which supposedly gave the Soviets the shakes during the Cuban Missile Crisis .
They ’d had kind of a bad experience dueling with one speedfreak from the west , and now they were facing another , only this one had nuke - tipped ICBMs .
No wonder Khruschev backed down .
Then came Nam , the war that gave war on drugs a bad name .
See , the difference was that in all these other wars I ’ve been describing , soldiers were using drugs to enjoy their work and do a better job .
Naturally after the battle they ’d do other stuff , drink mostly , to come down from the excitement .
But that was n’t usually part of the battle , though you have to figure that most modern European armies were mostly drunk , since most Europeans up to 1945 were drunk from the time they woke up to the time they passed out in the gutter at night .
But that was R&R , not battle drugs .
In Nam , our guys started out using the same good healthy warlike speedy stuff the Japs and Germans and Soviets had used , but as they got increasingly bummed out by the war , they switched to Thai sticks , which were pot mixed with opium , or even heroin — total downers , not right for a soldier at all .
The low point came when they started bring heroin into the States in the bodies of dead GIs .
That ’s a good benchmark here : that ’s how you do n’t want to use drugs in wartime .
But thanks to all those after - school specials , we ’ve got a new , cleaned - up generation going into battle with the proper buzz , thanks to the medics in the USAF who ’ve got a whole new generation of go pills to hand out .
Not to mention Prozac .
Now you do n’t need to listen to your buddies shrieking all night about something they saw in the trenches .
Prozac ’em up , stuff a few speed pills in their mouths and adjust their attitudes .
When you think about the possibilities of night vision optics combined with hi-tech go pills like the Army ’s developing , that allow soldiers to stay alert for 40 hours straight , it just makes your mouth water .
And I hear this stuff kills your appetite too !
Damn , I ’m in the wrong line of drugs , because I ’ve been sticking to food .
That ’s my drug of choice ; once I ’ve inhaled four or five cheeseburgers , I get a lot calmer .
Maybe I should ’ve enlisted in the USAF , gotten high as a buzzard in a forest fire and played Halo 3 with some Canuck infantry .

University campuses receive a great deal of attention due to the political and cultural indoctrination and activism that some academics try to pass off as education .
[ 1 ]
However , government education bureaucrats are eager to ensure that their prescribed views are etched on the slate of the human mind at a much earlier age .
For this reason , the most shameless political and cultural activism is often directed , under the guise of environmental and social education , at young children attending government primary schools .
In Australia , governments have adopted environmental education programs that teach children that human intrusion into nature is to be condemned and that man 's life must be subordinated to the preservation of nature , by government force if necessary .
Under this view , nature is not to be preserved for the benefit of man , but rather , it is to be preserved for its own sake against the encroachments of man .
This is the philosophy of environmentalism , and the standard viewpoint of environmentalists , according to philosopher Michael Berliner :
Nature , they insist , has " intrinsic value , " to be revered for its own sake , irrespective of any benefit to man .
As a consequence , man is to be prohibited from using nature for his own ends .
Since nature supposedly has value and goodness in itself , any human action which changes the environment is necessarily branded as immoral .
Environmentalists invoke this argument from intrinsic value not against lions that eat gazelles or beavers that fell trees ; they invoke it only against man , only when man wants something .
The environmentalists ' concept of intrinsic value is nothing but the desire to destroy human values . [ 2 ]
Since explicit philosophical argument about the alleged intrinsic value of nature and the subordination of human values is too complicated for young children — and since explicit argument would demonstrate the environmentalist paradigm to be irrational — education bureaucrats instead adopt these principles implicitly as the normative basis for their environmental curriculum .
This curriculum is not designed simply to teach facts about the environment — it is designed to alter behavior in ways that are acceptable to environmentalists and government bureaucrats .
For example , according to a newsletter from the Cessnock City Council 's Sustainability Programs Officer ,
Changing any behaviour is difficult , which is why we try to instil the proper behaviours in our children from the very beginning .
When it comes to the environment , knowledge on its own can be very disempowering .
There has been lots of recent research on how to address the issue of " ecophobia " and in the school environmental education area you can't go past the work of David Sobel and B.B. Jensen …
Sobel 's work focuses on engaging the heart — learning to love the environment first then to protect it . [ 3 ]
Thus , rather than engaging the intellect of children to teach them basic facts about nature , education bureaucrats instead seek to " engage their hearts " — a process which is entirely antithetic to genuine education .
Planet Slayer — Government Funded and Approved
To get a taste of the approved " environmental education " activities of government bureaucrats , we can do little better than looking at a games website called " Planet Slayer , " recommended for children under the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative adopted by various Australian governments .
[ 4 ]
This games website , hosted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and created with the assistance of Film Victoria ( both government bodies ) , introduces itself as follows :
Get the dirt on greenhouse without the guilt trips .
No lectures .
No multinational - bashing ( well , maybe a little … ) .
Just fun and games and the answers to all your enviro - dilemas [ sic ] . [ 5 ]
To assist in their " fun and games " and answer all their alleged enviro - dilemmas , children are guided by the protagonist cartoon character , " Greena , the Worrier Princess . "
Greena is of course the archetypal image of bohemian environmentalist virtue — a spunky green - eyed red head with funky glasses and a nose ring , a khaki T - Shirt with a peace sign , green pants with eclectic colored patches , and sandals .
Greena invites children to use the website 's Greenhouse Calculator [ 6 ] to " find out what age you should die at so you do n't use more than your fair share of Earth 's resources . "
This calculator helps children to determine how much of a " greenhouse pig " a person is by answering questions about how much the person spends and consumes .
On the basis of these answers the calculator determines the person 's CO 2 consumption , which is depicted by making the cartoon " greenhouse pig " look bigger , fatter , dirtier and angrier .
When the child has answered the questions they are instructed to click on a skull and cross - bones symbol to find out when the person should die , depicted by having the pig explode in a bloody cartoon mess leaving only a pool of blood and a curly tail .
For example , according to the calculator , the consumption of an " average Aussie pig " is 24.6 tonnes of CO 2 per year .
At this level , the calculator states :
Based on the emissions from your greenhouse usage , you used up your share of the planet by the time you were 9.3 years old ! …
You should die at age 9.3 .
Some trial - and - error calculations quickly show that most of the questions affect the outcome very little .
However , the most significant factor affecting the calculation is the amount of money spent in the past year , with people who spend large amounts of money being condemned to an early death .
Thankfully there is salvation for these high spenders , since the calculator allows a longer life to those who invest in " businesses or organisations that make environmentally responsible products . " [ 7 ]
Aside from learning when they should die , children can also share in Greena 's adventures as she battles against all sorts of politically incorrect villains .
In Episode 10 , which bears the subtitle " Meat Is Murder … But Who Is that Dodgy - Looking Sheep ? "
Greena sees a dim - witted skinhead eating lamb and drinking beer in a restaurant .
[ 8 ]
She consults her " Activist Tactical Field Guide , " which tells her :
REMEMBER : Most meat eaters are total hypocrites .
Try confronting them with a live version of their favourite meat .
Lumberjacks and skinhead meat eaters aside , Greena 's real arch nemesis and the central villain of the website is a young woman called X - on ( presumably a play on Exxon ) . [ 9 ]
This insidious character is of course the exemplar of the materialistic bourgeoisie — a blue - eyed blonde in a pink shirt , short pink skirt , pink sunglasses and high heels , with a French poodle and a pink handbag .
In the " This is your Lifestyle " section children answer questions on what items they would choose to buy or consume .
When asked whether they would buy their drinks in a plastic bottle , a glass bottle or an aluminum can , our hero Greena shouts " Forget the packaging , it 's all cultural imperialism ! "
Forget the packaging ?
This statement is particularly revealing , since it demonstrates that the lesson that the website is designed to impart is not primarily environmental , but political .
In the " Planet Slayer " game , children can choose to help Greena save the planet by opposing logging , nuclear waste , war , consumerism , and other evils , and supporting such good things as composting , clean transport , solar power , and protesting .
Whereas Greena is again depicted as the virtuous savior of the planet , her nemesis , the bourgeoisie X - on , tries to destroy the planet by supporting the various bad things mentioned in the website — she not only supports consumerism , as is obvious from her clothing and accessories , but apparently also supports nuclear waste and war !
Of course , since war is not primarily an environmental issue , this is presumably included to show that hippy types like our protagonist Greena desire peace , whereas materialistic bourgeoisie types like X - on apparently enjoy war .
For those who suspect me of exaggeration in these explanations , I welcome them to have a look for themselves .
You really can't make this stuff up ( well , not unless you 're being funded by the Australian government anyway ) .
What this tells us about government education bureaucrats
While the " Planet Slayer " website is a particularly galling piece of environmentalist propaganda , the dry rot of government education for young children goes far deeper than a single website .
Rather , " Planet Slayer " is reflective of the standards and inclinations of the education bureaucrats who design educational policies and curricula for children .
Far more unsettling than the actual contents of the website is the fact that , in order to appear as a recommended website for children in multiple government documents for various government schools across Australia , several education bureaucrats must have seen the website and approved of it .
The fact that the above examples registered no sufficient reason to withhold recommendation of the website for young children is indicative of the goals of government educators .
Moreover , since this particular website is both funded and hosted by government agencies , some other bureaucrats must have been intimately involved in its initial creation .
The environmental educational programs of government primary schools reflect the incentives of government bureaucrats and the philosophy of environmentalism , which supports wide government powers .
It is a philosophy that advocates the sacrifice of man to nature , with the government taking ever more power over human lifestyle choices and industry , allegedly in order to protect the environment .
The logical conclusion of this philosophy is spelled out by environmentalist philosopher Paul Taylor :
Given the total , absolute , and final disappearance of Homo Sapiens , not only would the Earth 's community of life continue to exist , but in all probability , its well - being would be enhanced .
Our presence , in short , is not needed .
And if we were to take the standpoint of that Life Community and give voice to its true interests , the ending of the human epoch on Earth would most likely be greeted with a hearty " Good riddance ! " [ 10 ]
For some adults , a greenhouse calculator which tells you when you " should " die may be a useful tool for making lifestyle decisions .
For others , watching a " greenhouse pig " explode may just be a harmless bit of fun .
For radical environmentalists it is a device echoing their desire to end the scourge of mankind .
And for environmental education bureaucrats whose jobs rest on the philosophy of environmentalism , it is a means to " engage the hearts " of young children and inculcate them with the " proper " behaviors — namely , those which support wide government powers and the philosophy on which they rest .
Fortunately , there is hope .
Vigilance from parents may be sufficient to ensure that young children are not propagandized during school hours .
But this requires attention and diligence and , above all , asking children what they learned in school today .

Lance Armstrong is Kate Hudson's Rebound Romance
andmade news early this week when it was reported that their romance had ended for the second time .
The couple reportedly reconnected briefly at the end of February while Wilson was filming his latest movie project Marley & Me .
Now we are hearing , thanks to Perez Hilton , that Kate Hudson has been quietly spending time with Lance Armstrong over the past few weeks .
The couple reportedly took a private jet flight from New York City to Austin , Texas on Friday and are spending the weekend together .
Armstrong , 36 , owns a home in Austin as well as a ranch in the Texas Hill Country .
It should be interesting to see if the paparazzi are able to ferret out any Texas sightings .
Kate , 29 , and Owen , 39 , first split last June .
The breakup was rumored to have triggered Owen 's suicide attempt in August 2007 .
The pair met in 2006 on the set of the romantic comedy You , Me and Dupree .
Hudson has a four - year - old son , Ryder , with ex-husband Chris Robinson .
She is the daughter of actress Goldie Hawn and musician Bill Hudson .
She was recently named People magazine 's Most Beautiful Woman .
Armstrong is divorced with three children , Luke , 8 , and 6 year old twins Isabelle and Grace .
He was engaged to singer Sheryl Crow for 6 months before breaking it off two years ago .
He has since been romantically linked to mega millionaire twin Ashley Olsen and fashion designer Tory Burch .
So , the Second Balkan War .
Unless you ’re a history buff , or Bulgarian , you probably do n’t know about this .
And that ’s fine .
Unless you ’re a history buff , or Bulgarian , there ’s no reason to .
Still , I think it might have some relevance to recent events .
Short version : back in 1912 , Bulgaria , Serbia and Greece teamed up to attack Turkey .
They won .
In fact , they won big , grabbing huge slabs of territory from the hapless Ottomans … but they could n’t agree on how to divide their spoils .
The disagreement got so sharp that just a few months later , the Bulgarians tried to resolve it with a surprise attack on the Serbs and the Greeks .
That did n’t work out so well .
Bulgaria ’s northern neighbor Romania jumped on Bulgaria ’s back taking the opportunity to grab a couple of border provinces .
In the south , the Turks counterattacked to recover some of their losses .
Meanwhile the Greeks and Serbs rolled the Bulgarians back .
When the dust had settled , Bulgaria had lost some thousands of soldiers and almost all the territory that had been gained in the earlier war .
They lost half of Thrace , southern Dobrudja , and almost all of Macedonia .
If Balkan geography is n’t your strong point , let ’s put it this way : they lost almost everything they had fought for , including stuff that really should have been theirs .
And they never got it back .
Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the First World War , hoping to make good the losses of the Second Balkan War ; they were able to grab Macedonia and Dobrudja , but once the war ended they lost all that territory and more .
Then in 1940 they joined the Germans again , and once more they got back Macedonia … only to lose it a third time , this time for good , in 1944 .
They did eventually get back a bit of Dobrudja , but the rest of the lost lands were gone for good .
Bulgaria today is about two thirds the size it would have been if they had n’t tried that surprise attack in June 1913 .
Skopje and Adrianople would be Bulgarian , and Lake Ohrid , and much of the northern coastline of the Aegean .
If you ’re Bulgarian , you ’ve probably spent some time in mournful reflection on this .
Of course , lots of countries have lost territory in wars .
Germany , Hungary , Turkey and Russia all came out of the First World War a lot smaller than they had been .
Then Germany lost more territory in the Second World War , as did Italy and Poland and Romania .
In the 1990s , the Russians saw much of historical Russia carved off into Ukraine , Belarus and the Baltic States .
Just a few months ago , Kosovo declared independence from Serbia .
But most of these were the result of long , protracted , conflicts — World Wars , the Cold War — or of large , long - scale demographic and social trends , like differential birthrates or economic decline .
What makes the First Balkan War unusual is that it was the result of a single bad decision … a single stupid , unnecessary bad decision that ended up doing permanent harm to the nation .
So , here ’s my take : Georgia has just had a Second Balkan War .
They tried a surprise attack to resolve a dispute over land that should “ rightfully ” be theirs … and they lost .
The Bulgarians were shocked when the Romanians betrayed them and the defeated Ottomans turned around and bit back ; in retrospect , these things seem obvious , and historians have spent most of a century arguing over how the Bulgarian leadership could have been so goddamn stupid .
The Georgians were shocked … oh , you get the idea .
Anyway , here ’s the thing : the Second Balkan War poisoned Bulgaria ’s history for two generations .
It sucked them into two World Wars , caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives , destabilized the country and stunted its development .
Interwar Bulgaria developed a remarkably evil terrorist organization devoted to regaining the lost territory — and , of course , killing anyone who was n’t sufficiently dedicated to that cause .
I ’m inclined to doubt that Georgia will go the same way ; most obviously , it does n’t look like there ’s going to be another World War any time soon .
But losses of national territory are hard for any nation to accept .
Almost a decade after the 1999 war , Serbia ’s politics are still being distorted by the tidal pull of Kosovo — and Serbia has the European Union on its border , pulling it hard in a different direction .
Georgia has nothing to keep it from indulging in a protracted spasm of victimized nationalism .
We can certainly hope they wo n’t go that route , but I ’m not sure why they would n’t .
More informed opinions are , as always , welcome .
A. Still a Useful Policy Tool A word about New Open Economy Macroeconomics , which Obstfeld surveyed last year ; certainly this literature has come to dominate the academic literature on international macroeconomic policy .
2
Superficially , of course , most of the newer generation models appear quite different from Dornbusch 's model , not least because they introduce rigorous microfoundations for consumer and investor behavior .
At the same time , however , they can be viewed as direct descendants .
Formally , New Open Economy Macroeconomics attempts to marry the empirical sensibility of the sticky - price Dornbusch model with the elegant but unrealistic " intertemporal approach to the current account " .
3
But even with the inevitable onslaught of more modern approaches , the Dornbusch model is still very much alive today on its own , precisely because it is so clear , simple and elegant .
Let 's be honest .
If one is in a pinch and needs a quick response to a question about how monetary policy might affect the exchange rate , most of us will still want to check any answer against Dornbusch 's model .
Dornbusch 's variant of the Mundell - Fleming paper is not just about overshooting .
The general approach has been applied to a host of different problems , including the " Dutch disease , " the choice of exchange rate regime , commodity price volatility , and the analysis of disinflation in developing countries .
It is a framework for thinking about international monetary policy , not simply a model for understanding exchange rates .
But what sold the paper to policymakers , what still sells the paper to graduate students , is overshooting .
One has to realize that at the time Dornbusch was writing , the world had just made the transition from fixed to flexible exchange rates , and no one really understood what was going on .
Contrary to Friedman's ( 1953 ) rosy depiction of life under floating , exchange rate changes did not turn out to smoothly mirror international inflation differentials .
Instead , they were an order of magnitude more volatile , far more volatile than most experts had guessed they would be .
Along comes Dornbusch who lays out an incredibly simple theory that showed how , with sticky prices , instability in monetary policy - and monetary policy was particularly unstable during the mid-1970s - could be the culprit , and to a far greater degree than anyone had imagined .
Dornbusch 's explanation shocked and delighted researchers because he showed how overshooting did not necessarily grow out of myopia or herd behavior in markets .
Rather , exchange rate volatility was needed to temporarily equilibrate the system in response to monetary shocks , because underlying national prices adjust so slowly .
It was this idea that took the paper from being a mere " A " to an " A++ " .
As we shall see , Dornbusch 's conjecture about why exchange rates overshoot has proven of relatively limited value empirically , although a plausible case can be made that it captures the effects of major turning points in monetary policy .
But the true strength of the model lies in that it highlights how , in today 's modern economies , one needs to think about the interaction of sluggishly adjusting goods markets and hyperactive asset markets .
This broader insight certainly still lies at the core of modern thinking about exchange rates , even if the details of our models today differ quite a bit .
Paul Samuelson once remarked that there are very few ideas in economics that are both ( a ) true and ( b ) , not obvious .
Dornbusch 's overshooting paper is certainly one of those rare ideas .
Now , of course , unless one is steeped in recent economic theory , little of what appears in today 's professional economics journals will seem obvious .
However , that is only because it takes constant training and retooling to be able to follow the assumptions in the latest papers .
Once you can understand the assumptions , what follows is usually not so surprising .
But this is certainly not the case with the " overshooting " result , as I will now briefly illustrate .
B. Overshooting : The Basic Idea Since this lecture is aimed at a broad audience , it is not my intention to invoke too many mathematical formulas , though there will be a few .
A small number of equations is necessary if only to impress upon the reader how simple the concept really is .
The reader can easily skip over them .
Two relationships lie at the heart of the overshooting result .
The first , equation ( 1 ) below , is the " uncovered interest parity " condition .
It says that the home interest rate on bonds , i , must equal the foreign interest rate i* , plus the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate , E t ( e t +1 - e t ) , where e is the logarithm of the exchange rate ( home currency price of foreign currency ) 4 , and E t denotes market expectations based on time t information .
That is , if home and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes , and international capital is fully mobile , the two bonds can only pay different interest rates if agents expect there will be compensating movement in the exchange rate .
Throughout , we will assume that the home country is small in world capital markets , so that we may take the foreign interest rate i* as exogenous .
5
Uncovered interest rate parity ( 1 ) ____ nominal
interest rate expected rate of
charge of exchange rate Indeed , Dornbusch assumed " perfect foresight " in his model - essentially that there was no uncertainty - since techniques for incorporating uncertainty were not yet fully developed at the time of his writing ; the distinction between perfect foresight and rational expectations is not consequential for our analysis here .
Does uncovered interest parity really hold in practice ?
Many a paper has been written on the topic , and the short answer is no , not exactly .
Several recent attempts to reconcile exchange rate theory and data turn on generalizing this equation , though it remains to proven how fruitful this approach will be .6
The second core equation of the Dornbusch model is the money demand equation Money demand ( 2 ) money
supply price
level output where m is the money supply , p is the domestic price level , and y is domestic output , all in logarithms ; and are positive parameters .
Higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding money , and thereby lower the demand for money .
Conversely , an increase in output raises the transactions demand for money .
Finally , the demand for money is proportional to the price level .
Equation ( 2 ) is a simple variant of the Goldfeld ( 1972 ) money demand function .
Given the enormous revolution in transactions technologies , there has been a rethinking of money demand functions in recent years , but not in any direction that requires us to completely redo Dornbusch 's setup .
So how does " overshooting " work ?
It can all be captured by combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with a few simple assumptions .
First , assume that the domestic price level p does not move instantaneously in response to unanticipated monetary disturbances , but adjusts only slowly over time .
We shall say more about this assumption shortly , but it is certainly empirically realistic .
As Mussa ( 1986 ) so convincingly demonstrated , domestic price levels generally have the cardiogram of a rock compared to floating exchange rates , at least in countries with trend inflation below , say , 100 - 200 percent per annum .
Second , assume that output y is exogenous ( what really matters is that it , too , moves sluggishly in response to monetary shocks ) .
Third , we will assume that money is neutral in the long run , so that a permanent rise in m leads a proportionate rise in e and p , in the long run .
7
Now suppose , following Dornbusch 's famous thought experiment , that there is an unanticipated permanent increase in the money supply m .
If the nominal money supply rises but the price level is temporarily fixed , then the supply of real balances m-p must rise as well .
To equilibrate the system , the demand for real balances must rise .
Since output y is assumed fixed in the short run , the only way that the demand for real balances can go up is if the interest rate i on domestic currency bonds falls .
According to equation ( 1 ) , it is possible for i to fall if and only if , over the future life of the bond contract , the home currency is expected to appreciate .
But how is this possible if we know that the long run impact of the money supply shock must be a proportionate depreciation in the exchange rate ?
Dornbusch 's brilliant answer is that the initial depreciation of the exchange rate must , on impact , be larger than the long - run depreciation .
This initial excess depreciation leaves room for the ensuing appreciation needed to simultaneously clear the bond and money markets .
The exchange rate must overshoot .
Note that this whole result is driven by the assumed rigidity of domestic prices p. Otherwise , as the reader may check , e , p , and m would all move proportionately on impact , and there would be no overshooting .
Put differently , money is neutral here if all nominal quantities , including the price level , are fully flexible .
Of course , I have left out a lot of details , and we need to check them to make sure that this story is complete and hangs together .
We will do it later .
Fundamentally , however , the power and generality of the overshooting idea derives precisely from the fact that it can be cooked with so few ingredients .
The only equations we need are ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and therefore the result is going to obtain across a broad class of models that incorporate sticky prices .
Now underlying Dornbusch 's disarmingly simple result lies some truly radical thinking .
At the time Rudi was working on his paper , the concept of sticky prices was under severe attack .
In his elegant formalization of the Phelps islands model , Lucas ( 1973 ) suggested that one could understand the real effects of monetary policy without any appeal to Keynesian nominal rigidities , and by 1975 , Lucas had many influential followers in Sargent , Barro and others .
The Chicago - Minnesota School maintained that sticky prices were nonsense and continued to advance this view for at least another fifteen years .
It was the dominant view in academic macroeconomics .
Certainly , there was a long period in which the assumption of sticky prices was a recipe for instant rejection at many leading journals .
Despite the religious conviction among macroeconomic theorists that prices cannot be sticky , the Dornbusch model remained compelling to most practical international macroeconomists .
This divergence of views led to a long rift between macroeconomics and much of mainstream international finance .
Of course , today , the pendulum has swung back entirely , and there is a broad consensus across schools of thought that some form of price rigidity is absolutely necessary to explain real - world data , in either closed or open economies .
The new view can be found in many places , but certainly in the closed economy work of authors such as Rotemberg and Woodford ( 1997 ) , Woodford ( 2002 ) , and of course in New Open Economy Macroeconomics .
The Phelps - Lucas islands paradigm for monetary policy is , for now , a footnote ( albeit a very clever one ) in the history of monetary theory .
There are more than a few of us in my generation of international economists who still bear the scars of not being able to publish sticky - price papers during the years of new neoclassical repression .
I still remember a mid-1980s breakfast with a talented young macroeconomic theorist from Barcelona , who was of the Chicago - Minnesota school .
He was a firm believer in the flexible - price Lucas islands model , and spent much of the meal ranting and raving about the inadequacies of the Dornbusch model : " What garbage !
Who still writes down models with sticky prices and wages !
There are no microfoundations .
Why do international economists think that such a model could have any practical relevance ?
It 's just ridiculous ! "
Eventually the conversation turns and I ask , " So , how are you doing in recruiting ?
Your university has made a lot of changes . "
The theorist responds without hesitation : " Oh , it 's very hard for Spanish universities to recruit from the rest of the world right now .
With the recent depreciation of the exchange rate , our salaries ( which remained fixed in nominal terms ) have become totally uncompetitive . "
Such was life .
C. Cite Counts and Course Reading Lists
Since we are here to focus on the innate beauty of the Dornbusch model , it is perhaps crass to list citation counts and other quantitative measures of influence .
In principle , however , economics is a quantitative science , so please forgive me for doing so .
For the period 1976 - 2001 , the social science citation index ( of major economics journals ) shows 917 published articles citing Dornbusch ( 1976 ) .
This includes 42 separate articles in International Monetary Fund Staff Papers .
Roughly 40 percent of the issues of Staff Papers published between 1977 and 2001 included at least one article citing the Dornbusch model ; the Fund should have given him a column .
This is influence !
Oh , yes , as an afterthought , I should note that Dornbusch 's article has also been cited in 40 different articles in the American Economic Review and the Journal of Political Economy , the leading professional economics journals .
To put these numbers in perspective , the reader should understand that for the typical middle - aged scholar at a top - five American university , 500 citations lifetime is not a bad count for all of one 's articles , much less a single one .
Figure 1 - which at first glance looks like the hill program on a " stairmaster " exercise machine - gives the time trajectory of citations for Dornbusch 's article .
The article 's peak citation years were 1984 - 86 , when it received over 50 citations per year .
Not bad for an article ten years after being written .
Even towards the end of the nineties , Dornbusch ( 1976 ) was still getting over 25 citations per year .
And remember , these figures only includes journal articles , not books and conferences .
8
Another measure of influence is inclusion on reading lists for advanced graduate courses in international finance .
In 1990 , Alan Deardorf performed an informal survey of international finance reading lists at leading graduate programs .
To his surprise , only one article was listed on more than half of the reading lists , and this particular article was listed on every single one .
Guess which article it was ?
Today , since virtually every course - reading list is posted on the Web , conducting such a survey is much easier .
Table 1 lists the top - ranked international economics Ph.D. programs according to U.S. News and World Report .
Also listed are the top ranking international finance business programs .
One finds that Dornbusch 's article is listed on virtually every course reading list , with the only exception being a few cases where only Chapter 9 of Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1996 ) - which contains an exposition of the Dornbusch model - is listed .
Clearly the Dornbusch article 's influence in teaching is still alive and well as we mark its twenty - fifth anniversary .
The broad concept of overshooting has taken on a life far beyond the academic sphere .
One can find the idea of exchange rate overshooting regularly invoked in the pages of the financial press and in the speeches of major policy leaders .
During 1999 - 2000 , the Economist magazine contained 14 articles including the terms " overshooting " and " exchange rates . "
During 2001 , the Financial Times had eleven references to overshooting .
In recent months , both Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ( June 2001 ) and Bank of France President Jean - Claude Trichet ( May 2001 ) have discussed overshooting in speeches , and one can find countless more references by other world financial leaders , not least in developing countries .
This , too , is influence .
D. Learning from the Master : Life at MIT in Dornbusch 's International Finance Course Before proceeding to more analytic material , it is perhaps helpful to say a bit about how this author first learned the Dornbusch model .
This will also give the reader a bit of the flavor of the period .
I sat in on Rudi 's course in the spring of 1977 .
( " Spring , " anyway , is the euphemism that MIT uses for the semester that starts in February . )
Dornbusch 's classes during the three years 1976 - 78 included many MIT students who went on to become luminaries in the field .
A short list would include Paul Krugman , Jeffrey Frankel and Maurice Obstfeld , but there are literally scores of others who went on to distinguished academic careers .
There were several future finance ministers and heads of central banks as well .
My 1977 class happened to include the brilliant and charming Eliana Cardoso , whom Dornbusch later married .
Sitting beside the MIT students , there were also many Ph.D. students from Harvard , who braved the Cambridge winter to study at the master 's knee .
These included Larry Summers and Jeffrey Sachs .
Rudi has what can only be described as a confrontational style of teaching , challenging his class with a mix of incredibly difficult questions .
To make things even more challenging , his class typically meets very early in the morning , far earlier than the typical graduate student is accustomed to rising .
To put himself at further advantage , as if he needed , it , Dornbusch has a habit of writing down graphs without labeling the axes , a technique he learned from his own teacher , Robert Mundell .
I guess if I had really understood what was going on back then , it would have been easy to follow which way the curves were supposed to shift .
More often than not , however , I had to go back after class and recheck the article he was supposed to be teaching - if it had been written yet .
At least I was not alone in being unable to answer so many of the questions .
Having witnessed Rudi engage the likes of young Larry Summers , Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs , I would venture that Dornbusch 's international finance course at MIT is the answer to the trivia question " When was the last time these guys were completely humiliated in public ? "
The day when Dornbusch presented his 1976 overshooting paper was different .
All the graphs were labeled that day and he seemed to have organized notes , not that he drew on them much .
The excitement in the room was palpable , as the logic behind overshooting unfolded .
You could see in the students ' faces that something special was happening .
The ideas in Dornbusch ( 1976 ) have inspired countless students to choose international economics as a field .
This author is certainly among them .
III .
Theory and Empirics A . The Data
We have come to praise the overshooting model , not to bury it , but it is time for a few hard facts about the data .
Now , if there is a consensus result in the empirical literature , it has to be that nothing , but nothing , can systematically explain exchange rates between major currencies with flexible exchange rates .
This point was first stated in such radical form by Meese and Rogoff ( 1983 ) , and it very much still stands today .9
The basic problem with the Dornbusch model is that whereas it seems to capture major turning points in monetary policy quite well ( e.g. , the Volcker deflation of the early 1980s in the United States and the Thatcher deflation of the late 1970s in Britain ) , the model does not seem to capture all the other big exchange rate swings that regularly take place .
Formally testing the Dornbusch model is easier said than done .
To take the model to the data , one needs to resolve many issues .
These include , not least , how to allow for more general types of monetary disturbances , for the endogeneity of the money supply and interest rates , for real shocks , etc .
Perhaps the most robust empirical prediction of the model is Jeffrey Frankel 's ( 1979 ) observation that , under a reasonably general set of assumptions - which include that monetary shocks must be a predominant source of disturbances - a generalized Dornbusch model predicts that the real exchange rate and the real interest differential will be positively correlated .
That is , high real interest rates will bid up the real exchange rate .
Frankel 's generalization is an important one since if a rise in the money supply signals high future inflation , it will have very different effects on long - term nominal interest rates than if the rise in the money supply is viewed as a temporary easing .
Focusing on real interest rates turns out to finesse this problem .
Figure 2a gives a graph of the US dollar rate versus the German mark .
( For future generations reading this lecture , I will note that the mark was Germany 's currency before the euro . )
The solid line gives the real exchange rate , and the dashed line is the one - year real interest differential .10 A rise in the real exchange rate represents a depreciation of the mark , and a rise in the real interest differential represents a rise in German real interest rates relative to those prevailing in the United States .
As one can see , the model does seem to say something about major turning points , though we will not press to see if it robustly passes regression tests .
11 Figure 2b for the Japanese yen versus the dollar tells a similar story .
Even this tenuous relationship between real exchange rates and the real interest differential we see in Figures 2a and 2b is not universal .
Figure 2 c gives the UK pound against the dollar ; the relationship between the two series , if there is one , hardly jumps off the page .
Another piece of evidence comes from looking at the co-movements of forward and spot exchange rates , as Robert Flood highlighted in his 1981 Carnegie - Rochester paper .
Flood 's basic point is that , in most cases , the overshooting model predicts that forward rates and spot rates will not , in general , move one for one .
The exact comovement depends on the nature of the shock ( real versus nominal , temporary versus permanent ) and on the horizon of the forward rate .
In Dornbusch 's thought experiment of a one - time unanticipated change in the level of the money supply , the spot rate should move by more than the forward rate at any horizon .
This excess movement is precisely the overshooting .
Figure 3a graphs movements of the spot rate together with 90 - day and one - year forward rates for the yen / dollar exchange rate .
Movements in the three series are almost indistinguishable .
The same observation holds for Figure 3b , which gives the mark / dollar exchange rate .
Now , if we were to magnify these graphs , a bit more daylight would appear between the curves .
Indeed , as Table 2 illustrates , forward rate volatility is slightly lower than spot rate volatility over the sample period .
Though it would be straightforward , I do not actually test to see whether the differences are statistically significant .
The overarching point is that the differences are small .
Figures 3 may not constitute decisive evidence against overshooting , but nor does it give strong support to the concept .
12
Does the empirical failure of the Mundell - Fleming - Dornbusch model mean that we have to reject it as a useful tool for policy analysis ?
Not at all .
First , although the overshooting concept beautifully illustrates the inner workings of the model , the broader usefulness of the Mundell - Fleming - Dornbusch model goes well beyond the overshooting prediction .
It is a generalized framework for thinking about international macroeconomic policy .
Second , as well shall see in the next section , the model does not necessarily predict overshooting when output is endogenous .
Third , in newer models consumption typically appears in place of output in the money demand equations ; this change also tilts the balance away from overshooting .
Now , I would be the last to claim that the generalized failure of structural exchange rate models , as found in the post Meese - Rogoff ( 1983 ) literature , should not be taken seriously , even though there has been some progress here in the recent literature towards resolving these puzzles .
13 Rather , the apparent ability of the Dornbusch model to describe the trajectory of the exchange rate after major shifts in monetary policy is more than enough reason for us to press ahead and look more deeply at its underlying theoretical structure .
Regardless , of course , Dornbusch 's model was an important precursor to today 's exchange rate literature .
B. The Model
At this point , it would be helpful to venture a bit more deeply into the inner workings of the model .
Doing so allows us to further explore its ideas and contributions .
If the reader would like to finesee this technical material , she may skip to the next section .
We already have the first two equations of the model , equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above , the uncovered interest parity and the money demand equations .
The only nuance is that since the Dornbusch model abstracts from uncertainty ( except for an initial one - time shock ) , one can replace the expected value of the rate of change of the exchange rate , E t ( e t+ 1 - e t ) , with its actual value , e t+ 1 - e t , in equation ( 1 ) .
One of the central elements of Dornbusch 's model , which I have skipped over until now , is that it was among the first papers to introduce rational expectations into international macroeconomics .
14 Imposing " rational expectations " here implies that private agents must form exchange rate expectations in a way that is consistent with the model itself .
In this sense , rational expectations is a way of imposing overall consistency on one 's theoretical analysis .
The idea has enormous appeal , but took some time to penetrate the economics profession , not least because few economists were familiar with the now standard techniques needed to implement it .
In fact , Dornbusch himself clearly learned the technique of rational expectations over the course of his research on sticky - price exchange rate models .
He had already published a closely - related paper in the Journal of International Economics ( Dornbusch , 1976 b ) , which contains the core of the overshooting model , but did not incorporate rational expectations .
The assumption of rational expectations made the model far more intriguing .
Policymakers found it sobering to learn that in a world of fast - clearing asset markets and slow - clearing goods markets , exchange rate overshooting might be a rational response to monetary shocks .
Equation ( 3 ) below posits that aggregate demand depends on the real exchange rate .
Dornbusch ( 1976 b ) has a bit more complicated specification in which the real interest rate also matters , but this nuance is unimportant for our purposes .
The main feature of the model is the Keynesian assumption that the price of domestic goods cannot adjust immediately to clear the goods market .
As a consequence , aggregate demand yd can temporarily deviate from its full - employment level , .
Aggregate demand ( 3 ) Aggregate
demand foreign
price level equilibrium real
exchange rate where >
0 and is the equilibrium real exchange rate , which for simplicity we will treat here as fixed .
Thus aggregate demand is a decreasing function of the relative price of home - produced goods .
In Dornbusch 's main formulation , he assumed that output y is exogenous , so that if aggregate demand exceeds supply , the only impact will be on price adjustment .
Here , we will adopt the variant Dornbusch presented in an appendix to his paper , in which output is endogenous and demand determined .
As the reader will readily deduce , it is not difficult to move interchangeably between the two approaches .
The final element of Dornbusch 's model is the price adjustment equation .
That prices must eventually adjust to a monetary shock may seem obvious to us today .
Dornbusch 's treatment , however , was in stark contrast to the canonical Mundell - Fleming model of his era , in which the domestic price level was typically assumed fixed , and any dynamics depended on wealth accumulation .
15 Rather than use Dornbusch 's exact formulation , we will use a price adjustment mechanism proposed by Mussa ( 1982 ) , which has many virtues .
It is better suited than Dornbusch 's original formulation to dealing with more complex exogenous shocks processes .
At the same time , it turns out to greatly simplify analysis of the system 's dynamics .
16 Sticky - price adjustment ( a la Mussa ) ( 4 ) where >
0 . A key element of Mussa 's formulation is that price adjustment has a forward looking element - embodied here in its response to expected future exchange rate movements .
17 Note that equation ( 4 ) governs price movement only after the initial unanticipated monetary shock .
In the initial period , the price level is tied down by its historical value and only the exchange rate is assumed free to fluctuate .
To solve the model , it is helpful to reduce the above equations to a set of two simultaneous difference equations .
If we define the real exchange rate as Real exchange rate and normalize the log of the fixed foreign price level p* to zero , then the price adjustment equation ( 4 ) can be written as Real exchange rate adjustment ( 5 ) Note that equation ( 5 ) happens to be of the same form as the standard empirical equation one sees estimated in the large literature aimed at calculating the speed at which deviations from purchasing power parity die out .
18 The second equation of the dynamic system can basically be derived from the money demand and uncovered interest parity equations , making use of the definition of the real exchange rate q .
It is given by Nominal exchange rate adjustment ( 6 ) Equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are graphed in Figure 4 , which is drawn under the assumption that < 1 .
The vertical equation is the real exchange rate adjustment equation ( 5 ) .
As readers familiar with this kind of model will immediately recognize , the basic dynamic system of the Dornbusch model exhibits knife - edge " saddle - path " stability .
Because prices do not adjust immediately in response to shocks , the economy is not necessarily at its long - run equilibrium , given by the intersection of the two curves .
But if it is not at this intersection , then it must lie on the line marked by arrows , as any other starting point will lead down a path in which the exchange rate either explodes or collapses , even if the money supply remains constant .
The microfoundations needed to justify why the economy must lie on the " saddle - path " ( the line with arrows ) in monetary models were just beginning to be worked out at the time Dornbusch 's article was being written .
( The first serious attempt is Brock , 1975 . )
In 1977 , Dornbusch could only assure us that all paths except those on the dashed line " did not make sense . "
That answer , of course , was not entirely satisfactory , and many of us remained fascinated by the possibility that the economy could end up on path characterized by a self - fulfilling nominal asset price bubble .
Numerous people worked for many years justifying this not - so - minor assumption in the Dornbusch model ( and related monetary models ) , using both empirical methods ( e.g. , Flood and Garber , 1980 ) and theoretical reasoning ( e.g. , Obstfeld and Rogoff , 1983 ) .
The short answer , it seems , is that Rudi was right , and the " saddle - path " assumption - that the economy must lie on the dashed line - is quite reasonable .
19
We are now ready to graphically demonstrate the overshooting result .
Recall that the mental exercise that Dornbusch considered was that of a one - time permanent change in the money supply , which in the long run ( imposing the saddle - path assumption ) must lead to a proportionate depreciation of both the price level and the exchange rate .
But in the short run , the price level is fixed , so what happens to the exchange rate ?
Well , when the exchange rate jumps in response to the initial monetary surprise , q and e , the real exchange and the nominal exchange rate , have to move in proportion .
( This is more or less what happens in practice as well . )
Figure 5 illustrates the determination of initial post - shock exchange rate , which must lie at the intersection of the 45 - degree line and the " saddle - path " line ( marked by arrows ) .
As one can see , the exchange rate must overshoot its long - run equilibrium .
I have only presented a graphical depiction of overshooting , but it is not hard to fill in the algebra .
For a more formal derivation , I will leave it for the reader to look at Dornbusch ( 1976 ) or the exposition in Chapter 9 in my 1996 book with Obstfeld , since it is not essential to our discussion here .
What has one achieved by filling in all these algebraic details ?
Is there anything that was not already obvious by looking at equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ?
First , because we can actually solve the model formally , it is possible not only to talk about overshooting from a qualitative perspective , but from a quantitative perspective .
One can show what features of the model ( e.g. , very slow price adjustment ) give rise to a high level of overshooting , and therefore a high level of exchange rate volatility .
Second , one can now easily analyze a much richer menu of disturbances , such as anticipated monetary shocks , though again I will leave it for the reader to look at other references for details .
Third , a formal analysis brings out subtle details such as the assumption of no speculative asset price bubbles .
Last , but not least , a complete formulation of the model is necessary for empirical implementation .
C. Undershooting I have already mentioned that overshooting does not have to happen in this model , depending on the parameters .
Figure 4 and 5 are drawn under the assumption that < 1 , which corresponds to the assumption that money demand is not too responsive to output , and that aggregate demand does not move too sharply in response real exchange rate movements .
If , on the other hand , > 1 - if money demand is quite sensitive to output movement and aggregate demand is quite sensitive to the real exchange rate - then the magic arrow - marked " saddle - path " line becomes downward sloping as in Figure 6 .
Dornbusch considered this case to be quite unrealistic since most evidence suggests that monetary policy significantly affects output only with a lag .
Of course , as I have already mentioned , the undershooting case does not seem quite as implausible in more modern models in which money demand depends on consumption , which potentially responds more quickly than output .
We can go further with the equations , but I think this is enough algebra to illustrate the major points .
I will not make any attempt to theoretically critique the model ; it is clearly dated in many ways .
But what is interesting is how some of its core ideas are sufficiently simple and powerful that they can be preserved in today 's richer and better - motivated frameworks .
Competing Models of Overshooting Dornbusch was not the first to advance the general notion of overshooting of economic variables .
Arguably , one can even find the idea in Alfred Marshall 's Principles of Economics , in his analysis of short versus long - run price elasticities .
The clearest early statement of the concept is found in Samuelson 's 1948 Foundations of Economics where he discusses the application of Le Chatelier 's principle ( from chemistry ) to economics .
Samuelson 's discussion is largely abstract , but he demonstrates general conditions under which , if some variables adjust slowly , others may initially over - react .
At or around the time of Dornbusch 's writing , Kouri ( 1976 ) and Calvo and Rodriguez ( 1977 ) were proposing a very different notion of overshooting .
The dynamics in their models are more parallel to Mundell 's than to Dornbusch 's , in that the slow - moving variable is national wealth , which adjusts only gradually over time through the current account .
Obstfeld and Stockman ( 1985 ) discuss these models in their Handbook of International Economics chapter , and I will leave the reader to look there for further details and references .
The general reaction of policy economists at the time was that these alternative models , while elegant , were far less relevant empirically than Dornbusch 's variant .
The fundamental empirical criticism was that they did not incorporate the essential ingredient of sticky prices .
Certainly , any model that predicts that nominal domestic price volatility is of the same order of magnitude as exchange rate volatility patently contradicts the data .
Also , the somewhat ad hoc Kouri and Calvo - Rodriguez models came along just as the more elegant intertemporal approach to the current account was being developed ( by many scholars but not least including Obstfeld , Sachs and Calvo himself ) , so they were also quickly dated from a theoretical perspective , as well .
Nevertheless , the general point that current account dynamics can have large medium term impacts on real exchange rates remains an important one empirically .
It is perhaps no less important than the connection between monetary expansions and real exchange rates highlighted by the Dornbusch model .
I sketch the idea below , though I admit my discussion glosses over a number of important details and assumptions which one can find in Frankel and Razin ( 1987 ) or in Chapter 4 of Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1996 ) .
Ceteris paribus , during a period where a country is a large net importer of tradables , traded goods will be relatively abundant and the internal price of nontradables will be high .
When the trade balance turns to surplus and tradables become relatively scarce , the real price of non-tradables will drop .
One often sees this pattern in practice , particularly for countries that are forced to quickly reverse current account balances .
Figures 7a-d , show the correlation of real exchange rate and current account imbalances in Thailand , Korea , Indonesia and Mexico in the 1990s .
One wants to be cautious in inferring a structural relationship based on these casual correlations , which is driven by these countries ' shifts in and out of crises .
I believe , however , that a closer look at the data would support the view that the wealth channel was quite important in these instances .
Figures 7e - g show the same kind of relationship for the United States , Japan and the United Kingdom , though in the case of the UK , the correlation is quite weak .
Now it is possible , in principle , to integrate the two kinds of overshooting in a unified model , along the line of Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1995 ) .
Thus the two views of overshooting can be viewed as complementary and not necessarily competing .
In the generalized model , the Dornbusch type overshooting mechanism is the primary factor driving the short - run results ( though there need not be overshooting depending on the model setup and parameters ) .
The Kouri , Calvo - Rodriguez mechanism is central to the long run change in the real exchange rate .
( Of course , the two effects interact , but I leave this discussion to another day . )
IV .
Conclusion
Let me reiterate some of the lasting contributions of the Dornbusch model .
First , it breathed new life into the Mundell - Fleming model , which in turn remained a central workhorse model for policy analysis for at least the next twenty to twenty - five years .
Second , Dornbusch ( 1976 ) was the first paper in international finance to marry sticky prices with rational expectations , both central features of today 's mainstream " post " Mundell - Fleming - Dornbusch model .
Third , the Dornbusch model defines a high - water mark of theoretical simplicity and elegance in international finance , one which inspired a generation of students , and which still stands today as fundamental .
Even today , the model in its original form remains relevant for policy analysis .
Dornbusch ( 1976 ) is truly an extraordinary paper , one of the handful of most influential papers in macroeconomics generally over the past quarter century , and one of the most important papers in international economics over the entire twentieth century .
It is a just thing that we celebrate it today .
Long live the Dornbusch model !

The intertemporal approach reached its pinnacle with the publication of Jacob Frenkel and Assaf Razin 's 1987 book , completed just after Frenkel 's arrival as Economic Counsellor at the IMF .
As I shall highlight in Section IV , the main empirical failing of the intertemporal approach is that it imposed fully flexible prices and wages , an assumption which seems patently at odds with the data .

When I first took Rudi's course at MIT in 1977 , I had never before studied international finance .
Not being socialized in the field , I found it quite odd that a depreciation of the home exchange rate should be described as a rise in e , rather than a fall which seems more natural .
This is , of course , the convention in the theory of international finance , and it is one I have always felt awkward about passing on to my own students at Harvard and Princeton .
It is only now , having just arrived as Economic Counsellor at the International Monetary Fund , that I have come to appreciate the wisdom of the standard convention .
Already , on more than one occasion I have been involved in meetings on crisis countries in which the area department director has exclaimed " The exchange rate is completely collapsing ! " and then pointed his finger upward at the ceiling .
It makes me ever the more grateful for Rudi 's training ... 5 Equation ( 1 ) is commonplace these days , but remember that Mundell 's ( 1963 ) model had i= i* , since the technology for dealing with expectations had not yet been developed at the time of his writing .

See especially , the interesting attempt by Devereux and Engel ( 2002 ) to reconcile their " New Open Economy Macroeconomics " paper with the data , forthcoming in a Carnegie - Rochester conference volume devoted to the topic .
( See also , Obstfeld and Rogoff , 2002 , who show how the risk premium can potentially be quite large in empirical exchange rate equations . )

The property of long - run monetary neutrality is not quite as innocuous or general as it seems .
As Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1995 , 1996 ) stressed , if a monetary shock leads to current account imbalances , the ensuing wealth shifts can have long - lasting real effects far beyond the length of fixity in any nominal contracts .
However , this effect turns out to be of secondary importance in this context .

One frame of references is a comparison with citations to the celebrated Ricardian trade model of Dornbusch , Fischer and Samuelson ( 1977 ) , which has been enormously influential across a broad range of trade issues , and has become a workhorse model in the field .
Dornbusch , Fischer and Samuelson ( 1977 ) had 90 citations over the period 1977 - 2001 , only one tenth as many as Dornbusch ( 1976 ) .
9 See Rogoff ( 2001 ) .
In their chapter for the 1994 Handbook of International Economics , Frankel and Rose observe that scores of attempts to reverse the Meese - Rogoff finding had only served to reinforce it .
More recent work can be found in papers presented the September 2001 Conference on Empirical Exchange Rate Modeling , http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~cengel/ExchangeRateConference/exrate.htm.
The proceeds are to be published in the February 2003 Journal of International Economics .

The real interest rate is formed by taking the one - year nominal interest rate and subtracting off lagged twelve - month inflation .
11 Meese and Rogoff ( 1988 ) find that it is very difficult to detect any reliable relationship between real interest rates and real exchange rates for the major currencies .
12 Dornbusch ( 1976 ) , and Friedman ( 1953 ) writing before him , clearly anticipated that under floating exchange rates , the monetary authorities would allow nominal interest rates to fluctuate in response to real and financial market shocks far more than has actually turned out to be the case .
13 See especially , Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 2001 ) .
14 Stanley Black 's 1973 Princeton International Finance Discussion Paper appears to have been the first international finance paper to incorporate rational expectations ; it is cited in Dornbusch 's article .
15 In truth , neither the Dornbusch nor the Mundell - Fleming version of the Keynesian model had a well - developed theory of how the economy should move from short to long - run equilibrium , and this important detail only came later in new open economy macroeconomics versions of the models .
16 In fact , for the kinds of shocks Dornbusch ( 1976 ) analyzed , the Mussa price adjustment equation is observationally equivalent ; see Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1984 ) .
Frankel ( 1979 ) offers an alternative way to extend the Dornbusch model to allow for money growth shocks , though again it turns out to be observationally equivalent to the Mussa model .
17 In general , the final term in the Mussa price adjustment mechanism has the level of inflation that would be needed to clear the goods market if it were already in equilibrium .
In the simple model I present here , that rate of inflation just happens to equal the rate of exchange rate depreciation - see Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 1984 ) or ( 1996 , Chapter 9 ) for the general case .

Dems who flipped on FISA immunity see more telecom cash
House Democrats who flipped their votes to support retroactive immunity for telecom companies in last week ’s FISA bill took thousands of dollars more from phone companies than Democrats who consistently voted against legislation with an immunity provision , according to an analysis by MAPLight.org .
In March , the House passed an amendment that rejected retroactive immunity .
But last week , 94 Democrats who supported the March amendment voted to support the compromise FISA legislation , which includes a provision that could let telecom companies that cooperated with the government ’s warrantless electronic surveillance off the hook .
The 94 Democrats who changed their positions received on average $ 8,359 in contributions from Verizon , AT&T and Sprint from Jan. 2005 to March 2008 , according to the analysis by MAPLight , a nonpartisan organization that tracks the connection between campaign contributions and legislative outcomes .
Retroactive immunity could squash about 40 lawsuits pending against telecommunication companies that helped the government monitor the telecommunications traffic of Americans without warrants .
The telecom industry has lobbied hard to insure that the provision is included in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act update Congress is currently considering .
Nick Papas , spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus , said , “ Many members of the caucus opposed the earlier version of this legislation and ultimately supported better legislation that was the product of bipartisan negotiations .
Months of hard work , not campaign contributions , earned the support of many members . ”
MAPLight executive director Daniel Newman agreed that there are many factors that affect a lawmaker ’s vote but , unlike pressure from constituents , campaign cash is not a “ democratic influence . ”
The 116 Democrats who remained opposed to telecom immunity received an average of $ 4,987 from the telecoms during the three - year period , the analysis showed .
“ Regardless which way the legislators ’ vote , the fact is most of them get money from the telecom industry and that buys access even if it does n’t buy a favorable result for telecom , ” Newman said .
The members who voted yes on June 20 received , on average , $ 9,659 from the big three phone companies while those who opposed the bill received an average of $ 4,810 , MAPLight found .
The money provides special interests with a bigger megaphone , Newman said .
“ Who ’s more likely to get a meeting , you or AT&T , which donates million of dollars and has the legislator ’s ear ? ”
To create the large scale reproduction of my Gandhi avatar from Second Life , we first needed to extract my avatar 's 3 - D model from SL and process this model through a number of readily available software applications .
This was followed by the physical realization of the object in cardboard - I 've broken this section into three sections , SOFTWARE , MATERIALS , TOOLS :
- You will need a PC Windows computer , a laser or inkjet printer .
Software required :
1 ) Second Life ( to use this online environment one must sign up and create an avatar , this is free )
2 ) OGLE - " is an open source software package by the Eyebeam OpenLab that allows for the capture and re-use of 3D geometry data from 3D graphics applications running on Microsoft Windows " - it is freely available to use and share , complete with detailed instructions for use in any online game that uses openGL .
This can get a bit tricky - do read the instructions carefully and follow these to the " T " and you should be able to extract your avatar from Second Life .
Be aware that OGLE generally extracts the entire square region in which you are residing .
3 ) Blender - this is an amazing free 3 - D modeling and animation program - has a bit of a learning curve - you can generally use any 3 - D modeling application for this step .
You need this step to allow you to optimize the number of polygons in your model which are generally far to many to allow for the creation of a usable papercraft model .
We also used Blender to eliminate the environment and other objects from SL that were extracted using OGLE - when we first extracted Gandhi we could n't find him at first as the region was so big , he turned out to be a little speck in the enormous region that was extracted .
We then use Blender to eliminate all the extraneous information that came through the extraction process .
4 ) Pepakura Designer - this is a program that transforms any 3 - D model into usable templates or unfolding a 3 - D model for use in papercrafting .
A really fun program , be sure and take a look at the gallery link on their site , people make some pretty amazing stuff with this program !
Materials :
- CardboardCardboard - brown double faced - I used 25 sheets of 4x8 ' single ply cardboard purchased and delivered for $ 100 - you can get this stuff readily at packing supply houses online .
This is the cardboard that is used for the construction of the polygon skin of the sculpture .
You could of course do this project with cardboard boxes although you would need to be sure and find some large ones ;-)
- Honeycomb board - I used 6 sheets of this 42x30x1 / 2 " board purchased at Utrecht Art Supplies for $ 9.40 cents a sheet - you can likely find this cheaper or even for free in local dumpsters !
This cardboard is very sturdy and was used extensively to create the inner support system for the standing figure .
You can also likely find this stuff for free , often it is used for single use pallets for shipping and such .
- Cardboard Carpet tubes - various diameters , these I found in the trash both in an around Eyebeam , you would likely be able to get these for free at any big carpet retailer in your area .
These are thicker than the standard shipping tubes and such , these are essential for building the interior support structure .
- Transparencies Transparencies for either your Laser or Inkjet printer , get a box of 100 .
Be sure you get what works for your printer - inkjet transparencies in a laser printer will melt on the rollers !
- There are a few miscellaneous items that will be noted in further steps ...
Tools :
- Hot Glue GunHot Glue Gun - I bought an industrial grade version of this typical craft tool - you can find these online - this was by far the right tool for this job !
This is the one I bought , well worth the $ 100 !
- Box Cutter / Matt Knife QUICK CHANGEBox Cutter / Matt Knife QUICK CHANGE preferred ( I used a Husky folding version from Home Depot that was very convenient as it can strap to your belt or fold to go in your pocket )
- Replacement blades , buy at least a box or dispenser of 50 - 100 blades , you will want to change blades often during the cutting and scoring process .
- Alumi Cutter 30 " Alumi Cutter 30 " straight edge and ruler ( you can use other sizes but I think this is the best , has a raised edge to protect your fingers during cutting and scoring , take it from one who has sliced off the tip of my left index finger several times over the years , this tool is fabulous and essential for this process ! ) .
- Cutting MatCutting Mat - I used an Alvin 17x23 " version .
This is a self - healing surface that allows for thousands of cuts - really useful for this project as it helps keep your blades sharp and you do n't get stuck in cut lines during the scoring and cutting of the cardboard .
- Sharpie MarkersSharpie Markers - red , blue and black or whatever colors you prefer ( you need three colors to delineate cuts and the two different types of scoring , " mountains " or " valleys " as defined by the Pepakura diagrams .
- Overhead projectorOverhead projector - I used a standard 3 M model , this was used to magnify and project the Pepakura diagrams on to the 4x8 ' sheets of cardboard .
- Band sawBand saw - this is not essential , one could cut the pieces entirely using a mat knife but I would highly recommend using this floor standing saw as it greatly sped up the process of cutting out the Pepakura pieces .
- Various tapes - wide masking tape was used to hold the cardboard to the wall for projection and drawing of the diagrams .
Drafting tape or blue painting tape was used to hold the transparencies in position on the overhead projector .
- Velcro - I used one roll of 3 ' velcro with the sticky back on both sides to help with the final assembly of the figure .
April 26 , 2008  -- South Carolina Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn has expressed his worry about the tone of the party 's race for the nomination and criticized the Hillary Clinton campaign harshly for how it has dealt with Barack Obama .
" I think a lot of Clinton surrogates have been marginalizing , demonizing and trivializing Obama , " said the undeclared superdelegate , who worried the Democrats will lose in the fall if Americans lose faith in the election process .
The renowned Civil Rights advocate saved his harshest words for the campaign 's No. 1 surrogate , Bill Clinton .
Clyburn was incensed when the former president seemed to dismiss Obama 's South Carolina primary win earlier this election season .
" Jesse Jackson won South Carolina twice , " Bill Clinton said in February following his wife 's defeat in January .
When asked about the comment this week , Clinton said he was the victim of racial politics .
" I think that they played the race card on me .
And we now know , from memos from the campaign and everything , that they planned to do it all along , " he said .
Those comments further upset Clyburn .
" How do you play the race card on the ex-president of the United States ?
How do you do it ?
I would like to know how that 's done and who they [ are ] .
And I 'd like to see these memos he 's talking about .
That 's what 's so bizarre about this , " Clyburn said .
The talk about race has heated up again in the Democratic race following Hillary Clinton 's win Tuesday over Obama in Pennsylvania .
Critics have wondered aloud whether the politics of race has slowed Obama 's momentum , as some Democratic leaders start expressing concern about the Illinois senator 's weaknesses among a key Democratic group -- white working - class voters .
Earlier this year , Obama ran into trouble when controversial comments from his former pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , hit the airwaves .
The biracial Obama hoped to put the controversy to rest by delivering a speech on race addressing his relationship with Wright .
In a televised interview last night with Bill Moyers , Wright said the controversy surrounding him came from out - of - context sound bites and the mainstream media 's naïveté about the African - American experience .
" I felt it was unfair .
I felt it was unjust .
I felt it was untrue .
I felt for those who were doing that [ they ] were doing it for some very devious reasons , " said Wright , former Trinity United Church of Christ pastor .
The reverend 's comments come after Obama 's campaign continually has tried to put the issue of race to bed .
" We speak to two different audiences .
And he says what he has to say as a politician .
I say what I have to say as a pastor .
But they 're two different worlds , " said Wright , who has more interviews and appearances lined up .
In the interview Wright also complained about how the media only used sound bites to convey his thoughts .
It 's the constraint of television news and what the Obama campaign is worried about .
India ’s Olympic history has not been very bright or much heard of .
However , with Bindra bagging first - ever individual gold in Bejing has sparked lot of celebrations and hopes .
India had only won four individual medals , none of them gold , since sending their first team to the Summer Games in 1928 .
“ For me life will go on .
All my life I have just been punching holes in a blank piece of paper target .
Day after Bindra ponders , “ They have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning Gold is .
I realize that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise .
Honestly enough it really has not changed me , I am still the same Abhinav who just a day ago was hanging around alone in my room in the Olympic village .
Frankly , all the attention is a bit overwhelming .
I am not much good at making loud public pronouncements .
That in no way means that this is not the most intense experience of my life …
… For more than a decade now my life has been all about my sport .
In fact , I do not have a life beyond the confines of the 10 m range .
I have had a range built in my own home to cut down any possibility of distraction and to be able to practice my sport whenever the fancy strikes me .
It all did pay off , did n’t it ?
It has all still not sunk in .
I will post more once the feeling settles …
… I ran away from all the media and official attention yesterday after I had done the bit I had do in keeping with my new - found status .
Instead I chose to go to a quiet dinner with some friends .
India first participated in Olympics in 1900 .
It has to its credit 18 medals of which 8 are in hockey and the last was won in 1980 .
Olympics never seemed to be a priority in India .
The previous best was trap shooter Rajyavardhan Rathore ’s silver at Athens four years ago , while there were bronze medals for wrestler Khasaba Jadhav ( 1952 ) , tennis star Leander Paes ( 1996 ) and woman weightlifter Karnam Malleswari ( 2000 ) .
I ask the Indian people to support our athletes more .
It is fine to celebrate our achievements but it is just as important to keep up the backing when we are not on top of our game .
It is important for India to do better at Olympic sport as these are the true measure of a nation ’s sporting depth .
I wish more private initiatives come up with corporate support apart from the backing of the government .
The joy that the nation feels at my win is humbling .
I just wish that this is repeated more and more often …
… With our depth of talent and expanse of people I firmly believe India can be a world - class sporting power .
What we need are precise systems .

Kakuda , japan —
In a recent spin -off of the classic Japanese animated series Mobile Suit Gundam , the depletion of fossil fuels has forced humanity to turn to space - based solar power generation as global conflicts rage over energy shortages .
The sci - fi saga is set in the year 2307 , but even now real Japanese scientists are working on the hardware needed to realize orbital generators as a form of clean , renewable energy , with plans to complete a prototype in about 20 years .
The concept of solar panels beaming down energy from space has long been pondered — and long been dismissed as too costly and impractical .
But in Japan the seemingly far - fetched scheme has received renewed attention amid the current global energy crisis and concerns about the environment .
Last year researchers at the Institute for Laser Technology in Osaka produced up to 180 watts of laser power from sunlight .
In February scientists in Hokkaido began ground tests of a power transmission system designed to send energy in microwave form to Earth .
The laser and microwave research projects are two halves of a bold plan for a space solar power system ( SSPS ) under the aegis of Japan ’s space agency , the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
Specifically , by 2030 the agency aims to put into geostationary orbit a solar - power generator that will transmit one gigawatt of energy to Earth , equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant .
The energy would be sent to the surface in microwave or laser form , where it would be converted into electricity for commercial power grids or stored in the form of hydrogen .
“ We ’re doing this research for commonsense reasons — as a potential solution to the challenges posed by the exhaustion of fossil fuels and global warming , ” says Hiroaki Suzuki of JAXA ’s Advanced Mission Research Center , one of about 180 scientists at major Japanese research institutes working on the scheme .
JAXA says its potential advantages are straightforward : in space , solar irradiance is five to 10 times as strong as on the ground , so generation is more efficient ; solar energy could be collected 24 hours a day ; and weather would not pose a problem .
The system would also be clean , generating no pollution or waste , and safe .
The intensity of energy reaching Earth ’s surface might be about five kilowatts per square meter — about five times that of the sun at noon on a clear summer day at midlatitudes .
Although the scientists say this amount will not harm the human body , the receiving area would nonetheless be cordoned off and situated at sea .
At a facility in Miyagi , Suzuki and JAXA researchers are testing an 800 - watt optical - fiber laser that fires at a receiving station 500 meters away .
A mirror reflecting only 1,064 - nanometer - wavelength light directs it into an experimental solar panel .
( He chose that frequency of light because it easily cuts through Earth ’s atmosphere , losing no more than 10 percent of its pop . )
A key task will be finding a material that can convert sunlight into laser light efficiently .
A leading candidate is an yttrium - aluminum - garnet ceramic material containing neodymium and chromium .
The basic science is only part of the challenge .
Testing both the microwave and laser systems will require gargantuan structures in space : thin - film condenser mirrors , solar panels and a microwave transmitter stretching for kilometers and weighing 10,000 metric tons , as well as a 100 - unit laser array of 5,000 metric tons that would be 10 kilometers long .
The ground - based microwave antenna would have to be two kilometers long .
The total project cost would be enormous — perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars — but Suzuki and his colleagues say they are not considering the price tag .
“ We ca n’t know whether this is feasible or not if we do n’t have the basic technology first , ” he says .
“ We ’re aiming to produce stable , cheap power and hydrogen at a target price of 6.5 cents per kilowatt - hour . ”
That would be in line with conventional power generation costs of today and might make it more economically attractive .
Given current technology , transporting large - scale structures into space may be feasible only through the cooperation of space agencies on different continents .
Suzuki , though , says countries in the space race are trying to develop their technologies independently while the potential militarization of space grows .
“ If JAXA , NASA and the European Space Agency can work together , it would be best , ” he adds .
It all sounds like the prelude to a sci - fi saga .
Note :
This story was originally published with the title , " Roping the Sun " .
A crowd has gathered in front of the Las Vegas Convention Center , where a security guard is about to unlock the main entrance .
It 's less than a minute before 9 am , the official opening of the 2008 National Association of Broadcasters Show — typically a sleepy sales and marketing event known more for schmoozing than buzz .
But as the glass doors open on this April morning , a hundred people race toward a large crimson tent in the center of the hall .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The tent is home to Red Digital Cinema and its revolutionary motion picture camera , the Red One .
Standing nearby is the man who developed it — a handsome guy with a neatly trimmed goatee and a pair of sunglasses perched atop his clean - shaven head .
He clutches a can of Diet Coke in his left hand , an unlit Montecristo jutting from between his fingers .
Jim Jannard , 59 , is the billionaire founder of Red .
In 1975 he spent $ 300 to make a batch of custom motocross handlebar grips , which he sold from the back of a van .
He named his company Oakley , after his English setter , and eventually expanded into sci- fi - style sunglasses , bags , and shoes .
In November of last year he sold the business to Luxottica , the owner of Ray - Ban , for a reported $ 2.1 billion .
Jannard wo n't say how much money he has poured into Red , but his target market clearly appreciates the investment .
Supplicants swarm the tent , many of them with offerings — fine wine , gourmet coffee , single - malt whiskey — all to thank Jannard for building the Red One .
" I guess they just like me , " he says with a wry smile .

It 's more than that :
His team of engineers and scientists have created the first digital movie camera that matches the detail and richness of analog film .
The Red One records motion in a whopping 4,096 lines of horizontal resolution — " 4K " in filmmaker lingo — and 2,304 of vertical .
For comparison , hi - def digital movies like Sin City and the Star Wars prequels top out at 1,920 by 1,080 , just like your HDTV .
( There 's also a slightly higher - resolution option called 2 K that reaches 2,048 lines by 1,080 . )
Film does n't have pixels , but the industry - standard 35 - millimeter stock has a visual resolution roughly equivalent to 4 K .
And that 's what makes the Red so exciting :
It delivers all the dazzle of analog , but it 's easier to use and cheaper — by orders of magnitude — than a film camera .
In other words , Jannard 's creation threatens to make 35 - mm movie film obsolete .
Two years ago , Jannard brought a spec sheet and a mock - up of a camera — not much more than an aluminum box about the size of a loaf of bread — to NAB 2006 .
Even though it was n't a working product , more than 500 people plunked down a $ 1,000 deposit to get their names on a waiting list .
For months , industry watchers wondered if the company was for real .
Today , there 's no question .
The Red One is being used on at least 40 features .
Steven Soderbergh , the Oscar - winning director , borrowed two prototypes to shoot his Che Guevara biopics , which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May , and later purchased three for his film The Informant .
Peter Jackson , the Lord of the Rings himself , bought four .
Director Doug Liman used a Red on Jumper .
Peter Hyams used one on his upcoming Beyond a Reasonable Doubt .
Digital cinema that 's all but indistinguishable from film is finally coming to a theater near you .
The Red headquarters is in Lake Forest , California , a sprawling Orange County exurb consisting mainly of strip malls and office parks .
The 32,000 - square - foot facility , which Jannard recently bought for a reported $ 7.7 million , has a stark white exterior unbroken by windows except at the entrance , where a winged human skull is painted on the glass .
Jannard , wearing blue jeans , black slip - on sandals , and a lime - green short - sleeve shirt , greets me in the lobby and ushers me through a set of gray metal doors .
On the way into the workspace , there is a sign :

Since I 'm getting a tour from the wizard himself , I 'm apparently excused from genuflecting .
Behind the doors , the walls are festooned with camouflage netting — a nod , perhaps , to the postapocalyptic design of the steel - clad Oakley headquarters half a mile away .
" I had been thinking about this project for a long time , " Jannard says .
" As a camera fanatic and a product builder , this was something I seemed destined to do . "
When businesspeople talk destiny , it can sound like bullshit .
But at Oakley , Jannard not only ran the company , he personally shot one of its two TV spots and all of its print ads from 1975 to 1995 .
He owns more than 1,000 cameras , both still and motion picture , several dating back almost a century .
" I have a Bolex , Aaton , Arriflex , Eyemo , Filmo , Mitchell , Photosonic , Beaulieu , Keystone — just about every movie camera you can think of . "
Why The Red Rocks , Part I The Red One camera gives moviemakers the best of both worlds .
It delivers the ease of use and editing flexibility provided by digital cinema cameras .
At the same time , the Red 's resolution and color fidelity rival that of 35 - millimeter film , and it allows the same kind of control over focus .
Bonus : Like HD and 2 K digital , it 's cheap .

When he found he could n't use the files it produced without translation software from a company called Lumiere , he telephoned Lumiere 's owner , filmmaker Frederic Haubrich .
" I told Frederic that I could n't even view my footage on a Mac and that this had pissed me off enough that I wanted to build my own camera .
And he said , ' Jim , I know guys in the industry who can help . ' "
Haubrich introduced Jannard to interface designer Ted Schilowitz .
Schilowitz , Haubrich , and Jannard spent a year trying to design that dream camera , one that would combine the practical advantages of digital moviemaking with the image quality of analog film .
They recruited mathematicians , programmers , digital imaging experts , hardware engineers , and physicists .
" We needed a bunch of guys who were inventors to come up with entirely new ways of getting to the finish line , " Jannard says .
He kept the project quiet until his team could determine whether building the device was even feasible , but rumors swirled through Hollywood about some kind of mysterious supercamera in the works .
" I did n't know who Jim was , " Soderbergh says .
" But I heard about Red because they were canvassing filmmakers and cinematographers , asking , ' If you could wave a magic wand , what camera would you design ? ' "
Most of the work took place in what employees call Jim 's garage , a 20,000 - square - foot warehouse across the street from Red 's massive headquarters .
The team quickly concluded that existing technology was inadequate .
The guts of the camera — the image sensor and all the accompanying circuitry — would have to be created from scratch .
It was a daunting challenge , but the fact that Jannard 's management style falls somewhere between Mr. T and Steve Jobs on the autocracy scale helped .
" What separates us from other camera companies is that the vision guy is the decisionmaker , " he says .
" That was one of my biggest advantages at Oakley , and it's the same at Red — I'm in the trenches , in the product development , and I make the final call .
Red is a benevolent dictatorship . "
The video revolution has been on pause in Hollywood .
Just as digital still cameras now rule the photography market , hi-def digital movie cameras were supposed to replace film .
But moviemakers never fully bought in .
Typical digital videocams use prisms to split incoming light by color and send it to three separate sensors , which tends to soften images .
Onboard software sharpens the footage but also introduces halos and exaggerated edges .
Worse , the small sensors put too much of the picture in focus , giving it a canned look .
Cinematographers hate that ; the ability to guide the viewer 's eye by selectively blurring focal planes is one of their favorite techniques .
" That 's a storytelling tool , " says Pierre de Lespinois , a producer and director who spent three weeks in April filming a feature in the Mojave Desert with two Red Ones .
" In HD , what 's right in front of the lens and what 's 20 feet away are both sharp , so the image looks flat . "
To compete with celluloid , a digital cine - camera would need an image sensor identical in size and shape to a single frame of 35 - mm motion picture film .
Without that , the Red could n't give filmmakers the control over depth of field , color saturation , tonality , and a half dozen other factors that 35 - mm film provides .

But they 're designed to shoot no more than 10 frames per second .
That 's warp speed for still photographers but barely first gear for filmmakers .
Movies are shot at a minimum of 24 frames per second , with some scenes topping out at 120 fps for slow - motion effects .
The Red 's sensor would have to do everything a DSLR sensor does — and do it significantly faster .
The camera also had to be able to record in the same bulky file format that DSLRs use — called raw .
The format preserves picture data in essentially unprocessed form , which gives photographers more latitude to tweak images with software the way they once did in a darkroom .
( Cinematographers do the same thing with 35 - mm film , but it 's a complicated , expensive process :
The film must be scanned into digital to be manipulated , then converted back to analog for projection . )
Since a movie is just a long sequence of still pictures , using the raw format presented bandwidth and data - storage problems .
A two - hour feature could run up to 7 terabytes .
The Red engineers built a workaround , a lossless compression codec they call Redcode Raw .
Finally , in August 2006 , Jannard 's team flipped the switch on Red 's first prototype , codenamed Frankie .
It was n't really a camera at all , just a mechanical test bed containing the new sensor .
" Our whole business was predicated on this sensor , " Jannard says .
" If it did n't work , we 'd be cooked .
When it did , it was like giving birth and counting all the fingers and toes to make sure everything was there .
It was phenomenal .
Everybody went nuts . "
Schilowitz remembers that moment , which camera makers call first light , as mind - blowing : " Everyone started screaming like little kids , ' First light !
First light !
It 's alive ! '
The thing actually worked . "
Two weeks later , at an industry event in Amsterdam , Jannard showed test footage taken with Frankie — a clip of two perky women in '50s garb chugging milk from glass bottles — on a 60 - foot screen .
" People were stunned , " Schilowitz says .
" They were standing around scratching their heads .
That moment made a lot of people into believers . "
Filmmakers did n't care how the Red One worked , but they liked what they saw .
" The Red camera is the closest thing to film I 've seen , " says Tristan Whitman , a cinematography lecturer at USC .
The Analog Advantage Typical 2 K and HD digital movie cameras keep everything in focus .
The 4K Red One is more like an analog camera , allowing depth of field control , which blurs the foreground or background .
By March 2007 , Red had assembled two additional prototypes , named Boris and Natasha .
But now , with three weeks to go before NAB 2007 , Jannard wanted new footage to show what the camera could do .
He emailed Jackson , asking if the director could recommend a good cinematographer in Los Angeles to help create a Red promo spot .
Not long after , Jackson telephoned .
" Jim , why do n't you fly down here to New Zealand , and I 'll shoot the footage for you , " he said .
" Do n't tease me , " Jannard replied .
" No , I 'm serious , " Jackson said .
" Bring the cameras down . "
Jannard packed up Boris and Natasha , still crude machines with no features other than a run / stop button and a shutter , and headed south .
When he got to Wellington , Jackson was ready .
" Peter had put together an army , " Jannard says .
" He was going to shoot a mini-movie to put the cameras through their paces , using them on helicopters and Steadicams , crawling on the ground with them — and I 'm thinking , ' Oh my gosh , I just hope they keep working through the weekend . ' "
Boris and Natasha performed flawlessly .
" We stayed at Peter 's house , and he was just beaming because he was having so much fun . "
Jackson delivered his 12 - minute featurette , titled Crossing the Line , the night before the NAB Show opened .
Jannard shows me the film at Red headquarters .
His desk is in an open workspace that he shares with six staffers and his puppy .
Next to his computer there 's a box of the Montecristos he favors and a pinewood crate from Napa Valley Reserve , the world 's most exclusive wine club .
Members reportedly pay up to $ 145,000 to join , in exchange for which they can partake in grape harvests and create their own blends .
There 's something oddly honorable about a billionaire with insanely expensive taste in wine but no office .
I watch Crossing the Line on Jannard 's 30 - inch HD display while he stands behind me .
The film , set on the front lines of World War I , alternates between aerial dogfights and bloody ground combat .
The screen resolution is about half what it would be in a theater .
Nevertheless , it 's like looking through a window onto a battlefield .
I can barely discern a single pixel .
The detail is stupefying ; the colors are rich and sensual .
After NAB 2007 , Jannard showed Crossing the Line at the Directors Guild in LA .
" I rearranged my travel plans to be there , " Soderbergh says .
After he saw the film , he called Jannard .
" Jim , I 'm all in .
I have to shoot with this . "
" OK , great , " Jannard said .
" But what does that mean ? "
" I 'm making two movies with Benicio del Toro .
Come to my house , and we 'll do a test .
If it looks as good as what I saw in Peter 's film , I want these cameras for my movies . "
Soderbergh took two prototypes into the Spanish wilderness .
" It felt like someone crawled inside my head when they designed the Red , " he says .
What impressed him most was the cameras ' sturdiness .
Movie sets are often a flurry of crashes and explosions , which can vibrate sensitive electronics , introducing visual noise known as microphonics into images .
" A lot of cameras with electronics in them , if you fired a 50 - caliber automatic weapon a few inches away — which we did — you'd get microphonics all over the place , " Soderbergh says .
" We beat the shit out of the Reds on the Che films , and they never skipped a beat . "
Then there 's the economics :
The Red One sells for $ 17,500 — almost 90 percent less than its nearest HD competitor .
The savings are even greater relative to a conventional film camera .
Not that anyone buys those ; filmmakers rent them , usually from Panavision , an industry stalwart in Woodland Hills , California .
Panavision does n't publicize its rates , but a Panavision New Zealand rental catalog quotes $ 25,296 for a four - week shoot — more than the cost of purchasing a Red .
" It 's clearly the future of cinematography , " Peter Hyams says .
" You can buy this camera .
You can own it .
That 's why people are excited . "
Even so , traditionalists cling to film 's reliability .
Film is tangible .
Hard drives crash ; files get corrupted .
" You put film in a can and stick it on a shelf , and it costs $ 1,000 a year to store , " says Stephen Lighthill , who teaches cinematography at the American Film Institute .
" With a project that starts as data , you have it on a hard drive , which has to be nursed and upgraded .
It 's an electronic , mechanical device that can't be left unplugged . "
Preserving a 4 K digital master of a feature film would cost $ 12,000 a year , according to a report by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .
And that does n't address the reliability of the camera itself .
" In the slammin ' , jammin ' world of production , you want a really tough machine that takes very simple approaches to problems , " Lighthill says .
" I 'm not sure Red is the way to go .
It 's a supercomputer with a lens on it . "
Proponents dismiss such criticism as Luddite drivel .
" Hollywood is just used to shooting on film , " says Bengt Jan Jönsson , cinematographer on the Fox TV show Bones .
" Honestly , if you proposed the film work - flow today , you 'd be taken to the city square and hung .
Imagine I told you we 're going to shoot on superexpensive cameras , using rolls of celluloid made in China that are a one - time - use product susceptible to scratches and that can't be exposed to light .
And you can't even be sure you got the image until they 're developed .
And you have to dip them in a special fluid that can ruin them if it 's mixed wrong .
People would think I was crazy . "
As Reds infiltrate Hollywood , the typical filmgoer might not notice much difference at first .
After all , once they 're projected onto a cineplex screen , movies shot with Jannard 's camera will look like the analog movies audiences are used to .
But the camera 's ease of use and lower cost are sure to change the industry .
" There 's talent on the streets , kids with ideas who have stories to tell and never get a chance , " Jannard says .
" Up to now , they 've been limited to tools that confine their stories to YouTube . "
Access to this kind of tech will make it easier for aspiring auteurs to break in and could ultimately expand the range and variety of films that get made .
Of course , most theaters still show movies the old - fashioned way , running analog film in front of a bright light .
For now , pictures shot with the Red must be transferred to celluloid for distribution .
It 's a cumbersome system : A full - length feature might take as many as five ( heavy , expensive to print ) reels .
A major release goes to at least 3,500 theaters .
Plus , the celluloid stock gets damaged and dirty and has to be sent in for cleaning and repair after every few dozen screenings .
Luckily , analog projection seems to be on the way out .
In March , four big Hollywood studios announced plans to retrofit 10,000 screens — about a quarter of the US total — for digital projection at 2 K .
Movies shot with Red 's 4 K camera will look every bit as good as those shot on film , and they 'll all be ads for the company 's next camera , the Epic , with more than 5,000 lines of resolution .
That 's a knockout pixel punch .
I ask Jannard if Red plans to develop a 4 K projector or perhaps even a 5 K that it would market to theater owners .
He 's cagey .
" I will say that the future of motion - capture will be digital , " he says , " and I think you can extend that to say the future of presentation will be digital . "
Jannard is doing his best to fulfill that prophecy .
He spends nights on the company 's Internet user forums sifting through customer feedback , answering technical questions , and addressing rumors about upcoming products .
" I 'm passionate about this because I 'm building the camera I 've always wanted to shoot with , " he says .
" When my grandkids and great - grandkids look back , they 're going to say I was a camera builder .
I did handgrips and then goggles and then sunglasses to prepare myself .
But cameras are magic . "
In A Question of Torture , historian Alfred W. McCoy tracks the nightmarish world of the CIA ’s Project ARTICHOKE and its later metastasis , MKULTRA through two distinct , though overlapping phases :
First , esoteric , often bizarre experiments with hypnosis and hallucinogenic drugs , from 1950 to 1956 ; then , more conventional research into human psychology until 1963 when the agency compiled the fruits of this costly investigation in a definitive interrogation manual .
As revelations emerge that top Bush administration officials gave the intelligence “ community ” and Pentagon a “ green light ” to torture , evidence mounts that CIA and Special Operations Command interrogators used mind - altering drugs on prisoners subjected to coercive interrogations .
According to a report published in Tuesday ’s Washington Post ,
At least two dozen … former and current detainees at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere say they were given drugs against their will or witnessed other inmates being drugged , based on interviews and court documents .
Like [ Adel al - ]
Nusairi , other detainees believed the injections were intended to coerce confessions .
The Pentagon and the CIA deny the charges , claiming that the stories are “ either fabrications or mistaken interpretations of routine medical treatment , ” Warrick reports .
However , the allegations have returned with a vengeance after this month ’s release of a Justice Department memo that explicitly approved the use of drugs on prisoners .
The March 2003 memo , penned by Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo , rejected a decades - old ban on the use of “ mind - altering substances , ” on prisoners .
Yoo argued that drugs could be used provided they did not inflict permanent and “ profound ” psychological damage .
The memo claims that U.S. law , as interpreted by Bushist torture enablers , “ does not preclude any and all use of drugs . ”
When coupled with “ reverse - engineered ” interrogation techniques derived from the military ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape ( SERE ) program , the forced drugging of detainees at Guantánamo Bay ’s Camp Delta detention facility and CIA “ black sites , ” all but guarantee a regime of “ profound ” psychological torture .
In a report published earlier this month , Congressional Quarterly ‘s Jeff Stein reports ,
‘ The new Yoo memo , along with other White House legal memoranda , shows clearly that the policy foundation for the use of interrogational drugs was being laid , ’ says Stephen Miles , a University of Minnesota bioethicist and author of ‘ Oath Betrayed : Torture , Medical Complicity , and the War on Terror . ’
‘ The recent memo on mood - altering drugs does not extend previous work on this area , ’ he said .
‘ The use of these drugs was anticipated and discussed in the memos of January and February 2002 by DoD , DoJ , and White House counsel using the same language and rationale .
The executive branch memos laid a comprehensive and reiterated policy foundation for the use of interrogational drugs . ’
With a “ green light ” from the administration , Guantánamo Bay torturers ’ got what they wanted from Adel al - Nusairi : a forced “ confession . ”
A former Saudi policeman captured in 2002 by U.S. forces in Afghanistan , el - Nusairi told his attorney during an interview at America ’s premier gulag , that after hours of interrogation , always preceded by an injection of an unknown drug , his interrogators would rouse him from a fitful sleep–for more questions .
“ I was completely gone , ” he remembered .
“ I said , ‘ Let me go .
I want to go to sleep .
If it takes saying I ’m a member of al - Qaeda , I will , ” according to the Washington Post .
As documented by investigative reporter Stephen Grey in Ghost Plane , prisoners destined for CIA “ black sites ” or other notorious dungeons in Central Asia or the Middle East , were administered sedatives by “ rendition teams ” to “ calm ” their shackled and hooded victims .
These new reports suggest that upon arrival , suspected “ terrorists ” –real or imaginary –have been drugged as an integral element of their “ enhanced interrogation ” experience .
French national Mourad Benchellali , a Guantánamo prisoner for three years related how after being administered “ medicine ” or “ vitamins ” by his captors said that “ these medicines gave us headaches , nausea , drowsiness , ” Benchellali wrote in an e-mail to the Washington Post .
“ But the effects were different for different detainees .
Some fainted or threw up .
Some had reactions such as pimples . ”
But then there were periods when things were demonstrably worse .
Benchellali described that periodic injections , “ often administered by force , ” left him by degrees , feeling nauseated and light - headed .
“ We were always tired and always felt groggy . ”
Benchellali related to Warrick how “ a different type of injection seemed to be reserved for detainees who were particularly uncooperative . ”
The former prisoner described episodes also related by four other detainees in interviews or court documents , of a particularly chilling quality .
“ The injection would make them crazy .
They would have a crisis or dementia — yelling , no longer sleeping , soiling themselves .
Some of us suspected they were given LSD . ”
As did the attorney representing accused “ dirty bomber ” Jose Padilla during his three year stint as an “ enemy combatant ” in a naval brig .
Michael Caruso , the chief federal defender who represented Padilla asserted in a motion last year that his client “ was given drugs against his will , believed to be some form of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) or phencyclidine ( PCP ) , to act as a sort of truth serum during his interrogations , ” according to Congressional Quarterly ‘s Jeff Stein .
Nor would it be the first time the U.S. government used drugs as a means to induce a “ confession ” from a “ resistant subject . ”
The CIA ’s KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual , has this to say :
Drugs can be effective in overcoming resistance not dissolved by other techniques .
As has already been noted , the so - called silent drug ( a pharmacologically potent substance given to a person unaware of its administration ) can make possible the induction of hypnotic trance in a previously unwilling subject .
…
Particularly important is the reference to matching the drug to the personality of the interrogatee .
The effect of most drugs depends more upon the personality of the subject than upon the physical characteristics of the drugs themselves .
If the approval of Headquarters has been obtained and if a doctor is at hand for administration , one of the most important of the interrogator ’s functions is providing the doctor with a full and accurate description of the psychological make - up of the interrogatee , to facilitate the best possible choice of a drug .
Persons burdened with feelings of shame or guilt are likely to unburden themselves when drugged , especially if these feelings have been reinforced by the interrogator .
And like the placebo , the drug provides an excellent rationalization of helplessness for the interrogatee who wants to yield but has hitherto been unable to violate his own values or loyalties .
Like other coercive media , drugs may affect the content of what an interrogatee divulges .
Gottschalk notes that certain drugs “ may give rise to psychotic manifestations such as hallucinations , illusions , delusions , or disorientation ” , so that “ the verbal material obtained cannot always be considered valid . ”
For this reason drugs ( and the other aids discussed in this section ) should not be used persistently to facilitate the interrogative debriefing that follows capitulation .
Their function is to cause capitulation , to aid in the shift from resistance to cooperation .
Once this shift has been accomplished , coercive techniques should be abandoned both for moral reasons and because they are unnecessary and even counter - productive .
[ emphasis added ]
Note the emphasis above : if a doctor is at hand for administration .
Which inevitably gives rise to the question : were physicians or other health care professionals present during torture sessions ?
The answer unfortunately , may be “ yes . ”
According to psychoanalyst Stephen Soldz , a fierce critic of the American Psychological Association ’s ( APA ) cozy relationship with the CIA and Pentagon throughout Washington ’s “ war on terror , ” some APA members advised interrogators on the most “ effective ” techniques to psychologically “ break ” detainees .
Soldz writes ,
At this point it is unknown if psychologists are involved as among those “ health ” professionals who involuntarily administered drugs .
But we should remember that , thanks partly to military support , a number of psychologists can now legally prescribe drugs .
And some of those prescribing psychologists were with the Behavioral Science Consultation Teams [ BSCTs ] at Guantánamo .
It also should be remembered that in 2003 the American Psychological Association co-sponsored with the CIA an invitation - only Science of Deception Workshop that discussed , among other topics , “ What pharmacological agents are known to affect apparent truth - telling behavior ? ” CIA consultant torturers James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen were among those invited to attend , as were several of their superiors .
As Washington ’s “ bad apples ” –wide swathes of the national security apparatus – “ took the gloves off ” and went to “ work the dark side ” as vice president Dick Cheney recommended shortly after the September 11 attacks , those with “ boots on the ground , ” CIA officers , Special Forces operators and mercenary contractors , inevitably complied .
Just as inevitably , new documents –and ever - more revelatory horrors –will emerge , a steady drip , drip , drip from the suppurating wound that is the “ post - Constitutional ” order created by the rogue Bush regime .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British suspect in the disappearance of 3 - year - old Madeleine McCann in Portugal last year won 600,000 pounds ( $ 1.2 million ) in libel damages on Thursday for “ the utter destruction ” of his life .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
The 10 British newspapers involved in the case had accused Robert Murat , who lived in the resort where McCann vanished last May , of being involved in the girl ’s disappearance .
Portuguese police questioned Murat soon after the British girl went missing from her parents ’ holiday apartment in the southern resort of Praia da Luz and later declared him a formal suspect , but he was never charged and denied any involvement .
“ The newspapers in this case brought about the total and utter destruction of mine and my family ’s life and caused immense distress , ” Murat said outside London ’s High Court .
“ I am pleased that the publications concerned admitted the falsity of their allegations and I can now start to rebuild my life . ”
Murat spoke to reporters frequently in the days after Madeleine disappeared from her bedroom , and said she looked like his daughter in England .
His mother ’s house was about 150 meters from the McCann family ’s apartment .
Murat ’s lawyer said tabloid newspapers in Britain published a series of “ made - up ” allegations .
The court heard these included claims that Murat had an interest in child pornography and might have been part of a pedophile ring involved in McCann ’s abduction .
Publishers of the newspapers , with a combined circulation of 15 million copies , apologized , admitted the claims were untrue and agreed to pay the damages .
Murat ’s lawyer , Louis Charalambous , said his client had watched silently as “ the worst elements of the British media ” destroyed his good name and reputation .
“ The behavior of tabloid journalists and their editors has been grossly irresponsible , demonstrating a reckless disregard for truth , ” he said .
It is the second time British papers have been sued over their coverage of the McCann case .
In March Gerry and Kate McCann , who led a high - profile global hunt for their daughter , won 550,000 pounds in damages from the Daily Express and Daily Star over stories suggesting they might have killed Madeleine .
The papers then issued front - page apologies for the “ baseless ” reports and donated the damages to a fund set up to find the missing girl .
Despite the worldwide hunt , McCann has not been found and no one has been charged in connection with her disappearance .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , under fire for apparently discounting the impact of climate change , on Thursday said global warming poses real risk to human health and the American way of life .

Risks include more heat - related deaths , more heart and lung diseases due to increased ozone and health problems related to hurricanes , extreme precipitation and wildfires , the agency said in a new report .
“ Climate change poses real risk to human health and the human systems that support our way of life in the United States , ” the agency ’s Joel Scheraga said in a telephone briefing .
The report does not specify how many people in the United States could die due to climate change , because that number can be changed by taking action , Scheraga said .
“ We are not saying in this report that more people will die in the future due to climate change , ” he said .
“ What we are saying is that there ’s an increased risk of deaths due to heat waves in the future as the climate changes .
“ We have an opportunity to anticipate these increased risks ... and to due to prepare for the future in order to mitigate these risks . ”
Limited to climate change impacts in the United States , the report found a likely increase in food and water - borne germs as the world warms and habitat ranges expand for some disease - causing organisms .
Also , the inequities now found in the U.S. health care system are likely to be exacerbated by global warming : “ Many of the expected health effects are likely to fall disproportionately on the poor , the elderly , the disabled and the uninsured . ”
Global warming is expected to affect water supplies across the country , with reduced water flow in rivers , lower groundwater levels and more salt creeping into coastal rivers and groundwater , the report said .
People who live along the coasts will face the consequences of rising sea levels and severe weather events while city dwellers can expect higher energy demand to cool buildings -- though the demand for heat will probably decline .
The report covers much of the same substance as an EPA document released on Monday that found global warming endangers human health .
This document was part of the agency ’s response to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that found the EPA had the power to regulate climate - warming greenhouse gas emissions if it was found that they hurt human health .
However , the agency has indicated no action is likely before the Bush administration leaves office next January .
Stephen Johnson , head of the environmental agency , has been called to testify on July 30 before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on alleged White House interference with the agency .
Researchers have repeatedly complained of White House censorship of environmental science .
A quarter of a century after the outbreak of Aids , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has accepted that the threat of a global heterosexual pandemic has disappeared .
In the first official admission that the universal prevention strategy promoted by the major Aids organisations may have been misdirected , Kevin de Cock , the head of the WHO 's department of HIV / Aids said there will be no generalised epidemic of Aids in the heterosexual population outside Africa .
Dr De Cock , an epidemiologist who has spent much of his career leading the battle against the disease , said understanding of the threat posed by the virus had changed .
Whereas once it was seen as a risk to populations everywhere , it was now recognised that , outside sub -Saharan Africa , it was confined to high - risk groups including men who have sex with men , injecting drug users , and sex workers and their clients .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dr De Cock said : " It is very unlikely there will be a heterosexual epidemic in other countries .
Ten years ago a lot of people were saying there would be a generalised epidemic in Asia – China was the big worry with its huge population .
That does n't look likely .
But we have to be careful .
As an epidemiologist it is better to describe what we can measure .
There could be small outbreaks in some areas . "
In 2006 , the Global Fund for HIV , Malaria and Tuberculosis , which provides 20 per cent of all funding for Aids , warned that Russia was on the cusp of a catastrophe .
An estimated 1 per cent of the population was infected , mainly through injecting drug use , the same level of infection as in South Africa in 1991 where the prevalence of the infection has since risen to 25 per cent .
Dr De Cock said : " I think it is unlikely there will be extensive heterosexual spread in Russia .
But clearly there will be some spread . "
Aids still kills more adults than all wars and conflicts combined , and is vastly bigger than current efforts to address it .
A joint WHO / UN Aids report published this month showed that nearly three million people are now receiving anti-retroviral drugs in the developing world , but this is less than a third of the estimated 9.7 million people who need them .
In all there were 33 million people living with HIV in 2007 , 2.5 million people became newly infected and 2.1 million died of Aids .
Aids organisations , including the WHO , UN Aids and the Global Fund , have come under attack for inflating estimates of the number of people infected , diverting funds from other health needs such as malaria , spending it on the wrong measures such as abstinence programmes rather than condoms , and failing to build up health systems .
Dr De Cock labelled these the " four malignant arguments " undermining support for the global campaign against Aids , which still faced formidable challenges , despite the receding threat of a generalised epidemic beyond Africa .
Any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected HIV as the cause of the disease , or who used the disease as a weapon to stigmatise high risk groups , he said .
" Aids still remains the leading infectious disease challenge in public health .
It is an acute infection but a chronic disease .
It is for the very , very long haul .
People are backing off , saying it is taking care of itself .
It is not . "
Critics of the global Aids strategy complain that vast sums are being spent educating people about the disease who are not at risk , when a far bigger impact could be achieved by targeting high - risk groups and focusing on interventions known to work , such as circumcision , which cuts the risk of infection by 60 per cent , and reducing the number of sexual partners .
There were " elements of truth " in the criticism , Dr De Cock said .
" You will not do much about Aids in London by spending the funds in schools .
You need to go where transmission is occurring .
It is true that countries have not always been good at that . "
But he rejected an argument put in The New York Times that only $ 30 m ( £ 15 m ) had been spent on safe water projects , far less than on Aids , despite knowledge of the risks that contaminated water pose .
" It sounds a good argument .
But where is the scandal ?
That less than a third of Aids patients are being treated – or that we have never resolved the safe water scandal ? "
One of the danger areas for the Aids strategy was among men who had sex with men .
He said : " We face a bit of a crisis [ in this area ] .
In the industrialised world transmission of HIV among men who have sex with men is not declining and in some places has increased .
" In the developing world , it has been neglected .
We have only recently started looking for it and when we look , we find it .
And when we examine HIV rates we find they are high .
" It is astonishing how badly we have done with men who have sex with men .
It is something that is going to have to be discussed much more rigorously . "
The biggest puzzle was what had caused heterosexual spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa – with infection rates exceeding 40 per cent of adults in Swaziland , the worst - affected country – but nowhere else .
" It is the question we are asked most often – why is the situation so bad in sub-Saharan Africa ?
It is a combination of factors – more commercial sex workers , more ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases , a young population and concurrent sexual partnerships . "
" Sexual behaviour is obviously important but it does n't seem to explain [ all ] the differences between populations .
Even if the total number of sexual partners [ in sub-Saharan Africa ] is no greater than in the UK , there seems to be a higher frequency of overlapping sexual partnerships creating sexual networks that , from an epidemiological point of view , are more efficient at spreading infection . "
Low rates of circumcision , which is protective , and high rates of genital herpes , which causes ulcers on the genitals through which the virus can enter the body , also contributed to Africa 's heterosexual epidemic .
But the factors driving HIV were still not fully understood , he said .
" The impact of HIV is so heterogeneous .
In the US , the rate of infection among men in Washington DC is well over 100 times higher than in North Dakota , the region with the lowest rate .
That is in one country .
How do you explain such differences ? "
Auchan , Carrefour , Casino , Conforama , Ikea , et Leroy Merlin ont signé mardi 1er juillet avec la Préfecture de Région , un protocole par lequel les entreprises s’engagent à développer le recours à la voie fluviale .
Les groupes de grande distribution s’engagent à promouvoir et privilégier l’utilisation de la voie d’eau , à oeuvrer pour la généralisation du standard permettant l’utilisation indifférente du rail , de la route et de la voie d’eau pour favoriser le porte à porte multimodal .
Les entreprises s’engagent aussi à réaliser pour toute nouvelle implantation des études comparatives , avec un objectif de privilégier la voie d’eau , tant à l’import que pour la distribution domestique .
Les entreprises s’engagent enfin à réfléchir ensemble à ce que pourraient être les schémas des flux à l’horizon de dix ans .
5850 camions en moins
Les engagements devraient aboutir au transfert annuel de 11 700 conteneurs EVP de la route vers le fleuve .
Cela représente le retrait de 5850 poids lourds , de 81 600 tonnes de marchandises , avec une réduction des émissions de 1 469 Tonnes d’équivalant CO2 , et une économie de 499 tonnes de pétrole .
Une négociation identique est envisagée avec les industriels .
La signature du protocole a été l’occasion de faire le point sur la position des entreprises par rapport à la voie d’eau .
Auchan a été avec Conforama remier client du fleuve lors du lancement de la ligne fluviale Fos-Lyon .
Depuis le lancement des lignes ferroviaires par River Shuttle Conteneur ( opérateur à conteneurs du bassin Saône Rhône méditerranée )
Auchan a aussi confié une partie de son trafic au mode ferroviaire utilisé en alternance avec le fleuve .
En 2007 / 2008 , Auchan confiait 65 % de son trafic au mode fluvial .
Pour organiser ses post acheminements maritimes , Carrefour a longtemps utilisé la route au détriment des lignes fluviales de River Shuttle Conteneur ou de Logirhône les deux opérateurs à conteneurs du bassin Saône Rhône Méditerranée .
Le lancement de la barge sous douane à l’import a convaincu la société de recourir au mode fluvial .
Cette organisation douanière est intéressante en terme de trésorerie : elle offre à l’enseigne la possibilité de ne pas avancer les règlements des droits et taxes durant le voyage et durant la période de stockage portuaire des conteneurs et apporte une réelle souplesse à la gestion des transport .
Transport sous douane facilité
De même Casino a été convaincu par le lancement de la barge sous douane à l’import qui a convaincu Carrefour de recourir au mode fluvial .
Aujourd ’hui seulement 15 à 20 % des conteneurs de l’enseigne sont mis sur la voie d’eau , l’objectif étant d’atteindre les 50 % .
C’est à la suite de la demande de Casino que la première étude « stocks flottants » a été lancée par l’Etat et VNF Lyon .
Casino a été un partenaire crucial de VNF en étant force de proposition tout au long de l’étude et en confiant une partie de son trafic a une expérimentation de transport fluvial de palettes entre Lyon et Arles / Fos.
Aujourd ’hui Casino participe au programme de recherche UTILE ( financement 5000 € + comité de pilotage ) dont l’objectif est d’offrir une solution alternative fluviale et ferroviaire au tout route actuel pour le transport continental européen ( en non continuité du transport maritime ) .
Conforama le premier
Conforama a été le premier client du fleuve lors du lancement de la ligne fluviale Fos-Lyon .
Conforama a également confié une partie de son trafic au mode ferroviaire qu’il utilise en alternance avec le fleuve .
Ikea pour sa part a utilisé à son lancement la ligne fluviale mais l ’a abandonnée rapidement en raison de la qualité de service était en période de test .
Depuis Ikea utilise très rarement le fluvial à l’import maritime vers son entrepôt de Saint Quentin Fallavier .
Le site de Saint Quentin Fallavier ne traitera plus à terme de conteneurs maritimes .
Les conteneurs d’importation auront pour destination finale le site de Fos / mer où ils seront dépotés puis reconditionnés pour être redistribués vers l’Europe du sud et la région Rhône Alpes par camions .
Ikea a néanmoins accepté de participer au programme de recherche UTILE ( financement 5000 € + comité de pilotage ) afin de mettre en oeuvre une solution alternative fluviale pour ces marchandises circulant à l’intérieur du territoire .
Faute d’entrepôt sur la région Rhône Alpes , Leroy Merlin n’utilise pas le transport fluvial pour ces flux d’importation .
Néanmoins Leroy Merlin prévoit de recourir au transport fluvial pour ses importations de conteneurs maritimes vers un de ses entrepôts situés en dehors de la région .

A PARAMEDIC was ordered to sit and watch for 13 minutes as a teenager stabbed in the neck bled to death in the street .
Mairi Lennon , 35 , begged to be allowed to respond to Stuart Baillie 's screams for help and is convinced she could have saved his life .
But she was told over her car radio to sit tight and wait for the police because she was on her own at the scene of a violent incident .
She could have been sacked if she had ignored the order but Mairi , who is haunted by the tragedy , is off work suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and receiving counselling .
A close colleague said : " She begged her bosses to get out of the car to help the poor boy but was told to stay put until the police arrived .
It was torture for her .
" Mairi had to sit across the road in a car and listen to the screams for help .
" It is like a bloody horror movie .
" She will never forget that boy 's face as he lay there dying before her . "
This horrific incident was highlighted after the Record revealed shock plans to replace ambulances with single - manned rapid - response cars to meet time targets .
Last night , Transport and General Workers ' Union convener John Gallacher hit out : " Mairi Lennon is a victim of the spreadsheet management .
" It has nothing to do with patient or staff safety .
" It is to do with ticking boxes and getting to the scene within that target time of eight minutes . "
Lone paramedics in rapid response cars are regularly forced to beat their target time to get to major incidents - then do nothing until back - up arrives .
Mairi , of Glasgow , refused to talk about the incident in Easterhouse last August , for fear of losing her job but fellow ambulance workers said other paramedics are regularly frustrated in similar life - or - death situations .
One source said : " These kind of incidents happen all the time - about one in three jobs .
" But this is a perfect example of why replacing ambulances with these vehicles to boost their response time and make the service look good will cost lives . "
The ambulance worker said 19 - year - old Stuart Baillie might have been saved in Netherhouse Place if it had not been for the policy and response targets .
The source continued : " If Mairi had been in an two - man ambulance , they would have been able to assess the situation and if there was any danger , they could have put the young man in the back of the vehicle and got out of there fast .
" But , because of cutbacks , mismanagement and policies , Mairi was not allowed near the scene .
She had all her equipment in the back of the car and she thinks there is a good chance the boy would still be alive today had she been allowed to do her job .
" Sadly , what happened to Mairi , is reflected in one in three jobs where paramedics are sent out on their own just to beat the clock but when they get there they can do nothing to help .
" There is an increasing number of highly trained staff going off with stress because they are being forced to sit and watch people die because they are banned from attending to the patient when they arrive at the scene .
Mairi 's torment over the incident left her sick and unable to do her job .
She went off sick with stress earlier this month , as the boy 's killer was jailed for 11 years at the High Court in Glasgow .
She had been dreading having to face Stuart 's family and friends , who could not understand why she had to sit in her car and not respond to their screams to help the dying boy that night .
She feared having to relive her ordeal by giving evidence at a murder trial .
But the trial did not go ahead after knifeman Ian Lowrie , also 19 , pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide .
After he stabbed Stuart , of Ballieston , to death , a taxi driver overheard him boasting that he had " plunged the b****** , I put it right through him " .
Mairi 's colleague said : " The thought of having to face the family brought back the full horror of the situation to Mairi and she went off with stress .
" She has been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress and is being treated for it .
" Mairi loves her job and has been a paramedic for 10 years .
" She had been working on the rapid response vehicles for 18 months when she was told to attend the stabbing .
" She was able to go to the boy 's aid when police and an ambulance arrived 13 minutes later but , by then , the boy was dead .
" When the people who were screaming for help saw her , they were very hostile towards her because they had seen her sitting in the car 150 yards away , doing nothing to help .
" Mairi is haunted every day by the whole horror of it all .
She suffers from flashbacks and the guilt is eating her up .
" She is convinced she could have saved that boy and the family would n't have suffered the trauma of it all .
She is struggling to come to terms with that .
Mairi was " extremely distressed " when she returned to the ambulance depot after the incident and asked her bosses for time off and counselling .
The source said : " She was forced back out on an emergency call on her own that night and told if she did n't go , she could be disciplined or sacked .
" She expressed concerns about returning to Easterhouse , for fear of repercussions but was told that was just tough and she would have to go where the calls came in . "
The Scottish Ambulance Service admitted that Mairi arrived first at the scene , within five minutes and 16 seconds , and was ordered to stay in her car until the police arrived .
They confirmed she was told not to get out of her vehicle for her own safety because it was a violent incident .
A spokesman said : " Because of the circumstances - a very violent knife attack - they were advised to wait at the end of the street for police support in the interests of their safety .
" The safety of our staff is paramount and , at times , we have to make difficult decisions to protect them . "
WASHINGTON  Security in Iraq continues to improve even after the withdrawal of nearly 25 % of U.S. combat brigades , increasing the prospects of further cuts in American forces .
Although U.S. commanders are cautious about predicting further withdrawals , interviews with military experts and recent official statements indicate growing optimism about the potential to pull out more forces .
" I believe the momentum we have is not reversible , " said Jack Keane , a retired Army vice chief of staff who helped develop the Iraq strategy adopted by President Bush in January 2007 .
There will be " significant reductions in 2009 whoever becomes president , " said Keane , who regularly consults with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki echoed Keane 's optimism Saturday by declaring that " we defeated " the terrorists in Iraq .
U.S. commanders remain cautious .
Army Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin , the No. 2 commander in Iraq , said recently that " our progress is fragile , and we continue to work to make this progress irreversible . "
Such encouraging reports could benefit both presidential candidates .
Republican John McCain has been a major supporter of Bush 's escalation of U.S. forces in Iraq .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama said he wants to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq in 16 months , although he said any pullout would be determined by conditions there .
Violence in Afghanistan is growing , increasing pressure to shift more troops from Iraq to there .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said he wants to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , but he does n't want to sacrifice gains in Iraq by shifting troops too soon .
About half of the 60,000 allied forces in Afghanistan are American .
Four of the five extra brigades sent to Iraq last year have left the country ; the last unit is preparing to leave this month .
The extra brigades increased U.S. troop levels to about 160,000 from 130,000 .
Even after five combat brigades leave , about 140,000 U.S. troops will remain in Iraq .
The average number of weekly attacks in Iraq has dropped to 200 , an 80 % reduction since June 2007 , according to Multi- National Corps — Iraq .
U.S. and Iraqi casualties have also dropped significantly .
The State Department said in a recent report that Iraq has met 15 of 18 congressional benchmarks designed to measure progress in Iraq .
The improved effectiveness of Iraq 's security forces will make it easier to withdraw U.S. troops , said California Rep. Duncan Hunter , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee .
" I think it might surprise some people how fast we can come out of Iraq as the Iraqi army matures , " Hunter said .
" I think we passed the tipping point as far as the Iraqi army maturing . "

Note to victims of accidents , medical malpractice , broken contracts and the like :
When you sue , make a deal .
That is the clear lesson of a soon - to - be - released study of civil lawsuits that has found that most of the plaintiffs who decided to pass up a settlement offer and went to trial ended up getting less money than if they had taken that offer .
“ The lesson for plaintiffs is , in the vast majority of cases , they are perceiving the defendant ’s offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more , ” said Randall L. Kiser , a co-author of the study and principal analyst at DecisionSet , a consulting firm that advises clients on litigation decisions .
Defendants made the wrong decision by proceeding to trial far less often , in 24 percent of cases , according to the study ; plaintiffs were wrong in 61 percent of cases .
In just 15 percent of cases , both sides were right to go to trial — meaning that the defendant paid less than the plaintiff had wanted but the plaintiff got more than the defendant had offered .
The vast majority of cases do settle — from 80 to 92 percent by some estimates , Mr. Kiser said — and there is no way to know whether either side in those cases could have done better at trial .
But the findings , based on a study of 2,054 cases that went to trial from 2002 to 2005 , raise provocative questions about how lawyers and clients make decisions , the quality of legal advice and lawyers ’ motives .
Critics of the profession have long argued that lawyers have an incentive to try to collect fees that are contingent on winning in court or simply to bill for all the hours required to prepare and go to trial .
“ What I would want them to look at was whether or not the lawyers had a strong financial incentive to go to trial , ” said Cristina C. Arguedas , a criminal defense lawyer in Berkeley , Calif. , when told of the study .
“ I ’m not suggesting the answer , because I do n’t know , but that would be my question . ”
The study , which is to be published in the September issue of the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies , does not directly answer Ms. Arguedas , but it does find that the mistakes were made more often in cases in which lawyers are typically paid a share of whatever is won at trial .
On average , getting it wrong cost plaintiffs at about $ 43,000 ; the total could be more because information on legal costs was not available in every case .
For defendants , who were less often wrong about going to trial , the cost was much greater : $ 1.1 million .
“ Most of the time , one of the parties has made some kind of miscalculation or mistake , ” said Jeffrey J. Rachlinski , a law professor at Cornell who has studied how lawyers and clients decide to go to trial and who is co-editor of the journal .
“ The interesting thing about it is the errors the defendants make are much more costly . ”
The study ’s authors have analyzed some data from New York and , after a review of 554 state court trials in 2005 , have found parties to lawsuits making the wrong decision at comparable rates .
The findings suggest that lawyers may not be explaining the odds to their clients — or that clients are not listening to their lawyers .
“ It ’s entirely possible that the attorneys are not giving adequate advice , ” said Mr. Kiser , who is also a lawyer but is not practicing .
“ An attorney could advise a client that they have a strong defense to enforcement of a contract , but that is not the same thing as forecasting what the likely outcome at trial would be . ”
As part of the study , which is the biggest of its kind to date , the authors surveyed trial outcomes over 40 years until 2004 .
They found that over time , poor decisions to go to trial have actually become more frequent .
“ It ’s peculiar if any field is not improving its performance over a 40 - year period , ” Mr. Kiser said .
“ That ’s a troubling finding . ”
Law schools do not teach how to handicap trials , nor do they help develop the important skill of telling a client that a case is not a winner .
Clients do not like to hear such news .
“ Most clients think they are completely right , ” Michael Shepard , a lawyer at Heller Ehrman in San Francisco .
A good lawyer has to be able to tell clients that a judge or jury might see them differently , he continued .
“ Part of it is judgment and part of it is diplomacy . ”
Several lawyers were dismissive of the study , noting that the statistics mean nothing when contemplating a particular case , with its specific facts and legal issues , before a specific judge .
They stressed the importance of a lawyer ’s experience .
But the study tried to account for that possibility and found that factors like the years of experience , rank of a lawyer ’s law school and the size of a law firm were less helpful in predicting the decision to go to trial .
More significant was the type of case .
For example , poor decisions by plaintiffs to go to trial “ are associated with cases in which contingency fee arrangements are common , ” according to the report .
“ On the defense side , high error rates are noted in cases where insurance coverage is generally unavailable . ”
The findings are consistent with research on human behavior and responses to risk , said Martin A. Asher , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author .
For example , psychologists have found that people are more averse to taking a risk when they are expecting to gain something , and more willing to take a risk when they have something to lose .
“ If you approach a class of students and say , I ’ll either write you a check for $ 200 , or we can flip a coin and I will pay you nothing or $ 500 , ” most students will take the $ 200 rather than risk getting nothing , Mr. Asher said .
But reverse the situation , so that students have to write the check , and they will choose to flip the coin , risking a bigger loss because they hope to pay nothing at all , he continued .
“ They ’ll take the gamble . ”
The third co-author of the study was Blakeley B. McShane , a graduate student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania .

The rise of Literature ?
For a few weeks I 've been mulling over a " theory " about the nature of contemporary fiction .

Here 's the argument : contemporary mainstream fiction is very different from the storytelling of the deep past because of a demand side shift .

How do they differ ?

The Tale of Genji ... is a classic work of Japanese literature attributed to the Japanese noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu in the early eleventh century , around the peak of the Heian Period .
It is sometimes called the world 's first novel , the first modern novel , or the first novel to still be considered a classic .
This issue is a matter of debate .
See Stature below .
...
The Genji is also often referred to as " the first novel " , though there is considerable debate over this - some of the debate involving whether Genji can even be considered a " novel " .
Some consider the psychological insight , complexity , and unity of the work to qualify it for " novel " status while simultaneously disqualifying earlier works .
Others see these arguments as subjective and unconvincing .
Related claims , perhaps in an attempt to sidestep these debates , are that Genji is the " first psychological novel " , " the first novel still considered to be a classic " , or other more qualified terms .
It is , however , difficult to claim that it is the world 's first novel without denying the claims of Daphnis and Chloe and Aethiopica in Greek , which author Longus and an unknown sophist respectively wrote , both around the third century , and in Latin , Petronius 's Satyricon in the first century and Apuleius 's Golden Ass in the second , as well as Kadambari in Sanskrit which author Banabhatta wrote in the seventh century .
( The debate exists in Japanese as well , with comparison between the terms monogatari -- " tale " -- and shosetsu -- " novel " . )

I did n't seek out fiction in any form before I was 13 or so ( I was assigned books in school of course ) ; but I had read Bullfinch 's Mythology as well as translations of the Iliad and Gilgamesh .
In hindsight I suspect that my interest in these works is due to the fact that they are recognizably High Fantasy .
Either they are explicit myths , or , they refer to peoples and places whose lack of banality is due to their distance in time & space ( obviously I have never been to the Zagros mountains ! ) .
I also have read historical fiction which is sufficiently distant in time , e.g. , the whole of Colleen McCullough 's Masters of Rome series .

I 'm somewhat along the autism spectrum toward Asperger's .
I 'm not the type to lose myself in a story , and I 'm not really interested in most horror films because I have a hard time getting scared or identifying with the characters ( I can't forget it 's just a movie and the people are n't real ) .
It seems clear to me why I have a hard time being interested in mainstream fiction ; not only am I not interested in the characters , but I 'm just not like most of the people depicted in terms of their values or personality .
I can't " relate , " and I 'm not interested in " relating .

If you read Isaac Asimov 's biography , In Memory Yet Green , I think you get a sense of why his novels depict flat characters .
Though Asimov seems to be a gregarious individual , he was very narcissistic and self - involved .
I do n't get a sense that he was a socially sensitive soul ( though he did resent the anti-Semitism he had experienced or slights from strangers ) .
Asimov wrote something of an apologia for science fiction as a genre of ideas , but I think it reflects the set of values which I 've expressed above and which many science fiction oriented individuals embody ; .

For whatever reason Our Kind of People do n't become literary critics or arbiters of taste & sophistication .
Science fiction & fantasy can never be Great Fiction .
If a work of science fiction & fantasy is Great Fiction then by definition it is not science fiction & fantasy .
Slaughterhouse - Five Brave New World and 1984 are not science fiction .
Within the science fiction ghetto authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Ray Bradbury , who admit or manifest little interest in science as such and emphasize literary values and social messages ( especially Le Guin for the latter ) , are held up as the great authors who are acceptable .
In other words , authors for whom psychological exploration just happens to involve a spaceship in the background .
Why does any of this matter ?
For one , I think that it is somewhat peculiar that many of us find fiction from the past more engaging than popular contemporary works .

John McCain released a new TV ad in which the announcer says that on his trip , Barack Obama ( seen here ) “ made time to go to the gym , but canceled a visit with wounded troops .
Seems the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . ”
McCain takes aim at Obama ’s character
As Barack Obama traveled overseas , the campaign against him appeared to take a decisive new turn when John McCain zeroed in on his Democratic opponent ’s character .
In a year when polls show an easy victory for a generic Democratic candidate , McCain has until now been loath to employ the tack many strategists see as essential and which anonymous e-mailers and commenters with no apparent links to his campaign have been practicing since last summer : hitting Obama not on his record or his platform , but on his values and person .
Advertisement
The Democrat ’s Achilles ’ heel in this model is an inchoate sense among some voters that the new arrival on the national stage with the unusual biography — who ’s the first black nominee from either party — is n’t American enough .
Prior to Obama ’s trip overseas , though , McCain had instead employed , without appreciable effect , a more conventional critique of his opponent as an ordinary politician , a flip - flopper and , of course , a liberal .
On Saturday , though , McCain released a new television advertisement in which the announcer says that on his trip , Obama “ made time to go to the gym , but canceled a visit with wounded troops .
Seems the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . ”
" John McCain is always there for our troops , " adds the announcer , before concluding with the campaign ’s new slogan : “ McCain , country first . ”
The slogan ’s inverse implication for his opponent was made clear earlier in the week , when McCain accused Obama of placing his political ambitions before the national interest .
" It seems to me that Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign , " McCain said Tuesday in New Hampshire , a line he ’s been using regularly since .
While Republican presidential candidates have long sought to paint their Democrat foes as insufficiently devoted to the country , the military or both , McCain ’s suggestion that Obama preferred to hit the gym than to visit wounded soldiers is considerably more personal than , say , President Bush ’s 2004 attack on Sen.
John F. Kerry for voting against bills to fund troops in Iraq .
In some ways , it bears more of a resemblance to the third - party Swift boat campaign that denigrated Kerry ’s service in Vietnam .
Further , McCain is uniquely qualified to make this charge , and Obama is uniquely vulnerable to it .
A former naval aviator and prisoner of war in Vietnam , McCain is pressing his case against a candidate with no military experience — thanks in part to a subterranean smear campaign that ’s tapped a nerve with some voters who do n’t see Obama as entirely American .
While the botched troop visit might have been the stuff of an attack ad in any case , since it was the only significant slip - up in an otherwise well - staged trip , McCain ’s new ad dovetailed with the latest viral e-mail aimed at Obama , a widely circulated — though later recanted — missive from a Utah National Guard officer stationed in Afghanistan , Joseph Porter , who wrote that Obama " blew ... off " and " shunned " soldiers during his visit there .
" He was just here to make a showing for the Americans back home , " Porter wrote , though press reports contradicted some of the details provided in his e-mail .
" It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country . "
Obama responded with high - minded disappointment to McCain 's new round of attacks , and his traveling companions in the Middle East , Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island , condemned them .
" I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into , ' you 're less patriotic than me .
I 'm more patriotic , ' " said Hagel , a Vietnam veteran who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate and is rumored to be considering a cross-party endorsement .
It ’s a tempting line of attack for McCain to take against Obama .
A recent poll found that 55 percent of voters thought Obama the “ riskier ” choice for president , but only 35 percent named McCain .
It ’s also an attack that taps into another major source of unease — Obama 's race — and is especially likely to pay dividends with a relative newcomer to the national stage such as Obama , whose public image is not yet as clearly defined as McCain's .
McCain ’s turn to character also reflects his campaign ’s deep , genuine contempt for Obama .
As the Democrat enjoyed boffo media coverage and a warm reception at every turn on his foreign trip , McCain aides began to openly use their derisive nickname for him , " The One , " mock some of his more gushing coverage , and draw a contrast between what they characterized as their candidate 's demonstrated dedication to country and their rival 's lip service to the same .
The tone is reminiscent of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's disdainful mockery of Obama in the primary .
" The skies will open , the light will come down , celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect , ” she said , just a touch sarcastically , of her rival .
Her attack is also a reminder of the difficulty in landing a clean shot on Obama .
In his book , " The Audacity of Hope , " Obama wrote : " I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views . "
While that undefined quality helped fuel Obama 's meteoric political assent and may have blunted the impact of some attacks on him , it 's now proving a stumbling block for many swing voters , particularly older ones .
For all the media attention his historic run has attracted , not to mention the quarter - billion dollars he has already spent introducing himself to the nation , 25 percent of respondents in a recent Newsweek poll wrongly believe he was raised as a Muslim and nearly 40 percent errantly thought he attended a Muslim school while growing up abroad .
These incorrect claims have also come up repeatedly in Politico interviews with voters , including Democrats and independents .
Kathie Steigerwald , a Dearborn , Mich. , businesswoman who said she voted for Hillary Clinton but now plans to support McCain , offered an especially succinct recital of a narrative on which other interviewees offered numerous variations :
" I feel John McCain is a true American and I want to support a true American , " she said .
But is n't Obama a " true American ? " she was asked .
" I do n't know , " she said after a measured pause .
" I question it . "
Why ?
" I do n't know — maybe because of his name ? "
Whatever his motives , McCain ’s new hit on his foe ’s patriotism hints at two years of whispered , viral rumors and myths about Obama centered on his patriotism and American values , or , more to the point , his lack thereof .
The e-mails — cataloged in Snopes.com 's lengthy Obama section and Obama 's own “ fight the smears " page — often have contradictory particulars , but the thrust is clear : Obama , various false e-mails claim , is not really a natural - born American citizen , is not really a Christian and refuses to pledge allegiance to the American flag .
" [ McCain ] can't beat him with the old ' liberal ' playbook , they can't beat him by deploying the old social - cultural wedge issues , and it seems more and more that they wo n't be able to beat him on readiness and experience , " said Dan Gerstein , a Democratic consultant whose clients have included Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman .
" So all they really have left is the personal stuff , first and foremost what I would call fear of ' the other , ' which is mostly but not exclusively about race , and goes to visceral issues of trust . "
" I 'm not questioning his patriotism , " McCain said on ABC's " This Week with George Stephanopolous . "
" I am saying that he made the decision [ to oppose the surge ] , which was political , in order to help him get the nomination of his party . "
" It really is the first time in the campaign where you have had the Obama online smears , of which there have been many , matching up with the actual paid negative advertising of a candidate , " said Chris Lehane , a Democratic consultant .
McCain supporters rejected the notion that this new line of attack is out of bounds .
" It 's accurate , effective and timely , " said Rick Wilson , a Republican consultant , of McCain 's ad .
" It seriously speaks to the calculated nature of the trip and Obama 's own [ calculating nature ] . ”
Wilson said the questions about Obama 's values and patriotism have particular potency because of his background , though he rejected the notion that race played a major role in it .
" Obama is always going to struggle with the cultural disconnect — he scans very much as liberal Ivy League elitist , " he said .
" People automatically put him in a box with people who are not like middle America 's view of patriotism . "
Jim Pinkerton , a contributor to Fox News who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , and for former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee in this year 's GOP primary , is n’t convinced of the efficacy of this line of attack :
" First they goaded him into going to Iraq , and that was pretty successful — for Obama .
And now the McCain people are trying to goad him into spending more time with the troops and going to hospitals to visit wounded soldiers .
“ They better be careful what they wish for , since Obama just might screw them up and do it . ”
A man has pleaded guilty to killing an 18 - day - old baby so that he could finish his videogame in peace .
On October 26 , 2007 , Rene Edward Barrios was trusted to look after his girlfriend 's newborn baby while it was sleeping .
Leaving it in the next room , Barrios was playing an unspecified game when the baby started to cry .
Enraged by the noise , the man went into the next room , where he violently shook the child and hit it in the head .
With the baby subdued , Barrios then went to finish his videogame for the next ten minutes , coming back to check on the child only to find it blue and unconscious .
The baby died later in hospital and Barrios was arrested there and then .
He has officially been found guilty of manslaughter and faces between 10.5 and 21 years of prison .
Having lived with far younger siblings , one can sympathize with the agony of having a child 's screaming ruin your gaming .
But Jesus Christ on a ferris wheel , it 's depressing to think that people are capable of this .

Kucinich to Present Impeachment Case to Panel
By Molly K. Hooper , CQ Staff
Democratic leaders have agreed to give Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich a day before the House Judiciary Committee to make his case that President Bush ought to be impeached for allegedly lying to Congress in order to get approval to invade Iraq .
Kucinich , D - Ohio , has introduced three impeachment resolutions — one against Bush ( HRes 1258 ) and two against Vice President Dick Cheney ( H Res 333 , H Res 799 ) — all of which have been referred to committee and then ignored .
On Thursday , Kucinich complied with a rule requiring him to give notice before filing another article of impeachment , which he intends to do on July 14 .
Earlier Thursday , Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D- Calif. , said Judiciary Chairman John Conyers Jr. , D - Mich. , likely would review the matter before his committee .
Kucinich contends that Pelosi ’s blessing demonstrates the desire on Capitol Hill to hold the administration accountable for allegedly lying to Congress .
“ When Congress is reminded that a case for war was made based on information that has been categorically proven to be untrue , Congress will then want to reflect on its power and responsibility , ”  Kucinich said .
But Democratic
House leaders downplayed the possibility of actual impeachment proceedings .
“ It is my expectation that there will be some review of it in the committee , ”  Pelosi said .
“ Not necessarily taking up the articles of impeachment , because that would have to be voted on the floor , but to have some hearings on the subject . ” 
“ The chairman may be holding hearings .
Whether he holds impeachment hearings would be another question , ”  Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , D - Md. , said Thursday .

TOKYO , June 2 ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s postal services system is looking to switch its entire fleet of about 21,000 short - distance delivery vehicles to zero-emission electric cars starting this business year , it said on Monday .
“ We ’re discussing the feasibility with automakers and battery makers to that end , ” said a spokesman at Japan Post Service Co , the mail delivery unit of Japan Post Group .
Depending on how fast the cars and necessary infrastructure such as recharging stations could be ready , the company may use some gasoline - electric hybrid cars in the interim , he said .
Among Japanese automakers , Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T , Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T are aggressively developing electric cars , which emit little to no harmful emissions but require large loads of batteries to drive relatively short distances .
The time required to recharge the batteries is also a hurdle with current technology .
All three automakers have said they aim to commercialise electric cars by 2010 .
Shares of vehicle - use battery makers surged after the Nikkei business daily reported Japan Post 's plan on Monday .
Furukawa Battery Co 6937 .T surged 16 percent , GS Yuasa Corp 6674.T , which has a battery joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors , jumped 7 percent , and Sanyo Electric Co 6764 .
T put on 5.6 percent .
Hitachi Maxell Ltd 6810 .T gained 6.5 percent .
A spokesman there confirmed a Nikkei evening edition report that it is aiming to commercialise a longer - lasting , cheaper lithium - ion battery in the next three to four years that substitutes expensive cobalt with manganese .
Shares of Mitsubishi Motors rose 3.7 percent while Fuji Heavy gained 1.4 .
Nissan lagged the sector with a 0.9 percent rise .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) -
It was no coincidence the U.S. military jurors at Guantanamo timed the prison sentence they gave Osama bin Laden ’s driver to end just before President George W. Bush ’s term does , legal analysts say .
In this file photograph of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin , reviewed by the U.S. Military , defendant Salim Hamdan sits during his trial inside the war crimes courthouse at Camp Justice , the legal complex of the U.S. Military Commissions , at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base , in Cuba , July 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Janet Hamlin/ Pool
The timing seems intended to give the next U.S. president who takes office on January 20 a chance to override the Bush administration ’s announcement that it will continue to hold convicted Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan as an “ enemy combatant ” in the war against terrorism after he finishes his sentence .
“ My inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release Hamdan at the end of his sentence , but the next one might , ” said David Glazier , a national security expert who teaches at Loyola Law School .
“ I think Hamdan ’s continued detention past the end of his sentence , although justifiable under the law of war , would be a political train wreck , and I think the panel made an effort to protect the U.S. from further international criticism . ”
Both major U.S. presidential candidates have said they would close the detention camp at the U.S. naval base in Cuba .
The six - member jury of military officers convicted Hamdan on Wednesday of providing material support for terrorism by driving and guarding bin Laden in Afghanistan .
They rejected charges that he was part of a broad al Qaeda conspiracy to murder American civilians , one of the “ worst of the worst . ”
The verdict in the first U.S. war crimes tribunal since World War Two endorsed military defense lawyers ’ position that Hamdan was a bit player who made the terrible decision to keep working for bin Laden because he needed the $ 200 monthly salary to support his family .
MILITARY PUSHING BACK
When jurors began deliberating his sentence , the only question they asked the judge was how much credit Hamdan would get for the time he has been held at Guantanamo .
The judge said he would get a little over 61 months ’ credit , and the jurors sentenced Hamdan to a 66 - month term that runs out at the end of December .
The jurors did not publicly explain their reasons but given the nuance of their verdict , it seems unlikely that timing was a coincidence .
“ For seven years , uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administration ’s most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies , only to be overruled by White House lawyers with little respect for the Constitution or Geneva Conventions , ” said Ben Wizner , a lawyer who monitored the trial for the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ We may never know what the commission members were thinking , but we saw what they did : they ensured that Mr. Hamdan ’s fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law . ”
Only one other prisoner has been convicted at Guantanamo , Australian David Hicks .
He avoided trial by pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism -- the same charge Hamdan was convicted of .
Hicks plea - bargained for a nine - month sentence and was allowed to leave Guantanamo before it ended , finishing it out in Australia .
“ Holding Hamdan past the end of his ( term ) is only going to further inflame anti-American feelings in the Muslim world where the U.S. will clearly be perceived as continuing to discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion , ” said Glazier , a former U.S. Navy officer .
U.S. citizens are exempt from imprisonment and trial at Guantanamo .
All the captives from Western nations were released long ago except for Canadian Omar Khadr , who faces trial in October on charges of killing a U.S. soldier with a grenade .

We all know the type : she 's successful , bright and , oh yes , too often has a man who humiliates her .
What on earth is the attraction ?
Logic would , or should , dictate that a high - flying woman who has everything going for her ( looks , talent , drive ) should ,
by definition , attract a man who is her equal , if not her superior , in terms of looks , intellect and wealth .
Yet in my experience , this is simply not the case .
The more accomplished the woman , the less accomplished the man is likely to be .
In fact , smart women seem to have a knack for attracting the sort of men that most of us were raised to stay well clear of .
I noticed this as a teenager , when my first night at university was punctuated by the arrival of police officers next door .
I went over to find a petite , beautiful blonde woman shaking uncontrollably .
She told me that her boyfriend had threatened her at gunpoint for breaking off their relationship , so she 'd called 999 .
Second rate : Sex And The City 's Carrie Bradshaw with Mr Big who refused to commit and continually humiliated her during their relationship
Tina , now a medical consultant , quickly became my best friend - and her ( awful ) choice of men soon became a big part of my life .
She left the stalking psychopath ( with a restraining order ) for a serial philanderer - only to end up in the hands of a terrifying but gorgeous German surgeon with a passion for heavy black leather coats .
He criticised her weight , publicly humiliated her and betrayed her without even trying to cover his tracks .
She left him a few times , only to return sheepishly several weeks later .
One day , when she was flying back into London , my husband drove to the airport and effectively kidnapped her to get her away from this man .
We soon heard the German circling outside our house like a rabid Doberman .
It was only then that Tina realised she was no different from the abused women on Oprah Winfrey - except that she had a PhD .
This is not an isolated story .
Over the years , I have watched some of my most accomplished girlfriends enter a string of relationships which have left them wrung out like wet towels .
So it was with great interest that I read the findings of Dr Steve Stewart - Williams , one of the psychologists behind the study Why Do Men Insult Their Intimate Partners ?
Published in a recent issue of the Journal Of Personality And Individual Differences , Dr Stewart - Williams concluded that when it comes to women with high IQs , a form of meanness is actually programmed into male behaviour .
' Meanness is a form of " mate retention " in many men , ' he says .
' Typically , men want lower status women because they feel they can control them .
It can be threatening for a man if their partner has a higher IQ because they will often feel that makes the woman more desirable than they are themselves .
' That 's when a man is likely to be unfaithful or aggressive as a means of asserting control over the woman .
' If a man demeans a woman , it makes her feel low , neglected and disrespected .
And if a woman feels humiliated , they will eventually come to believe they can't do any better and stick around with that man . '
It 's a classic cycle of abuse , however subtle .
The real surprise is that it appears to be happening to such brilliant women , and so many of them .
I recently flew to Paris to comfort a friend abandoned by the father of her seven - month - old boy - a child born only after she had been through no fewer than four IVF treatments .
This is a funny woman with a fat bank account who turns heads wherever she goes .
And here she is alone again , at the age of 44 , having signally failed to choose a man in the past two decades who will be kind and faithful to her .
Those of us with a ' cad antenna ' superglued to our foreheads could tell that the man who left her was bad news .
( Even before he ran off with another woman , he refused to make any adjustments in his work schedule to include my friend . )
But last week , my friend said something that shocked me .
' I think love is conditional , ' she opined .
' I expect to be loved only if I am perfect in every sense of the word . '
How could someone so bright , so beautiful , have such appallingly low self - esteem ?
It made me think .
Over the years , there had been a string of men who had fallen for her wit , sexiness and competence - but all had bolted when she showed any signs of neediness .
I counted five who'd abandoned her in this fashion .
I think the trouble with my friend is that , apart from choosing hopeless men in the first place , she is seemingly unable to leave them when it all goes horribly wrong - hence her feeling that it was her fault because she was not perfect .
The Clintons : Hillary was publicly humiliated when husband Bill 's affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed , yet she has remained by his side
Simply put , she was so used to taking on challenges in her career - and winning - that she assumed men would be the same .
And because she could n't stand to lose at anything , she could n't give up on her relationships , no matter how unsuitable .
You see , clever women also tend to be perfectionists who are programmed to succeed .
Perhaps rather than walk away at the first sign of trouble with a man , they simply try harder .
Many , too , never learned the difficult art of compromise because they did not think they had to .
The tug - of - war that usually happens at the beginning of a relationship - when a couple seeks to find out who 's boss - becomes a nuclear battle for them ; and too often , the women lose .
They also , I think , tend to have little experience of men .
While the less clever girls were busy playing ( and learning to master ) the field , the smart ones were revising .
One of my literary editors , a Cambridge graduate , tells me : ' Making fun of men was what we did in school .
We did n't have a clue how to handle them , though . '
This makes smart women prime targets for cads , says Dr Andy Clark , a psychologist at Bristol University , who noted in New Scientist magazine that ' anti - social men can make up a lot of ground just by being flirtatious .
This sort of behaviour often fools women into thinking that the man is not so bad ' .
By the time a woman figures out what he 's really like , she 's already hooked .
In other words , clever women are remarkably naive when it comes to emotional matters , and too easily fooled by men who are charming on the surface but really not very nice at all .
So , while my less accomplished , less driven girlfriends settled down happily ( all , I noticed , quit the big jobs when the children came along ) , those with the Oxbridge Firsts and the business awards ploughed on alone , seemingly destined for romantic misery .
I 've discussed this issue with a writer friend .
At 5ft 10in , with knockout looks , she hypnotises every man she meets , yet she has fallen for some horrible cads .
' I do n't know the psychological reasons why " Wheat " women choose " Chaff " men , but I do know that I 've done it myself , ' she says .
' But maybe this is the key : terrible men can be terribly amusing .
There 's a fine line between humour and hurt ; between what 's powerfully insightful and connecting , and what 's cruel and , often , stupid .
Sometimes , we women get mixed up while we 're laughing .
' I almost married a man who treated me terribly , doing drugs and cheating , because he was the funniest man I 'd ever met .
The only thing that set me straight was finding someone else 's underwear in his dresser .
' That 's a pretty blatant betrayal - but I 've found that " abusive " behaviour comes in many forms .
Sometimes , the worst treatment is almost invisible - like carbon monoxide leaking undetected into the relationship .
' I once dated a charming , energetic , successful man whom others may still see as a catch .
But there was that carbon monoxide there : an almost total lack of thoughtfulness - except in social situations when others were watching .'
Perhaps this is not an issue we read about much because it's not the kind of thing most women want to talk about .
Career women who can't pick the right guy tend to be embarrassed that they keep getting it wrong romantically .
Let 's face it , we expect women in trailer parks to get beaten up emotionally - not women who dominate boardrooms and earn six - figure salaries .
Italian lawyer Nancy Dell 'Olio with Sven Goran Eriksson , the former England manager had public affairs with Ulrika Jonsson and FA secretary Faria Alam but she always stood by her man .
The pair finally split last year
Ours is a generation of women that was spoon - fed self - esteem by teachers and parents : it 's not nice to have to admit that your love life is a failure .
One of my girlfriends got a First at Cambridge and was among the first women to become a managing director of an international bank .
She was earning six figures by the age of 28 , but when she came home , her husband ( also a well - paid banker ) would attack her verbally .
' He would rubbish my bank constantly and do things such as change the TV channel when I was watching .
One evening , when we had a couple over , he brought only three glasses to the table so that I had to do without .
' He was permanently humiliating me in endless small ways . '
It 's only now , after they divorced , that she realises he must have felt threatened .
' Interestingly , he remarried someone with a low - grade career and less brains , ' says my friend drily .
Alpha females , the theory goes , get a bum deal because men are biologically hard - wired to avoid successful partners for the fear of being cheated on .
A 2004 study by psychologists at the University of Michigan found that high status men preferred to marry their secretaries rather than colleagues .
Dr Stephanie Brown , a social psychologist who reported the results in the Journal Of Evolution And Human Behaviour , said : ' These findings provide empirical support for the widespread belief that powerful women are at a disadvantage in the marriage market because men may prefer to marry less accomplished women . '
To make matters worse , a study published a few months ago by the Centre of Longitudinal Studies in London estimates that 40 per cent of female graduates born in 1970 are likely to enter their 40s single .
So the lonely life known as ' sologamy ' may be the price that high - achieving women have to pay .
New York Times journalist Maureen Dowd inspired a lot of vitriol recently when she wrote : ' The aroma of male power is an aphrodisiac for women - but the perfume of female power is a turnoff for men .
' It took women a few decades to realise that everything they were doing to advance themselves in the boardroom could be sabotaging their chances in the bedroom . '
So can these women escape the pattern of picking Mr Wrong time and again ?
Self - awareness seems to be the main ticket out of this emotional mire - learning that the kind of powerful man who makes you laugh , but also tells you you 're 5lb too fat and you can't cook is really not the man for you .
My abandoned friend in Paris coped with her own emotional disaster by teaching herself to think the way abused women in shelters are told to think : by constantly reminding herself of just what an unpleasant piece of work her child 's father was .
' I just remember everything bad he did ; how every weekend he graced me with ten minutes of attention at breakfast before he went back to reading and sleeping the rest of the time , ' she says .
' And then I feel a lot better about the fact that he left me .
She at least is finding the strength to get over that disastrous affair .
But the question remains as to why she allowed herself to get into it in the first place .
Maybe high - achieving women just strive harder - and relationships are no exception ?
Easy just does n't feel right for them .
But in searching for a strong man whom they feel will be their equal , they often mistake bullying , or charm , for strength .
Maybe that 's why so many brilliant woman are so lonely .
Note :
This post is about a new product we 're testing at my company Kosmix .
Search engines are great at finding the needle in a haystack .
And that 's perfect when you are looking for a needle .
Often though , the main objective is not so much to find a specific needle as to explore the entire haystack .
When we 're looking for a single fact , a single definitive web page , or the answer to a specific question , then the needle - in - haystack search engine model works really well .
Where it breaks down is when the objective is to learn about , explore , or understand a broad topic .
For example :
Hiking the Continental Divide Trail .
A loved one recently diagnosed with arthritis .
You read the Da Vinci code and have an irresistible urge to learn more about the Priory of Sion .
Saddened by George Carlin 's death , you want to reminisce over his career .
The web contains a trove of information on all these topics .
Moreover , the information of interest is not just facts ( e.g. , Wikipedia ) , but also opinion , community , multimedia , and products .
What 's missing is a service that organizes all the information on a topic so that you can explore it easily .
The Kosmix team has been working for the past year on building just such a service , and we put out an alpha yesterday .
You enter a topic , and our algorithms assemble a " topic page " for that topic .
Check out the pages for Continental Divide Trail , arthritis , Priory of Sion , and George Carlin .
The problem we 're solving is fundamentally different from search , and we 've taken a fundamentally different approach .
As I 've written before , the web has evolved from a collection of documents that neatly fit in a search engine index , to a collection of rich interactive applications .
Applications such as Facebook , MySpace , YouTube , and Yelp .
Instead of serving results from an index , Kosmix builds topic pages by querying these applications and assembling the results on - the - fly into a 2 - dimensional grid .
We have partnered with many of the services that appear in the results pages , and use publicly available APIs in other cases .
Here are some of the challenging problems that we had to tackle in building this product :
Figuring out which which applications are relevant to a topic .
For example , Boorah , Yelp , and Google maps are relevant to the topic " restaurants 94041 " .
WebMD , Mayo Clinic , and RightHealth are relevant to " arthritis " .
If we called each application for every query , the page would look very confusing , and our partners would get unhappy very quickly !
I 'll write more on how we do this in a separate post by itself , but it 's very , very cool indeed .
Figuring out related topics in the Related in the Kosmos section on each Topic page .
For example , you can start from the Priory of Sion and laterally explore Rosslyn Chapel or the Madonna of the Rocks .
Figuring out the placement and space allocation to each element in the 2 - dimensional grid .
Going from one dimension ( linear list ) to two dimensions ( grid ) turns out to be quite a challenge , both from an algorithmic and from a UI design point of view .
In this alpha , we 've taken a first stab at tackling these challenges .
We are still several months from having a product that we feel is ready to launch , but we decided to put this public alpha out there to gather user feedback and tune our service .
Many aspects of the product will evolve between now and then :
Do we have the right user interaction model for topic exploration ?
Do we put too much information on the topic page ?
Should we present it very differently ?
How do we combine human experts with our algorithms ?
Most importantly , the Kosmix approach does not work for every query !
Our goal is to organize information around topics , not answer arbitrary search queries .
How do we make the distinction clear in the product itself ?
Can we carve out a separate niche from search engines ?
We hope to gain insight into all these and more questions from this alpha .
Please use it and provide your feedback !

It ’s certainly no secret that continued high gasoline prices have put a serious dent in the budgets of most Americans .
In order to cope and deal with rising fuel costs , many of us have had to begrudgingly make changes in our driving habits that even a year ago , would have seemed unfathomable .
After all , has n’t it become the new Manifest Destiny for Americans to have abundant , cheap and convenient transportation ?
As expensive gasoline started to become less of a passing fad and more of an entrenched institution , these subtle changes in lifestyle and driving habits became less of a nuisance and more of an necessity to stay financially solvent .
However , with the price of gasoline having now fallen for 17 consecutive days – and now down over 5 % from its record high – one would think that the natural tendency would be for people to return to their “ old ” driving habits .
After all , we certainly have become accustomed to driving whatever , whenever and wherever we choose .
Not so fast .
This time it appears that we may have learned our lesson and are willing to let our recent change in driving habits become a little more entrenched .
According to a recent poll on CNNMoney.com , 67 % of drivers will continue to try and find new ways to save gas , even if prices continue to fall .
Here ’s how nearly 100,000 people responded to the poll , which asked : “ If gas prices continue to go down , I will : ”
6 % stated they will go back to their old driving habits
27 % stated they will drive the same way they do now
67 % stated they will still find new ways to save gas
Due to record high gas prices , many of us are walking more , driving less and moving towards vehicles with better fuel economy .
Considering none of these changes are too dramatic or life changing , it ’s easy to see why we appear so willing to make these recent adjustments a permanent part of our lives .
The GOP 's 2008 nominee is ... Eldon Smith ?
It turns out that this is n't the first time the issue of John McCain 's lavish multiple residences has emerged in the heat of a campaign .
In 1986 , when then - Rep. McCain was running for the Senate seat vacated by Barry Goldwater , he quietly began remodeling a $ 500,000 house in central Phoenix owned by his wealthy father - in - law James Hensley .
The $ 225,000 project -- which included the construction of a 4,000 - square - foot addition , swimming pool , jacuzzi , cabana and barbecue -- held political peril for McCain , who was already fighting charges that he was as an opportunistic carpertbagger .
The new house was located in Phoenix 's fourth congressional district -- outside of the first district in Tempe which he represented at the time .
AP caught wind of the work at 7110 North Central Ave. shortly before the general election and dispatched a reporter to examine blueprints at the planning department .
They found the permit applicants were listed as Hensley and a mysterious " Mr. Smith . "
The reporter tracked down McCain 's plumber , who told him he'd been told Mr. Smith 's first name was " Eldon . "
Eldon Smith , it turned out , was John McCain .
When confronted with the blueprints , McCain 's spokeswoman did n't deny that the renovation was being done for McCain and his wife Cindy -- and suggested that Smith was Cindy 's mother 's maiden name .
She did n't explain why Marguerite Hensley might have been listed as " Mr. Smith . "
Later , McCain released a statement attributing the choice of Smith 's name to his architect .
Use of the alias did n't violate the law , he claimed , because it appeared only on blueprints and not on official permits .
" Like most architectural firms , Sheiner Day Kunz Associates uses a generic name on blueprints when working for a well - known client , " he said , adding that he and Cindy had been " very open " about their plans to move out of his congressional district .
Alas , local planning experts did n't quite agree .
" Gabor Lorant , head of the Phoenix - area chapter of the American Institute of Architects , " the AP reported on Oct. 31 , 1986 , " said that in his 29 years of work here he had never heard of a blueprint practice such [ as the one ] McCain described as common practice . "
A McCain spokesman declined comment on the 22 - year - old intrigue .
Note to Barack Obama :
The story had little impact on the race and McCain went on to trounce Democrat Richard Kimball .

ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Bombs killed 15 people and wounded around 140 in Istanbul late on Sunday , just hours ahead of a court case over banning the governing party that has plunged Turkey into political turmoil .
Forensic officers investigate the scene of two bomb explosions in a busy shopping district in Istanbul July 27 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Osman Orsal
Officials said one loud blast brought people into the streets of a busy shopping and eating area , then a larger bomb hidden in a rubbish bin exploded 10 minutes and 50 meters away , tearing through the crowds .
“ This is a terror attack , ” city governor Muammer Guler told reporters at the scene , in a pedestrianized street where families gather in the evenings to dine , sip tea and stroll , well away from the city ’s tourist sites .
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts , the deadliest attack in Turkey since 2003 .
Television showed ambulances taking away the wounded in the middle - class Gungoren district of Turkey ’s biggest city , near the main airport .
Among the rubble and glass of broken shop windows , men carried away the wounded and children cried .
“ First a percussion bomb exploded and then a bomb in a garbage container , ” Deputy Prime Minister Hayati Yazici told reporters .
One witness said : “ Tens of people were scattered around .
People ’s heads , arms , were flying in the air . ”
“ I condemn those who carried out this bombing , which shows us terrorism ’s inhumane desire for cruelty and violence without discriminating between men and women , young , old and children , ” President Abdullah Gul said in a statement .
An official at the Istanbul governor ’s crisis centre told Reuters the death toll had now reached 15 and 137 people were injured , some seriously .
Television stations put the injuries as high as 150 .
Interior Minister Besir Atalay told CNN
Turk television 15 people died and 15 were in critical condition .
DETENTIONS REPORTED
Turkish newspaper Zaman reported on its website that three people had been detained in connection with the blasts .
Forensic teams were examining the scene of the blasts and police were now investigating the security cameras in the area .
“ I heard the blast and I came running , people were running the other way to get away .
As I approached I saw a huge black cloud coming out of the street .
I saw about 10 bodies lying down on the ground , ” Ercan Usta , who owns a cafe nearby , told Reuters .
Kurdish separatists , far - left groups and Islamists have all carried out bombings in Istanbul in the past .
Turkey , which is seeking European Union membership , has been plunged into political and economic uncertainty by a court case over banning the ruling party that begins on Monday .
The Constitutional Court , Turkey ’s highest judicial body , will deliberate on whether the AK Party has engaged in Islamist activities and should be closed .
The party denies the charges .
A ruling is expected in early August .

Tensions have also been rising over a widening police investigation into a suspected ultra-nationalist group accused of seeking to overthrow the AK Party government .
So far 86 people have been arrested , including well - known critics of the government .
Governor Guler said the “ heinous attack ” in Istanbul , which straddles Europe and Asia , was not a suicide bombing .
In Gungoren , on the European side , residents hung the red and white Turkish flag out of their homes after the bombs .
Earlier this month three Turkish police and three gunmen were killed in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Istanbul .
The most serious attacks in recent years were in 2003 , when 62 people were killed by Islamist militants targeting two synagogues , a bank and the British consulate in Istanbul .
State news agency Anatolian reported a failed suicide attack on a police station in Bingol province in southeast Turkey .
One of the attackers was killed , one wounded and one escaped .
Even war criminals have fan clubs .
On Tuesday , 15,000 people in Belgrade , Serbia , protested the transfer of indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic to the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague .
Karadzic is implicated in torture , rape , murder and genocide , but to some self - styled Serbian patriots , these are mere details .
“ Long Live Radovan ! ” chanted the protesters .
For the many Americans who read of Karadzic ’s arrest but wondered , “ Yes , great -- and when will George W. Bush and Dick Cheney face trial for war crimes ? ” this is something to keep in mind .
Karadzic was the leader of a small , unrecognized rogue republic and presided over a genocide -- but he evaded justice for more than a decade and still keeps a loyal fan base .
Bush and Cheney are the leaders of the most powerful state in the world , and their misdeeds , though egregious , are n’t on the same level as Karadzic’s .
( Unless -- ahem -- you count the Iraq war , on the “ it was all a tissue of lies ” theory .
But for the sake of the argument , let ’s give them the benefit of the doubt . )
So no one should be surprised that there ’s still a Bush fan club ( albeit a small one ) or that the prospects of criminal proceedings against the president and his henchmen are virtually nonexistent .
It ’s not that Bush , Cheney and Co. do n’t deserve to end up in the dock .
Retired Army Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba , who was commissioned by the Pentagon in 2004 to investigate the abuses at Abu Ghraib , recently concluded that “ the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture .
...
A government policy was promulgated to the field whereby the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice were disregarded .
...
There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes . ”

The human cost of those crimes ?
It ’s hard to say for sure , given the administration ’s penchant for secrecy ( understandable , because the president was warned as early as January 2002 of “ the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act ” by his then - chief counsel , Alberto Gonzales ) .
But when the nongovernmental Detainee Abuse and Accountability Project examined thousands of pages of internal government records , it documented more than 330 cases “ in which U.S. military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees ” at “ U.S. facilities throughout Afghanistan , Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay . ”
A McClatchy Newspaper Group report released a few weeks ago came to a similar conclusion , finding that brutal mistreatment of prisoners was routine in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo , even though in many cases the abused detainees had no ties to Al Qaeda .
Did all this violate U.S. and international law ?
You betcha .
The U.S. is party to the U.N. Convention Against Torture , and torture is also a federal crime .
At the time most of the abuses were committed , the War Crimes Act also criminalized violations of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , which prohibits “ cruel treatment and torture [ and ] outrages upon personal dignity . ”
And under the doctrine of “ command responsibility , ” senior civilian and military leaders could all face criminal liability for authorizing or tolerating the abuses .
But do n’t hold your breath .
As far back as 2001 , administration lawyers were crafting legal opinions designed to shelter their bosses from any future criminal liability , and much evidence has since been hidden and destroyed .
Then in 2006 , the GOP - dominated Congress amended the War Crimes Act -- with retroactive effect -- to make future prosecutions almost impossible .
Advertisement
In any case , neither Democrats nor Republicans have the stomach for criminal proceedings against high - ranking current or former officials who still retain substantial public support .
Meanwhile , no international tribunal is ever likely to have jurisdiction over the U.S. participants involved in the abuses .
But that does n’t mean we should give up on accountability .
John McCain and Barack Obama should be urged to establish a high - level , nonpartisan “ truth commission ” with robust subpoena powers early in 2009 .
That commission should investigate , hold hearings and issue a public report on responsibility for torture , war crimes and other abuses committed during the Bush administration .
Such a panel would n’t satisfy those who ’d like to see Bush and Cheney in prison garb , but it would be a major step toward undoing the damage the administration did to our reputation as a nation committed to human rights .
And as more incriminating details come out -- and they will -- some Bush - Cheney fan club members might even turn in their membership cards .

“ If Amazon / eBay / Google / Yahoo offer platforms – and they will , I believe . ” – me
That was Saturday .
By Monday , Google App Engine had launched with much fanfare .
When I said cloudy days were ahead , I obviously believed that to be the case .
I just did n’t know that meant Monday .
Some forecaster I am .
Anyway , you ’re hearing it here last ( seriously ) as usual , but as the highest profile entrant into the cloud computing market since Salesforce.com , Google has earned itself a Q&A .
Better late than never and all that .
Q : For those few that have n’t seen the news , can you summarize the announcement for us ?
A : Certainly .
Monday evening , at their now annual Campfire One developer gathering , Google announced the release and immediate , limited availability of a cloud computing platform called Google App Engine .
In essence , it ’s a cloud based platform similar and yet distinct from competitive offerings from Amazon , Salesforce.com , and so on .
Like those mentioned , it ’s what Marc Andreessen might term a Level 3 platform .
Q : How does Google App Engine compare , specifically , to alternative cloud options available to developers ?
A : If we think of cloud computing offerings on a spectrum of closed to open , with Salesforce.com ’s Force.com on the closed end and Amazon ’s EC2/S3 at the open ( though the Joyent guys can credibly argue to be more open than Amazon ) , Google ’s App Engine is somewhere near the midpoint .
It does impose a proprietary database ( Bigtable ) on would - be developers , as does Force.com , but it allows for the use of a standard programming language ( Python ) rather than the proprietary one required of Force.com developers .
It ’s more constrained than Amazon , of course , which essentially offers developers the freedom to pick and choose from the bare metal of a virtualized platform on up , but Google ’s approach does offer some advantages to with its disadvantages .
Q : What kinds of advantages ?
A : Transparent scalability , primarily .
Relative ease of implementation , secondarily .
As Google describes it , App Engine includes “ automatic scaling and load balancing , ” and this feature along will be worth it to a certain class of application developers .
Says my office mate Alex King :
At Crowd Favorite we are web developers , not system admins .
We understand how to build something so it can scale , but actually doing the server config and managing them on a day to day basis is not our core competency .
This service is designed for us .
To be sure , self hosted offerings or competing services like Amazon ’s can be scaled , but they – short of an abstraction layer provided by a third party – require both know how and time .
Both of which may be in short supply at many startups .
Google ’s service , by contrast , aims to deliver this as part of the offering .
For developers like those at Crowd Favorite , who ’d prefer to focus on the actual construction of applications , this is , as Alex put it , a potential game changer .
But it does not come without a cost , of course .
Q : Let ’s talk about the costs : what are the downsides of App Engine ?
A : Alex Bosworth lists several that are worth considering , but four seem most important to me .
Two are relatively minor , two are more substantial .
Q : What are the minor objections ?
In ascending order of importance , they are :
No CRON :
According to what I ’ve read , App Engine includes no CRON - like scheduling component .
Meaning that , as Alex suggests , developers will – where such scheduled tasks are required by the application – be compelled to maintain external application components to “ wake up ” App Engine via HTTP requests .
: According to what I ’ve read , App Engine includes no CRON - like scheduling component .
Meaning that , as Alex suggests , developers will – where such scheduled tasks are required by the application – be compelled to maintain external application components to “ wake up ” App Engine via HTTP requests .
Python Only :
In its initial iteration , App Engine supports Python only , so developers in Java , PHP , Ruby , and so on are left with two choices : port their applications to Python , or host elsewhere .
Frankly , I find this constraint as understandable as it is logical , given both Google ’s internal Python focus ( remember , they employ Guido ) and the difficulties of launching a new service .
But for some developers , it will mean App Engine is a non-starter .
Aside from the fact that there are obvious work arounds for the above , both could – and likely will be – addressed in some future version of the App Engine platform .
So I do n’t see either as worth focusing on , at least at the present time .
Q : So what is worth focusing on ?
What are the major objections >?
A : They ’re actually somewhat intertwined , but again in order of ascending importance the big issues from my vantage point are :
No Export :
At the current time , according to the answers Alex got , there is no simple export – no mysqldump , as it were – available for App Engine .
Meaning that anything your application generates and persists on the App Engine platform will have to be extracted programmatically .
This is suboptimal , even if we can expect such tools to emerge relatively quickly post - launch .

Meaning that anything your application generates and persists on the App Engine platform will have to be extracted programmatically .
This is suboptimal , even if we can expect such tools to emerge relatively quickly post - launch .
The Lockin Issue :
The most obvious concern , both for myself and several other commenters .
In a nutshell , as Ian writes , it ’s wise to be somewhat cautious “ [ basing ] my startup on a infrastructure which can only be provided by a single company . ”
ARS Technica , in an excellent piece , is more blunt , saying : Although Google App Engine offers some clear advantages and lowers the barriers to entry for startups and independent developers , the potential for lock - in creates risks that could prove more costly in the long - term .
To be sure , App Engine is less closed than Force.com , as the construction language in Python is at least portable .
And from the initial reports , it would appear that GQL – the customized version of SQL used to access Bigtable – is not a radical departure from its ancestor , and thus the persistence layer should n’t be hugely challenging to port .
But a port it would still be .
Not to mention the fact that if you ’ve been relying on Google to transparently handle scaling for you , on exiting that environment that challenge would loom alongside the task of porting .
In short , while it ’s technically possible to leave Google ’s platform from what we know at this point , there are a variety of factors in the design that actively disincent this choice .
Which may be wholly necessary in order to horizontally scale the service over a substantial user base .
But developers and startups selecting App Engine should do so understanding that any future migration will be a significant challenge .
Which it always is , of course , but in my view there are unique considerations for App Engine based offerings .
Q : What could Google do to reduce concerns about the potential for lock - in ?
A : Open source as much of the infrastructure as is possible .
One person I ’ve spoken with , in fact , is of the opinion that this will happen , but I have n’t seen any public confirmation of this one way or another .
If any of the Googlers are at liberty to comment on the subject , I ’d love to hear what if any plans there are for opening the doors .
If Google is unable or unwilling to open source these assets , it might instead assist in the creation of API compatible back ends , either with resources , documentation , or both .
More than a few developers believe that this will happen anyway , with Ivan Krsti saying :
And now , as people begin to implement their own Google datastore API - compatible backends on top of everything from Apache CouchDB to ( awkwardly - fitting ) relational databases like MySQL and Postgres — which , make no mistake , will happen very soon — we might yet see the long - unfulfilled WinFS dream of rich metadata and tremendously powerful search come to life .
If the initial assessments of the APIs prove correct , it seems likely that this is correct .
And while some might remain skeptical of the possibility of reverse engineering the APIs because of the lack of incentive – even if you ’re successful , are you likely to more or less efficient than Google – there are other potential use cases for external implementations of the underlying infrastructure .
Think test , staging , and so on .
Q : What about the libraries and applications I rely on ?
If my application takes advantage of Java libraries and is built on top of MySQL , what are my options ?
A : For the libraries , seek Python equivalents .
As for MySQL , Google ’s persistence mechanism is Bigtable so MySQL is unsupported ; your application will have to leverage that instead .
Q : What about Django ?
Is Python ’s answer to Rails supported on App Engine ?
A : My understanding is that it is , with some exceptions , which should speed application generation up considerably .
Q : Besides the language and persistence support , are there other relevant APIs available ?
A : There are .
Besides the standard mail interface , Google apparently is providing an API to its own identity system .
This is important from a developer perspective because , if leveraged , it could obviate the need for the creation of an authentication / authorization / signon infrastructure .
At the cost of mandating Google account usage or creation , and increasing the platform lock - in , of course .
As Tim Bray put it , the API has the potential to turn adopters into sharecroppers .
It ’s no surprise that Google has made this available , as it offers them potentially rich new pipelines for account creation , which can both be mined and cross-sold into other Google application usage .
Q : What are the service level restrictions ?
A : Applications are currently limited to “ 500MBs of storage , 200 M megacycles of CPU per day , and 10 GB bandwidth per day ” which Google expects to translate to the ability to serve “ around 5 million pageviews per month . ”
Beyond that , commercial rates will begin to apply , though those rates are not currently available .
Though I ’ve seen several question these caps , they seem relatively reasonable to me , particularly at launch .
Q : And are there any levels of service promised ?
A : If there are , I have not seen them .
Nor would I have expected them ; Amazon , remember , launched without them , and I think it ’s unrealistic to expect a newly launched offering of this nature to promise anything in the way of uptime .
Once they can profile the demand from the initial 10,000 users , it will be easier to tackle the capacity planning – and the attendant service level expectations – for a wider scale rollout .
Q : Are SLAs even worth anything in this day and age ?
A : Strictly speaking , no .
Particularly in instances such as this , where the service is offered at no cost .
That said , SLAs do speak to the expectations for uptime that the offering vendor believes are reasonable , and as such are of interest , at least to me .
Even if I ca n’t hold a cloud computing vendor to the terms of an SLA , it is useful to know what metrics they believe they can meet .
Q : Does this make sense for commercial organizations as well as individual developers ?
A : It depends , of course .
Assuming that the basic restrictions – Python , Bigtable , etc – are not obs tacles , you need to assess the long term probability of a departure from the platform , and decide whether the risks are under threshold for your organization .
And I would also want to understand more fully the over - limit costs that can be expected , and whether or not those were predictable over at least a two to three year period .
Q : What about the costs of the service , both now and in future ?
A : At the present time , with the restrictions already noted , the service is free .
More , the platform at those same levels will remain so .
Meaning that , unlike any of the other cloud computing offerings , users can begin building at no cost , assuming only the risk of porting should that become necessary .
As many have said before , it ’s difficult to compete with free , so in spite of the some of the aforementioned concerns , Google has essentially guaranteed itself a market by eliminating cost as a barrier to entry .
Few if any competitors or potential competitors , with the possible exception of Microsoft , would seem willing to try this model .
The question of costs above and beyond the basic levels remains an open one , and until we have numbers it ’s difficult to speculate on its positioning relative to offerings from Amazon et al .
Q : Speaking of Amazon , what impact do you expect this to have on them ?
A : It ’s difficult to say precisely , because the answer is entirely dependent on a question I do n’t know that anyone will be able to answer : are there more developers that will put a premium on seamless scalability , or are they outnumbered by the set that values openness and fears lock - in ?
I certainly cannot claim to know the answer to that question at the present time , and neither , in my view , can anyone else .
It will be fun to watch .
In the short term , however , I expect that Amazon will remain a viable and often preferred choice for a very sizable portion of the addressable market .
It was inevitable that they would face competition in this market , and like Dave Winer I believe that it will affect Amazon ’s direction in a positive way for users .
It ’s reasonable to predict , for example , that Amazon will redirect AWS resources into the tooling and management of the platform , both which are likely to suffer in comparison to Google ’s front ends .
Q : Who are the other winners and losers here ?
A : Well , the clear winners are the Python language and Google .
App Engine , from the discussions I ’ve had over the past few days , has galvanized interest in both , and besides the obvious short term wins observable , there are more interesting long term implications to the offering , including the potential for dramatically streamlining acquisitions .
Q : Wait , what does that mean ?
A : Several people have made the point , but ARS puts it most subtly :
This sounds great to small developers with small sites , but what happens when your cool idea takes off and you ’ve got thousands or millions of users ?
You ’ll be paying a lot of money to Google each month — with no easy way out .
No matter how much your user base and technology is worth , almost no company will be willing to purchase your idea because of the high cost of migrating that code out of Google .
Everyone except Google , of course .
Google ’s unimpressive track record with respect to the handling of its acquisitions is well known ; Dodgeball , Grand Central , Jaiku , Jotspot and others have all shown signs of stalling under Google ’s care , if not outright neglect , and one potential explanation for this is the difficulty of rearchitecting the acquired technologies for Google ’s unique environment .
But what if the acquired technologies were already running on Google ’s infrastructure ?
IBM , unlike Google , has a history of integrating its acquisitions into its portfolio efficiently .
Part of that ability is the smaller size of the majority of its acquisitions , but the bigger factor , in my view , is the fact that IBM tends to acquire partners .
More specifically , partners that are preintegrated with IBM technologies .
It ’s possible that App Engine represents , in some fashion , Google ’s digestion of that particular lesson .
Q : Back to the winners and losers : who stands to lose from this announcement ?
A : All of the larger systems vendors , in my view , including HP , IBM , Microsoft , Sun and so on .
For every week or month they delay their own cloud computing strategies , their losing developers that – particularly in the case of Google – they may never get back .
Besides the vendors , languages other than Python may take a hit .
Not permanent , particularly as Google has promised to support languages other than Python on App Engine in the future , but I ’ve already spoken with a few developers that are either porting or considering porting various assets to Python .
For example , here ’s Alex on the subject :
While I ’m not going to run out and rewrite all of my PHP products in Python , I ’ve already mentally re-architected a component of MyFreeBusy that we probably will rewrite in Python so that it can leverage GAE to scale .
Another idea that I ’ve had for a service that has been backburnered for a while is probably going to be written in Python instead of PHP so that we can roll it out on GAE .
None of this spells wholesale departures , of course , but it unquestionably means that Python is a far more formidable competitor than it was on Sunday .
Q : What was the controversy around one of the initial sample applications , Huddle Chat ?
A : As John Gruber noted , Huddle Chat effectively cloned the 37 Signals application Campfire :
HuddleChat is just a feature - for - feature clone of 37signals ’s Campfire .
The layout is the same , the tabs at the top of the screen are the same , the right - side sidebar listing participants and file uploads is the same .
It even copies Campfire ’s trick of formatting a message as “ code ” if it contains literal newline characters .
As he went on to conclude , it ’s one thing to borrow ideas , it ’s another to precisely replicate an entire interface , as I ’ve written before .
Fortunately , the potential for distraction was ended when Google offlined Huddle Chat , leaving the following message in its place :
Hi , a couple of our colleagues wrote Huddle Chat in their spare time as a sample application for other developers to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Google App Engine .
We ’ve heard some complaints from the developer community about it and because of that we ’ve decided to take it down .
If you ’d like to see more sample applications written on Google App Engine please check out our documentation and our App Gallery .
Apparently not everyone agrees with the decision , but personally I think it ’s appropriate .
Q : Considering the above , if you were in a developer ’s shoes , would you or would you not consider hosting on App Engine ?
A : Consider it ?
Of course .
If your application is written in Python or not yet written , I think you ’ be foolish not to consider it .
Even I downloaded Mark Pilgrim ’s Dive Into Python this afternoon .
But as for the decision process on whether or not to host there , I ’d consider my own skillset and language preference , the resources available to me , the risks of lock - in , the need and difficulty of scaling .
Depending on how you answer weight the above , App Engine may or may not be a good option for you .
Consider Adrian Holovaty ’s EveryBlock .
Adrian , one of the creators of the Django framework and a noted advocate of Python , would on a first pass seem to be an ideal candidate for App Engine .
While it ’s mere speculation , based on the infrastructure of his earlier and similar Chicagocrime.org project , my guess is that Adrian is building EveryBlock off of PostgreSQL but more specifically PostGIS .
If that ’s true , that portion of the application at least would be ineligible for Google ’s cloud platform .
Just a few paragraphs prior , of course , we heard Alex talk about rearchitecting an existing application in just such a fashion .
Whether or Google ’s offering is right for you , then , is a complicated question with no easy answers .
Q : With two or maybe three major and several smaller cloud based initiatives now in place , what are the remaining opportunities for late - market entrants ?
A : Being first to market in cloud computing is a significant advantage , because inertia is as much a friend to Amazon , Google et al in the cloud as it is to Windows on the desktop .
That said , all of the current offerings have limitations that throttle their usage .
Many of which are related to the lack of open standards .
Apart from the mostly standard Python implementation , App Engine is decidedly non-standard .
Even Amazon Machine Images are uniquely packaged to that platform .
My general recommendation for potential cloud computing players is to seek opportunities to conflate cloud computing with virtualization .
It should , but is not , be straightforward for potential cloud computing customers to package running instances into snapshots that can be seamlessly deployed on competing cloud computing environments .
The technical capabilities are widely available and utilized , but not – typically – within the clouds .
If I were a vendor looking for an opportunity to differentiate , then , that ’s where I would start .
Q : What ’s the most interesting aspect of the App Engine announcement that you have n’t seen discussed ?
A : That no one has so much as mentioned operating systems when discussing it .
Disclosure : IBM , Microsoft and Sun are RedMonk customers , while Amazon , Google , and HP are not .
Joyent is not a RedMonk customer , but hosts a personal site of mine gratis .
Rights recently signed up by producer Erwin Stoff ( Matrix , A Scanner Darkly )
The IFMagazine.com entertainment website reports that film producer Erwin Stoff ( The Matrix , A Scanner Darkly ) is developing a live - action adaptation of Sunrise 's Cowboy Bebop multi - genre action anime series for Fox .
Stoff told the website that the project is " in the really early stages " since the parties " just signed it the other day . "
Shinichiro Watanabe 's original anime follows the motley crew of the spaceship Bebop as it travels throughout the solar system in search of the next job .
Stoff promised " a real degree of faithfulness , " and added , “ When I met with them in Japan , one of the first things that I brought up was the experience that we had on A Scanner Darkly , and how hard we worked to remain faithful to Philip K. Dick , and that was our big concern here . ”
The anime distributor Bandai Entertainment and Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim programming block released the original 1998 television series in the United States , and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the subsequent 2001 animated movie .
The anime was also adapted into two separate manga series , and Tokyopop released both manga series in North America .
A Bandai Entertainment representative was unable to publicly comment on this report .
Thank you to Meghan Grant and Starks for the news tips .
End of Life for PHP 4 08 Aug 2008
Today is 8/8/8 , which is interesting for a few reasons , one of which is that it marks the end of PHP 4 .
What does this mean ?
It means yesterday 's release of 4.4.9 is the final release of PHP 4 .
More information can be gleaned from the mailing list archives , beginning with Derick 's request to drop support :
I am trying to gauge what people feel about dropping support for PHP 4 at the end of this year .
Derick caveated his suggestion with the idea of continuing to publish new releases that address security vulnerabilities .
Rasmus did n't see the point :
I do n't really understand what dropping support means if we will still release security fixes .
That 's the mode we have been in for at least a year , so what would change at the end of the year ?
He suggested a stronger stance :
I 'd be more in favour of a statement that put a final death date on it which means no new releases of any sort .
We could still say security - fixes only by the end of the year and then death by 08/08/08 or something like that .
So , here we are .
PHP 4 is dead .
Long live PHP .
Nevius :
Most homeless have city - funded home
A long overdue civil grand jury report released Wednesday says that the city should be proud of getting over 4,000 homeless people into housing since 2004 but distressed at the scene on the streets .
Panhandling , public drunkenness and street loitering are still an unpleasant reality downtown .
The mayor and others are now admitting what the grand jury reported - that a majority of those on the streets are not homeless .
The head of the city 's homeless program , Dariush Kayhan , estimates that 50 to 75 percent of street people live in supportive housing .
" We just warehouse addicts , " said the grand jury 's Stuart Smith .
" Granted , it is a nicer place for them , but it does n't address the problem . "
In short , the jury is reflecting the views of many San Franciscans who made the choice to live here .
They understood that housing and taxes would be higher , and so would the cost of a meal in a restaurant .
They understand and believe that the city needs to provide for its poorest homeless residents and do n't begrudge what the grand jury says is $ 186 million a year in city funds spent to finance homeless programs .
But , they ask , ca n't someone stop the panhandling ?
And , given all the programs and services , is it unreasonable to ask those who are being given supportive housing to start making some effort to be self - sufficient ?
" People 's conduct has to be held to account , " Supervisor Bevan Dufty said .
" They can't engage in conduct that is hurtful to them or others . "
Enforcing that is easier said than done .
But it does begin the dialogue .
" I think the grand jury did an excellent job , " Kayhan said .
" We got people into housing , but we acknowledge that it is now time to make the next step , moving on to jobs , treatment and schools . "
The tough part , as always , is how to do that .
" I understand that the public is frustrated , " said Jeff Kositsky , executive director of the Community Housing Partnership , which has over 950 residents in supportive housing .
" But it is easy to demonize people when you do n't know them . "
Advocates like Kositsky are entering the dialogue , but not just to rail against change .
" We appreciate the need to innovate , " Kositsky said .
" We 're all looking for new ideas . "
If that 's the case , the grand jury has a report for you .
It begins with the money , pointing out that the city is now spending $ 186 million a year on homelessness , six times what was spent in 1993 - 94 .
" Are we getting the most bang for our buck ? " Kayhan asked .
" I agree that we are at a place now where we would like to see the cost effectiveness of our programs . "
Hardly a week goes by without a note or e-mail from a tourist who was shocked by behaviors and conditions downtown .
When San Franciscans supported Mayor Gavin Newsom 's " Care Not Cash " effort in 2004 , many felt that getting the homeless into housing would solve the problem .
The fact is , despite a supportive housing effort that has gotten national attention , the streets do n't seem that much better .
And there does n't seem to be a standard of measurement for what the programs are trying to accomplish .
The grand jury members say they were told that " expectations were unnecessarily low for supportive housing patrons " and that at present the measure of success is whether or not residents stay in the housing .
Not surprisingly , over 90 percent do .
But how many of them are panhandling every afternoon ?
" We understand very clearly that we need to take a close look at what is happening on the streets , " Kayhan said .
" We are currently holding meetings on that , and I would say that we would have three or four pilot programs , based on what 's worked in other cities , ready to go before the end of the calendar year . "
Another thought is the Community Justice Center , a proposed special court targeted at those who repeatedly commit street crimes .
The supervisors initially turned the idea down , but it is clearly gaining momentum .
On Wednesday , Supervisor Jake McGoldrick became a supporter and Supervisor Sean Elsbernd , also a supporter , says he expects it to pass in a landslide if it goes to the ballot in November .
" The only question is whether it will be 75 percent or 85 percent , " he said .
Another innovative idea comes from Randy Shaw , executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic .
His group has been using " step - up " units as an incentive for residents who lived in start - up supportive housing and have made the effort to get their lives on the right track .
The reward is apartment - style housing without a need for in - house counselors .
" We 've run these for over five years , " Shaw said .
" They are a proven success .
And the advantage is that the cost is so much lower because they do n't need support services . "
In all , these sound like encouraging ideas with some popular support .
But let 's remember , it is still San Francisco .
Asked if it was possible to raise the standard of conduct for city - supported residents , one political insider wished supporters the best of luck .
" We ca n't get the Board of Supervisors to pass a code of conduct for themselves , " he said , " let alone for the homeless . "
Considering how little attention the PS3's motion - sensing functionality currently receives , we 're not inclined to think that Sony 's making an even deeper push into the Wii 's territory , but a site called Playstation Lifestyle says that Sony conducted focus - group testing on a controller similar to the Wiimote earlier this year .
Apparently the device was mounted on a foot - tall mini-tripod , and was demoed with tennis , fencing , and paintball mini-games , as well as used to play Quake on a laptop .
That 's not to say that Sony 's ever going to bring this stuff to market , but it would certainly be interesting if it did -- and coupled with those persistent Xbox 360 remote rumors , the gaming landscape could suddenly be overrun with people miming tennis .

Did the McCain campaign do any research on Sarah Palin ?
Talk to anyone in the state ?
Even do a google search ?
Apparently not .
Check out this hometown smack down :
State Senate President Lyda Green said she thought it was a joke when someone called her at 6 a.m. to give her the news .
“ She ’s not prepared to be governor .
How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ? ” said Green , a Republican from Palin ’s hometown of Wasilla .
“ Look at what she ’s done to this state .
What would she do to the nation ? ”
All politics is local .
Palin does n’t like State Senate President Lyda Green .
Palin laughed out loud when a radio talk show host called Green a “ bitch ” — and a “ cancer ” ( Green is a cancer survivor ) :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKkydrUnBZE]
Now , if Palin had been vetted by the McCain campaign , some of this stuff might have come up .
But , McCain is erratic and impulsive .
It was more important for McCain to “ win ” the news cycle than pick a v.p. who was qualified .
She replaces Dan Abrams .
Just in time for the closing rush of the presidential election , MSNBC is shaking up its prime - time programming lineup , removing the long - time host -- and one - time general manager of the network - Dan Abrams from his 9 p.m. program and replacing him with Rachel Maddow , who has emerged as a favored political commentator for the all - news cable channel .
The moves , which were confirmed by MSNBC executives Tuesday , are expected to be finalized by Wednesday , with Mr. Abrams 's last program on Thursday .
After MSNBC 's extensive coverage of the two political conventions during the next two weeks , Ms. Maddow will begin her program on Sept. 8 .
MSNBC is highlighting the date , 9/8/08 , connecting it to the start of the Olympics on 8/8/08 , as a way to signal what the network 's president , Phil Griffin , said " will be the final leg of the political race this year . "
He added , " We making that Rachel 's debut . "
Another Critical Mass ride , another stunning display of police brutality .
Watch as one of New York 's finest violently shoves a cyclist off his bicycle , launching him through the air to the curb at 46th street and Seventh Avenue during Friday night 's monthly Critical Mass ride .
Although a judge ruled in 2006 that the monthly Critical Mass bicycle rides could proceed without a permit , the NYPD 's stance remains somewhat adversarial .
Though the city has not been enforcing the controversial parade permit law when it comes to Critical Mass , police have been ticketing cyclists during the ride for such infractions as not having the required lights .
A representative for TIMES UP !
tells us that the cyclist in this video was arrested , held for 26 hours , and charged with attempted assault and resisting arrest .
One other cyclist was ticketed Friday night for riding outside the bike lane , which is not actually illegal and often necessary , considering how popular bike lanes are for double parking .
UPDATE : MyFoxNY has it that the police officer in the video – 22 - year - old Patrick Pogan – has been stripped of his badge and gun and the NYPD has " placed the officer on desk duty pending the outcome of a department investigation . "
The cyclist , Christopher Long , has not commented , but his lawyer said , " The video speaks for itself . "
UPDATE 7/29 : More details here , including how Officer Pogan is apparently a third - generation cop and Long is described as an Army veteran who works as a grocer at the Union Square Green Market .
NORTH CANTON , Ohio 
A simple change to the design of the gallon milk jug , adopted by Wal - Mart and Costco , seems made for the times .
The jugs are cheaper to ship and better for the environment , the milk is fresher when it arrives in stores , and it costs less .
What ’s not to like ?
Plenty , as it turns out .
The jugs have no real spout , and their unorthodox shape makes consumers feel like novices at the simple task of pouring a glass of milk .
“ I hate it , ” said Lisa DeHoff , a cafe owner shopping in a Sam ’s Club here .
“ It spills everywhere , ” said Amy Wise , a homemaker .
“ It ’s very hard for kids to pour , ” said Lee Morris , who was shopping for her grandchildren .
But retailers are undeterred by the prospect of upended bowls of Cheerios .
The new jugs have many advantages from their point of view , and Sam ’s Club intends to roll them out broadly , making them more prevalent .

July 20th , 2008
I have no idea what to make of this one .
All of the sites I was able to find that reference this stockpile assume that it has something to do with an upcoming American holocaust and martial law , etc .
Again , I have no idea .
Let ’s try to work trough this one a bit …
First of all , what are they ?
The product is called a “ Burial Vault . ”
They are made by PolyGuard Vaults .
Their website describes the product as follows :
A Burial Vault is an outside receptacle or container , in which the casket and remains are placed , at the time of burial .
This helps to maintain the above ground aesthetics of the grave site .
Polyguard Burial Vaults are now manufactured using an injection moulding process , and constructed of non-biodegradable , water and chemical resistant polymers .
So , they ’re not coffins , but liners in which coffins would be placed before burial .
I did some more research to determine if the government did business with PolyGuard Vaults .
Indeed , the U.S. Veterans Administration has been buying Burial Vaults from PolyGuard Vaults for years .
Use fedspending .org to look up the contracts .
Click the Contracts tab and type in Polyguard .
You can go back to the year 2000 .
When you use the Level of Detail : Complete ( all information ) setting , this will show more detail .
In the “ Contract Description ” fields you ’ll see : THERMOPLASTIC GRAVELINERS .
So , it seems to make sense that the VA would be buying these things …
Here ’s a reference with regard to casket burials in a cemetery in Hawaii .
This is from the Aloha Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America :
Casket burials now require Polyguard Burial Vault at a cost of $ 220 for family members and no charge for the Retiree , Veteran or Active Duty personnel .
The vaults were required to prevent the burial site from settling and collapsing following the burial .
Anyone looking into this situation in Georgia might find the VA contracts and just think , “ Yep , the VA bought them , nothing to see here . ”
An interesting question would be : How many units did the VA get ?
I have n’t been able to determine that .
If we knew that , we ’d be able figure out roughly how many casket burials were happening at VA run cemeteries vs. how many Burial Vaults were ordered .
If there was a large difference , well , we would have a pretty good idea of where the extra units went …
Where are they ?
They are in a field near Madison , Georgia , just off of Lion ’s Club Road and next to ( as far as I can tell ) a Fowler Flemister Concrete plant .
See coordinates : +33° 33 ′ 57.36 ″ , - 83° 29 ′ 6.26 ″ .
I ’ll host a local screen shot of the map above , just in case Google decides to disappear it .
Here ’s a video taken at the site :
How many ?
I tried to figure out a way to count them , but I could n’t do it .
I felt like my estimates could easily be off by an order of magnitude .
To say that it ’s tens of thousands is probably conservative .
Who owns the land ?
I have n’t been able to figure that out .
The legend that I keep running across is that a private individual leased the land to FEMA .
I suppose that ’s possible , or it could be absolute nonsense .
I do n’t know .
With all of the U.S. Government ’s vast land holdings and facilities , FEMA leased this field from someone to store these Burial Vaults ???
Again , I suppose that anything is possible .
If these Burial Vaults do belong to FEMA , that would be very interesting .
I went through all of the government contracts with PolyGuard going back to 2000 and FEMA has n’t done any ( on the books ) business with them .
Since 2000 , the government contracts that went to PolyGuard were all awarded by the VA .
Why ?
That ’s the question .
I have no idea and I have n’t found any good guesses either .
The consensus on the foil sites is that these Burial Vaults are to be used in the aftermath of some kind of false flag attack or holocaust / final solution situation .
Initially , I thought the same thing , but when I thought about it more carefully , would n’t FEMA just stockpile body bags ?
The anonymous comments on some sites say that it ’s probably related to contingency planning for a natural disaster .
Again , would n’t FEMA just stockpile body bags ?
One thing that I have n’t seen mentioned anywhere is how much money is represented by this Burial Vault stockpile .
The newsletter above puts the cost at $ 220 .
I have not been able to determine what the government pays , per unit , but let ’s not even assume that $ 220 is the cost .
Let ’s say it ’s just $ 100 each .
At that rate , ten thousand units would be worth $ 1 million .
So , there ’s easily several million dollars worth of inventory sitting in that field .
To the imbeciles who suggest that this is some sort of routine private inventory for a mortuary business ( yes , I have seen people suggesting that ) :
There is A ) no way that a mortuary company would spend millions of dollars for so many of these at once and B ) no way that a mortuary company would leave them sitting unguarded in a field for years .
I ’d love for someone to provide a This - Is - Normal - There ’s- Nothing - To - See - Here explanation , but so far , I have n’t been able to find such an explanation .
One last thing :
This is n’t a new story
Infowars just posted this story and that ’s where I saw it , but the earliest reference that I can find to this was from 2006 .
ATS has a thread from December 2007 that covers this situation .

Despite its obvious lack of an oversized touchscreen interface , Nokia wins points for a remarkably trim profile ( 10 mm vs. 12.3 mm ) , decent 3.2 - megapixel camera ( instead of 2.0 ) , and the fact it ’s not tied to any carrier ( yet ) .
Most of all , we ’re stoked they avoided the overcrowded iClone bandwagon by sticking to what they do best : gorgeous hardware packed with a satisfying range of fun( ctional ) features .
Setting up Nokia ’s Mail for Exchange program required no IT help or time .
QuickOffice let us create , edit and send Word / Excel / PowerPoint files on the fly while we browsed PDFs with Adobe Acrobat Reader .
The E71 is stocked with enough apps and goodies to keep even the most overworked road warrior on the ball , but it did n’t feel too “ business . ”
That ’s mostly due to the fact that the E71 has two separate customizable home screens .
One is designed to house all of your work apps like Excel and PowerPoint while the other is geared more towards entertainment with programs for audio , video and gaming .
Switching between the two is dead simple , a dedicated button at the top of the menu lets you toggle between the two screens instantly .
The phone ’s 2.36 - inch , 320 x 240 QVGA display is only slightly smaller than the iPod Classic ’s , and though the resolution can’t top the iPhone ’s , with 15 fps , the E71 is still solid for YouTube clips .
The slightly rejiggered QWERTY took some getting used to ( the Q - A - Z keys are flush with the chassis ) , but the learning curve was significantly faster than any touchscreen we ’ve tapped :
After three days of iPhoning , typos were relatively common .
After three hours with the E71 , they ’re pretty much nonexistent .
Oh , and did we mention the E71 ’s got battery life for days ?
Yes , literally three of them .

Ashcroft bank accused of diverting £ 5 m aid for poor of Belize to its own coffers
Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is facing claims that a bank he controls in Belize ‘ diverted ’ £ 5 million intended to help the country ’s poor to its own coffers .
The money was a gift from Venezuela to the tiny Central American nation , where the controversial Tory donor ’s multi-million business empire is based .
According to the Belize government , half of it arrived but the rest vanished .
It was later revealed that the funds had been routed , via London ,
to the Belize Bank Limited , ( BBL ) owned by one of Lord Ashcroft ’s holding companies .
Powerful : Lord Ashcroft with his wife Suzie at a New York reception
The bank says it is keeping the £ 5 million because , it argues , it is repayment of a debt guaranteed by the impoverished country ’s former prime minister , Said Musa .
But the current administration claims Mr Musa acted without authorisation from his national assembly .
It says the money was meant to pay for housing for low - income families and is suing BBL to get it .
At a hearing at Belize ’s Supreme Court on Friday , Chief Justice Abdulai Conteh said he will rule in the next few days on whether the dispute – dubbed by lawyers ‘ the case of the missing millions ’ – should go before a special tribunal .
Protesters march through Belize city demanding the return of the money
The Mail on Sunday has been told by a highly - placed source that a complaint to police about how the funds were allegedly appropriated by BBL is also imminent .
‘ Once that complaint is made the authorities will be automatically obliged to mount a criminal investigation , ’ said the source .
The government ’s lawyer , Lois Barrow Young , told The Mail on Sunday : ‘ We have said that the money was diverted but my view is that , basically , this is plain and simple theft of money .
‘ The money was transferred to BBL ’s Bank of America account in London , where it was held for a few weeks , and on the account statement it says all the money was for the Government of Belize for housing repairs and construction . ’
Protesters reach the Bank of Belize where they air their grievances
It is unclear what role , if any , Lord Ashcroft played in the affair , but it is already proving embarrassing for him .
In Belize , formerly British Honduras , where the peer also owns a TV station , a telecommunications company and hotels , the dispute has caused widespread anger and prompted a public demonstration .
It was organised by a pressure group called the Committee to Oust Lord Ashcroft , which believes their country is seen by the billionaire entrepreneur as his personal fiefdom .
More than 300 people , including politicians , marched on BBL ’s offices in Belize City , a mile from the 62 - year - old tycoon ’s seafront home .
Organiser Evan
Hyde said the protest was ‘ about getting back the money that belongs to the people of Belize ’ .
He added : ‘ There are many people who believe Lord Ashcroft has become a pervasive influence in politics and the economy here .
He has become too big a fish in too small a pond .
‘ He was close to Mr Musa and to a great extent Musa facilitated Lord Ashcroft ’s rise .
There has been no control over the way he has been allowed to dominate our country . ’
The Belize Bank controversy revolves around an unremarkable - looking
private hospital on the outskirts of Belize City , established by a company called Universal Health Services ( UHS ) .
To finance the project the company borrowed large sums from both the government and BBL in 1998 and continued to do so over the following six years .
By December 2004 UHS owed BBL £ 7.7 million and Mr Musa stepped in and agreed to guarantee repayment of all UHS ’s obligations to the bank .
Crucially , court documents show that the guarantee was not made public and Mr Musa did not inform his cabinet .
Further funds were then released to UHS and the debts continued to pile up .
Then a new deal was drawn up between the BBL and the government in March last year in which Musa promised to start paying back the debt .
But he failed to secure the approval of his national assembly , breaching financial legislation , say lawyers .
Meanwhile , details of the first agreement became public and shortly afterwards the 2007 deal was also revealed .
Legal action was taken to prevent the government paying BBL back , with lawyers arguing that the first deal should have been taken to cabinet
and the second violated the country ’s finance act .
Meanwhile , BBL maintained it was still entitled to its money .
But the government ’s solicitor general undertook not to make any payments until the legal action was concluded .
By the end of 2007 Mr Musa was facing the prospect of election defeat the following February .
He needed money if he was to stand any chance and he went cap in hand to Taiwan and Venezuela , both friendly to Belize .
Court documents show that on December 28 the Central Bank of Belize received $ 10 million from Venezuela for housing and a sports stadium .
But the gift failed to secure Mr Musa ’s re-election and on February 7 a new prime minister , Dean Barrow , was installed .
The following day the new administration received a letter from the Venezuelan government asking for ‘ an accounting ’ of its $ 20 million gift .
‘ We thought there had been a typing error , ’ said government lawyer Michael Young .
‘ Up until this point it was assumed the gift was for 10 not 20 million .
It was astonishing . ’
So what happened to the missing $ 10 million ?
Court papers show that instead of going to the Central Bank of Belize it was transferred on December 28 by Venezuela ’s Bank of Economic and Social Development to Belize Bank ’s account – numbered 68332015 – with Bank of America in London .
The transfer contained the instructions ‘ Single disbursement [ to ] GOB ( the Government of Belize ) for construction and repair of housing ’ .
On January 24 , the money was transferred to an account held with BBL in the Turks and Caicos islands , where Lord Ashcroft is a ‘ belonger ’ or citizen .
Ms Barrow Young said a contract between Mr Musa ’s government and Venezuela clearly says the $ 20 million gift was meant for ‘ a programme of construction and the repairs of housing for low - income persons . ’
She added : ‘ There is much poverty here and the money was desperately needed . ’
Mark Espat , a minister under Mr Musa who lost his cabinet job for opposing the guarantee , said money was ‘ diverted from its intended purpose to honour a debt that should never have been agreed in the first place ’ .
On April 10 , the government sued BBL for the return of $ 10 million ( £ 5 million ) .
In a direct swipe at his predecessor Mr Barrow told the national assembly later that month that ‘ the days of doing things in the dark behind the backs of the Belizean people in order to screw the Belizean people are over ’ .
Philip Johnson , the chairman of Belize Bank , told The Mail on Sunday in a
letter : ‘ I am not in a position to discuss this matter with you in detail as it is the subject of arbitration proceedings ...
' [ However ] the allegation by Ms Lois Barrow Young that there was a “ diversion ” or “ theft ” of funds is simply untrue and baseless .
‘ UHS owed the bank very substantial sums that had been advanced in part
at least in reliance upon a guarantee by the Government of Belize .
That guarantee was signed by the then Prime Minister of Belize in his capacity as
the Minister of Finance and witnessed by the then Attorney General of Belize .
‘ The bank believes that guarantee was lawful and valid and only committed to further funding of UHS on that basis . ’
Mr Musa could not be contacted last night .
A spokesman for Lord Ashcroft declined to respond to questions .
He said : ‘ It is a Belize Bank matter . ’
The billionaire peer haunted by controversy
Lord Ashcroft , who has given the Tories more than £ 2.5 million since 2003 , spent part of his youth in Belize – his father was a colonial civil servant – and later returned
to base some of his business activities there .
He holds dual UK and Belize nationality .
And it is his association with the country , squeezed between Mexico and Guatemala , which has been at the heart of many of the controversies that have shadowed his career .
In Britain he was seen to pay too little income tax due to his domicile there .
Recently ,
Tory attacks on Labour over its party funding scandal were met with counter claims about the peer ’s tax status .
His elevation to the peerage , which was heavily criticised by Labour , was approved only after he promised to take up permanent residence in the UK .
But he persistently refused to say if he had done so – only relenting earlier this year after Conservative leader David Cameron summoned him to a face - to - face meeting and insisted he clarify his position .
By yesterday 's debate 13 amendments had been put forward , many of which called for much tougher safeguards such as the creation of entirely new " men only " dioceses to look after those across the country who did not want to be led by a woman bishop , or a new class of " super bishop " to minister to traditionalists in their existing dioceses .
As Democrats celebrate in Denver next week , Republican presumptive presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain will be trying to fire up some star power of his own by collecting checks and support from conservatives in Hollywood .
Mr. McCain will attend a fundraiser at the Beverly Hilton on Monday , the day the Democrats ’ convention opens , bringing together top leaders from the Los Angeles business and entertainment communities , according to an invitation for the event obtained by The Washington Times .
Show business publication Variety reported that Angie Harmon , David Zucker , Jon Cryer , Lionel Chetwynd , Craig T. Nelson , Jon Voight , Craig Haffner and Robert Duvall are among those expected to attend .
Tickets start at $ 500 for those 35 or younger , and $ 1,000 for everyone else .
As usual at these events , those who give more get more time with Mr. McCain , and chances for private photos with him .
Several of the expected attendees did not return calls from The Times seeking comment , but Variety said some of the stars are expected to go to the Republicans ’ nominating convention the week after , in St. Paul , Minn .
A Republican Party operative said on the condition of anonymity that the hope is the celebrities will drive up attendance and interest in the fundraiser and in the McCain message .
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the event is meant to attract a wide swath of Los Angeles supporters , not just the Hollywood glitter .
“ We ´re proud to have such a broad cross-section of support in the Los Angeles area from people who share the firm belief that John McCain is the best prepared leader to move America forward , ” he said .
Conservatives in Hollywood have slowly been joining the political fray this year .
Last month , The Times reported that Hollywood figures , organized by Gary Sinise and others , have been meeting in a loose - knit network dedicated to supporting U.S. troops and traditional American values .
And Mr. Voight wrote an op - ed arguing that an Obama presidency would mean “ we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before , and our country will be weakened in every way . ”
According to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics ’ OpenSecrets.org , employees in the entertainment industries of TV , movies and music have contributed $ 4.7 million to Sen.
Barack Obama , dwarfing the $ 838,101 to Mr. McCain .
That figure includes contributions from media bosses such as Jerry Bruckheimer , who is listed as one of the co-chairs of Monday ’s event .
Mr. McCain angered some of the Hollywood set when his campaign began running a television commercial earlier this year comparing Mr. Obama to celebrities Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
Miss Hilton ’s mother , a McCain donor , was harshly critical , and Miss Hilton herself made a well - received video response spoofing both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama .
And the Los Angeles Times reported that some in Hollywood thought Mr. McCain a bit hypocritical since eight years ago , in his primary battle with then - Texas Gov. George W. Bush , he was considered the darling of Hollywood .

Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute graduating senior Jeffery Martin has put his basic knowledge of sugars to exceptional use by creating a lab - on - a - chip device that builds complex , highly specialized sugar molecules , mimicking one of the most important cellular structures in the human body - the Golgi Apparatus .
Among the most important and complex molecules in the human body , sugars control not just metabolism but also how cells communicate with one another .
Cells build sugars in a cellular organelle known as the Golgi Apparatus .
Under a microscope , the Golgi looks similar to a stack of pancakes .
The strange - looking organelle finishes the process of protein synthesis by decorating the proteins with highly specialized arrangements of sugars .
The final sugar - coated molecule is then sent out into the cell to aid in cell communication and to help determine the cell ’s function in the body .
Martin ’s artificial Golgi functions in a surprisingly similar way to the natural Golgi , but he gives the ancient organelle a very high - tech makeover .
His chip looks similar to a miniature checker board where sugars , enzymes , and other basic cell materials are suspended in water and can be transported and mixed by applying electric currents to the destination squares on the checker board .
Through this process sugars can be built in an automated fashion where they are exposed to a variety of enzymes found in the natural Golgi .
The resulting sugars can then be tested on living cells either on the chip or in the lab to determine their effects .
With the chip ’s ability to process many combinations of sugars and enzymes , it could help researchers quickly uncover new sugar - based drugs , according to Martin .
“ Almost completely independently he has been able to come closer than researchers with decades more experience to creating an artificial Golgi , ” said Robert Linhardt , the Ann and John H. Broadbent Jr. ’ 59 Senior Constellation Professor of Biocatalysis and Metabolic Engineering at Rensselaer and Martin ’s adviser .
“ He saw a problem in the drug discovery process and almost instantly devised a way to solve it . ”
Scientists have known for years that certain sugars can serve as extremely beneficial therapeutics for humans .
One well - known example is heparin , which is among the most widely used drugs in the world .
Heparin is formed naturally in the Golgi organelle in cells of the human body as well as in other animals like pigs .
Heparin acts as an anticoagulant preventing blood clots , which makes it a good therapeutic for heart , stroke , and dialysis patients .
The main source of heparin is currently the intestines of foreign livestock and , as recent news reports highlight , the risk of contamination from such sources is high .
So researchers are working around the clock to develop a safer , man -made alternative to the drug that will prevent outside contamination .
A synthetic alternative would build the sugar from scratch , helping eliminate the possibility of contamination he explained .
“ I am very grateful to have the privilege of working with Dr. Linhardt who has discovered the recipe to make fully synthetic heparin , ” Martin said .
“ Because we know the recipe , I am going to use it as a model to test the device .
If our artificial Golgi can build fully functional heparin , we can then use the artificial organelle to produce many different sugar variants by altering the combination of enzymes used to synthesize them .
Another great thing about these devices is that they are of microscale size , so that if needed we could fill an entire room with them to increase throughput for drug discovery . ”
There are millions of possible sugar combinations that can be formed and scientists currently only know the function of very few of them like heparin .
“ Since it is known that these types of sugars play a part in many important biological processes such as cell growth , cell differentiation , blood coagulation , and viral defense mechanisms , we feel that that this artificial Golgi will help our team to develop a next generation of sugar - based drugs , known as glycotheraputics , ” Martin said .
“ We are going to start making new combinations and we simply do n’t know what we are going to find .
We could find a sugar whose signal blocks the spread of cancer cells or initiates the differentiation of stem cells .
We just do n’t know . ”
But Mr. Blasko and other experts said that because the military did not have heavy - lift helicopters , vital equipment like excavators and cranes had to be brought in on roads obstructed by landslides , slowing the pace of the rescue operations .
Shen Dingli , a leading security expert at Fudan University in Shanghai , said the military ’s response did not reflect well on the military ’s preparedness for a potential war with , say , Taiwan , the independently governed island that China claims as its sovereign territory .
China ’s air force deployed 6,500 paratroopers to Sichuan , but only 15 ended up dropping into the disaster zone , military officials said , because of bad weather and forbidding mountain terrain .
Mr. Shen called the effort too little and too late .
“ The air force should have been able to get troops into Wenchuan in two hours , ” he said , referring to a county near the quake ’s epicenter .
“ It took 44 hours .
If it took them 10 hours , that ’s understandable .
But 44 hours is shameful . ”

Allan Behm , a former official in Australia ’s Defense Ministry , said the Chinese military was evidently still focused on conventional warfare rather than engineering skills .
In spite of its efforts to modernize , Mr. Behm said , “ the P.L.A. is still built on the idea of bringing hundreds of thousands of troops into the battle area . ”
China has often deployed the P.L.A. , along with a separate paramilitary force , the People ’s Armed Police , to respond to natural disasters , social unrest and other domestic security issues .
Tai Ming Cheung , a senior fellow at the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego , said that in addition to preparing for a possible conflict with Taiwan , China was “ focused on projecting power inside its borders , to ensure social stability . ”
In January , P.L.A. units from southwestern China ’s Chengdu Military Region were deployed to southern areas hit by heavy snowstorms .
In March , they were transferred to Tibetan regions of western Sichuan to pacify antigovernment protesters .
Then , in May , the earthquake hit , and they came down from the Tibetan plateau to rescue people buried under collapsed buildings .
If you have never encountered OpenGL , then you might not be aware of the fact that it is an excellent 3D graphics API and an absolute pleasure to work with .
One caveat however is that setting up your application to use OpenGL can be ... kind of painful .
The struggle comes from the fact that each GUI library handles the OpenGL rendering context slightly differently and some GUIs require various tricks .
Also initializing the viewport can be done in several different ways and getting it right ( while trying to hack some code together ) can also be painful , especially if you have to recompile every time you change something .
PyOpenGL , as the name implies , is the Pythonic OpenGL API .
If you have OpenGL experience but have never used PyOpenGL you should take the time to read the PyOpenGL for OpenGL Programmers tutorial .
Although you can pretty much write C OpenGL in Python the PyOpenGL package also provides a nicer more python oriented interface for the OGL API .
3.1 Use the Pythonic functions A large portion of the PyOpenGL API has pythonic wrappers , try to use those functions instead of the ones you are used to in C , this will make your code cleaner and therefore easier to understand and debug .
Look at PyOpenGL for OpenGL Programmers and the PyOpenGL doc pages to see exactly which calls are pythonic .
For example you can call glGenTexture with one argument , the number of texture IDs you want , and it will return either a single integer based texture id or a list of texture IDs .
You can also call it the standard way , initializing an ID and providing it to the function .
Another example is you can call glVertexPointer the C way providing the necessary arguments or use the pythonic glVertexPointer [ f|b|i| ] set and only providing an array of the given type .
3.2 Zero is not NULL Some OpenGL calls require a pointer to a data buffer , and sometimes you must call these functions with a NULL pointer .
In C/ C+ + it is perfectly legal to do the following : # 's 1 glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , buffer )
2 glVertexPointer ( 3 , GL_FLOAT , 0 , 0 )
but in Python you have to do this : # 's 1 glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , buffer )
2 glVertexPointer ( 3 , GL_FLOAT , 0 , None )
3.3 NumPy array data type
When creating NumPy arrays you do n't normally have to specify the data type , it will automatically be inferred from the content .
However on a 64 bit machine NumPy seems to automatically make floats into float64s which are actually doubles .
Surely you can already see the problem with this , you are telling OGL that you are giving it an array of 256 floats , but instead it gets 128 doubles ... the result is something like this :
That is supposed to be a solid cube , surrounded with a wireframe cube Specifying the data type for a numpy array can be done using the dtype parameter to the array function : # 's 1 a = array ( [ 0.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 ] , dtype = float32 )
3.4 Generating Buffers Sometimes you would need to generate some buffers , for example using the glGenBuffers VBO call or the old version of the glGenTextures texture generation call .
In this case you must define the variable beforehand and initialize it to the correct type : # 's 1 buffer = 0
2 glGenTextures ( 1 , buffer )
3
4 # Sometimes you need the exact data type like above :
5 from OpenGL.raw import GL
6 buffer = GL .
GLuint ( 0 )
7 glGenBuffers ( 1 , buffer )
3.5 Loading Image Textures
Although there are plenty of good imaging libraries for C/C+ +
I doubt that any of them are as easy to use as the Python Image Library ( PIL ) .
Although PIL 's commercially licensed version has an OpenGL Image interface , with the free version in order to load an image as a texture you can do something like : # 's 1 import Image
2 img = Image . open ( ' some_img.png ' ) # .jpg , .bmp , etc. also work
3 img_data = numpy .
array ( list ( img . getdata ( ) ) , numpy . int8 )
4
5 texture = glGenTextures ( 1 )
6 glPixelStorei ( GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT
, 1 )
7 glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , texture )
8 glTexParameterf ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S , GL_CLAMP )
9 glTexParameterf ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T
, GL_CLAMP )
10 glTexParameterf ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER , GL_LINEAR )
11 glTexParameterf ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER , GL_LINEAR )
12 glTexImage2D ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , 0 , GL_RGB , img . size [ 0 ] , img . size [ 1 ] , 0 , GL_RGB , GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE , img_data )
3.6 Geometry Rendering Performance
In general the fewer OpenGL calls you make , the better , true in C but even more so in Python .
The performance hierarchy for drawing geometry in OpenGL is as follows ( from slowest to fastest ) : Immediate mode ( glBegin / glEnd ) -
One of the strengths of OpenGL and one of the main reason OGL is so easy to learn , but it's also the slowest way of drawing primitives .
# 's 1 # Somewhere before the drawing code
2 circle = [ [ radius * math .
sin ( math .
radians ( deg ) ) , radius * math .
cos ( math .
radians ( deg ) ) , 0.0 ] for deg in xrange ( 360 ) ]
3
4 # In the drawing code
5 glBegin ( GL_LINE_STRIP )
6 for pt in circle :
7 glVertex ( pt )
8 glEnd ()
Vertex arrays -
By precalculating vertex coordinates , color , normals and texture values and loading them into buffers you not only reduce the number of calls you make but you also allow the hardware to more efficiently transfer the data to the video card .
The buffer data is still sent to the video card on every frame but this time in one giant block .
# 's 1 glVertexPointerf ( circle )
2 glDrawArrays ( GL_LINE_STRIP , 0 , len ( circle ) )
Interleaved Vertex Arrays -
Same as vertex arrays , except that you can place multiple types of data inside one giant buffer and then render it all using the same glDrawArrays / glDrawElements calls as before .
Create a buffer with the data then use glInterleaved Arrays to prepare it for rendering .
Vertex Buffer Objects ( VBOs ) -
The geometry equivalent of the texture objects , VBOs allow you to move the vertex , color , normal , texture data to the video card and render it when needed , without moving the data to the card on every render call .
Depending on your application , VBOs can provide a huge performance boost ... although their support in PyOpenGL is a bit rough .
Making things a lot easier is Nathan Ostgard 's VBO class # 's 1 # Generate Buffers ( inside Init method )
2 circle = array ( circle , dtype = float32 )
3 vertex_vbo = GL .
GLuint ( 0 )
4 glGenBuffers ( 1 , vertex_vbo )
5 glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , circle )
6 glBufferData ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , ADT .
arrayByteCount ( circle ) , ADT .
voidDataPointer ( circle ) , GL_STATIC_DRAW_ARB )
7
8 # Draw buffers ( inside Render method )
9 glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , vertex_vbo )
10 glVertexPointer ( 3 , GL_FLOAT , 0 , None )
11 glDrawArrays ( GL_LINE_STRIP , 0 , circle . shape [ 0 ] )

Politico :
While excitement is building for a Democratic Party convention capped by Barack Obama ’s historic acceptance speech before a sold - out , 75,000 - seat football stadium , the GOP convention the following week is shaping up to be a considerably more staid affair , marked by the conspicuous absence of many of the usual convention attendees [...]
Of the 12 Republicans running in competitive Senate races — five of whom are incumbents — only three have said they will be attending the convention .
Six are definite no - shows , and three are on the fence .
“ Nobody likes a funeral , ” said a Senate Republican press secretary who spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing “ the overall climate of general malaise about the party ” as the reason for hesitance on the part of Republicans .
On the House side , according to a report in The Hill , during a July 31 conference call National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Tom Cole of Oklahoma discouraged congressional hopefuls from attending , saying that doing so would potentially be a “ waste of time . ”
Ouch .
Furthermore , Republicans appear upset that the convention is in American 's heartland .
The political environment is just one explanation behind the absence of convention fever .
Many GOP lobbyists also have decided the convention is n’t worth the trip — despite the seemingly limitless networking and schmoozing opportunities — in part because of logistics and location .
In 2004 , D.C. - based conventioneers could zip in and out of New York City by train .
The 2000 convention in Philadelphia was an even shorter ride .
It 's like DC has a forcefield around it , and it's so hard for Republicans to break out of that bubble .
Yet they talk so much about the heartland , and pretend to know what " regular Americans " think , that it 's surprising that they would n't want to go and hang out in fly - over territory at least once every decade or so .
But apparently , while New York is good enough for this crowd , Minnesota is n't .
“ I would definitely say that people are n’t as excited about going to Minneapolis as they were about going to New York City , ” said Matthew Keelen , president of the Keelen Group , a D.C. - based lobbying firm .
“ Minneapolis is a nice city , but it does n’t quite have the environment and reputation of a New York City , and I think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was , ” he said .
As much as they claim to hate liberal NYC , turns out that 's just been empty rhetoric .
They actually hate middle America .
Ultimately , as the article goes on to note , venue owners in Minneapolis - St .
Paul are wondering why no one is booking their facilities .
Turns out few people give a damn about the GOP convention .
Meanwhile , Denver is facing a space - crunch of epic proportions , with space so hard to find , that we had to literally erect a big tent for the Big Tent .
A reporter asked me recently if I would attend the GOP convention .
I told her that I would n't , since no one had bothered to set up anything similar to the Big Tent in Minnesota .
You think someone would 've taken the initiative to do so , but it 's quite clear that no one cares enough to go through the hassles .
So yeah , Denver appears fated to be party central in a couple of weeks , while the RNC effort looks to be a funeral .
Look for that to be the topic of the next McCain ad , because remember -- excitement and intensity of support are now bad things .

By helping Ms. Schardt end her life , and then broadcasting the result , Mr. Kusch has , in effect , hung out a shingle .
A former senior government official from Hamburg , Mr. Kusch , 53 , said he would help other people like her who decide of their own free will to commit suicide .
“ My offer , since last Saturday , is to allow people to die in their own beds , ” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday .
“ That is the wish of most people , and now it is possible in Germany . ”
With his penchant for brazen publicity , Mr. Kusch recalls Jack Kevorkian , the euthanasia crusader in Michigan who all but dared the authorities to stop his assisted suicides , and ended up in prison .
But Mr. Kusch , who is trained as a lawyer , is careful not to cross the legal line .
In Ms. Schardt ’s case , he counseled her about how to commit suicide , but did not provide or administer the drugs .
He left the room after she drank the poisonous brew and returned three hours later to find her dead on her bed .
He videotaped the entire process as proof that he was not an active participant .
Prosecutors have looked into the case , but it does not appear that Mr. Kusch is in legal jeopardy .
Mr. Kusch also videotaped five hours of interviews with Ms. Schardt , in which she discussed her fears and why she wanted to die .
He showed excerpts at the news conference , causing an outcry .
“ A 10 - minute video says more than if I had talked for two hours , ” he said .
While Ms. Schardt was not suffering from a life - threatening disease , or in acute pain , her life was hardly pleasant , Mr. Kusch said .
She had trouble moving around her apartment , where she lived alone .
Having never married , she had no family .
She also had few friends , and rarely ventured out .
In such circumstances , a nursing home seemed likely to be the next stop .
And for Ms. Schardt , who Mr. Kusch said feared strangers and had a low tolerance for those less clever than she was , that was an unbearable prospect .

American actress Heather Thomas , known for her role as Jody Banks in the 1981 television series The Fall Guy with Lee Majors , has told Retroality TV that she does not believe flight 77 hit the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 .
“ They said it vaporized , and yet they produced bodies saying that they did n’t vaporize .
You can vaporize a two - ton engine ?
I do n’t think so… .
No plane does damage like that .
It was a bomb . ”
Heather Thomas : “ A lot of people say they closed the Twin Towers for weekends on end ( directly before 9/11 ) and would n’t let the security people in there ( because they were setting it up for demolition ) . "
Thomas , who played Marilyn Monroe in Hoover vs. the Kennedys , also voiced doubts about the official version of events at the WTC .
“ And a lot of people say they closed the Twin Towers for weekends on end ( directly before 9/11 ) and would n’t let the security people in there ( because they were setting it up for demolition ) . ”
Ben Fountain and Scott Forbes , who worked at the WTC , are both on the record as saying that there were several evacuations and power - downs of the twin towers in the weeks leading up to the attack .
“ Over the past few weeks we ’d been evacuated a number of times , which is unusual .
I think they had an inkling something was going on , ” Fountain told People Magazine .
Forbes claims to have witnessed men in maintenance suits entering the building the weekend before the attacks .
According to Thomas , described as a “ sociopolitical and philanthropic activist ” by Retroality TV , 9/11 was an inside job “ staged in order to take the oil leases .
It was even admitted that ( the motivation for the Gulf War in ) Kuwait was … a total lie that got us to establish our army base in Saudi Arabia … .
It ’s all about the oil companies . ”
Ms. Thomas joins a growing number of celebrities that have expressed doubts over the official version of events , including Charlie Sheen , Willie Nelson , Jesse Ventura , Rosie O’Donnell , Tom DeLonge , and others .

Corporations are slashing jobs .
States are in on the act too .
Let 's take a look at a few headlines .
All are from last weekend .
Citigroup ( C ) Slashing Investment Banking Jobs
Yahoo Finance is reporting Citigroup to slash investment - banking jobs
Citigroup is preparing fire thousands from its worldwide investment - banking division , The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday .
The Journal , citing people familiar with the matter , said the layoffs are part of a plan to cut about 10 percent of the staff of the 65,000 - member investment - banking group .
Miami Teachers Protest Job Cuts
Teachers in Miami -Dade County are fighting back against the school board 's decision to slash jobs .
Several teachers gathered outside the Intercontinental Hotel on Sunday to protest superintendent Rudy Crew 's decision to slash jobs while refusing to cut his own pay .
The board approved additional job cuts last week , raising the total number of jobs lost to more than 2,000 .
Continental Airlines Slashing Jobs
Continental Airlines Inc , which is shedding 3,000 jobs in a cost - cutting move , is offering employees a year 's worth of health insurance and travel perks if they leave on their own .
" We are offering all of our work groups voluntary plans to reduce the number of involuntary furloughs and terminations that will be required due to capacity cuts , " said Continental spokeswoman Mary Clark .
Continental has made an umbrella offer to all labor groups that includes the health benefits and free travel privileges for employees and their families until 2023 .
The offer was extended to employees who have worked at Continental for at least 10 years .
Janesville WI GM Closing To Cost 9,000 Jobs
A new analysis shows the closing of General Motors in Janesville could result in the loss of nearly 9,000 jobs and nearly half a billion dollars in labor income .
Using software developed by the Minnesota Implan Group , Deller did the analysis assuming that nearly 2,200 of the plant 's 2,667 employees live in Rock County .
It gets to the nearly 9,000 mark -- about 10 percent of the county 's resident work force -- when jobs are lost through a ripple effect .
Every modeling program uses a multiplier , a number that expands the effects .
In this case , the program attached different multipliers to the direct number of GM jobs lost ( 2,196 ) and the direct labor income of those GM employees ( $ 188 million ) .
Pennsylvania Tax Collectors Automated Out Of Jobs
Lawmakers are eyeing a bill to drastically change the way wage taxes are collected by slashing the number of tax collectors and creating countywide collection districts .
Sen .
Jane Earll , of Erie , sponsored the bill , which cleared the Finance Committee on Wednesday by a vote of 25 - 1 and now heads to the House .
California unemployment hits 6.8 %
California 's moribund construction and real estate industries helped push the state unemployment rate to 6.8 % in May , its highest level in nearly five years .
The state Employment Development Department reported Friday that joblessness in May rose six - tenths of a percentage point from the previous month and was a dramatic 1.5 percentage points higher than in May 2007 .
" Although some forecasting groups continue to debate whether or not the economy is heading into a recession , these numbers should make it perfectly clear that the state is already in a recession , " Beacon Economics , a Los Angeles - based research firm , said in an analysis of the jobless data .
" The only question now is , how long and how bad will it be ? "
Big California Unemployment Jump
Florida Unemployment Rate Highest Since 2003
State officials say Florida 's unemployment rate in May was at its highest in more than five years .
The jobless rate was 5.5 percent , the same as the national number .
The Agency for Workforce Innovation reported Friday that another 56,000 workers lost jobs last month , bringing the total number of jobless in Florida to more than 500,000 .

2 Faced Baby Born in India
A very special girl was born last March in a small suburb of Delhi , India .
She was born with 4 eyes , 2 noses , 2 mouths , 2 ears , and 1 dimple on a shared cheek .
Similar to Lakshmi Tatma , a 2 year - old girl born with four arms and four legs , she is reverred as a reincarnated god by her local villagers , who sing and dance regularly for her .
“ I had never seen something like this in my life so naturally I was a little scared when I first saw her , ” her father was quoted as saying .
The young girl and her mother are both healthy and the family has no intentions of seeking surgery to correct the deformities .
“ The doctor said everything is normal when she was born .
So where ’s the need to get medical help ? ” said the child ’s father .
“ She ’s fed through one mouth and sucks her thumb with the other .
We use whichever mouth is free to feed her . ”

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- A Chinese man wielding a knife stabbed an American couple in central Beijing on Saturday , killing the man and seriously wounding the woman before jumping to his death from an ancient tower , said U.S. Olympic officials and state - run media .
Todd Bachman , seen in a 1995 photo from KARE - TV , was stabbed to death Saturday in Beijing , China .
A female Chinese tour guide also was wounded in the attack , which happened around noon at the Drum Tower , a popular tourist site , China 's official news agency , Xinhua , reported .
The U.S. Olympic Committee identified the dead man as Todd Bachman , the father - in - law of Olympic Men's Indoor Volleyball Head Coach Hugh McCutcheon .
Bachman 's wife , Barbara , suffered " serious and life - threatening " injuries , the committee said .
However , Xinhua reported that she and the tour guide were in " stable " condition at a hospital .
The couple 's daughter , Elizabeth Bachman McCutcheon -- the coach 's wife and a member of the 2004 indoor women 's volleyball team -- was with them during the attack but was unharmed , USOC said .
Watch the site where the American was killed »
Dale Bachman , second cousin to Todd , said that Barbara Bachman had made it through surgery Saturday and was being treated in intensive care at a Beijing hospital .
" The next 24 hours are critical and we appreciate all your thoughts and prayers , " he said .
The Bachmans were not wearing apparel that identified them as relatives of members of the U.S. delegation at the time of the attack , USOC said .
Dale Bachman said the family has been " simply overwhelmed " by an outpouring of support and sympathy from across the globe since news of the attack broke .
" The U.S. Olympic family is another family for Todd and Barbara , " he said .
" They were very excited about making this trip to China .
One of the messages that came back was to a friend of Todd's , an e-mail after the opening ceremonies letting her know that Todd had seen the opening ceremonies and enjoyed them and was inspired by them . "
The attacker , identified as a 47 - year - old man from Hangzhou , in eastern China , jumped from the second level of the building , a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Government Information Office told Xinhua .
Watch a USOC official describe security for Americans »
" It is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour , " USOC Chairman Peter Ueberroth said .
" Our delegation comes to the Games as a family , and when one member of our family suffers a loss , we all grieve with them .
Our thoughts , prayers and deepest condolences are with the Bachman and McCutcheon families . "
President Bush , who is in Beijing for the Games , said in a statement that he and the first lady were " saddened " by the attack .
" Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families .
And the United States government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs , " Bush said .
The U.S. Embassy has offered the victims ' families whatever assistance is needed , a White House spokesman said .
The ancient Drum Tower and the nearby Bell Tower are popular tourist sites .
Both sites told the time in the capital city , with the bell rung in the morning and drum beaten in the evening , throughout the Yuan , Ming and Qing dynasties .

The islands issue has long been a nationalist touchstone in Korea
Advertisements promoting Japanese condoms have been removed from Korean underground trains amid a rekindled territorial dispute .
The action was taken following complaints from passengers , a Seoul Metro spokesman told AFP news agency .
" If the territorial dispute with Japan over Dokdo had not flared up again , such complaints would not have been lodged with us , " said Kim Jeong - hwan .
Dokdo is the Korean name for islets known as Takeshima in Japan .
Both Korea and Japan say they have a historical claim to the islands , and the issue has been a persistent irritant in relations .
This week Korea recalled its ambassador to Tokyo after new teachers ' guidelines produced in Japan reaffirmed the claim to ownership .
Now it has emerged that about 200 ads for Japanese condoms - bearing the strapline " No. 1 in Japan " - have been taken down from Korean trains .
The islands are small , but have symbolic and economic importance
" There were public complaints about promoting Japanese condoms and we immediately took action , " Mr Kim said .
Protesters threw tomatoes and rotten eggs at the Japanese embassy in Seoul on Wednesday .
Meanwhile , a spokesman for Korean President Lee Myung - bak said he was considering further moves on the issue , including possible legal action , reported Korean news website Hankyoreh .
The islets , which are roughly equidistant from Korea and Japan , are small , but lie in rich fishing grounds which could also contain large gas deposits .
But the dispute also taps into lingering grievances over Japanese colonial rule of Korea until 1945 .

David " Everything is Miscellaneous " Weinberger sez , " Here 's a PDF of a 1944 ' Simple Sabotage Field Manual ' from the US Strategic Services , explaining how to train people to sabotage their workplace .
Full of useful suggestions , from the practical to the , um , less so ( e.g. , bring a bag of mo [ n ] ths into a theater showing propaganda films ) .
It also recommends doing things through channels , making speeches , and referring matters to committee as techniques of sabotage ( cf. page 28 ) .
I got this link from a presentation by two CIA folks at the Enterprise 2.0 conference . "
(1) Insist on doing everything through " channels . "
Never permit short - cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions .
(2) Make " speeches . "
Talk as frequently as possible and at great length .
Illustrate your " points " by long anecdotes and accounts of perÂ­ sonal experiences .
Never hesitate to make a few appropriate " patriotic " comments .
(3) When possible , refer all matters to committees , for " further study and consideraÂ­tion . "
Attempt to make the committees as large as possible – never less than five .
(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible .
(5) Haggle over precise wordings of comÂ­munications , minutes , resolutions .
(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision .
(7) Advocate " caution . "
Be " reasonable " and urge your fellow - conferees to be " reasonÂ­able " and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on .
(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision – raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisÂ­ diction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon .
By admin on Aug 5 , 2008 in database
In every application , no matter Java , .NET or PHP , most probably you need to interact with databases .
For every domain your application is used for , the database design is definitely different , though basic database design principles are still the same .
Every domain requires different database models and unless you are the domain expert , most of the time you need to spend time to study the domain and the business requirements .
DatabaseAnswers.org has a vast collection of free data models for different domains .
It can serve as a starting point for our application database design .
You can then customize the database design to your specific requirements .
As quoted from the owner
My intention is to provide a wide range of ‘ Kick Start ’
Models that anyone can use as a starting - point , and could extend cleanly and logically , with appropriate reference to the Business Rules .
It is not my intention to provide Models that can be used off - the - shelf to meet the requirements of a large commercial organisation .
After all , that is one of the things I do for a living !!!
None of the Models is the complete and final solution in its area , but any of them can be added to easily and quickly to meet a specific requirement .
The logic in each Model is correct and contains the minimum Entities for the area being modeled .
It is easy to create a complex Model by combining these Kick - Start Models because they all follow the same design approach and standards .
Here are the top 20 models
System F is ubiquitous in logic , theorem proving , language meta - theory , compiler intermediate languages , and elsewhere .
Along with its type abstractions come type applications , but these often appear redundant .
This redundancy is both distracting and costly for type - directed compilers .
We introduce System IF{} , for implicit System F , in which many type applications can be made implicit .
It supports decidable type checking and strong normalisation .
Experiments with Haskell suggest that it could be used to reduce the amount of intermediate code in compilers that employ System F .
System IF constitutes a first foray into a new area in the design space of typed lambda calculi , that is both useful in practice and interesting in its own right .
Robert C. Martin delivered a very powerful speech yesterday at the Agile 2008 conference , titled Quintessence .
Criticising software developers for not acting as professionals , he suggested adding a fifth principle to the Agile manifesto .
Pointing out how the Agile conference was created by merging two earlier conferences a few years ago , one primarily related to XP and one primarily related to Scrum , Martin suggested that a merged conference predicted the fact that those two methods have by now effectively merged into a single set of agile development practices that people actually use .
He then pointed out how this still does not solve some core problems .
When he asked the audience who has at least once been significantly impeded by bad code since going agile , most people raised their hands .
Martin criticised both Scrum and XP for becoming “ too meta ” .
Scrum was criticised for unrealistically expecting everything to be ideal and for promoting certifications as a way to confirm someone ’s professionalism .
On the other hand , XP was criticised for being too strict .
As an interesting demonstration , he asked everyone in the audience to raise their hands and then started listing original XP practices , asking people that do not use a particular practice to put their hands down .
My estimate is that there were about one and a half thousand attendees , but only a few hands remained raised after the fifth or sixth practice being listed .
When he asked who in the audience has unit test coverage larger than 90 % , most people simply laughed .
Commenting on the current state of affairs in the software industry , Martin said that “ The fastest way to get done with dinner is not to do the dishes .
Making dinner starts taking some serious time and after a while you start to outsource dinner … “ .
He then pointed out that we should focus more on delivering stable and high - quality code rather than going fast , and not give in under pressure of schedules and deadlines to compromise quality .
Calling for programmers to be more professional , he asked “ If you believe yourselves to be professional , how can you release code that you are not sure it works ? ” .
Martin then talked about Ignaz Semmelweis , a hospital administrator in 19th century Vienna who discovered that the mortality rate in a maternity clinic could be drastically cut by making doctors wash their hands when moving between the autopsy ward and the maternity ward .
Semmelweis met with stiff resistance , including the claim that doctors had no time to wash their hands , according to the talk .
Wikipedia entry on Semmelweis states that he is now considered the “ savior of mothers ” .
( Interestingly , Wikipedia also has some grimmer facts about his fate : “ His contemporaries , including his wife , believed he was losing his mind and he was in 1865 committed to an asylum ( mental institution ) .
Semmelweis died there only 14 days later , possibly after being severely beaten by guards . ” )
Drawing parallels between that story and software development , Martin asked programmers to “ wash their hands ” and write clean code , not giving in to time pressures or claiming that they have no time for that or that they will not be allowed to do that .
Asking for people to do a good job and be better professionals , he suggested a change to the agile manifesto , adding the sentence “ we value craftsmanship over crap ” .

TwoDaemon : ... that is simultaneously so logical and so awesomely retarded .
WITH the financial system in meltdown , and the economy slowly heading in the same direction , you would have to be crazy to launch a new business .
Would n't you ?
On the contrary , “ the best time to get started is in a recession , ” says Felix Dennis , a famously controversial British media tycoon .
“ This is when big and medium - sized companies retrench , which allows small firms and entrepreneurs a chance . ”
Although he now runs a large , eponymous publishing company , Mr Dennis is taking his own advice .
Although in June 2007 he shrewdly sold several of his magazines — including the “ lads ' mags ” Maxim and Stuff — to private - equity at the top of the market , he still owns t he Week , a news magazine , and Viz , a rude comic , and has since juiced up his web strategy , launching several e-zines : e-mailed downloadable free content , which uses software that creates the effect of turning pages , as well as allowing other interactivity .
Rex Features
Felix Dennis
His portfolio of e-zines now includes i- GIZMO , which provides product reviews and was launched in March and Monkey , a slightly grown - up version of a lads ' mag , which he describes as “ even more idiocy , but this time animated and live . ”
On July 17th , he will launch an “ aspirational motoring ” e-zine , iMotor .
This will build on his purchase in April 2007 of Octane , a print magazine that Mr Dennis describes in his characteristically earthy way as “ classic car porn ” .
It comes as no surprise when Mr Dennis says that he turned down the Donald Trump role in the British version of “ The Apprentice ” — “ it stunk ; it is hard enough without some bully telling you you 're useless and you 're fired ” — for he is a magnetic character , not least because of his flaws .
He curses constantly ( infamously , he was the first man to say “ cunt ” on British television ) , writes and performs poetry , chain smokes and proudly cites a description of himself in the Times , a British newspaper , as an “ engaging monster … reeking of sulphur . ”
In America , the engaging monster has just published a memoir - cum - self - help - guide , “ How to Get Rich ” , which he says has done “ really well ” in the UK already .
While now may be a good time to start a business , the main message of the book , he says , is to try to discourage people from becoming entrepreneurs unless they are deadly serious and driven to such an extent that they cannot stop themselves .
This , he says , was his own experience ; having been jailed for publishing obscenity in his magazine Oz , and then given a lighter sentence than his partners because the judge thought he was stupid , he determined to build a business empire to prove that slur wrong and to ensure he always had the money to hire the best defence lawyer .
He is convinced that any suitably serious , driven person , blessed with reasonable intelligence and living in a developed economy , who takes his advice will “ get rich ” , but that it will exact a terrible price .
“ If you are married , your spouse or kids will be sacrificed ; you will be buying them presents laden with guilt .
I 've met many rich people and by and large their children are a mess . ”
The book , he says , was also his way to “ try to figure out all the mistakes I 've made . ”
For an entrepreneur , making mistakes is inevitable : “ If you make three big errors in a year and get one thing right , you are doing well , ” he says .
Learning when to stop doing something is probably more important than coming up with a business idea .
“ You do n't need a great idea , you need great execution .
It 's how you deal with failure that separates wannabes from gonnabes .
The first rule of entrepreneurial success is ' Do not reinforce failure ' . ”
Look at Lakshmi Mittal , now one of the richest men in the world , he says .
“ Go round the world buying crap steel companies .
Where is the new idea there ?
What he 's got is sensational execution . ”
Despite what he anticipates to be his fourth recession — “ we are talking ourselves into it ” — starting in America , Mr Dennis remains bullish on the land of the free .
“ For the rest of my lifetime I 'm betting on America , ” he says , noting the country 's “ pervasive aura of optimism ” .
This he contrasts unfavourably with his motherland .
“ I can't change my country 's bizarre and self - hurting culture towards entrepreneurial activity , ” he complains , noting that after some modest improvement in the culture of entrepreneurship in recent years , “ things have started going backwards again ; there is a very strong feeling that people who create jobs and money are beyond the pale . ”
Unlike in Britain , in America “ I 've never met anyone who hates me because I have earned a few hundred million dollars . ”
Something all the economic doom - mongers in America nowadays should bear in mind .
Rather than complain , perhaps they should each start a new business .
Violence Crosses the Border
Targets
Tactical Implications
Late on the night of June 22 , a residence in Phoenix was approached by a heavily armed tactical team preparing to serve a warrant .
The members of the team were wearing the typical gear for members of their profession : black boots , black BDU pants , Kevlar helmets and Phoenix Police Department ( PPD ) raid shirts pulled over their body armor .
The team members carried AR - 15 rifles equipped with Aimpoint sights to help them during the low - light operation and , like most cops on a tactical team , in addition to their long guns , the members of this team carried secondary weapons — pistols strapped to their thighs .
But the raid took a strange turn when one element of the team began directing suppressive fire on the residence windows while the second element entered — a tactic not normally employed by the PPD .
This breach of departmental protocol did not stem from a mistake on the part of the team ’s commander .
It occurred because the eight men on the assault team were not from the PPD at all .
These men were not cops serving a legal search or arrest warrant signed by a judge ; they were cartel hit men serving a death warrant signed by a Mexican drug lord .
The tactical team struck hard and fast .
They quickly killed a man in the house and then fled the scene in two vehicles , a red Chevy Tahoe and a gray Honda sedan .
Their aggressive tactics did have consequences , however .
The fury the attackers unleashed on the home — firing over 100 rounds during the operation — drew the attention of a nearby Special Assignments Unit ( SAU ) team , the PPD ’s real tactical team , which responded to the scene with other officers .
An SAU officer noticed the Tahoe fleeing the scene and followed it until it entered an alley .
Sensing a potential ambush , the SAU officer chose to establish a perimeter and wait for reinforcements rather than charge down the alley after the suspects .
This was fortunate , because after three of the suspects from the Tahoe were arrested , they confessed that they had indeed planned to ambush the police officers chasing them .
The assailants who fled in the Honda have not yet been found , but police did recover the vehicle in a church parking lot .
They reportedly found four sets of body armor in the vehicle and also recovered an assault rifle abandoned in a field adjacent to the church .
This Phoenix home invasion and murder is a vivid reminder of the threat to U.S. law enforcement officers that stems from the cartel wars in Mexico .
The fact that the Mexican men involved in the Phoenix case were heavily armed and dressed as police comes as no surprise to anyone who has followed security events in Mexico .
Teams of cartel enforcers frequently impersonate police or military personnel , often wearing matching tactical gear and carrying standardized weapons .
In fact , it is rare to see a shootout or cartel - related arms seizure in Mexico where tactical gear and clothing bearing police or military insignia is not found .
One reason for the prevalent use of this type of equipment is that many cartel enforcers come from military or police backgrounds .
By training and habit , they prefer to operate as a team composed of members equipped with standardized gear so that items such as ammunition and magazines can be interchanged during a firefight .
This also gives a team member the ability to pick up the familiar weapon of a fallen comrade and immediately bring it into action .
This is of course the same reason military units and police forces use standardized equipment in most places .
Police clothing , such as hats , patches and raid jackets , is surprisingly easy to come by .
Authentic articles can be stolen or purchased through uniform vendors or cop shops .
Knockoff uniform items can easily be manufactured in silk screen or embroidery shops by duplicating authentic designs .
Even badges are easy to obtain if one knows where to look .
While it now appears that the three men arrested in Phoenix were not former or active members of the Mexican military or police , it is not surprising that they employed military - and police - style tactics .
Enforcers of various cartel groups such as Los Zetas , La Gente Nueva or the Kaibiles who have received advanced tactical training often pass on that training to younger enforcers ( many of whom are former street thugs ) at makeshift training camps located on ranches in northern Mexico .
There are also reports of Israeli mercenaries visiting these camps to provide tactical training .
In this way , the cartel enforcers are transforming ordinary street thugs into highly - trained cartel tactical teams .
Though cartel enforcers have almost always had ready access to guns , including military weapons such as assault rifles and grenade launchers , groups such as Los Zetas , the Kaibiles and their young disciples bring an added level of threat to the equation .
They are highly trained men with soldiers ' mindsets who operate as a unit capable of using their weapons with deadly effectiveness .
Assault rifles in the hands of untrained thugs are dangerous , but when those same weapons are placed in the hands of men who can shoot accurately and operate tactically as a fire team , they can be overwhelmingly powerful — not only when used against enemies and other intended targets , but also when used against law enforcement officers who attempt to interfere with the team 's operations .
Although the victim in the Phoenix killing , Andrew Williams , was reportedly a Jamaican drug dealer who crossed a Mexican cartel , there are many other targets in the United States that the cartels would like to eliminate .
These targets include Mexican cartel members who have fled to the United States due to several different factors .
The first factor is the violent cartel war that has raged in Mexico for the past few years over control of important smuggling routes and strategic locations along those routes .
The second factor is the Calderon administration ’s crackdown , first on the Gulf cartel and now on the Sinaloa cartel .
Pressure from rival cartels and the government has forced many cartel leaders into hiding , and some of them have left Mexico for Central America or the United States .
Traditionally , when violence has spiked in Mexico , cartel figures have used U.S. cities such as Laredo , El Paso and San Diego as rest and recreation spots , reasoning that the general umbrella of safety provided by U.S. law enforcement to those residing in the United States would protect them from assassination by their enemies .
As bolder Mexican cartel hit men have begun to carry out assassinations on the U.S. side of the border in places such as Laredo , Rio Bravo , and even Dallas , the cartel figures have begun to seek sanctuary deeper in the United States , thereby bringing the threat with them .
While many cartel leaders are wanted in the United States , many have family members not being sought by U.S. law enforcement .
( Many of them even have relatives who are U.S. citizens . )
Some family members have also settled comfortably inside the United States , using the country as a haven from violence in Mexico .
These families might become targets , however , as the cartels look for creative ways to hurt their rivals .
Other cartel targets in the United States include Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement officers responsible for operations against the cartels , and informants who have cooperated with U.S. or Mexican authorities and been relocated stateside for safety .
There are also many police officers who have quit their jobs in Mexico and fled to the United States to escape threats from the cartels , as well as Mexican businessmen who are targeted by cartels and have moved to the United States for safety .
To date , the cartels for the most part have refrained from targeting innocent civilians .
In the type of environment they operate under inside Mexico , cartels cannot afford to have the local population , a group they use as camouflage , turn against them .
It is not uncommon for cartel leaders to undertake public relations events ( they have even held carnivals for children ) in order to build goodwill with the general population .
As seen with al Qaeda in Iraq , losing the support of the local population is deadly for a militant group attempting to hide within that population .
Cartels have also attempted to minimize civilian casualties in their operations inside the United States , though for a different operational consideration .
The cartels believe that if a U.S. drug dealer or a member of a rival Mexican cartel is killed in a place like Dallas or Phoenix , nobody really cares .
Many people see such a killing as a public service , and there will not be much public outcry about it , nor much real effort on the part of law enforcement agencies to identify and catch the killers .
The death of a civilian , on the other hand , brings far more public condemnation and law enforcement attention .
However , the aggressiveness of cartel enforcers and their brutal lack of regard for human life means that while they do not intentionally target civilians , they are bound to create collateral casualties along the way .
This is especially true as they continue to conduct operations like the Phoenix killing , where they fired over 100 rounds of 5.56 mm ball ammunition at a home in a residential neighborhood .
Judging from the operations of the cartel enforcers in Mexico , they have absolutely no hesitation about firing at police officers who interfere with their operations or who dare to chase them .
Indeed , the Phoenix case nearly ended in an ambush of the police .
It must be noted , however , that this ambush was not really intentional , but rather the natural reaction of these Mexican cartel enforcers to police pursuit .
They were accustomed to shooting at police and military south of the border and have very little regard for them .
In many instances , this aggression convinces the poorly armed and trained police to leave the cartel gunmen alone .
The problem such teams pose for the average U.S. cop on patrol is that the average cop is neither trained nor armed to confront a heavily armed fire team .
In fact , a PPD source advised STRATFOR that , had the SAU officer not been the first to arrive on the scene , it could have been a disaster for the department .
This is not a criticism of the Phoenix cops .
The vast majority of police officers and federal agents in the United States simply are not prepared or equipped to deal with a highly trained fire team using insurgent tactics .
That is a task suited more for the U.S. military forces currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
These cartel gunmen also have the advantage of being camouflaged as cops .
This might not only cause considerable confusion during a firefight ( who do backup officers shoot at if both parties in the fight are dressed like cops ? ) but also means that responding officers might hesitate to fire on the criminals dressed as cops .
Such hesitation could provide the criminals with an important tactical advantage — an advantage that could prove fatal for the officers .
Mexican cartel enforcers have also demonstrated a history of using sophisticated scanners to listen to police radio traffic , and in some cases they have even employed police radios to confuse and misdirect the police responding to an armed confrontation with cartel enforcers .
We anticipate that as the Mexican cartels begin to go after more targets inside the United States , the spread of cartel violence and these dangerous tactics beyond the border region will catch some law enforcement officers by surprise .
A patrol officer conducting a traffic stop on a group of cartel members who are preparing to conduct an assassination in , say , Los Angeles , Chicago or northern Virginia could quickly find himself heavily outgunned and under fire .
With that said , cops in the United States are far more capable than their Mexican counterparts of dealing with this threat .
In addition to being far better trained , U.S. law enforcement officers also have access to far better command , control and communication networks than their Mexican counterparts .
Like we saw in the Phoenix example , this communication network provides cops with the ability to quickly summon reinforcements , air support and tactical teams to deal with heavily armed criminals — but this communication system only helps if it can be used .
That means cops need to recognize the danger before they are attacked and prevented from calling for help .
As with many other threats , the key to protecting oneself against this threat is situational awareness , and cops far from the border need to become aware of this trend .
There are certain jobs that nobody dreams of doing when they grow up .
They tend to be the type of jobs that are dirty , dangerous , and sometimes boring and tedious .
However , they also tend to be well - paying jobs .
Some of these stigmatized jobs actually pay well and are definitely worth a closer look .
If you ’re on the fence about where your financial future is headed , stop and consider any of the shockingly lucrative jobs that follow .
Here are 25 well - paying jobs that you might want to consider .
[ NOTE :
We realize that there are , technically , people who do want these jobs .
The point is to spotlight jobs with stigmas attached to them that pay more than the typical person would think . ]
1. Crab fisherman
Featured on the Discovery Channel ’s hit TV series “ Deadliest Catch ” , the job of crab fisherman is often called the most dangerous in America .
Fishing in frigid Alaskan waters , these brave spirits weather stormy seas , below - freezing temperatures , and the heartache of being away from home for months .
The short crab season makes it imperative that they catch as many crabs as possible during that short window .
However , this can become astonishingly lucrative once one gets the hang of of it .
According to one estimate , even a somewhat experienced crab fisherman can catch as many as $ 50,000 worth of crabs in an 8 week period .
As a Methodist minister , I 'm always looking for new ideas to illustrate an old message in an effective and memorable way .
Dressing up as a tramp one Sunday this month illustrated the Biblical account of the road to Emmaus , when the disciples failed to recognise Jesus .
The media covered the drama of the occasion well - but nothing could have prepared me for the reaction I was to receive from my congregation at Trinity Methodist Church in Prestatyn .
The message of unconditional love , forgiveness , acceptance and the universality of the Gospel is preached weekly from the pulpits up and down the country .
The practice , it seems , is not so easily grasped !
Unshaven and in clothes bought from a charity shop and splashed with lager , I looked different , I certainly smelt different and I behaved in a quiet , intoxicated way - but obviously not in a way that would ensure I was unconditionally accepted into the House of God .
Now , I understood that some of the congregation would be concerned for their personal safety issue when a tramp tried to enter the church , but surely distant concern would have been preferable to a look of condemnation , and a spirit of acceptance - if only conditional - to an attempt to erase all signs of my presence with bleach .
Getting into the church proved much more difficult than I anticipated .
Those on " welcome " duty looked daggers at me and sent me scurrying away in an efforts to protect their cars from a man who was clearly trying to steal them , even if he could n't stand upright for long .
Eventually I got as far as the entrance of the church .
Behind a glass screen I saw for the first time the care and compassion in the eyes of some of those present – as well as some expressions that led me to question the purpose of this place .
About 20 minutes into the service , I began to bring the drama to a climax .
During a hymn , I shuffled forwards to the front of the church .
I felt every eye burning into me .
When I finally removed my hat and wig , the sigh of relief was audible .
It was followed by spontaneous applause .
Without having to speak a word , I had managed to communicate a deep message : we all look different on the outside , but on the inside we are essentially the same , needing love , acceptance and fellowship .
After the service some people apologised , while others tried to justify their suspicious reaction .
Of course , I am aware that approaching a tramp can feel risky , but folks could have initiated a chain of events that would bring help and care to one in such obvious need .
During my career in the police force I met many homeless people .
They provided a wealth of information about local crime .
Often these folks would share their life story with me .
On many occasions they had been successful in their chosen career , got married , had children , a house , a car - but something went wrong , and they found themselves on the street , alone , without the capacity or ability to begin to climb the socially acceptable ladder back to normal life .
At times many of us are just a couple of steps from losing everything .
The Google Yahoo deal raises fears of a monopoly in search advertising A formal antitrust investigation into a deal struck between Yahoo and Google over search advertising is set to be launched by the US Justice Department .
The Washington Post said investigators will also demand documents from other large internet and media companies .
Together Google and Yahoo claim nearly 80 % of the web search market and agreed to give antitrust authorities 100 days to look at the deal before going ahead .
Yahoo had called it an $ 800 million ( £ 400 m ) annual revenue opportunity .
It 's now thought that a formal investigation could signal that the Justice Department may have found some cause for concern with the partnership which would allow Google to provide some search advertising for Yahoo .
Lawyers familiar with similar investigations told the Washington Post that the kind of legal requests being issued by the Justice department - " civil investigative demands " - are not used for routine matters .
" It does n't mean they have drawn any conclusions , " Peter Guryan told the Post .
He is a partner with law firm Fried Frank and formerly an antitrust lawyer in the Justice Department .
But " it is a significant step beyond a request for voluntary information " ?
" It demonstrates that the DOJ clearly has questions . "
There has been no comment from either Google or Yahoo .
We all suffer
There has been concern by critics that a Google and Yahoo pairing could result in a monopoly in internet advertising if the agreement is given the go ahead .
Recently a coalition of 16 American civil rights and rural advocacy bodies called on regulators to investigate any online advertising and search partnership between the two companies .
Gary Flowers of the Black Leadership Forum told the BBC at the time " We all suffer in such mega mergers . "
In a letter to the Justice Department he and the rest of the coalition argued that Yahoo and Google combined would result in " a possible future in which no content could be seamlessly accessed without Google 's permission . "
Politicians were also wary of the pact and heads of key sub committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate reiterated their intentions to look into the arrangement .
Last month Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang visited Washington to allay fears that the partnership would impact competition within the online search advertising industry .
The Google Yahoo collaboration does not need up front approval from the US antitrust authorities as the two companies are not merging .
However , the government could challenge the deal in court if it came to the conclusion that it would restrain competition between them .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
It may be about time to dig out that old library card .
Hoping to draw back readers , libraries have vastly expanded their lists of digital books , music , and movies that can be downloaded by their patrons to a computer or MP3 player -- and it does n’t cost a cent , unlike , say , media from Apple Inc’siTunes or Amazon.com Inc .
New Apple iPod Nanos are seen during an unveiling in San Francisco , California September 5 , 2007 .
It may be about time to dig out that old library card .
Hoping to draw back readers , libraries have vastly expanded their lists of digital books , music , and movies that can be downloaded by their patrons to a computer or MP3 player -- and it does n't cost a cent , unlike , say , media from Apple Inc 's iTunes or Amazon.com Inc. REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
In Phoenix , for instance , branches have banded together to create a digital library that currently has about 50,000 titles of e-books , audiobooks , music and videos that can be “ checked out ” from anywhere .
Once discovered , says Tom Gemberling , the electronic resources librarian for the Phoenix Public Library , the program often proves wildly popular .
Not long ago , Gemberling visited a local trailer park to speak about the program to 100 or so seniors -- who regularly travel the roads touring in their recreational vehicles .
“ They were cheering and screaming by the end , ” he said .
“ They were so excited .
They ’re RVers , so they can go anywhere on the road , find a computer , go into the Phoenix Public Library catalogue , download a book and play it while they drive down the highway . ”
Available in thousands of libraries across the country , the programs work like this :
First you need a library card , access to the web , and some easily downloadable software -- the Adobe Digital Editions , the Mobipocket Reader or the OverDrive Media Console .
At that point , just browse around the library ’s website , select some titles , add them to a digital book bag and click the download button .
If the title is n’t available , it can be placed on hold for downloading later .
Depending on the library and title , the item remains on your computer for one to three weeks before disappearing , meaning you do n’t have to bother with returning a book , CD or DVD to the actual library .
FROM PHONES TO PALMS
One of the main distributors to libraries is OverDrive Inc , based in Cleveland , which has deals with publishers including HarperCollins and Random House as well as music labels like Alligator Records .
David Burleigh , OverDrive ’s director of marketing , says the company now has an inventory of around 100,000 titles , works with about 7,500 libraries and has racked up millions of downloads of its media player and digital check - outs .
“ We also know we are touching only a small percentage of each library ’s patrons .
Everyone we talk to is like ‘ Wow , you do that ? ’ ” he says .
“ It ’s a like this nice secret , that we of course do n’t want to be kept secret . ”
Although it depends on publisher permission , books can usually be transferred from a desktop computer to any number of mobile devices .
Sony Corp ’s Reader , SanDisk Corp ’s Sansa , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ’s Blackjack , Palm Inc ’s Treo 700wx , Motorola Inc’s Q , Microsoft Corp ’s Zune , iRiver ’s 510 , Hewlett - Packard Co’siPAQ , Dell Inc’s Axim , Creative Technology Ltd’s ZEN , AT&T Inc ’s Cingular Smartphone , and Apple ’s iPhone and iPods can all be used with the downloads , depending on the title and the library .
“ People like the portability of it , ” Jim McCluskey , collection development assistant manager for Washington State ’s Sno - Isle Libraries , which will soon be offering iPod compatible downloads .
While having a collection of books and music available for downloads helps libraries keep up with changes in technology , McCluskey said , it carries other advantages , too .
“ A lot of our libraries are cramped for space , ” he notes .
“ Material that does n’t take up shelf space and is available 24/7 -- that ’s really attractive for libraries . ”
It appears the U.S. women 's gymnastics team may actually get their coveted gold medals if an IOC investigation into the ages of the Chinese gymnastics team proves the little demons were n't all 16 years of age .
After initially dodging all the questions , the findings of one U.S. - based blogger named Stryde Hax , has apparently prompted the IOC to respond , according to the Times of London .
An IOC official told The Times that because of " discrepancies " that have come to light about the age of He Kexin , the host nation ’s darling who won gold in both team and individual events , an official inquiry has been launched that could result in the gymnast being stripped of her medals .

Wow .
If He Kexin is stripped of her medals , the disqualification would probably mean a little more gold for the U.S. team and , of course , more embarrassing and troubling news for the host country .
What 's even more amazing is the fact that this possibly medal - altering revelation was initiated by " Stryde Hax " who 's who 's neither super - journalist or super - sports fan , but just a dude named Mike Walker who loves to Google Hack as a hobby .
" There was a conclusion here , " Mr Walker said .
" These documents existed , on a state - wide website , and now they do n’t exist , and this change has taken place recently .
I was interested because these were documents that no - one could find .
If there ’s information to be found on the internet I ’m a citizen journalist - it was a challenge . "

While every other of the 20,000 journalist covering the Beijing Olympics pranced around eating scorpions , it 's a bit ironic that one extremely curious dude with a blogspot account might be the person who exposes one of the biggest scandals in Olympic history .
Maybe he should get a medal too ?

JOHANNESBURG
 Zimbabwean authorities confiscated a truck loaded with 20 tons of American food aid for poor schoolchildren and ordered that the wheat and pinto beans aboard be handed out to supporters of President Robert Mugabe at a political rally instead , the American ambassador said Wednesday .
“ This government will stop at nothing , even starving the most defenseless people in the country  young children  to realize their political ambitions , ” said the ambassador , James D. McGee , in an interview .
The government ordered all humanitarian aid groups to suspend their operations last week , charging that some of them were giving out food as bribes to win votes for the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , in a June 27 presidential runoff against Mr. Mugabe .
But political analysts , aid workers and human rights groups contend that it is , in fact , Zimbabwe ’s governing party that has ruthlessly used food to reward supporters and punish opponents in a country where agricultural production has collapsed over the past decade and millions of people would go hungry each year without emergency aid .

GUANTANAMO BAY NAVY BASE , Cuba — Soon after Osama bin Laden ’s driver got here in 2002 , he told interrogators the identity of the al Qaeda chief ’s most senior bodyguard — then a fellow prison camp detainee .
But , inexplicably , the U.S. let the bodyguard go .
This startling information was revealed in the fourth day of the war crimes trial of Salim Hamdan , 37 , facing conspiracy and material support for terror charges as an alleged member of bin Laden ’s inner circle .
Michael St. Ours , an agent with the Naval Criminal Intelligence Service , NCIS , provided the first tidbit .
He testified for the prosecution that his job as a prison camps interrogator in May 2002 was to find and focus on the bodyguards among the detainees .
And Hamdan helped identify 30 of them — 10 percent of the roughly 300 detainees then held here .
They had just been transferred to Camp Delta from the crude compound called Camp X - Ray , and U.S. intelligence was still trying to unmask them .

Tori Spelling and the case of the mysterious sunken chest
Tori Spelling displayed a worryingly concave chest as she took a stroll with her husband in Beverly Hills .
The mother - of - two ’s thin upper - body has left observers worried for her health in recent weeks and these latest pictures will no doubt spark further concerns .
The star - who recently pulled out of an appearance in the new 90210 spin- off - admitted to having undergone breast augmentation surgery earlier this year .
Collapsing : Tori first showed her sunken chest two years ago after admitting to going under the knife
The actress - who was wearing a necklace with the names of her two children Liam and Stella - has admitted having had breast augmentation surgery
'( I had ) a boob job .
There it is .
I finally said it .
I wanted to come clean that I had my boobs done in my 20s , because people falsely write that I 've had all those things done .
' I 've had the two procedures that probably every other woman in Hollywood has had done . ' she said earlier this year , ' The Sun quoted her as saying .
Tori has been plagued by controversy and heartbreak in the last few years .
She and husband Dean left their spouses for each other after meeting and falling in love on the set of TV movie Mind Over Murder .
Dean 's devastated wife Mary Jo Eustace - mother of his 9 - year - old son - then wrote a book entitled Tori Spelling stole my husband .
Spelling reveals her thin upper chest while out with her son Liam last week
Her father , the creator of dozens of television shows including Dynasty , Charlie 's Angels , The Love Boat and Fantasy Island , died in June 2006 , aged 83 .
A feud then began with her mother , Candy , who reportedly blocked her from producing a documentary about her father by refusing to let her use archive material of his shows .
Tori is also only believed to have inherited £ 430,000 of her late father 's estimated £ 270 million fortune .
Tori wed Dean in Fiji in May 2006 and the couple have two - children , Liam 1 , and two - month old Stella .
With so many instances of corruption and influence - peddling around him and whatever problems with the candidate that are keeping the campaign from letting reporters interview him anymore , John McCain is now again charging Obama with what amounts to soft treason — wanting to lose the war in Iraq in order to make himself president .

It would seem to most casual surfers of the Internet that the battle that once roared between The “ Church ” of Scientology and the group called “ Anonymous ” all but fizzled out .
While Guy Fawkes mask - wearing protesters are still occasionally sighted outside of Dianetics centers , the oddly named group does n’t make the major headlines anymore .
Clearly the higher - ups in Anonymous are worried that their movement may come to a halt .
On August 1st , the powers that be issued another chilling video to their members , supporters , and the Internet at large , stating their new determination to :
“ shift to more subtle and shocking tactics . ”
While it had the same Anonymous “ clouds and traffic overlay , ” the video was a little longer and dealt with slightly more specific topics than some of the original releases .
Personally I ’m a bit confused with their video .
It ’s very “ rally the troops ” but it lacks any real pith .
If anything it seems to be suggesting that they are going to do things that will really disagree with their more fair weather supporters .
Do they mean Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attacks ?
If so , that ’s nothing new for them .
The video also seems to put down newer Anonymous members for being too wimpy .
To make sure all their bases were covered , they issued a second video to the tune of :
“ In any conflict of this magnitude every part plays a role .
All Anonymous are welcome regardless of their origins , tactics , beliefs or reasons for their fight . ”
“ … every part plays a role ? ”
You really ca n’t be too much more wishy - washy than that .
Here is the first video so you can form your own opinions ( post them below ) :

A wolf pack of at least 30 thugs viciously attacked two hero ex-Marines in Brooklyn after they rescued a teenage girl who was being assaulted , police and witnesses said yesterday .
And when the brother of one of the former servicemen tried to come to his rescue during the July 25 melee in Coney Island , he was beaten into a coma .
The former leathernecks , Valentyn Olenyev , 23 , and Boris Bukler , 22 , Russian émigrés who served tours in Iraq , were walking a female friend to her parked car on West 23rd Street at 12:30 a.m. when they spotted two men holding the screaming teen by her hands and legs .
“ She was yelling , ‘ Help ! ’ ” said Olenyev .
“ I asked her , ‘ Do you need help ? ’
She said , ‘ Yes ! ”
“ It was n’t our intention to get into a fight , ” said Bukler .
“ We said , ‘ Let the girl go , and we ’ll leave . ’
We told them , ‘ Stop . ’
“ She was screaming , and all we did was look to help her .
I got a bottle smashed over my head , and after that , I started fighting .
But I got beat down .
“ I was getting my ass kicked by 50 people . ”
Their friend called Olenyev ’s brother , Ivan , 22 .
“ When I showed up , there were a lot of people there , people on the left and people on the right , and then – ‘ Boom ! ’ – I got hit and passed out , ” Ivan told The Post from his hospital bed .
Police sources said he was pounded senseless by 240 - pound Timothy Dixon , 23 , who was swinging a metal baseball bat .
Ivan suffered multiple facial fractures and will require plastic surgery .
The NYPD is looking for Dixon , who remains at large .
The teenage girl fled after the melee .
The two former Marines , meanwhile , insist that the violence had racial overtones , although the assault has not been labeled a bias crime .
Bukler said , “ Those in the crowd were yelling , ‘ Hey , white boys , you ’re in the ‘ hood now ! ’
We were yelling back , ‘ We do n’t care – we live here ! ’

But then the senator was quick to point out that he had bought his daughter a Prius — the prefect ( sic ) halo symbol for his green pretensions . [… ]
We also pressed McCain on the home issue , though at that time he was only willing to reveal two of his dwellings : one in Phoenix and a second home in Sedona .
And he was quite proud of the fact that he had installed solar panels on the Sedona pad .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Dell Inc. deceived customers in a massive " bait and switch " scheme to increase sales of its computer and electronic products , a New York state judge ruled Tuesday .
State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Dell in 2007 on behalf of hundreds of customers who claimed that the electronics company lured them into buying products with promises of attractive deals and promotions .
In reality , the lawsuit alleged , most customers were denied or misled into believing that they had been approved for low interest or financing rates .
The lawsuit also accused Dell of depriving customers of technical support that they were entitled to , in some instances , by pressuring them into performing repairs on their own or subjecting them to long wait times on the phone .
Watch Cuomo detail the complaints »
In a 26 - page decision , Supreme Court Justice Joseph C. Teresi found in favor of the consumers .

" Dell has engaged in repeated misleading , deceptive and unlawful business conduct , including false and deceptive advertising of financing promotions and the terms of warranties , fraudulent , misleading and deceptive practices in credit financing and failure to provide warranty service and rebates , " Teresi said in his decision .
The court will hold further proceedings to determine how much restitution Dell will have to pay its customers .
Dell said it disagreed with Teresi 's decision .
" Our goal has been , and continues to be , to provide the best customer experience possible , " spokesman Jess Blackburn said in a written statement to CNN .
" We are confident that when the proceedings are finally completed , the court will determine that only a relatively small number of customers have been affected , " Blackburn said .
Cuomo hailed the decision in a statement Tuesday .
" For too long at Dell , the promise of customer service was a bait and switch that left thousands of people paying for essentially no service at all , " Cuomo said .
" We have won an important victory that will force Dell to live up to its responsibilities and pay back its customers for profits that were pocketed but not deserved . "

But Campbell , a Pentagon official in the Clinton administration and now head of the Centre for a New American Security , a Washington think tank , wanted to explain that these metaphors did not quite capture the true nature of the neocon .
A silver bullet in the heart could kill a vampire , but not a neocon ; and werewolves went crazy at night , but a neocon did crazy things at any time , Campbell joked to much laughter , reported Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation in his blog , The Washington Note .
Campbell continued that " a better analogy was ' intellectual special forces ' - highly trained , confident , ninja - like , working well in small teams but always seeking to define the terrain of conflict .
They will not stand and fight if things go poorly but instead will search for a better battle . "
The problem was that a leading neocon was at the same dinner .
Robert Kagan was not amused .
He decided to protest .
The Americans were in London for a conference the next day .
Kagan , who had been invited as a speaker , decided to boycott the conference so he could avoid sharing the stage with Campbell .
A rueful Campbell went shopping to buy Kagan a tie and wrote him a note of apology , says Clemons .
Here is the irony .
Kagan is a card - carrying neocon .
He was a co-founder of the main neocon vehicle for pressing for the invasion of Iraq , the Project for the New American Century .
Through this he shares responsibility for that disastrous misadventure .
Yet it was not Kagan writing the apology .
It was Campbell , a member of the " realist " school of foreign policy and not an advocate of the invasion , while Kagan struck an indignant pose .
Elsewhere , Campbell had marvelled at this phenomenon - the insouciance of people he calls Iraqitects : " Perhaps part of the curiosity is because this current generation of war planners has conducted themselves so much differently than the Vietnam era Masters of the Universe , " he wrote in The New York Times in November .
" Many from the version 1.0 of the best and the brightest - those intrepid Cold Warriors who led the country to a slogging defeat in Vietnam - had to subsequently endure booing on college campuses , shunning from old friends and colleagues , brutal treatment from the commentariat of the time , and the kind of bitter despair that generally accompanies a thoroughgoing battlefield defeat .
" The version 2.0 era of neoconservative advocates of military action to topple Saddam have behaved very differently in the midst of our current quagmire in Iraq .
Almost all have generally tried to put on a brave public face and to remain on the intellectual offensive , pointing out the weaknesses and limitations of their critics and full of ideas for what the US can do next in the world .
Even after offering atrocious advice to President Bush during the 2000 campaign , most of them are back again . "
And they have indeed found their " better battle " .
The neocons are now agitating nonstop in the campaign to attack Iran .
But were n't the neocons in the Bush Administration all purged ?
Men like the deputy secretary of defence , Paul Wolfowitz , and the undersecretary of defence for policy , Doug Feith , were forced out .
So was the former US ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , and the chief of staff to the Vice - President , Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
With no neocons in government , surely their only attacks now have to be rhetorical - surely they cannot wage war .
But a number of key neocons have arrived in the inner circle of the candidate to become the next Republican president , John McCain .
This is being taken very seriously by American foreign policymakers .
" There 's no doubt that some neocons like Senator Joe Lieberman are linked to McCain at the elbow like Siamese twins , " said one of the grey eminences of US foreign policy , Zbigniew Brzezinski , national security adviser to Jimmy Carter and now an adviser to the Democrats ' presidential candidate , Barack Obama .
" Lieberman believes that we are already in World War Four and his complaint is that we are not sufficiently conscious of it or sufficiently belligerent , " Brzezinski told the Herald .
On Iran , Lieberman advocates air strikes to disable its nuclear program .
Other notable neocons who are now counted as McCain advisers are Bolton ; William Kristol , the editor of the neoconservative journal The Weekly Standard and son of the neocon intellectual founder , Irving Kristol ; a former Wolfowitz ally at the Bush Pentagon , Peter Rodman , and the easily offended Robert Kagan .
Crucially , a neocon has landed as chief co-ordinator of McCain 's foreign policy and national security teams .
Randy Scheunemann was the founder of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and , like Kagan , was one of the founders of the Project for the New American Century .
This clustering of neocons around a possible next president troubles American analysts for two principal reasons .
First , the neocons ' record lends them no credibility , yet their positioning around the candidate gives them enormous potential power .
The neocons were adamant about the need to invade Iraq .
Kristol and Kagan wrote in 2001 : " The road that leads to real security and peace is the road that runs through Baghdad . "
They were wrong .
The invasion destabilised Iraq and unleashed a civil war between the Sunnis and Shiites whose future remains completely unpredictable .
The invasion empowered Iran .
It energised terrorists around the world .
It compromised US power .
It sent the US to its lowest point in world regard since Vietnam .
It needlessly killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians and 4000 US troops to date .
Its ultimate financial cost will be counted in the trillions of dollars .
It reduced Iraq 's oil output .
And yet the neocons , in general , remain unbowed and unrepentant .
Second , the neocons ' world view is ideological ; zealotry is a poor guide for cool - headed and judicious policy - making .
The neocon , unlike the realist , is an idealist and believes in a revolutionary doctrine .
He believes that America 's unique mission is to civilise the world at gunpoint .
Professor Andrew Bacevich , of Boston University , says there are five defining characteristics of neoconservatism .
The neocon believes that : * US global domination is benign and other nations see it as such ;
* Any lapse in US domination will create chaos ; * Military force is necessary to impose democracy ; * US military power must always be expanded to allow it to intervene decisively in every critical region of the world simultaneously if necessary ; and
* Realists in foreign policy must be aggressively targeted and defeated .
As Bacevich puts it , the neocon cannot abide the realist because " realism was about defending national interests , not transforming the global order " .
So it has been much remarked in Washington that McCain 's advisory group contains not only some of America 's leading neocons , but also some of its famous realists .
Asked about the influence of neocons in McCain 's campaign , his lead Asia adviser , Mike Green , points to this fact : " If you look at McCain 's senior group , it includes Henry Kissinger and George Shultz and Bob Zoellick - it 's hardly a pantheon of neocons .
" And the advisory group , at the next level down , includes moderate conservatives like me , " said the former senior director for Asia in the Bush White House .
" I have never felt I 've needed to butt heads with neocons .
" But John McCain has been involved in national security for decades .
The idea that he could be taken over by any adviser is totally mistaken .
On almost everything , McCain already has a stated position . "
And his stated position on Iran ?
" You mean a serious position , or him singing ' Bomb Iran ' ? " asks Green , referring to the infamous YouTube clip of McCain during a public appearance singing those two words over and over to the tune of the Beach Boys tune Barbara Anne .
Asked for the longer version of the candidate 's position , Green says : " Barack Obama 's pledge to meet personally with the leadership of Iran is definitely not where McCain is .
He 's been one of the leading people in the Senate arguing that Iran is the leading threat to Iraq , arguing that Iran is on the offensive in Gaza and Lebanon and efforts of diplomacy and offers of carrots have been rebuffed by the regime .
" You have France , Germany and Britain arguing we need more pressure on Iran - that 's pretty much where McCain is .
He is sceptical of what you can get through talking .
The more important thing is to put more pressure on them . "
Green portrays this as a practical middle way of approaching Tehran : " There is more to Iran policy than bombing them or talking to them . "
Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation explains that he is anxious about the neocons '
Iran policy " because they regard the mullahs of Iran as the greatest threat to Western values , and many of them also worry about Israel .
When you take these concerns and then consider Iran with nukes , the neocons just go crazy . "
But the simple answer is not necessarily to vote Democrat : " I worry that Barack Obama worries that he wo n't be trusted by the American people on national security and he may be looking for an action to define himself .
So Obama could end up looking a lot like a neocon . "
It is easy to make fun of the neocons , but Washington is alive with the concern that they may yet have the last laugh .

News : Briefing
The media frenzy over bird flu has receded , but the threat of a global epidemic still looms large .
Bird flu : it 's still out there .
TBKMEDIA.DE / ALAMY
Is bird flu affecting fewer people now ?
Yes and no .
The 88 cases and 59 deaths reported last year are lower than the 2006 peak of 115 cases and 79 deaths , when the virus first arrived in Turkey and Egypt and sparked a large number of cases there .
Thirty four cases have been reported so far this year .
Vietnam , Thailand and China — the only countries to report cases from 2003 – 04 during the current epidemic — have made progress in controlling the spread of the virus in poultry .
Once major hotspots , all three countries have consequently seen a significant drop in human cases .
But cases have since cropped up in 12 other countries , with Indonesia leading at 135 cases — more than one - third of the worldwide total of 385 .
A major worry is that Bangladesh , which reported its first human case in May , might go the way of Indonesia because the virus is firmly established in the country 's poultry .
The apparent current downturn in cases could be short - lived .
What is the situation in poultry ?
Although some countries are making progress controlling the disease , the prospects are bleak .
Experts are now convinced that the disease has become endemic in Indonesia , Bangladesh , Vietnam and Egypt , making eradication impossible .
That makes it inevitable that outbreaks will continue elsewhere as the poultry trade helps to spread the virus .
In 2007 , outbreaks in poultry or wildlife were reported in 28 countries .
Twenty two countries have reported outbreaks this year , with South Korea having its worst outbreak ever in April .
Sixty one countries have now been affected , and the H5N1 virus remains a major threat to agriculture and food supply , and to human health .
Short - term fire - fighting tactics are now evolving into long - term efforts , including restructuring trade and farming practices .
" Acceptance that the viruses will not be eradicated does not mean complacency — it is a dose of reality .
But it also takes the disease out of the headlines , " says Les Sims , a consultant for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization .
" If governments are to tackle these issues , long - term donor support is needed .
Unfortunately , long - term programmes may prove less appealing to donors than emergency activities , especially if the disease is no longer front - page news . "
One problem is that most countries do n't have systems for rapidly incorporating new antigens into vaccines , making current poultry vaccines in high - risk areas increasingly ineffective .
Might bird flu still reach the Americas ?
Yes .
That it has n't already is mostly down to good luck , and relative geographic isolation .
If it enters the Americas it could be a disaster for the food industry in Latin America — Brazil is the largest producer of poultry .
If the risks are still there , why has the media largely gone quiet ?
Media coverage of avian flu peaked from mid-2005 to mid-2006 .
That was when H5N1 avian flu erupted out of Asia , spread across Russia , and fanned out into Europe and Africa .
Although bird flu has since faded from the front pages , media coverage in fact remains sustained and high , as can be seen from a timeline search of the Google News archive .
What 's being done to prepare for a pandemic ?
Many countries — Canada in particular — have made considerable progress in planning to mitigate a pandemic , compared with just three years ago when only a few had national pandemic plans .
But implementation remains patchy .
What progress has been made in vaccines ?
Plenty .
Vaccines with adjuvants that boost their effectiveness by making antigens go much further — a crucial factor in a pandemic — are belatedly getting the attention they deserve , despite the inertia of regulators , governments , and research agencies .
Current formulations are so antigen - sparing that todays flu - vaccine production capacity would be enough to vaccinate everyone on Earth .
But vaccines can't be made until a pandemic starts , and the particular pandemic strain has been identified .
So it will be a race against the clock , requiring an unprecedented level of international coordination .
As things stand , vaccines would n't be available until several months into a pandemic , and the nine countries that have the flu- vaccine factories are likely to keep the first batches for themselves .
Taiwan , Korea , Brazil and Mexico are now developing their own flu-vaccine facilities .
What are the alternatives to a perfectly matched vaccine ?
A Commentary in this week 's issue of Nature highlights the possibility of using pre-pandemic vaccines matched to earlier strains of H5N1 .
Even if these were only partly effective , they might confer sufficient protection to prevent death or severe disease .
The World Health Organization is planning to stockpile more than 100 million doses of pre-pandemic vaccines , and some nations , including Japan , are considering the same .
But the cruel reality is that without greater international effort , vaccines and antivirals are not going to be available to most of the world 's population who live in poor countries .
David Fedson , former director of medical affairs at the drug firm Sanofi - Aventis , argues that cheap , generic anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely available in poor countries could help to reduce death and severe disease during a pandemic .
They could calm the massive overreaction of the immune system , called a cytokine storm , that is the main killer in flu .

Rastafarians win right to possess more marijuana because of their religion
If you 're a Rastafarian in Italy , you might be able to possess more marijuana than the law allows everyone else .
Italy 's highest criminal court has ruled that the fact Rastafarians consider marijuana use a religious sacrament should be taken into account if they are tried on trafficking charges , lawyers in a recent case and news reports said Friday .
Smoking pot in Italy is not a crime , but being caught with amounts considered too large for personal use can bring charges of trafficking .
The Court of Cassation threw out the drug trafficking conviction of a 44 - year - old Italian Rastafarian , ruling that the amount he possessed was in line with the heavy use that comes with his religious beliefs .
The court annulled a 16 - month jail sentence the defendant was given in 2004 , defense lawyer Caterina Calia said .
Police had found the man with a few ounces ( several grams ) of marijuana , enough to make around 70 cigarettes , which he claimed were all for personal use , she said .
" Rastafarians usually smoke together , " Calia said .
" He is a Rasta and has argued that pot is a divine drug . "
Calia said she had not seen the court 's official explanation , deposited in court offices Thursday , for its ruling , so she declined to give details .
But Italian news organizations quoted widely from the court document .
Rastafarians " use marijuana not only as a medicinal ... but also as a possible way to obtain the psycho-physical state contemplation aims for during prayer , " Turin daily La Stampa quoted the document as saying .
" Belonging to that religion ... followers ( must ) use the sacred grass daily , up to 10 grams ( 0.35 ounces ) a day for person . "
Rastafarians worship Ethiopia 's last emperor , Haile Selassie , who died in 1975 , as a god .
They preach unity with nature and smoke marijuana as a sacrament .
The Italian Health Ministry described the ruling as " disturbing . "
" These rulings represent an element of destabilization for the pillars of secularism , " Undersecretary Francesca Martini said in a statement .
Right - wing lawmaker Maurizio Gasparri also criticized the ruling , saying the Rastafari religion is more of a fashion trend in Italy .
" Someone stop the judges who live outside of reality , " he was quoted as saying by the Apcom news agency .
An appeals court in Florence will now have to hear the case , keeping the Cassation 's words in mind , Calia said .
Anti-Russian fervor threatens to hit fever pitch in Washington this week .
In the wake of Russia ’s military incursion into Georgia , Barack Obama is suddenly doing his best to parrot John McCain ’s Russophobia .
Indeed , the cries to shove Moscow back into the cold are coming from both sides of the aisle : Kick Russia out of the G - 8 , lock it out of the European Union and the World Trade Organization and , by all means , boycott Vladimir Putin ’s pet project , Sochi 2014 -- the Winter Olympics slated for a Black Sea venue a short drive from the disputed territory of Abkhazia .
On Tuesday , NATO said that continuing normal relations with Russia was impossible and moved to all but scrap the NATO - Russia Council .
Let no one be deceived : Putin has drawn a dangerous new line .
Russian troops have trespassed into a sovereign nation for the first time since the dissolution of the Soviet Union .
But all such retributive Western campaigns are misguided and , like every attempt to twist Russian arms since the end of the U.S.S.R. , sure to backfire .
There ’s really only one lever left : Invite Russia to join NATO .
This is not a new idea .
Once upon a time , it was openly entertained in diplomatic circles East and West .
In late 1991 , the final days of the U.S.S.R , , Boris Yeltsin stunned a NATO meeting by sending a letter with this unilateral declaration : “ Today we are raising a question of Russia ’s membership in NATO . ”
“ A long - term political aim , ” Yeltsin called it then , as he threw down the gauntlet before the West .
NATO ministers , as Tom Friedman reported for the New York Times at the time , were “ too taken aback ... to give any coherent response . ”
In the ensuing years , as Yeltsin with characteristic bravura continued to raise the prospect , the West kept fumbling for a reply .
Even Putin , in his first days in the Kremlin , seized on the issue .
In March 2000 , in his first interview with a foreign reporter -- the BBC ’s David Frost -- Putin shocked critics and fans alike , saying , “ We believe we can talk about more profound integration with NATO , but only if Russia is regarded as an equal partner . ”
Asked outright if Russia could join NATO , Putin shot back : “ I do not see why not . ”
He also added a dark warning :
Any NATO attempt to exclude Russia from the debate over the alliance ’s eastward expansion would only provoke “ opposition . ”
Give him points for honesty .
The end of the U.S.S.R. opened an era of unprecedented promise .
But while Russians openly yearned for closer ties , the West only pushed back -- expanding NATO into former Warsaw Pact countries and former Soviet states .
More recently , the U.S. has moved to station elements of a missile defense system , what Russians still call with dread “ Star Wars , ” in Russia ’s backyard -- in the Czech Republic and Poland .
Meantime , successive U.S. administrations have steadily reduced U.S. - Russian relations to Washington ’s lowest common denominator : our need for non-Arab oil and our need for help in constraining two of Russia ’s closest diplomatic and trading partners , Iran and North Korea .
When it came to the war in Iraq , we asked for Russia ’s support .
But then we shut it out of all oil and reconstruction contracts .
Amid the talk now in vogue of a “ new cold war , ” we are adrift in a sea of lost opportunities .
This week , ominous reports have surfaced : that Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office has pushed for several months to increase military aid to Georgia -- in particular , the sale of hand - held antiaircraft weapons -- at a time when Russia has been flying Tu - 95 Bear H bombers , capable of bearing cruise missiles , near the coast of Alaska .
Russia is moving to reestablish its hegemony over its neighbors , some will say .
Yes , it is true .
But that is all the more reason to engage , not to chastise .
After all , where is America ’s leverage ?
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , we are told , interrupted her holiday and made more than 90 phone calls to try to mediate the crisis in Georgia .
President Bush “ demanded ” that Russian troops leave .
To what effect ?
Russia ’s tanks have rolled on .
But Americans should not fear Russian expansionism .
The Russians are already here .
Only 10 years ago , Russia defaulted on $ 40 billion in bonds and cut its umbilical cord to the global capital markets .
But today , Moscow , awash in oil money , is out to enhance Russian prowess on the global stage , not militarily but economically .
It ’s not only estates in Aspen that the Russian oligarchs have scooped up .
The list of Russian takeovers is long and growing .
Ask the Wall Street bankers who have reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year alone .
Ask the folks at Oregon Steel in Portland and Colorado , Rouge Steel in Detroit and Stillwater Mining in Montana -- their paychecks now come from Russian oligarchs .
At some point between Putin ’s last day as president and the announcement this year that Moscow leads the world in billionaires , a new strategy emerged .
“ The Kremlin plan , ” the oligarchs call it .
Go forth and multiply , Putin told Russia ’s business titans .
His puppet president , Dmitri Medvedev , in his first meeting before the oligarchs last spring , laid out the terms of the bargain : Keep one foot in the motherland but expand your portfolios and , above all , extend Russia ’s reach abroad .
What does Russia want ?
Just a couple of tiny restive provinces pried away from Georgia ?
Hardly .
In Putin ’s Russia , muscle -- be it tanks or banks -- rules .
Gazprom , the state giant that controls at least 25 % of Europe ’s natural gas supply , hungers to enter the U.S. market .
So do a raft of Russian oil giants and those who control the country ’s sovereign wealth funds , flush with at least $ 157 billion in oil money .
What should the West do ?
Many in Washington and on Wall Street will whisper the obvious reply : Bring them in .
“ If our goal all these years , since the Soviet breakup , has been ‘ Get them to play by our rules , ’ ” one former high - ranking national security aide in the Bush and Clinton administrations told me recently , “ what better way to do it ? ”
So too on the diplomatic front .
Now is the time , before the conflagration in the Caucasus spreads , to reverse course and embrace Russia more tightly than ever .
In 1991 , when the world was giddy with expectation , a NATO foreign minister answered Yeltsin ’s talk of joining NATO with a fearful prediction .
“ If you do it for Russia , ” said the Belgian foreign minister , “ you also have to do it for the other republics . ”
How true .
“ For NATO , ” he added , “ there is a danger of dilution . ”
One need not look for long at the smoldering fires in Georgia to recognize our own myopia and to see where the greater danger lies .

Le projet de loi pénitentiaire a été soumis au conseil des ministres , lundi 28 juillet .
Il sera débattu à l'automne .
Très attendu , dans un contexte de surpopulation carcérale , il est critiqué pour ses insuffisances par les associations d'aide aux détenus et les syndicats de surveillants de prison , à l'exception de FO , pour son manque d'ambition .
La ministre de la justice , Rachida Dati , défend son texte et répond à la gauche , qui avait renoncé à présenter un tel projet avant l'élection présidentielle de 2002 .
Quels sont les principaux objectifs du projet de loi pénitentiaire ?
Nous proposons une nouvelle conception de la prison : une prison moderne , digne , et une nouvelle vision de la privation de liberté avec la prison " hors les murs " .
Le fait de condamner , de sanctionner , de priver de liberté peut prendre d'autres formes que l'emprisonnement .
Aujourd 'hui , l'objectif est de lutter contre la récidive par la réinsertion de la personne condamnée .
Cela passe par le développement des aménagements de peines , grâce à la surveillance électronique et l'assignation à résidence des personnes en attente de jugement , mais également par la construction de prisons plus dignes .
C'est aussi une loi qui concerne à la fois les personnels et les détenus .
L'amélioration des conditions de vie des détenus permettra d'améliorer les conditions de travail de l'ensemble des personnels .
Comment cette loi va-t - elle lutter contre la surpopulation des prisons , alors que le nombre de détenus a atteint un nouveau record avec 64 250 personnes pour 50 806 places ?
La surpopulation est une réalité .
Il ne faut pas prendre le problème à l'envers : nous devons d'abord assurer la sécurité des Français en condamnant les délinquants .
Il y a une vertu à la fermeté : la certitude de l'exécution des condamnations est dissuasive .
Le problème de la surpopulation a été mal anticipé .
Le premier programme d'ampleur a été entrepris par Albin Chalandon en 1987 avec la construction de 13 000 places .
Entre 1997 et 2002 , alors même que la délinquance augmentait , le nombre de places de prison a diminué de 4 % .
En 2002 , les constructions ont été relancées .
Un programme sans précédent de 13 200 nouvelles places est engagé , c'est - à- dire 63 000 places disponibles en 2012 .
Nous avons un objectif : qu'il n'y ait plus de surpopulation carcérale en 2012 .
Cet objectif sera atteint , d'une part , par la réalisation du programme de construction , et , d'autre part , par le développement des aménagements de peines tels que le placement sous surveillance électronique , la libération conditionnelle , la semi-liberté ou le placement extérieur .
Je rappelle qu'entre 2002 et 2007 il y avait en moyenne 2000 peines aménagées par an , avec des grâces collectives annuelles , une loi d'amnistie et des réductions de peines automatiques .
Depuis 2007 , la population pénale a certes augmenté , mais au 1er juillet 2008 , nous avons plus de 6000 peines aménagées , et cela en l'absence de grâce collective et de loi d'amnistie , et avec la disparition du caractère automatique des réductions de peine .
Notre politique est de lutter contre la récidive en réinsérant les personnes détenues , et non pas de réguler la population carcérale par des sorties " sèches " .
La loi pénitentiaire créera des nouveaux outils qui permettront d'améliorer la réinsertion des détenus de manière durable .
Il faut des moyens financiers et humains pour assurer la surveillance des 14 6000 personnes placées sous main de justice en dehors de la prison ( contrôle judiciaire , sursis avec mise à l'épreuve , travail d'intérêt général , libération conditionnelle ) .
Comment seront - ils assurés ?
La modernisation du système pénitentiaire sera intégralement financée .
Les personnels , les constructions , les 12 000 bracelets électroniques .
Déjà , le nombre de conseillers d'insertion et de probation ( CIP ) a doublé en cinq ans .
La loi pénitentiaire , qui donne de nouveaux droits aux détenus , permettra d'améliorer leur travail .
Par exemple , le fait d'élire domicile pour le détenu dans son établissement pénitentiaire lui permettra d'effectuer directement des démarches administratives actuellement réalisées par les conseillers .
Il y a eu de nombreuses réactions de déception après la présentation de l'avant - projet de loi , notamment en ce qui concerne les droits accordés aux détenus , jugés insuffisants …
Sur l'exercice des droits des détenus , nous partons de très loin .
Cette loi consacre et organise l'exercice de nombreux droits pour les personnes détenues : élection de domicile au lieu de détention , accès aux prestations sociales , accès au téléphone , exercice du droit de vote , bénéfice d'une formation professionnelle .
Une personne privée de liberté n'est pas privée de ses droits fondamentaux .
Cela n'avait jamais été fait auparavant , y compris par ceux qui nous critiquent aujourd ' hui .
C'est notre majorité qui a institué un contrôleur général des lieux privatifs de liberté .
C'est le président de la République qui a nommé à cette fonction Jean - Marie Delarue , personnalité indépendante unanimement saluée .
L'idée d'un revenu minimum pour les prisonniers n'a pas été retenue , alors que vous sembliez y être favorable .
Pourquoi ?
Nous sommes favorables à une aide ponctuelle , financière ou en nature , notamment pour les détenus les plus démunis , mais nous ne souhaitons pas l'instauration d'une mesure d'assistance généralisée .
Je préfère donner la priorité à la réinsertion par le travail ou la formation professionnelle .
Le travail est aussi un facteur de dignité .

A long distance swimmer is ditching his trunks to kayak his way to the North Pole in order to make people more aware of the effects of climate change .
He says no - one 's tried to paddle to the pole before because it 's usually frozen over .
But scientists reckon this year an ice - free route could open up .
He hopes his 745 mile trip will show the effect rising temperatures have had on the environment .
Lewis Pugh is famous for things like swimming in the Arctic .
" There 's one side of me that desperately wants to get to the North Pole to be able to shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what has happened there , " he said .
" But then there 's the other side of me that says I really hope I do n't get there .
I hope I fail because if I am able to get there we really are in deep trouble . "

Two people have been rescued from a light aircraft which hit power lines near Durach , in southern Germany .
It took emergency services two hours to get the trapped occupants out of the plane which was left dangling 30 metres ( 100 feet ) above the ground .
Rescuers on the scene believe the plane 's undercarriage clipped the 380,000 volt power line shortly after taking off from a nearby airport .
The pilot and passengers had to wait in the stranded plane while a cherry - picker was brought to the scene .
It was decided that the downdraft from a helicopter would risk dislodging the aircraft .

House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) issued letters of inquiry Wednesday to Vice President Cheney ’s former chief of staff , I. Lewis Libby , regarding a forged letter linking Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks .
The Michigan Democrat also sent letters to senior former Bush intelligence officials , including Robert Richer , former CIA Deputy Director of Clandestine Operations , who claimed that Cheney ’s office pushed the CIA to develop a phony letter to aid their argument for a preemptive strike on Iraq .
The letters were copied to RAW STORY .
“ I have become very concerned with the possibility that this Administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion , ” Conyers wrote Libby , who was convicted of obstruction of justice in the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame .
“ The law specifically provides that “ [ n] o covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies , or media . ”
Conyers ’ letters come in the wake of claims by author Ron Suskind , who quotes Richer in his most recent book as saying a forged letter linking Saddam Hussein to the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks was ordered on White House stationery .
“ What I remember is George [ Tenet ] saying , ‘ we got this from ’ –basically , from what George said was ‘ downtown , ' ” Richer says in a transcript Suskind released .
“ He may have hinted –just by the way he said it , it would have –cause almost all that stuff came from one place only : Scooter Libby and the shop around the vice president . ”
Richer contests the account .
In an unusual move , the White House issued a denial in Richer ’s name when the details of the book were released earlier this month .
In it , Richer declared , “ I never received direction from George Tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document … as outlined in Mr. Suskind ’s book . ”
Suskind , however , says he has a tape of their conversation , which took place earlier this year .
His prior accounts of internal Administration machinations have stood up under scrutiny .
Conyers asked that Richer “ set up a time ” to discuss allegations surrounding the false letter .
“ According to recent allegations in your capacity as the former CIA Deputy Director of Clandestine Operations and Chief of the Near East Division , you were tasked by former CIA Director George Tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the White House stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written , ” Conyers wrote Richer Wednesday .
“ Given your reported direct knowledge of these events , I am requesting that you contact Judiciary Committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter . ”
Full transcripts of the letters follow .
Conyers also wrote John Hannah , Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs .
Book asserts
White House ordered forged letter
Suskind ’s book , The Way of The World , asserts that senior Bush officials ordered the CIA to forge a document “ proving ” that Saddam Hussein had been trying to manufacture nuclear weapons and was collaborating with al Qaeda .
The alleged result was a faked memorandum from then chief of Saddam ’s intelligence service Tahir Jalil Habbush dated July 1 , 2001 , and written to Hussein .
The bogus memo claimed that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had received training in Baghdad but also discussed the arrival of a “ shipment ” from Niger , which the Administration claimed had supplied Iraq with yellowcake uranium — based on yet another forged document whose source remains uncertain .
The memo subsequently was treated as fact by the British Sunday Telegraph , and cited by William Safire in his New York Times column , providing fodder for Bush ’s efforts to take the US to war .
It is likely the Vice President ’s Office will refer to Richer ’s denial on the matter and claim that discussions between the Vice President ’s staff and the Vice President are protected .
Libby , who was convicted of four counts of obstruction of justice and perjury , was sentenced to 30 months in prison but had his sentence commuted by President Bush in July 2007 .

My Experience at Indy Mac : Fraud , Corruption , Criminality
Long time readers are familiar with my fascination with antique sports cars .
One of my pals , Jan , is a well known Porsche collector who is also affiliated with the International Automotive Appraisers Association ( IAAA ) .
Its a hobby for him , and he specializes in the rehabilitation and appraisal of antique sports cars .
He has rebuilt and appraised everything from celebrity Bugattis to classic Ferraris to modern supercars .
I call Jan " landed gentry " -- he 's owned a major car rental firm ( sold it ) , develops real estate , buys / sells land and houses .
He is quasi- retired , leaving him plenty of time to play with his many fine automobiles -- and for us to discuss the housing market collapse .
Amongst our many discussions , we have gone over the issue of housing appraisal fraud .
So when the IAAA newsletter sent out the tale ( below ) to its members as a warning against fraud , conflict of interest , and corruption , it got his attention -- and he forwarded it to me .
His comments were : " This is even worse than the nightmare of corruption you described . "
Let me hasten to add that many appraisers were offended by the corruption of colleagues in their industry , especially those greased by the worst elements among mortgage brokers and real estate agents .
In 2005 , more than 8,000 appraisers -- roughly 10 percent of the industry -- signed a petition asking the federal government to take action ; the White House and Federal agencies demurred , and appraisal fraud continued unabated .
Eventually , Phony and Fraudy cut a deal with NYS AG Cuomo to stop enabling the appraisal fraud .
Which brings us to the now defunct Indy Mac , and the below diatribe about the criminality , corruption , and rampant appraisal fraud that was the CountryWide spinoff 's stock in trade .
The original piece was published by Vernon Martin at the Appraiser 's Forum ( http://appraisersforum.com).
His story is utterly fascinating , and it deserves wider distribution .
Martin was the chief commercial appraiser for Indy Mac from October 15 , 2001 , to when he was terminated six months later for failing to look the other way or actively engage in fraud .
Most of the details below are culled from the public record of his wrongful termination litigation , which was eventually settled in Martin 's favor .
My quick overview of the conflicts , fraud , and criminality at Indy Mac --
Fraud :
• Underwriting loans based on appraised values well above purchase prices ; • Fabricating rent rolls for commercial properties to be appraised ; • Over-stating Construction work as 80 % complete versus 15 % in actuality ;
• Attempting to change discounted cash flow models for subdivisions in order to increase appraised value ;
Criminality :
• Attempted intimidation of Appraisers ; • Providing false information to appraisers ;
Conflict of interests :
• Appraising a development where the land was being purchasing from David Loeb , IndyMac ’s Chairman of the Board ; •
On one transaction , the CEO 's father and father - in - law were commercial construction inspectors for the firm ; the loan officer was the CEO 's brother ( a former police officer with no loan experience ) ;
That 's just the overview .
Amazingly , these events took place before the enormous Housing and Construction boom from 2003 - 06 .
One is left to imagine just how insane the place must have been during that period .
I 'd love to find the details , and given the enormous lending losses -- $ 8B and counting -- we can only begin to imagine what sort of rampant fraud took place .
I hope the FDIC releases a full report of their investigation of the collapse of Indy Mac .
( Gee , I wonder how Senator Schumer caused THOSE problems back in 2001 ?
CNBC should know better than to publish trash such as this . )
You really need to read the entire piece to get a feel as to just how much of a criminal enterprise Indy Mac was before it went under .
Is it any surprise the entire firm , and not just any individuals , are under FBI investigation for Fraud ?
~~~
These things have a tendency to disappear , so I am capturing a PDF and the text ( after the jump ) in case it somehow vanishes .

My experience at IndyMac
________________________________________
I ’ve shared some tidbits with you in the last month about my experience at IndyMac as their chief commercial appraiser from October 2001 to the end of March 2002 .
Now that IndyMac has been seized by FDIC and their legal staff presumably unemployed , I will tell the rest of the story .
Some people tell me that it must have been hell for me , but I look back on it as an adventure , like sailing into the “ Perfect Storm ” , a perfect storm of corruption and incompetence , and living to tell about it .
I first became acquainted with IndyMac through OTS appraisal examiner Darryl Washington , MAI .
Darryl used to examine my appraisal department each year when at Home Savings of America , which was acquired by WAMU in 1998 .
During the summer of 2001 , I had a chance encounter with him at a jazz concert .
I asked him what he had been up to , and he told me that he had just completed the first examination of IndyMac Bank , which had just received its savings and loan charter only a year before .
He said , “ Vern , they could use a guy like you . ”
Several weeks later I saw the chief commercial appraiser position for IndyMac Bank posted on Monster.com .
I responded with a cover letter that started with “ Darryl Washington of the OTS suggested that I contact you …. ”
Apparently , that was the right way to start the letter .
IMB ’s chief credit officer called me soon , asking “ do you know Darryl Washington ? ’
I said “ Yes , he examined my department annually at Home Savings . ”
His next question was “ Do you know how to deal with him ? ”
I assured the chief credit officer that I was used to dealing with the OTS and Darryl and that I could get IMB into compliance with OTS appraisal regulations .
After 3 interviews , IMB wanted me to start right away , because the OTS was returning in November .
I started on 10/15/01 and had a month to familiarize myself with their commercial lending practices until the OTS showed up .
At the end of my first week , there was an urgent need to field review an appraisal of a subdivision in the Sacramento area .
I went up there on the weekend , but also took along some other recent appraisal reports from the Sacramento area .
One of the other appraisal reports concerned me .
A residential subdivision had been appraised as “ 80 % complete ” , but when I visited it , it had only been rough - graded , probably no more than 15 % complete .
When I returned to the office on Monday I asked who the construction inspector was for that region .
I was told that there were two inspectors for the Sacramento area ; one was CEO Mike Perry ’s father and the other one was Mike Perry ’s father - in - law .
The loan officer on the deal was Mike Perry ’s younger brother , Roger , who had recently been hired .
His previous experience had been as a cop .
Thereafter I heard of favoritism towards relatives of Mike Perry and “ FOMs ” , and the chief credit officer advised me to take special care of Mike Perry ’s brother .
( “ FOM ” was IndyMac jargon for “ Friend of Mike ” . )
I reported my Sacramento findings in a private memo to the chief credit officer , who then distributed it to the senior managers at the construction lending subsidiary known as the Construction Lending Corporation of America ( CLCA ) .
The senior credit officer from CLCA , the manager who most resembled Tony Soprano , was the one to call me .
He asked “ Are you sure you saw what you said you saw ? ” in a rather chilling manner .
He said he had been on site with Roger Perry and had seen things differently .
After that call , I asked the chief credit officer why CLCA ’s senior credit officer would want me to recant my report .
He told me that the senior credit officer received sales commissions for every loan made , which seemed to me like a blatant conflict of interest .
All appraisals were ordered by the loan officers from a list of approved appraisers maintained by LandAmerica .
I was not allowed to order appraisals , but I recognized many names on the LandAmerica list as well known , reputable appraisers .
What I began to observe , however , was that loan officers were learning which appraisers were more “ flexible ” than others .
My areas of concern were extraordinary assumptions , lack of feasibility analysis , and false information given to appraisers .
As an example , I read an appraisal of a vacant , former Costco warehouse which had been purchased for $ 2 million several months before , but was appraised for $ 17 million based on a fabricated rent roll composed of tenants that had never signed a lease or a letter of intent .
Only one tenant actually moved in .
I told the loan officer that I could not accept the appraisal report , as it was hypothetical .
He wanted me to approve it , any way , with the understanding that no funds would be disbursed until the prospective tenants could be verified .
I told him that I was n’t going to approve a hypothetical appraisal .
The loan was funded , any way .
My only substantive encounter with CEO Mike Perry was in November 2001 .
I was summoned late to an impromptu meeting of senior executives in the board room .
When I arrived , the meeting was already underway .
The tone of the meeting was very different than senior executive meetings at other companies I had worked for .
Mr. Perry , a man in his thirties , was spinning ideas and executives who were 10 or 20 years his senior were behaving like “ yes men ” , competing to agree with his ideas .
There were lots of raised hands and enthusiastic participation .
He seemed to be enjoying this , in an immature , megalomaniacal way .
Then he turned to me with an idea .
He asked me if I , as the chief commercial appraiser , had the regulatory authority to change the discounted cash flow models in each subdivision appraisal , which might have the effect of changing appraised values .
I said that I could possibly do it , but why ?
He smiled and said " Do n't housing prices always go up ? "
( Was he really too young to remember the early 1990s ? )
I told him that it was n’t a good idea , because we were already hiring competent appraisers who had more local knowledge than I had .
Unless I could show that their analysis was flawed , it would be inappropriate for me to change the appraisals .
That answer seemed to anger him .
At the end of the meeting , the chief credit officer tried to introduce me to him , but he turned his back on me .
I later learned that Mike Perry was hired as CEO of IndyMac at the age of 30 when it was spun off by Countrywide .
He had been an accountant at Countrywide and a protégé of Countrywide founders David Loeb and Angelo Mozilo .
When the OTS arrived mid-November , my review duties were handed over to LandAmerica .
I was to spend full time responding to findings from OTS examiner Darryl Washington .
In the ensuing month it became increasingly obvious that the main reason I was there was to refute OTS findings and serve as window dressing for an institution that scoffed at or was wholly ignorant of federal regulations .
Many , if not most , of the senior executives had come over from Countrywide , which was an unregulated mortgage bank .
One of the craziest violations of OTS regulations was underwriting loans based on appraised values well above purchase prices .
For example , a prominent Sacramento developer purchased a piece of land for $ 18 million , a price most reasonably supported by the comps , but it was appraised and underwritten at a value above $ 30 million , the rationale being that this developer added value to the property just by buying it .
This does not satisfy the USPAP and federally accepted definition of market value , however .
The appraisal firm was the same one used for the supposedly 80 % complete subdivision .
I was present at several confrontational meetings between the OTS and FDIC examiners and CLCA executives .
It seemed that IMB was intent on refuting every finding and using me towards that end .
I was criticized for not arguing enough with the examiners .
After the examination was over , there was an unsolicited appraisal report waiting for me on my desk .
A piece of land next to an airport had recently been purchased for $ 24,375,000 and was almost immediately appraised for more than $ 65 million based on the owner ’s plans to build an airport parking lot .
This was three months after September 11th , 2001 and average parking lot occupancy at this airport had declined from 73 % to about the low fifties .
The appraisal lacked a sales comparison approach and its feasibility analysis was based on pre-September 11th data .
The feasibility analysis was done by the same consultant who caused the city of Los Angeles to lose millions on the parking garage at Hollywood and Highland .
The appraisal was done by an unapproved appraiser who had previously caused my previous employer , Home Savings , to set up a $ 17 million loan loss reserve on a hotel he appraised for $ 450 million and the loan defaulted within a year .
The report was delivered less than a week after it was ordered by the IMB loan officer , leading me to suspect that it had already been completed for someone else , most likely the borrower .
I told CLCA executives that I could not accept the report and that I considered it to be biased .
I tried to get the appraiser to change the report , but he immediately called the chief lending officer , who must have then instructed him to ignore my request .
Despite my stated objections to the appraisal report , the chief lending officer told the Loan Committee that I had ordered and approved the appraisal , and they funded a $ 30 million loan .
Thereafter , there was sustained pressure on me to approve the report .
I responded that I would have to write my own report , since the original appraiser would not make changes .
This bought me time .
Meanwhile , the airport , who had previously owned 80 % of the parking spaces in the area , was suing the developer and erected a fence to keep people from walking from the parking lot to the terminals .
The chief lending officer also pressured me to accept another unsolicited appraisal of a Sacramento - area subdivision .
This report was based on an “ extraordinary assumption ” that a road led to the subject property .
When I went up to Sacramento to see the property , there was no road .
In January I went to Sparks , Nevada , to review an appraisal of the last phase of a condominium project .
The first phase , with condos on the golf course , was a success , but the last phase was on the opposite side from the golf course and actually sloped below grade .
The appraiser made an $ 8000 downward adjustment for each unit , and I questioned whether $ 8000 was adjusting enough .
That provoked warnings from several executives , including the chief credit officer .
The developer was buying the land from David Loeb , IndyMac ’s Chairman of the Board ( and co-founder of Countrywide ) , and I was warned that challenging this deal could get me fired .
Soon after , the chief credit officer came to my office with a representative from human resources to announce that my initial 90 - day probation would be extended for another 90 days , as CLCA executives had complained about my lack of cooperation with them .
The HR rep had a look of horror on her face the whole time he delivered this message .
I finally finished my own airport parking lot appraisal report in late March , the same week that the Bush Administration laid off most of the OTS examiners .
I do n’t know which event precipitated my termination .
My appraisal of the airport parking lot estimated the stabilized value at $ 37 million in year 2003 and the value upon completion as $ 31 million in 2002 .
These appraised values were considered insufficient to support the $ 30 million loan .
IMB gave me two weeks ’ notice of my impending termination and offered me $ 25,000 severance pay if I turned over all documents and signed a non-disclosure agreement .
I told them that state law required me to keep records of all of my appraisals and reviews , and that $ 25,000 was not enough .
After a few days of seeing that I was not cooperating , I was summoned to a final meeting with the chief legal officer and “ chief people officer ” .
A written statement indicated that I was being terminated for having a “ communication problem ” .
I asked for examples of my communication problem , but none were presented .
( I later recounted , during a deposition , that I was left alone with the chief legal officer for a few minutes of awkward silence .
I then asked him , “ Does n’t it bother you that I am being fired for a communication problem without any evidence against me ? ”
He said , “ Not at all . ”
This cracked up my attorney . )
After the meeting , I was escorted back to my office by a large security guard to collect my personal belongings , and then I was escorted out of the building , with my toothbrush in my left hand and my toothpaste in my right hand .
During these last days I contacted OTS about the abuses going on at IMB and said I had documentary evidence .
They flew in to Burbank to meet me and they debriefed me for a couple of hours .
They were upfront about how the flow of information had to be one way , from me to them , and not vice versa .
I had to call my friends at IMB to find out how OTS was responding .
The OTS paid a special visit to IMB and called for an internal audit to investigate my allegations .
The first audit was considered a whitewash , and the OTS called for a re-audit .
Interestingly enough , there was even a document produced that supposedly indicated my approval of the appraisal of the “ 80 % complete subdivision ” .
The second audit corroborated most of my allegations and the OTS called for certain personnel changes .
The president and senior credit officer of CLCA were ousted ; the chief lending officer had his loan approval privileges removed .
Chairman of the Board David Loeb suddenly and coincidentally retired at the same time .
He died 5 months later .
Interestingly enough , at about this same time , I read in the press of IMB receiving a “ corporate governance ” award from some organization , for having an impartial and effective board of directors .
I had an excellent attorney .
Besides suing for wrongful termination , he showed me that I could actually sue for discrimination .
Many states , including California , have laws that prevent discrimination against employees who are upholding public policy , which was the very reason that got me fired .
Other bank appraisers should take note of this .
USPAP and OTS appraisal regulations are public policy .
In interrogatories sent to IndyMac during the litigation , they were once again asked to demonstrate evidence of my “ communication problem ” .
The only evidence provided was a memo from me about a borrower “ trying to deceive us ” and a memo from a loan officer complaining that I actually called Union Pacific Railroad concerning one of his deals , a subdivision being built close to a railroad right - of - way .
I was told by the loan officer that the track was no longer used , but Union Pacific disclosed to me that it was still being used once a day during the evening hours .
Interestingly enough , in the six months of unemployment and underemployment which followed my termination , I rented many videos , one of which was “ The Insider ” , the real - life story of Dr. Jeffrey Wygand , who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry to Sixty Minutes and was also fired , coincidentally , for having a “ communication problem . ”
Most of this information is already publicly disclosed in my lawsuit , filed 7/15/02 in Los Angeles Superior Court , Case Number BC277619 , for anyone wanting further details .
As for the results of that lawsuit , the only thing I can legally say is that “ the matter has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both parties ” .

Commercial real estate is the next shoe to drop .
Mark it down .
Posted by : Jeff | Jul 25 , 2008 10:56:00 AM
Welcome to the fourth installment of Enumerating Enumerable , a series of articles in which I challenge myself to do a better job of documenting Ruby ’s Enumerable module than RubyDoc.org does .
In this article , I ’ll cover Enumerable #count , one of the new methods added to Enumerable in Ruby 1.9 .
In case you missed the earlier installments , they ’re listed ( and linked ) below :
Enumerable #count Quick Summary
In the simplest possible terms
How many items in the collection meet the given criteria ?
Ruby version 1.9 only Expects Either :
An argument to be matched against the items in the collection
A block containing an expression to test the items in the collection Returns
The number of items in the collection that meet the given criteria .
RubyDoc.org ’s entry Enumerable #count
Enumerable #count and Arrays
When used on an array and an argument is provided , count returns the number of times the value of the argument appears in the array :
# How many instances of " zoom " are there in the array ?
[ " zoom " , " schwartz " , " profigliano " , " zoom " ] . count ( " zoom " ) =>
2 # Prior to Ruby 1.9 , you 'd have to use this equivalent code : [ " zoom " , " schwartz " , " profigliano " , " zoom " ] . select { |word| word == " zoom " }.size => 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # How many instances of " zoom " are there in the array ? [ " zoom " , " schwartz " , " profigliano " , " zoom " ] . count ( " zoom " ) = > 2 # Prior to Ruby 1.9 , you ' d have to use this equivalent code : [ " zoom " , " schwartz " , " profigliano " , " zoom " ] . select { | word | word == " zoom " } . size = > 2
When used on an array and a block is provided , count returns the number of items in the array for which the block returns true :
# How many members of " The Mosquitoes " ( a Beatles - esque band that appeared on # " Gilligan 's Island " ) have names following the " B*ngo " format ?
[ " Bingo " , " Bango " , " Bongo " , " Irving " ] . count {|bandmate| bandmate =~ / B[a-z] ngo/ } =>
3 # Prior to Ruby 1.9 , you 'd have to use this equivalent code : [ " Bingo " , " Bango " , " Bongo " , " Irving " ] . select {|bandmate| bandmate =~ / B[a-z ] ngo/}.size 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # How many members of " The Mosquitoes " ( a Beatles - esque band that appeared on # " Gilligan 's Island " ) have names following the " B*ngo " format ? [ " Bingo " , " Bango " , " Bongo " , " Irving " ] . count { | bandmate | bandmate = ~ / B [ a - z ] ngo / } = >
3 # Prior to Ruby 1.9 , you ' d have to use this equivalent code : [ " Bingo " , " Bango " , " Bongo " , " Irving " ] . select { | bandmate | bandmate = ~ / B [ a - z ] ngo / } . size
RubyDoc.org says that when count is used on an array without an argument or a block , it simply returns the number of items in the array ( which is what the length / size methods do ) .
However , when I ’ve tried it in irb and ruby , I got results like this :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .count => #< Enumerable : : Enumerator:0x189d784 > 1 2 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
count = > # & lt ; Enumerable :: Enumerator : 0x189d784 & gt ;
Enumerable #count and Hashes
As with arrays , when used on a hash and an argument is provided , count returns the number of times the value of the argument appears in the hash .
The difference is that for the comparison , each key / value pair is treated as a two - element array , with the key being element 0 and the value being element 1 .
# Here 's a hash where the names of recent movies are keys # and their metacritic.com ratings are the corresponding values .
movie_ratings = { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " => 88 , " The Love Guru " => 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " => 93 } => { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " = > 88 , " The Love Guru " = > 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " = > 93 } #
This statement will return a count of 0 , since there is no item in movie_ratings # that 's just plain " Iron Man " . movie_ratings.count ( " Iron Man " ) =>
0 # This statement will return a count of 1 , since there is an item in movie_ratings # with the key " Iron Man " and the corresponding value 93 . movie_ratings.count ( [ " Iron Man " , 93 ] ) => 1 # This statement will return a count of 0 .
There 's an item in movie_ratings # with the key " Iron Man " , but its corresponding value is NOT 92 . movie_ratings.count ( [ " Iron Man " , 92 ] ) => 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # Here 's a hash where the names of recent movies are keys # and their metacritic.com ratings are the corresponding values .
movie_ratings = { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " => 88 , " The Love Guru " => 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " => 93 } => { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " = > 88 , " The Love Guru " = > 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " = > 93 } #
This statement will return a count of 0 , since there is no item in movie_ratings # that ' s just plain " Iron Man " .
movie_ratings .
count ( " Iron Man " ) = > 0 # This statement will return a count of 1 , since there is an item in movie_ratings # with the key " Iron Man " and the corresponding value 93 .
movie_ratings .
count ( [ " Iron Man " , 93 ] ) = > 1 # This statement will return a count of 0 .
There ' s an item in movie_ratings # with the key " Iron Man " , but its corresponding value is NOT 92 .
movie_ratings .
count ( [ " Iron Man " , 92 ] ) = > 0
count is not useful when used with a hash and an argument .
It will only ever return two values :
1 if the argument is a two - element array and there is an item in the hash whose key matches element [ 0 ] of the array and whose value matches element [ 1 ] of the array .
if the argument is a two - element array and there is an item in the hash whose key matches element [ 0 ] of the array and whose value matches element [ 1 ] of the array .
0 for all other cases .
When used with a hash and a block , count is more useful .
count passes each key / value pair in the hash to the block , which you can “ catch ” as either :
A two - element array , with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1 , or Two separate items , with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item .
Each key / value pair is passed to the block and count returns the number of items in the hash for which the block returns true .
# Once again , a hash where the names of recent movies are keys # and their metacritic.com ratings are the corresponding values .
movie_ratings = { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " => 88 , " The Love Guru " => 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " => 93 } => { " Get Smart " => 53 , " Kung Fu Panda " = > 88 , " The Love Guru " = > 15 , " Sex and the City " => 51 , " Iron Man " = > 93 } # How many movie titles in the collection start # in the first half of the alphabet ?

A reporter and photographer from two Japanese news organisations were detained and beaten by Chinese police as they were covering yesterday 's terrorist attack on a police station in Xinjiang province , the organisations said .
Uighur separatists killed 16 police when they attacked a police station using a truck , home - made explosives and knives .
The two organisations said Masami Kawakita , a 38 - year - old photographer from the Chunichi Shimbun newspaper 's Tokyo headquarters , and Shinji Katsuta , a 37 - year old reporter from Nippon Television Network 's China General Bureau , both suffered light injuries .
The two men arrived in Kashgar late on Monday and were stopped by force when covering the incident .
They were allegedly taken inside a nearby hotel , and were beaten before being released two hours later .
Japan plans to protest to China over the alleged detention and beating by police , a top government official said .
" Our embassy is of course gathering information from the authorities , " said Japan 's top government spokesman , Nobutaka Machimura .
" I believe there is no mistake , so we plan to protest strongly . "
Police may have detained the reporters on suspicion that they were taking pictures of a nearby military facility , said spokesman Kenji Kikata of Nippon Television .
" It is extremely unfortunate that a working reporter who followed the correct procedures should be the victim of violence , " the company said in an official statement .
Chinese police have arrested two ethnic Uighurs , members of a minority that resents Chinese control of the region , for Monday 's bomb attack , which marred the final countdown to the Olympics .
Japan 's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda , a long - term advocate of warmer ties with China , is set to attend the opening ceremony in Beijing on Friday .

The national average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline climbed by 1.1 cents today – up from $ 3.68 to $ 3.691 – marking the first daily price increase in 43 days .
Since hitting its record high of $ 4.12 per gallon on July 16 , the price of gasoline has fallen or remained steady , up until this morning .
Currently , only Hawaii and Alaska are reporting state - wide average gas prices above $ 4 per gallon , at $ 4.55 and $ 4.40 , respectively .
New Jersey has the lowest state - wide average gas price at $ 3.44 per gallon .
But , keep in mind , while the recent price declines have come as a welcome relief , we ’re still paying more than a third more for gas than we were just a year ago .
Today ’s slight price increase is more than likely due to fears that Hurricane Gustav may cause significant damage to the Gulf ’s oil refineries .
The Gulf Coast is home to nearly 40 % of the United State ’s oil refining capacity , so should there be significant damage to these facilities , the price of gasoline will likely spike , and could soar well past the record high set back in the middle of July .
For example , in the days following Hurricane Katrina , the national average price of gas climbed from $ 2.60 to $ 3.05 – a jump of nearly 20 % .
Should the same thing happen – and right now it is considered very unlikely that Gustav will reach the same size as Katrina – the price of gasoline would climb to nearly $ 4.35 per gallon .
Again , as of right now , this certainly seems very unlikely , but that being said , you should probably go ahead and fill up your gas tanks tonight or tomorrow just to be on the safe side !
Google will have to turn over every record of every video watched by YouTube users , including users ' names and IP addresses , to Viacom , which is suing Google for allowing clips of its copyright videos to appear on YouTube , a judge ruled Wednesday .
Viacom wants the data to prove that infringing material is more popular than user - created videos , which could be used to increase Google 's liability if it is found guilty of contributory infringement .
Viacom filed suit against Google in March 2007 , seeking more than $ 1 billion in damages for allowing users to upload clips of Viacom 's copyright material .
Google argues that the law provides a safe harbor for online services so long as they comply with copyright takedown requests .
Although Google argued that turning over the data would invade its users ' privacy , the judge 's ruling ( .pdf ) described that argument as " speculative " and ordered Google to turn over the logs on a set of four tera - byte hard drives .
The judge also turned Google 's own defense of its data retention policies – that IP addresses of computers are n't personally revealing in and of themselves , against it to justify the log dump .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has already reacted , calling the order a violation of the Video Privacy Protection act that " threatens to expose deeply private information . "
The order also requires Google to turn over copies of all videos that it has taken down for any reason .
Viacom also requested YouTube 's source code , the code for identifying repeat copyright infringement uploads , copies of all videos marked private , and Google 's advertising database schema .
Those requests were denied in whole , except that Google will have to turn over data about how often each private video has been watched and by how many persons .
Motorola Razr 2020
The Motorola Razr is the most personal phone I 've ever used .
The foldable screen clamshell shape opens the door to redefining our relationship with mobile devices and how we use them .
But I wo n't be buying one .
EVEN before landing back in the US , Olympic swimming champ Michael Phelps , winner of eight gold medals in Beijing and the man being hailed as the greatest Olympian of all time , was converting his fame into a big pool of Yankee dollars .
Phelps snagged an estimated $ 1.6 million advance from the Free Press imprint of Simon & Schuster for his latest book , to be called “ Built to Succeed . ”
Waxman Literary Agency , working with Phelps ’ long - time talent manager Peter Carlisle of Octagon , brokered the deal , which had a $ 1 million floor price just to get into the hunt .
At least a half - dozen major publishers took a look before Dominick Anfuso , editorial director of Free Press , landed the deal .
In the book , which is being called an “ inspirational memoir , ” the publisher said that Phelps will reveal the secrets of his success , and give a behind - the - scenes look at his approach to training , competition and winning .
The narrative thread is expected to be the eight final swims of the 2008 games .
The book will make it onto bookshelves by December .
Phelps , now 23 , had first signed up with Carlisle when he was 15 and was just starting to turn pro .
Phelps ’ coach , Bob Bowman , had first approached Carlisle about repping Phelps , but Carlisle rebuffed Bowman ’s overture .
At the time , Carlisle was heavily involved in the burgeoning snowboarding scene and did n’t want to diversify .
But Bowman persisted and now Carlisle has his own version of Olympic marketing gold , thanks to his most famous client .
Carlisle told The Wall Street Journal recently that he thinks Phelps will eventually earn $ 100 million in his lifetime from marketing and endorsement deals .
Phelps has already earned a $ 1 million bonus from swimwear maker Speedo , at the Olympics , for breaking the 36 - year - old record for the most gold medals earned in a single Olympics , which was set by Mark Spitz .
Last year , Phelps was said to have earned about $ 5 million from marketing and endorsement deals with companies like Visa , Omega , Power Bar , Speedo and AT&T .
This year , experts say he ’ll easily double that figure .
Whatever Phelps ’ long - term selling power turns out to be , he has already passed one of the early marks of hotness by selling out magazine covers .
Sports Illustrated put Phelps on the cover of the Aug. 25 issue that hit newsstands last Thursday with his eight gold medals forming an Olympic necklace - a reprise of Spitz ’ famous SI cover in 1972 .
Early estimates are that Phelps ’ issue sold close to 130,000 copies on newsstands – a 54,000 - copy , or 72 percent , surge over the 75,640 copies that the magazine sold in an average week in the second half of 2007 .
Dara ’s deal
Dara Torres , the 41 - year - old swimmer , wrapped up her two - book deal with the Broadway imprint of Random House Inc. , even before she splashed down in Beijing and promptly added three more medals to her collection .
Torres , who came out of retirement two years ago , after the birth of her first child , to prepare for her final Olympic event , plans to write a yet - to - be titled inspirational memoir scheduled to be on shelves next April .
The second book , a fitness guide , wo n’t hit shelves until the spring of 2011 .
The books were purchased by Stacy Creamer , editor - in - chief for Broadway , in a deal brokered by Evan Morgenstein at Premier Management Group .
Torres has competed in the 1984 , 1988 , 1992 and 2000 Olympics and has 12 Olympic medals overall , including five golds and the three silvers that she added to her haul at the Beijing Games .
Fast track
Doubleday is speeding up the release of “ The Man Who Owns the News , ” the Michael Wolff tome on Rupert Murdoch , the chairman of News Corp. ( which owns The Post ) and its epic $ 5.4 billion takeover of The Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones .
The book , which Amazon still lists as landing on shelves in February , will now be out in early December .
Wolff , a columnist at Vanity Fair , is going to be able to doubly hype the book .
First , he ’s writing about Murdoch for his monthly column in the October issue that hits newsstands next week .
Then Vanity Fair ’s December issue , which hits in November , will feature an excerpt from the book .
A spokesman for Doubleday said , “ We expect to get 100,000 copies out to start . ”
Last August , Wolff snagged what is believed to have been a $ 1 million advance to write the book for which Murdoch agreed to grant access .

A navy officer who seduced her ex-lover and then cried rape was jailed for a year yesterday .
Erin Casson , 27 , had sex with Brian Eaton three months after their relationship ended at the home of her new boyfriend .
Police dropped her rape claim after suspicions she was lying about the attack and charged her with making a false allegation .
Communications officer Casson was found guilty yesterday of perverting the course of justice .
Jailing her at Portsmouth crown court , Judge Graham
White told her : " You put Mr Eaton through hell . "
Casson , of Portchester , Hants , has since wed her Royal Navy boyfriend .
Knock - based commands for your Linux laptop
Knock some sense into your computer with an HDAPS - aware kernel , an accelerometer - enabled laptop , and this Perl script
In 2003 , IBM began releasing ThinkPad laptop computers with integrated accelerometers and associated software to protect the hard disks when the unit is dropped .
Enterprising hackers from IBM and elsewhere have worked to develop modules for the Linux kernel to take advantage of these sensors .
On - screen display orientation , desktop switching , even game control and real - time 3D models of the tilt of the laptop are now available .
This article presents a new twist -- knock codes -- and a simple program to run commands when specific knock codes are detected .
Using an updated Linux kernel with the HDAPS driver , you can use a simple program called knockAge to generate knock codes .
You can also download and use a Perl script to customize your own knocking input environment .
See the Downloadable resources and Related topics sections at the bottom of this article for links , including links to see knockAge in action .
Hardware requirements
Easy does it As you can see from watching the demonstration video ( see the link in Related topics , below ) , the knocking action consists only of light taps with the knuckles .
Although the ThinkPad 's accelerometers are designed to protect it from accidental impact , too much force can damage it .
So be careful out there .
Many IBM ( now Lenovo ) ThinkPads manufactured in 2003 or later have the HDAPS hardware .
If you are unsure of your hardware configuration , check the technical details on Lenovo 's Web site for your model .
If you do not have a ThinkPad , this code will not function on your laptop .
This article was written on an x86 architecture .
The code in this article was developed and tested on two different models of the ThinkPad T42 p .
See the Related topics section for links to ThinkPad hardware .
If you have an Apple MacBook , you should have the accelerometers and the same general methods available to access them through the kernel .
However , the code in this article is untested on Apple hardware .
Software requirements
The HDAPS driver must be included in the kernel to enable access to the accelerometers .
Attempts to patch my existing kernel were unsuccessful , so I recommend downloading the latest kernel from your favorite mirror .
The newer kernel distributions come with the HDAPS drivers included .
Fire up your kernel configurator of choice , and include the HDAPS drivers in your config .
The HDAPS drivers are located under the Device Drivers > Hardware Monitoring Support > IBM Hard Drive Active Protection System ( hdaps ) option .
Further kernel configuration and installation instructions are beyond the scope of this article , but there are plenty of tutorials on the Web for detailed help ; see the Related topics section for links to help you get started .
This article was developed and tested on Kernel level 2.6.15.1 .
Creating a simple knocking sequence
Download the source code repository from the Downloadable resources section and find the knock Age.pl script .
This is the main Perl program that allows you to create knock sequences as well as listen for specific knock sequences and run commands .
Let 's go through the user - space usage and configuration of the knock Age.pl program , and then we 'll review its functions .
Run the knock Age.pl program using the following command :
perl knockAge.pl -c
This starts the Perl program listening for knock events and recording their temporal spacing for later use .
Once the program is running , impart some percussive impacts upon your laptop 's case .
You wo n't need to physically move your ThinkPad for the knock event to register , although some slipping and sliding is likely if your ThinkPad is on a synthetic surface .
I recommend holding your ThinkPad on the left side near the hinge with your left hand while knocking with your right hand approximately three inches above the bottom right of the LCD panel on the side of the display frame .
Please see the demonstration video linked to in Downloadable resources or Related topics for an example of creating a knock sequence .
Experiment with different paces and strengths in your knocking to get a feel for the resolution of events that the knock Age program can capture .
This is important for creating more complex knocks .
Your first actual trial knock should be simple , with 0.5 seconds between knocks for a " double tap . "
Run perl knockAge.pl -c again , and when you see " enter a knock sequence , " firmly knock twice on the side of the LCD with one half second delay , then stop .
An automatic timeout will occur after 4 seconds ( configurable ) , and your knocking sequence will be printed out similar to the following example :
0 540031 _#_ ( command here ) _#_ < comments here >
Let 's dissect that line -- knock sequence , delimiter , command area , delimiter , and comment area .
Your next step is to copy this line into the default configuration file for the knock Age.pl program , {$HOME}/.knockFile , which is probably / home /< username>/.knockFile .
Once you have created the .
knock
File with the above knocking sequence line , you can modify the line to run a program .
Change the ( command here ) text to / bin / echo " double tap " , and modify the comments area to something more descriptive , like so :
0 540031 _#_ / bin /echo " double tap " _#_ Double tap event
Now that you have modified the configuration file to print out a notification , run the knock Age script in daemon mode with the command :
perl knockAge.pl
The program will silently listen in the background for any of the events from the ~/.knock File listing .
Try your double tap with the same temporal spacing , and you will see the text " double tap " printed to the screen .
If you want to see the functioning of the knock Age.pl script in more detail , run it in daemon mode with the command :
perl knockAge.pl -v
Locking and unlocking your screen using xscreensaver
Creating a " password " sequence
Run the knock Age.pl program in " create " mode with the command :
perl knockAge.pl -c
You now need to create an unlocking password sequence ; I recommend something like " Shave and a Haircut . "
Make sure you pick something that you can consistently perform accurately .
Although you 'll be able to modify the parameters that control the precision with which you need to enter your secret knock , it can still be very difficult to match the precise timing .
" Shave and a Haircut , " in addition to provoking uncontrollable singing in animated rabbits , is a good mix between complexity and simplicity for a screensaver unlocking password .
Here is an example knock sequence for " Shave and a Haircut " :
0 564025 1185795 621350 516038 960035 444421 _#_ / bin /echo " shave the haircut " _#_ two bits
Before you move on to the next step , you should practice with the above command and the first double tap in your ~/.knock File configuration file .
This will help later when the screensaver is running and it is more difficult to detect if you are knocking correctly .
Command configuration for xscreensaver
The following setup assumes that you are logged into your window manager , and the xscreensaver program has been started by your userid .
For example , if you are running Fedora Core 4 and log in to KDE through gdm , xscreensaver is started automatically .
So , to activate it , change the double tap command from :
/ bin/echo " double tap "
to :
xscreensaver - command - activate &
Now , whenever the " double tap " event is recognized , the xscreensaver program will activate with whatever settings you have specified .
Once the screensaver is activated , you can unlock the screen by typing in your password if so configured .
What we really want to do , though , is impress our friends with the secret unlocking code to disable the screensaver .
So , replace the following command for the " secret password sequence " in your ~/.knock File :
/ bin /echo " shave the haircut "
with :
killall xscreensaver ; nohup xscreensaver - nosplash >/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
This command will kill all of the xscreensaver programs currently running , then restart the xscreensaver in the background .
Now you can repeatedly lock and unlock your computer 's screensaver just by knocking on the side of the case .
Is this faster or better in any way than setting up a custom key combination ?
Not really .
Is it more secure or more convenient than Bluetooth proximity locking ?
Probably not .
Is it cooler ?
Yep .
More examples
HDAPS sensors and the knock Age.pl program provide an additional user input device that you can use in unique ways .
For example :
If you plan on testing a new X config file on the plane , update the double tap entry to restart your good X server .
No more keyboard lockups forcing hard resets .
Place the location of any shell script you like in the command area , and use a double tap to check your e-mail .
Knock in the latest break beat from your rave mix , and have the ThinkLight blink out a secret Morse code location of the WWII - era gold storage facility in Kinakuta .
Tap in Morse code to avoid keyloggers .
See the Related topics section for some great examples of reading the " tilt " of the ThinkPad for games , display tools , and more .
Or skip right ahead and set the Threshold variable to 15 so when you drop kick your ThinkPad it will automatically reboot .
The knock Age.pl code
History and strategy
The hdaps - gl. c code written by Jeff Molofee is the basis for the knock Age.pl code .
Hdaps - gl.c is a great demonstration program of how the tilt sensor can be used to display information about the ThinkPad 's orientation in real time .
The substantial differences here are the isolation of specific events in time to create a knock , along with the associated code to create and listen for a knock sequence .
Parameter configuration
Let 's start at the top of knock Age.pl with the timing and sensor - critical parameters :
Listing 1 . Main program parameters
require ' sys/syscall.ph ' ; # for subsecond timing my $ option = $ ARGV [ 0 ] || " " ; # simple option handling # filename for hdaps sensor reads my $ hdapsFN = " / sys/devices/platform/hdaps/position " ; my $ UPDATE_THRESHOLD = 4 ; # threshold of force that indicates a knock my $ INTERVAL_THRESHOLD = 100000 ; # microseconds of time required between knock # events my $ SLEEP_INTERVAL = 0.01 ; # time to pause between hdaps reads my $ MAX_TIMEOUT_LENGTH = 4 ; # maximum length in seconds of knock pattern # length my $ MAX_KNOCK_DEV = 100000 ; # maximum acceptable deviation between recorded # pattern values and knocking values my $ LISTEN_TIMEOUT = 2 ; # timeout value in seconds between knock # events when in listening mode
These variables and their comments are relatively straightforward .
Their usage and configuration options are explained later in this article .
The following is the remainder of the global variables and their descriptions .
Listing 2 . Knock pattern parameters
my @baseKnocks = ( ) ; # contains knock intervals currently entered my % knockHash = ( ) ; # contains knock patterns , associated commands my $ prevInterval = 0 ; # previous interval of time my $ knockCount = 0 ; # current number of knocks detected my $ restX = 0 ; # `resting ' positiong of X axis accelerometer my $ restY = 0 ; # `resting ' positiong of Y axis accelerometer my $ currX = 0 ; # current position of X axis accelerometer my $ currY = 0 ; # current position of Y axis accelerometer my $ lastX = 0 ; # most recent position of X axis accelerometer my $ lastY = 0 ; # most recent position of Y axis accelerometer my $ startTime = 0 ; # to manage timeout intervals my $ currTime = 0 ; # to manage timeout intervals my $ time
Out = 0 ; # perpetual loop variable my $ knockAge = 0 ; # count of knocks to cycle time interval
Subroutines
First in our list of subroutines is a simple logic block to check if the accelerometer is available for reading :
Listing 3 . Check accelerometer subroutine
sub checkAccelerometer ( ) { my $ ret ; $ ret = readPosition ( ) ; if ( $ ret ) { print " no accelerometer data available - tis bork ed
" ; exit ( 1 ) ; } }#checkAccelerometer
The hdaps - gl.c code from Jeff Molofee provides a great starting point for all of the code in knock Age.pl .
You can see the vestiges of his comments in the readPosition subroutine , below .
This subroutine simply opens the file , reads the current accelerometer data , closes the file , and returns the data without the , ( comma ) characters .
Listing 4 . readPosition subroutine
## comments from Jeff Molofee in hdaps - gl.c #* read_position - read the ( x , y ) position pair from hdaps .
#* #*
We open and close the file on every invocation , which is lame but due to #* several features of sysfs files : #* #* ( a ) Sysfs files are seekable .
#* ( b) Seeking to zero and then rereading does not seem to work .
# # sub readPosition ( ) { my ( $ posX , $ posY ) = " " ; my $ fd = open ( FH , " $ hdapsFN " ) ; while ( < FH > ) {
s/\(//g ; s/\)//g ; ( $ posX , $ posY ) = split " , " ; }# while read close ( FH ) ; return ( $ posX , $ posY ) ; }#readPosition
getEpochSeconds and getEpochMicroSeconds provide detailed and precise information on the status of the knock patterns .
Listing 5 . Time splitters
sub getEpochMicroSeconds { my $ TIMEVAL_T = " LL " ; # LL for microseconds my $ timeVal = pack ( $ TIMEVAL_T , ( ) ) ; syscall ( &SYS_gettimeofday , $ timeVal , 0 ) != - 1 or die " micro seconds : $ ! " ; my @vals = unpack ( $ TIMEVAL_T , $ timeVal ) ; $ timeVal = $ vals [ 0 ] . $ vals [ 1 ] ; $ timeVal = substr ( $ timeVal , 6 ) ; my $ padLen = 10 - length ( $ timeVal ) ; $ timeVal = $ timeVal .
" 0 " x $ padLen ; return ( $ timeVal ) ; }#getEpochMicroSeconds sub getEpochSeconds { my $ TIMEVAL_T = " LL " ; # LL for microseconds my $ start = pack ( $ TIMEVAL_T , ( ) ) ; syscall ( &SYS_gettimeofday , $ start , 0 ) != - 1 or die " seconds : $ ! " ; return ( ( unpack ( $ TIMEVAL_T , $ start ) ) [ 0 ] ) ; }#getEpochSeconds
Next up is the knockListen subroutine , the first five lines of which read the current accelerometer data values and adjust for the base value readings .
The check Knock variable is set to 1 if the accelerometer magnitude in either dimension is greater than the update threshold value .
To adjust the program to only respond to intense knocking events or similar acceleration values , increase the update threshold .
For example , you could place your ThinkPad in your car and have it change your mp3 playlist only when hard acceleration ( or deceleration ! ) is detected .
If you knocked the laptop hard enough , and the update threshold has been passed , the getEpochMicroSeconds subroutine is called .
The diffInterval variable is then assigned to the duration between knock events .
This value is used to compress many rapid acceleration readings greater than the update threshold into one event .
Without the interval threshold check , a single hard knock will register as multiple events as the accelerometer continues to issue high magnitudes for an extended time .
This behavior is incongruous with the user perception both in sight and touch .
A knock is a knock to us , but apparently not to the HDAPS .
If the interval threshold has been reached , the knock interval is recorded in the baseKnocks array , and the interval between knocks is reset .
The careful modification of these variables will help tune the program to recognize your particular knocking style .
Reduce the update threshold and increase the interval threshold to detect widely spaced soft knocks .
Mechanical knocking devices or specific knock methods may require lowering the interval threshold to recognize distinct knock events .
Listing 6 . knockListen subroutine
sub knockListen ( ) { my $ check Knock = 0 ; ( $ currX , $ currY ) = readPosition ( ) ; $ currX -= $ restX ; # adjust for rest data state $ currY -= $ restY ; # adjust for rest data state # require a high threshold of acceleration to ignore non-events like # bashing the enter key or hitting the side with the mouse if ( abs ( $ currX ) > $ UPDATE_THRESHOLD ) { $ check Knock = 1 ; } if ( abs ( $ currY ) > $ UPDATE_THRESHOLD ) { $ checkKnock = 1 ; } if ( $ check Knock == 1 ) { my $ currVal = getEpochMicroSeconds ( ) ; my $ diffInterval = abs ( $ prevInterval - $ currVal ) ; # hard knock events can create continuous acceleration across a large time # threshold .
requiring an elapsed time between knock events effectively # reduces what appear as multiple events according to sleep_interval and # update_threshold into a singular event .
if ( $ diffInterval > $ INTERVAL_THRESHOLD
) { if ( $ knockCount == 0 ) { $ diffInterval = 0 } if ( $ option ) { print " Knock : $ knockCount # # last : [ $ currVal ] curr : [ $ prevInterval ] " ; print " difference is : $ diffInterval
" ; } push @baseKnocks , $ diffInterval ; $ knockCount + + ; }# if the difference interval is greater than the threshold $ prevInterval = $ currVal ; }#if checkknock passed }#knockListen
When a knock pattern is created , it is placed in the ~/.knock File file , and read by the following subroutine
Listing 7 . Read knock file
sub readKnockFile { open( KNCKFILE , " $ENV{HOME}/.knockFile " ) or die " no knock file : $ ! " ; while (< KNCKFILE > ) { if ( !/^#/ ) { my @arrLine = split " _#_ " ; $ knockHash{ $ arrLine [ 0 ] }{ cmd } = $ arrLine [ 1 ] ; $ knockHash{ $ arrLine [ 0 ] }{ comment } = $ arrLine [ 2 ] ; }#if not a comment line }#for each line in file close ( KNCKFILE ) ; }#readKnockFile
When a knocking pattern is acquired by knockListen , it is compared to the existing knock patterns loaded from readKnockFile .
The compareKnockSequences subroutine below performs a simple difference check between the timings of the knocks .
Note that the differences between knocks is not compounded : missing the timing on many knocks by a small amount will not accumulate into a total match failure .
The first comparison is between the number of knocks , as there is no point comparing a seven - knock sequence to a two - knock sequence .
If the number of knocks matches an existing knock sequence from ~/.knock File , and the difference between knocks is less than than the maximum knock deviation , the knock is a match .
Maximum knock deviation is critical to allowing the matching of knock sequences with accuracy , not precision .
You can increase the maximum knock deviation to allow you to be more liberal in your rhythmic timings , but be warned , this can cause erroneously matched patterns .
For example , try increasing the maximum knock deviation from 100000 to 500000 microseconds .
This will allow your knock patterns to deviate as much as half a second before or after the expected time , and still cause a match .
This effectively means that " Shave and a Haircut " can match to " Mary Had a Little Lamb " , so be wary of changing this parameter .
If the full pattern is a match , the command specified in the ~/.knock File is run , and the result printed out if verbose mode is enabled .
The next step is to exit the subroutine if no matches are found , or reset the recorded knocks if a match is made .
The compareKnockSequences subroutine performs this step :
Listing 8 . Compare knock sequences
sub compareKnockSequences { my $ countMatch = 0 ; # record how many knocks matched # for each knock sequence in the config file for ( keys % knockHash ) { # get the timings between knocks my @confKnocks = split ; # if the count of knocks match if ( $ knockCount eq @confKnocks ) { my $ knockDiff = 0 ; my $ counter = 0 ; for ( $ counter=0 ; $ counter <$knockCount ; $ counter + + ) { $ knockDiff = abs ( $confKnocks [ $ counter ] - $ baseKnocks [ $ counter ] ) ; my $ knkStr = " k $ counter b $ baseKnocks [ $ counter ] " . " c $ confKnocks [ $ counter ] d $ knockDiff
" ; # if it 's an exact match , increment the matching counter if ( $ knockDiff < $ MAX_KNOCK_DEV ) { if ( $ option ) { print " MATCH $ knkStr " } $ countMatch ++ ; # if the knocks do n't match , move on to the next pattern in the list }else{ if ( $ option ) { print " DISSONANCE $ knkStr " } last ; }# deviation check }#for each knock }#if number of knocks matches # if the count of knocks is an exact match , run the command if ( $ countMatch eq @confKnocks ) { my $ cmd = system ( $ knockHash {" @confKnocks " }{ cmd } ) ; if ( $ option ) { print " $ cmd
" } last ; # otherwise , make the count of matches zero , in order to not reset }else{ $ countMatch = 0 ; } }#for keys # if the match count is zero , exit and do n't reset variables so a longer # knock sequence can be entered and checked if ( $ countMatch == 0 ) { return ( ) } # if a match occurred , reset the variables so it wo n't match another pattern $ knockCount = 0 ; @baseKnocks = ( ) ; }#compareKnockSequences
Main program logic
With the subroutines in place , the main program logic allows the user to create a knock sequence , or runs in daemon mode to listen for knocks and execute commands .
The first section is executed when the user specifies option -c , for create mode .
A simple timeout process is used to end the knock sequence .
Increase the maximum timeout length variable to permit pauses of more than four seconds between knocks .
If you leave the maximum timeout length at four , the program will end and print your currently entered knock sequence .
Listing 9 . Create sequence main logic
if ( $ option eq " - c " ) { print " create a knock pattern :
" ; $ startTime = getEpochSeconds ( ) ; # reset time out start while ( $ time Out == 0 ) { $ currTime = getEpochSeconds ( ) ; # check if there has not been a knock in a while if ( $ currTime - $ startTime > $ MAX_TIMEOUT_LENGTH ) { $ time
Out = 1 ; # exit the loop }else{ # if a knock has been entered before timeout , reset timers so # more knocks can be entered if ( $ knockCount != $ knockAge ) { $ startTime = $ currTime ; # reset timer for longer delay $ knockAge = $ knockCount ; # synchronize knock counts }# if a new knock came in }# if timer not reached knockListen ( ) ; select ( undef , undef , undef , $ SLEEP_INTERVAL ) ; }#timeOut =0 if ( @baseKnocks ) { print " place the following line in $ ENV{HOME}/.knockFile
" ; for ( @baseKnocks ) { print " $_ " } print " _#_ ( command here ) _#_ < comments here >
" ; }#if knocks entered
Section two of the main logic listens for knocks in an infinite loop , sleeping for approximately one hundredth of a second in each loop .
A seconds - based timeout is also used in this loop to reset the knock sequences after sufficient delay .
Note that in this example , the knock listen timeout is for two seconds , whereas the maximum timeout length is four seconds .
This provides for a simple testing setup during the knock creation mode , and a fast resetting option for knock sequence listen mode .
Listing 10 .
Knock listen main code
}else{ # main code loop to listen for knocking and run commands readKnockFile ( ) ; $ startTime = getEpochSeconds ( ) ; while ( $ time Out == 0 ) { $ currTime = getEpochSeconds ( ) ; if ( $ currTime - $ startTime > $ LISTEN_TIMEOUT ) { $ knockCount = 0 ; @baseKnocks = ( ) ; $ startTime = $ currTime ; if ( $ option ) { print " listen timeout - resetting knocks
" } }else{ if ( $ knockCount != $ knockAge ) { $ startTime = $ currTime ; # reset timer for longer delay $ knockAge = $ knockCount ; # synchronize knock counts }# if a new knock came in compareKnockSequences ( ) ; }#if not reset timeout knockListen ( ) ; select ( undef , undef , undef , $ SLEEP_INTERVAL ) ; }#main knock listen loop }# if create or listen for knocks
Caveats , security
The knockAge program is well suited for providing an additional channel of user input for your system .
However , be wary of using knockAge to do anything requiring authentication on your system .
Yes , it can defeat key loggers sniffing for passwords , but there are many other variables associated with " knock authentication " suggesting that usage in any serious context is premature at best .
The knock sequences are currently stored as 4 - 9 digit representations of the delay in microseconds in the ~/.knock File .
It is comparatively easy to read this " password " file and simply try and match the knock pattern to gain access to this system .
One - way hashes could be used by eliminating some of the precision in the microseconds values , but this exercise is best left to readers wanting to evaluate the risks on their own .
Before deployment in any serious environment , studies should be done to determine whether users have a sufficiently variable and precise knocking apparatus .
For example , do we have the spatio - temporal motor skills to create and consistently enter knocking passwords of acceptable strength ?
Does the average human mind have the capability to intuitively work with knock sequences ?
Or are we all going to use " Shave and a Haircut " as our password ?

For me , Mr. Obama showed signs of jumping the shark two weeks back , when he appeared at a podium affixed with his own pompous faux - presidential seal .
It could have been a Pixar sight gag .
In fact , it is a gag in “ Wall - E , ” where , in a flashback , we see that the original do - nothing chief executive of Buy N Large ( prone to pronouncements like “ stay the course ” ) boasted his own ersatz presidential podium .
For all the hyperventilation on the left about Mr. Obama ’s rush to the center  some warranted , some not  what ’s more alarming is how small - bore and defensive his campaign has become .
Whether he ’s reaffirming his long - held belief in faith - based programs or fudging his core convictions about government snooping , he is drifting away from the leadership he promised and into the focus - group - tested calculation patented by Mark Penn in his disastrous campaign for Hillary Clinton .
Mr. Obama ’s Wednesday address calling for renewed public service is unassailable in principle but inadequate to the daunting size of the serious American crisis at hand .
The speech could have been  and has been  delivered by any candidate of either party in any election year since 1960 .
What Mr. Obama has going for him during this tailspin is that his opponent seems mortifyingly out - to - lunch .
Mr. McCain is a man who aspires to lead the largest economy in the world and yet recently admitted that he does n’t know how to use a computer , the one modern tool shared by everyone from the post - industrial American work force to Middle Eastern terrorists to Pixar animators .
Getting shot down over Vietnam may not be a qualification for president in 2008 , but surely a rudimentary facility with a laptop is .
What Mr. McCain has going for him is a press corps that often ignores or covers up such embarrassments .
The Republican ’s digital ignorance is not a function of his age but of his intellectual inflexibility and his isolation from his country ’s reality .
To prove the point last week , he took a superfluous , if picturesque , tour of Colombia and Mexico , with occasional timeouts for him and his surrogates to respond like crybabies to General Clark ’s supposed slur on his patriotism .
For connoisseurs of McCainian cluelessness , the high point was his Wednesday morning appearance on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
The anchor , Robin Roberts , asked the only important question :
Why in heaven ’s name was Mr. McCain in Latin America when “ the U.S. economy is really at the forefront of voters ’ minds ” ?
“ I know Americans are hurting very badly right now , ” he explained , channeling the first George Bush ’s “ Message : I care . ”
As he spoke , those hurting Americans could feast on the gorgeous flora and fauna of the Cartagena , Colombia , tourist vista serving as his backdrop .
“ It ’s really lovely here , ” Mr. McCain said .
Since he can’t drop us an e-mail , a video postcard will have to do .
Mr. McCain should be required to see “ Wall - E ” to learn just how far adrift he is from an America whose economic fears cannot be remedied by his flip - flop embrace of the Bush tax cuts ( for the wealthy ) and his sham gas - tax holiday ( for everyone else ) .
Mr. Obama should see it to be reminded of just how bold his vision of change had been before he settled into a front - runner ’s complacency .
Americans should see it to appreciate just how much things are out of joint on an Independence Day when a cartoon robot evokes America ’s patriotic ideals with more conviction than either of the men who would be president .

The baby Antarctic penguins being frozen to death by freak rain storms
Tens of thousands of newly - born penguins are freezing to death as Antarctica is lashed by freak rain storms .
Scientists believe the numbers of Adelie penguins may have fallen by as much as 80 per cent – and , if the downpours continue , the species will be extinct within ten years .
And the Emperor penguin – made famous in the Oscar - winning documentary March Of The Penguins – is also under threat .
Rain has soaked this Adelie penguin chick before its feathers are capable of repelling water
Temperatures on the Antarctic peninsula have risen by 3C over the past 50 years to an average of - 14.7C and rain is now far more common than snow .
Adelie penguins are born with a thin covering of down and it takes 40 days for them to grow protective water - repellent feathers .
With epic rains drenching their ancestral nesting grounds , their parents try to protect them .
But when the adults leave to fish for food , or are killed by predators such as seals , the babies become soaked to the skin and die from hypothermia .
‘ Everyone talks about the melting of the glaciers but having day after day of rain in Antarctica is a totally new phenomenon .
As a result , penguins are literally freezing to death , ’ said Jon Bowermaster , a New York - based explorer who has recently returned from Antarctica .
Miserable start to life : Cold , wet and dying antarctic penguins try to eke out an existence
‘ In the past five years , torrential rains have become increasingly common there .
We saw Adelie penguin chicks shivering during nearly six days of continuous storms .
‘ If it had been snow , like in the old days , their down would be perfectly equipped to cope .
But they ca n’t take rain .
It ’s like wearing a down jacket that gets soaking wet .
‘ At night , the temperature would dip and the next morning we ’d find them dead from hypothermia .
‘ Other marine creatures like seals in the Antarctic are born with fur , but penguin chicks have nothing to protect them .
‘ It is all very well talking theoretically about how the ice cap could disappear – but watching penguins walking among the skeletons of their young is the most powerful evidence of climate change I have seen . ’
Explorer Jon Bowermaster : ' Watching penguins walking among the skeletons of their young is the most powerful evidence of climate change I have seen '
Biologist Professor P. Dee Boersma , of the University of Washington in Seattle , has published a study in the magazine BioScience in which she says that the warming climate is also threatening the Emperor penguin .
She visited East Antarctica in December 2006 – less than two years after March Of The Penguins was shot – and says it would be unrecognisable to anyone who saw the film .
‘ I saw no Emperor penguin chicks , no sea-ice and fewer than a dozen small icebergs .
I was just shocked , ’ she said .
‘ It was the first time our expedition leader had seen the area free of ice since he started going there in the Eighties .
‘ There was no way chicks could have survived .
In late September , when they would have been little more than half grown , we were told a large storm had hit the area .
Emperor chicks are similar to the Adelie – they are downy and not waterproof and could not survive in the cold sea for any period of time .
‘ These penguins are sentinels who are showing we really are looking at big changes in the world ’s climate . ’
Athena Dinar , a spokeswoman for the British Antarctic Survey , said that 50 years ago two days of snow were recorded for every one day of rain at the region ’s Faraday meteorological station .
‘ Now , in the past few years , the trend is two days of rain to every one day of snow . ’

Advertisement A delegation of European and US envoys is heading to Georgia as its conflict with Russia over the breakaway South Ossetia region deepens .
The envoys hope to broker a truce after three days of fighting which are said to have killed or injured hundreds , and sent thousands fleeing .
Russian jets have bombed several towns , including Gori in central Georgia .
Russia says it wants Georgian forces to withdraw to the positions they held outside South Ossetia before Thursday .
In the absence of independent verification , there are conflicting figures about the casualties suffered on both sides but the numbers appeared to rise sharply on Saturday .
Air and ground attacks around South Ossetia on Saturday Based on Russian and South Ossetian estimates , the death toll on the South Ossetian side was at least 1,400 .
According to Moscow , all but a few of the dead were civilians .
Georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead , including 37 civilians , to a figure of around 130 dead .
A Russian air strike on Gori , a Georgian town near South Ossetia , left 60 people dead , many of them civilians , Georgia says .
Based on information supplied by both sides , the UN refugee agency believes that about 2,400 people have fled South Ossetia to other parts of Georgia while between 4,000 and 5,000 have crossed the border into Russia .
See a map of the region Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said his country is seeking " to force the Georgian side to peace " .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili accused Russia of seeking to " destroy " his country .
Meanwhile , separatists in Abkhazia - Georgia 's other breakaway region - say they have launched air and artillery strikes on Georgian forces in the Kodori Gorge .
' Broadening ' conflict
The joint delegation of the US , EU and the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe is due to visit Georgia on Saturday evening .

It comes as a third emergency session of the UN Security Council ended without an agreement on the wording of a statement calling for a ceasefire .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Britain would " lend its strong support to all those committed to a swift resolution to the conflict " .
But emmissaries from the US and Europe who are Nato members may not be seen as honest brokers by the Kremlin , when it comes to Georgia , BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall says .
The danger now is that Russia will not only use this crisis to demonstrate its military power in the region , but argue it is time to redraw the map , she adds .
Russian PM Vladimir Putin arrived in Russia 's North Ossetia region on his return from the Olympics on Saturday .
He described the violence as " genocide " , Russian media report .
Earlier , Mr Putin said it was unlikely now that South Ossetia would reintegrate with the rest of Georgia .

This , our diplomatic correspondent says , is precisely the outcome Georgia was trying to avoid .
Russia 's ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , said there could be no " consultations " with Georgia until Georgian forces returned to their positions and re-established " the status quo " .
The crisis began spiralling when Georgian forces launched a surprise attack on Thursday night to regain control of South Ossetia , which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992 .
The move followed days of exchanges of heavy fire with the Russian - backed separatists , led by Eduard Kokoity .
In response to the Georgian crackdown , Moscow sent armoured units across the border into South Ossetia .

Over 15,000 naval personnel from four countries are participating in a Joint Task Force Exercise dubbed " Operation Brimstone " , that is underway in North Carolina and off the eastern U.S. coast from Virginia to Florida .
The nine day exercise began Monday and includes special forces from France , Brazil and the United Kingdom .
The large exercise comes barely a month after the Israeli air force conducted a massive exercise in the Mediterranean reportedly a rehearsal for a military strike on Iran 's nuclear sites , and also shortly after the Geneva meeting where six world powers gave Iran yet another ultimatum of two weeks to suspend its uranium enrichment program .
For the first time units of the US Navy Expeditionary Combat command who are trained to operate in shallow coastal waters similar to those off the Perisan Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz where Iranian Revolutionary Guards are stationed on islands near the strait .
One cannot rule out the possibility that international forces may have to control the islands to ensure oil shipping freed passage out to world markets

This recipe comes from Wetsy ’s friend , Cynthia , in Austin .
I ’ve made it a few times , and I ’m always amazed at its versatility .
The final shredded product can be served immediately or in different dishes over the next few days , and the flavors are deliciously … delicious .
Rinse and pat dry the pork shoulder .
To begin , just throw the dried oregano , cumin , chili powder , salt , black pepper , garlic , olive oil , white wine vinegar and brown sugar into a food processor or blender .
( I happen to love brown sugar in my cooking , but you can decrease or omit it if you like . )
Cut one onion into quarters and put it in the food processor with the spices .
Blend mixture until totally combined and then pour it over the pork shoulder .
Now rub it into every nook and cranny of the meat , tucking it under folds an in crevices .
Let no stone go unturned .
Then place the pork into a roasting pan or Dutch oven and add a couple of cups of water .
Cover tightly and roast pork at 300 º for several hours , turning once every hour .
When it is fork tender , crank up the heat , remove the lid , and roast it , skin side up for another 15 to 20 minutes to get the skin crispy .
When it ’s done , let it rest for 15 minutes before shredding .
Shred the pork shoulder ( two forks work well ) .
When it ’s all shredded be sure to pour the juices all over the meat .
Serve with warm tortillas , lime wedges , sour cream , pico de gallo , guacamole , tomatillo salsa … whatever makes your skirt fly up !

Oh my goodness , am I ever in love with pork shoulder .
Wait a minute … did I just say that ?
That I ’m in love with pork shoulder ?
I seriously have to get a life .
I know when I was eighteen and living on the golf course and had the whole world ahead of me , I never in a million years could have predicted that I ’d one day profess my undying love for pork shoulder .
But I have ; it ’s happened .
How very far I ’ve fallen .
This recipe comes from Wetsy ’s friend , Cynthia , in Austin , who makes this delicious shredded pork for get - togethers with hip Austinites .
And it ’s not that I ’m ever at these said get - togethers with all the other hip Austinites .
For one thing , I do n’t live anywhere near Austin , so I ’m never invited .
For another , I probably would n’t go anyway because I do n’t like to leave my house .
It ’s a good thing I have my sister to fill me in on all of these delicious dishes .
And it ’s a good thing Cynthia agreed to share the recipe with me .
Thank you , Cynthia .
You have the most beautiful wide - set eyes I ’ve ever seen .
I wish I was of eastern European descent .
Either that or Italian .
I ca n’t decide .
Anyway , this pork .
I ’ve made it a few times , and I ’m always amazed at its versatility .
The final shredded product can be served immediately or in different dishes over the next few days , and the flavors are deliciously … delicious .
I like to serve it with warm flour tortillas , lime wedges , and a combo of pico de gallo , sour cream , guacamole … whatever I have lying around .
C’mon … let me show you the magic !
The Cast of Characters : 4 to 7 pound pork shoulder ( this is 7 - plus ) , onion , chili powder , brown sugar , garlic , dried oregano , ground cumin , chili powder , salt , black pepper , olive oil , white wine vinegar , and lime wedges .
I seriously have no idea why there ’s a glass of white wine there instead of white wine vinegar .
It was a busted synapse in my brain .
Or it was the white wine .
Sorry .
Do n’t be like me , okay ?
This is a pork shoulder roast .
Make friends with it , because it ’s a fabulously versatile piece of meat .
This one was about $ 1.49 / pound .
That ’s purty economicable .
( Oh , and go ahead and give it a good rinse before we move forward .
Go ahead .
I ’ll wait . )
I really like to rinse pork .
It ’s a hobby of mine .
This is chili powder , cumin , and brown sugar .
Oregano ’s around there somewhere , but it did n’t get in the shot .
Again … the wine .
You can add in / tweak the spices to make it all yours .
To begin , just throw the spices into a food processor or blender .
I use 1 teaspoon dried oregano , 1 teaspoon cumin , 1 tspo chili powder , and about 1/4 cup brown sugar .
I happen to love brown sugar in my cooking , but you can decrease or omit it if you like .
Also : add 3 to 4 peeled garlic cloves to make your kitchen smell divine while it ’s cooking .
Quarter 1 whole onion and throw it in …
Add in 1 to 2 tablespoons salt ( to taste ) …
A bunch of ground black pepper …
A couple of tablespoons white wine vinegar , and tablespoon or two of olive oil — just enough to make it pasty .
Blend mixture until totally combined , then pour it over the pork roast .
Rub it into every nook and cranny of the meat , tucking it under folds and in crevices .
Let no stone go unturned .
Place the pork into a roasting pan or dutch oven and add a couple of cups of water .
Cover tightly and roast pork at 300 degrees for several hours , turning once every hour .
I roasted mine about six or seven hours , then checked to make sure it was fork tender .
Then I cranked up the heat , removed the lid , and roasted it skin side up for another 15 to 20 minutes to get the skin crispy .
When it ’s done , let it rest 15 minutes before shredding …
Then shred away !
I like to use two forks .
Cynthia says to serve it with lime wedges .
And I do what she says , because she ’s eastern European with beautiful wide - set eyes .
Be sure to pour the juices all over the meat .
This ’ll make sure it stays moist and tender .
And moist .
And tender .
And moist .
Then I just pile it on a big platter .
This stuff is great for a crowd .
Serve the stuff with warm tortillas …
And sour cream , pico de gallo , guacamole , tomatillo salsa … whatever makes your skirt fly up !
Then repeat after me : Yum .
Yum yum yum .
Yum .
This stuff is really , really delicious .
And it makes a ton of meat , so you ’ll have leftovers galore for soups , enchiladas , tostadas , sandwiches , etc .
Enjoy , my friends !
Soon , you ’ll be able to say you ’re in love with pork shoulder , too .
And that ’s sure to make your parents proud .
Love ,

QUERETARO , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Wealthy Mexicans , terrified of soaring kidnapping rates , are spending thousands of dollars to implant tiny transmitters under their skin so satellites can help find them tied up in a safe house or stuffed in the trunk of a car .
A global positioning satellite is seen in a handout artist 's rendering .
REUTERS / Handout
Kidnapping jumped almost 40 percent between 2004 and 2007 in Mexico according to official statistics .
Mexico ranks with conflict zones like Iraq and Colombia as among the worst countries for abductions .
The recent kidnap and murder of Fernando Marti , 14 , the son of a well - known businessman , sparked an outcry in a country already hardened to crime .
More middle - class people also are also seeking out the tiny chip designed by Xega , a Mexican security firm whose sales jumped 13 percent this year .
The company injects the crystal - encased chip , the size and shape of a grain of rice , into clients ’ bodies with a syringe .
A transmitter then sends signals via satellite to pinpoint the location of a person in distress .
Cristina , 28 , who did not want to give her last name , was implanted along with seven other members of her family last year as a “ preventive measure . ”
“ It ’s not like we are wealthy people , but they ’ll kidnap you for a watch ...
Everyone is living in fear , ” she said .
The chips cost $ 4,000 plus an annual fee of $ 2,200 .
Most kidnappings in Mexico go unreported but independent analysts say there were 6,500 abductions last year , many of them “ express kidnapping ” where the victim is grabbed and forced to withdraw money from automatic cash machines .
GROWTH INDUSTRY
Official statistics show 751 kidnappings in Mexico last year but most abductions go unreported and the crime research institute ICESI says the number could have been as high as over 7,000 in 2007 .
Xega , based in the central Mexican city of Quererato , designed global positioning systems to track stolen vehicles until a company owner was kidnapped in broad daylight in 2001 .
Frustrated by his powerlessness to call for help , the company adapted the technology to track stolen people .
Most people get the chips injected into their arms between the skin and muscle where they can not be seen .
Customers who fear they are being kidnapped press a panic button on an external device to alert Xega which then calls the police .
“ Before , they only kidnapped key , well - known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners .
Now they are kidnapping people from the middle class , ” said Sergio Galvan , Xega ’s commercial director .
President Felipe Calderon has come under heavy pressure in recent weeks to stamp out violent crime .
He is to host a high - level meeting on Thursday of security chiefs and state governors .
Outside of Mexico , U.S. company VeriChip Corp uses similar radio - wave technology to identify patients in critical condition at hospitals or find elderly people who wander away from their homes .
But Xega sees kidnapping as a growth industry and is planning to expand its services next year to Brazil , Colombia and Venezuela .
An Indiana teacher who used a much lauded bestseller , The Freedom Writers Diary , to try to inspire under - performing high - school students has been suspended from her job without pay for 18 months .
The effective book ban by the school authorities in Perry Township has outraged teachers and education reformers .
The Writers Diary , a series of true stories written by inner-city teenagers , was put together by a teacher , Erin Gruwell , and has been celebrated as a model for transforming young lives .
It was made into a film with Hilary Swank last year .
Connie Heermann , a teacher for 27 years , sought permission to introduce the book to her students last autumn after attending a training workshop held by the Freedom Writers Foundation .
" If you read the whole book you will see how these inner-city students grow and change and become articulate , compassionate , educated young people who want to do something good in their lives despite the environment in which they were raised , " she told the Guardian .
" I thought my students would very much relate to those kids . "
Her head agreed and Heermann got written permission from nearly 150 parents , but the Perry Meridian high school board urged her to wait for its decision .
Teachers ' union officials say that a single board member objected to swearing in the book .
The school board member allegedly persuaded the other six officials to ban Heermann from teaching the book .
It remains available in school libraries .
Heermann and the union say there was no explicit ban on the book when she handed it out to pupils on November 15 .
But later that day she received an email from the board advising her not to teach the book .
" That was the pivotal moment of my life , when I saw how my students were taken with the book , how they loved it , and then I am told not to let them read it ?
I said no , " she said .
After being threatened with dismissal , Heermann was eventually suspended .
The union is deciding whether to take the case to court .
The school board denies book banning and accuses Heermann of insubordination .
Barbara
Thompson , the school board president , wrote in an email yesterday : " She knew she had defied her supervisors ' direction in her work and that her defiance was ' insubordination ' and ' neglect of duty ' . "
Opportunities for " greenwashing " – the method by which companies appear more environmentally friendly than they really are – may be limited in future , thanks to a new government - backed award scheme launched today .
Any company awarded the new Carbon Trust Standard certificate will have had to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions , rather than simply offset them .
Offsetting is the process of compensating for emissions by buying carbon credits that in theory reflect carbon savings made elsewhere , through planting trees , say , or replacing fossil - fuel power stations with renewable energy systems .
The problem is that buying the credits does not cut emissions .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
To be awarded the certificate , companies will either have to demonstrate total overall reductions or a 2.5 per cent improvement in carbon efficiency for businesses in which productivity – and therefore emissions – might be growing .
The new award is strongly supported by the CBI and was also welcomed by Greenpeace , which in the past has been one of the organisations most critical of companies it sees as pretending to be environmentally concerned .
ACLU : Memos authorized CIA torture Nick Juliano

As long as CIA agents could convince themselves they were not deliberately inflicting severe pain or suffering on detainees , they were free to do virtually anything in their questioning of suspected terrorists , including waterboarding .
Furthermore , the agents ' belief they were n't in fact torturing their captives did n't even need to be " reasonable . "
These are the implications of a controversial August 2002 memo from the Justice Department to the CIA that was released Thursday .
The American Civil Liberties Union obtained several internal Bush administration documents it says authorizes the CIA to torture detainees .
 These documents supply further evidence , if any were needed , that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to torture prisoners in its custody ,  Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project , said in a news release .
 The Justice Department twisted the law , and in some cases ignored it altogether , in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the U.S. once prosecuted as war crimes .
The documents were heavily redacted .
For example , the government blacked out 10 full pages of the 18 - page August 2002 memo , written by then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , before releasing it in response to a Freedom of Information Act request .
Most of the text on the remaining pages was similarly blacked out , but the released version of the Bybee memo does provide some insight .
Bybee outlined the definition of torture in Section 2340A of the United States code , focusing in part on its caveat that an act be " specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering . "
Elaborating on his definition of the " specific intent " provision , Bybee narrows the definition to the point where it become functionally meaningless .
All that is required to avoid prosecution is a CIA agent's " good faith belief " that his actions will not cause torturous pain and suffering .
Such a belief " need not be reasonable , " Bybee writes .
Although any references to waterboarding have been scrubbed from the released Bybee memo , the government handed over to the ACLU a 2004 memo from the CIA that referrs to the " classified August 2002 DoJ opinion stating that [ redacted ] interrogation techniques including the waterboard , do not violate the Torture Statute . "
The same memo raises the prospect of " future US judicial review of the Program , " referencing the Supreme Court 's decision that year in Rasul v. Bush .
A 2003 memo from the CIA to the Justice Department clarifying that " Enhanced Techniques " fall under those permissible by CIA headquarters , although it seems also to raise the possibility that even more coercive techniques could be " approved by Headquarters . "
Virtually all of the four - page memo is redacted , but the memo does make clear that in interrogations using Enhanced Techniques , " a contemporaneous record shall be created setting forth the nature and duration of each technique employed . "
The CIA last year destroyed at least two videotapes of enhanced interrogations that may have included waterboarding .
The Justice Department has started a criminal investigation into the tapes ' destruction .
The ACLU first requested the documents it released Thursday in a FOIA lawsuit filed in 2004 .
While the documents provide some more evidence of torture during George W. Bush 's presidency , the ACLU says his administration continues to do all it can to avoid full scrutiny .
 While the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the Bush administration 's torture policies , even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use ' national security ' as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment , criticism and possible criminal prosecution ,  Jaffer said .
 Far too much information is still being withheld . 

The Shanghai SSE composite index is now below 2320 , the lowest since the amazing run up started in 2006 .
The index is off over 60 % from the peak .
This is a stunning stock market crash .
Usually a stock market crash leads to less business investment , and an economic slowdown .
The second graph compares the NASDAQ ( as a percent from the peak ) to changes in business investment in structures and software and equipment .
This shows that business investment in both categories went negative about 3 quarters after the stock market peaked .
Of course there are major differences between the U.S. and China , but I 'd expect business investment to slow in China .
The CIA have released the full text of a book on the psychology of analysing surveillance data .
While aimed at the CIA ’s analysts , it ’s also a great general guide on how to understand complex situations and avoid our natural cognitive biases in reasoning .
I ’ve not read it all , but it aims not only to give the reader an understanding of the limitations of our reasoning , but also how to overcome them when trying to think about tricky problems .
A central focus of this book is to illuminate the role of the observer in determining what is observed and how it is interpreted .
People construct their own version of “ reality ” on the basis of information provided by the senses , but this sensory input is mediated by complex mental processes that determine which information is attended to , how it is organized , and the meaning attributed to it .
What people perceive , how readily they perceive it , and how they process this information after receiving it are all strongly influenced by past experience , education , cultural values , role requirements , and organizational norms , as well as by the specifics of the information received .
The chapters on cognitive biases seem particularly good , and the book consistently grounds the abstract concepts in accessible examples .
It ’s interesting that patients who undertake cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) to help with emotional or psychiatric difficulties will learn how to identify and avoid many of these exact same biases .
However , in the clinical situation the idea is that mood or emotion is in a pathological feedback loop which makes biases more likely ( e.g. anxious people will tend to focus on threatening things ) , which in turn reinforces the emotional state .
The CIA book does n’t seem to mention emotion or mood at all , despite the fact that the same effects are known to occur in all of us , even if they do n’t get to the level of illness or impairment .
Secret service analysts must surely work in high - emotion environments ( and the fact that the UK ’s secret services regularly advertise for clinical psychologists seems to bear this out ) , so this would seem to be a crucial aspect not covered by this otherwise very comprehensive guide .

After some brief expressions of sympathy , in particular from one of the women present , the conversation moved on .
Though sad for all involved , especially the couple 's young children , to us thirtysomethings such news comes as no surprise .
Breakdowns in relationships , such as retrenchment , car accidents or minor operations , are just one of the everyday hazards of modern life for Generation X .
It is an event that statistically is as likely to occur as not .
In her provocatively titled new book , Are Men Necessary ?
When Sexes Collide , American columnist Maureen Dowd tolls the bell of marital doom .
In an extract published in the New York Times Magazine , Dowd laments the abject failure of modern relationships : " Despite the best efforts of philosophers , politicians , historians , novelists , screenwriters , linguists , therapists , anthropologists and facilitators , men and women are still in a muddle in the boardroom , the bedroom and the Situation room . "
Dowd presents the landscape of relationships as a disaster zone of disappointment and inequality for women : " Before it curdled into a collection of stereotypes , feminism had fleetingly held out a promise that there would be some precincts of womanly life that were not all about men .
But it never materialised . "
In Dowd 's view , the sway held by stereotypes has n't lessened since the rise of feminism , only their content : " The message is diametrically opposite - before it was do n't be a sex object ; now , it 's be a sex object - but the conformity is just as stifling . "
Virginia
Woolf wrote that " to enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves " .
Dowd is quite right to identify conformity as a true enemy of happiness , but it is a force propelling our consumer society that is difficult to deny .
In gender relations , as in everything else , we are only limited by our imaginations and our capacity to empathise with one another .
The " ca n't live with them , ca n't live without them " theme adumbrated by Dowd also echoes in the media across the gender divide , where the howl of embittered women is answered just as loudly by the bellowing of angry men who fear that they really are unnecessary .
In addition to the misery and hardship that failed relationships cause to women , the high rate of divorce is just one of the factors that contribute to the so - called crisis in masculinity .
According to Marian Salzman , Ira Matathia and Ann O'Reilly , the joint authors of a new book called The Future of Men , instability and uncertainty in relationships is just one of the issues profoundly troubling men .
They refer to data indicating that men have a greater psychological need for permanence in relationships than women , and point out the fact that roughly twice as many divorces are instigated by women as men .
But is the crisis real , or is it a furphy , an excuse for some men to behave badly and feel sorry for themselves ?
Are the gender wars overall a sign of social disintegration or a bit of a beatup ?
The threshold question is not one that preoccupies the authors of The Future of Men .
In a sign of the times , the book is not a work of sociological inquiry or journalistic speculation but a business title .
Salzman , Matathia and O'Reilly are not polemicists but professional trendspotters and as such are primarily concerned with how the fluid situation of men may translate into future spending patterns .
They assert that the combination of " the women 's movement , the evolution towards information - based economies , and shifting social mores and values " is having " a negative impact on the male psyche , leaving modern men hesitant , disoriented , and , in many cases , more than a little depressed " .
The authors say that companies " looking to connect with the male consumer " must respond to what they term " M - ness " , that is a new masculinity being defined by men themselves .
After a decade or so of metrosexuals having the unblinking queer eye appraise their dress , hygiene and appearance , men are reasserting their traditional masculinity .
This new " ubersexual " man will keep using a regular moisturising routine , but will also be manlier in his pursuits and outlook .
But like the conformist women described by Dowd , is the crisis of masculinity merely creating a new breed of fashion victims whose angst can only be soothed by retail therapy ?
Advertisers , take note : boy 's toys can compensate men for the feeling they are toy boys .
The new alliance forecast in The Future of Men between quiche - man and caveman , to borrow the distinction made in Kath & Kim , may seem like a refreshing new development in the affairs of men , but is it simply a case of putting some of the old wine in new bottles ?
In truth , the really significant changes have occurred around men and not within them .
Human evolution has lagged far behind technology , medical science and legislative change .
Thomas Keneally reminds us : " It is for most of us far less than 5000 years since we came in off the plain and began farming .
But our chemistry is built for nomadic life .
We really did have mastodons to kill once . "
It is precisely this apparent mismatch between purpose and use , a " suspicion that we are biologically and socially redundant " , as Keneally puts it , that gives rise to a " profound unease " in men .
The projection into the future properly begins in the past , though we do not have to go back five millennia to establish the beginnings of a modern malaise .
The future of men arguably began that day in November 1951 when the patents were filed that heralded the introduction of the contraceptive pill for women .
Giving women the power to control their own fertility , as almost all of them do in the West , was an epoch - making moment in the history of humanity .
The freedom of choice that the Pill gave to women , and indirectly to their sexual partners , has been followed by medical advances that enable human reproduction to take place without the male partner or sperm donor being present at the moment of conception .
When cloning is perfected , then the concept of paternity could be done away with altogether .
In any case , according to geneticist Jennifer Marshall Graves , the Y chromosome will have exhausted its capacity to mutate within the next 10 million years .
The only real question is when , not if , the Y chromosome disappears , she has said in an interview .
" It could be a lot shorter than 10 million years , but it could be a lot longer . "
Some modern freedoms , such as those that enabled women to vote and to own property without being treated as property themselves , have altered relations between the sexes forever .
According to the authors of The Future of Men , there is no going back , and nor would societies that have experienced the benefits of the liberation of women want to return to the sexual dark ages :
" In the short term , it 's clear that cultures that resist the rise in female power are losing out to those cultures that accept it , because the cultures that accept it are progressing further faster on most fronts - health , economy , security , and technology , to name a few .
Only history ( sic ) will tell what the longer - term consequences may be . "
Some of the more militant men's advocacy groups may gnash their teeth but the dethronement of men was in some sense an abdication , since the entry of women into the workforce was an unintended consequence of the world wars waged by men , and it was men that led the medical research into women 's health .
Now men and women are able to work together as never before to improve the lives of everyone .
Who in their right mind would want to pass up the opportunity , however imperfect the application so far , to create a non-discriminatory meritocracy ?
On the domestic front , much of what has happened in our time is not gender - specific but is the impersonal operation of technology - driven consumer society .
The services that in the past only marriage could provide to each partner have now virtually been outsourced .
Single women can now " hire a hubby " whenever there 's an odd job to be done , while any man with enough cash can enjoy what used to be regarded as conjugal rights at the nearest licensed brothel .
Nothing is sacred , and everything has a price .
Shopping , cleaning , healthy food , child care , back rubs - all are just a phone call or a mouse click away .
An enterprising Japanese inventor has even come up with an artificial arm for singletons that takes the place of that otherwise provided by a real sleeping partner .
The marketplace fills the space to ensure that not even the absence of ordinary human contact lacks a commercial substitute .
If robots can serve as pets , why not have them fill in for humans as well ?
Objectively , the only factor holding women back from the possibility of complete independence from men , and vice versa , is financial , since the moral , social and legal pressure that used to exist for couples to pair off permanently has disappeared .
The crucial issue is the mutual desire to have children .
In most cases , the cost of health and education is such that it still requires two incomes to ensure that children receive what is generally considered to be a good start in life .
The authors of The Future of Men identify one area in popular culture that needs an adjustment to accommodate M-ness , and that is the negative stereotyping of men .
In 1929 , Virginia Woolf wrote that women " all these centuries have served as lookingglasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the magic figure of man at twice its natural size " .
Woolf knew , however , that the best writing transcends gender - specific thinking , since " anything written with a conscious bias is doomed to death " .
Great art , according to Woolf , encompasses the whole of human experience and dissolves any crude distinction between sex and gender .
" Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the man and woman before the art of creation can be accomplished .
Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated " .
A powerful representation of this concept as it may be manifested in an actual relationship appears in Kurt Vonnegut 's novel Mother Night .
The main character , an American playwright recruited to spy in pre-war Germany , sees the bond between himself and his wife as constituting what he calls " a nation of two " .
The couple 's loyalty to this nation will allow for a measure of regional autonomy and can survive the occasional outbreak of civil unrest .
Despite Woolf 's plea for wholeness and her warning against replacing misogyny with misandry , stereotyping is still with us .
Once women might have been denigrated or patronised with impunity , but now popular culture tends to load the dice against men .
Sitcoms and ads routinely show male characters as weak , foolish or stupid .
Instead of Father Knows Best , there are such dubious role models as Homer Simpson and Ray in Everyone Loves Raymond .
Not that they have much of an example to follow - Abraham Simpson was a terrible father and Ray 's dad is a ranting sociopath .
Of course , these shows would not be funny if the gag did not correlate to events in real life , but there is no balance , and in any case a joke repeated too often quickly becomes stale .
Of recent comedies , Coupling and Kath & Kim stand out as mature enough , and wicked enough , to be even - handed in satirising human relationships .
Selfishness , vanity , vulgarity , duplicity , snobbery , deceit - none of these things is the sole preserve of one half of humanity .
Nor are any of the more admirable qualities , needless to say .
Unreconstructed heroes such as those played by John Wayne and Steve McQueen have disappeared from the big screen , but also lost are the Gregory Pecks , Henry Fondas and Cary Grants .
Russell Crowe 's rampaging public persona may seem like a throwback , but even he can't go berserk in a hotel without concern for his family being the cause .
Such sensitivity , which is shared by Crowe 's characters in such films as Gladiator and The Cinderella Man , never inspired the ritual trashing of hotel rooms by rock bands in the '60s and ' 70s .
In modern life , the patriarchy has been superseded .
Men increasingly share in the family chores and spend time with their children , which is why the authors of The Future of Men think that " business still seems to be lagging behind the cultural reality of how much gender - blurring has occurred in traditional female domains " .
They write that " products related to food preparation , home furnishing and entertaining , and home maintenance ( i.e. cleaning ) are still generally pitched at women , despite the fact that most of these items have become gender neutral " .
While it has never been easier to form attachments , it has never been more of a challenge to maintain them .
The upheavals in men's lives have brought much that is new and unprecedented but also confirmed much that is as old as the hills .
A good man or woman has always been hard to find and the course of true love never runs smooth , as Shakespeare and Jane Austen , among other writers , understood .
Some are lucky in love and others miss out , no matter what the rules of engagement happen to be .
Mutual misunderstanding and gender confusion are a rich source of comedy and pathos in Shakespeare 's plays and the politics and economics of sex is a central concern of Austen 's novels .
Female sexual selection was known to be a vital factor in courtship long before evolutionary science confirmed it as the dominant one .
Much of what seems contemporary in gender conflict has a historical precedent .
The cad or shrew of yesteryear is today 's ballbreaker or toxic bachelor .
For every female chauvinist pig there 's a pick - up artist playing " the game " .
In his primping and preening , the metrosexual takes his cue from the dandy of yore .
The prospects for men may seem bleak to some , but that need not be the case .
Rather than feel useless and rejected , most men should perhaps feel lucky that women still show as much interest in them as they do and want their companionship .
Often the most effective critics of cultural misandry are women , and women do continue to give birth to sons as well as daughters .
Most women are attracted to men enough to want to be with them in some meaningful way , while men ( or women ) who like each other are no longer prevented from fulfilling their desire .
Love is fragile and often fleeting but I doubt whether many of us , no matter how modern our outlook , could contemplate life without it .
And for the time being , at least , it seems we do n't have to .

Pity Georgia 's bedraggled first infantry brigade .
And its second .
And its hapless navy .
For the past few evenings in the foothills of the Southern Caucasus on the outskirts of Joseph Stalin 's hometown of Gori , reconnaissance units of Russia 's 58th army have been raking through the spoils of war at what was the Georgian army 's pride and joy , a shiny new military base inaugurated only last January for the first infantry , the army engineers , and an artillery brigade .
A couple of hours to the west , in the town of Senaki , it 's the same picture .
A flagship military base , home to the second infantry brigade , is in Russian hands .
And down on the Black Sea coast , the radars and installations for Georgia 's sole naval base at Poti have been scrupulously pinpointed by the Russians and destroyed .
Gori and Senaki are not ramshackle relics of the old Red Army of the type that litter the landscape of eastern Europe .
" These bases have only recently been upgraded to Nato standard , " said Matthew Clements , Eurasia analyst at Jane 's Information Group .
" They have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the Georgian military . "
" There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki .
We make no secret of it , " said the general staff in Moscow .
" They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever . "
The " enormous arsenals " are American - made or American - supplied .
American money , know - how , planning , and equipment built these bases as part of Washington 's drive to bring Nato membership to a small country that is Russia 's underbelly .
The American " train and equip " mission for the Georgian military is six years old .
It has been destroyed in as many days .
And with it , Georgia 's Nato ambitions .
" There are a few countries that will say ' told you so ' " about the need to get Georgia into Nato , " said Andrew Wilson , Russia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations .
" But many more will want to walk away from the problem .
And for the next few years , Georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up . "
If Georgia and Nato are the principal casualties of this week 's ruthless display of brute power by Vladimir Putin , the consequences are bigger still , the fallout immense , if uncertain .
The regional and the global balance of power looks to have tilted , against the west and in favour of the rising or resurgent players of the east .
In a seminal speech in Munich last year , Putin confidently warned the west that he would not tolerate the age of American hyperpower .
Seven years in office at the time and at the height of his powers , he delivered his most anti-western tirade
Pernicious
To an audience that included John McCain , the White House contender , and Robert Gates , the US defence secretary and ex-Kremlinologist , he served notice : " What is a unipolar world ?
It refers to one type of situation , one centre of authority , one centre of force , one centre of decision - making .
It is world in which there is one master , one sovereign .
This is pernicious ... unacceptable ... impossible . "
This week , he turned those words into action , demonstrating the limits of US power with his rout of Georgia .
His forces roamed at will along the roads of the Southern Caucasus , beyond Russia 's borders for the first time since the disastrous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
As the Russian officers sat on the American stockpiles of machine guns , ammunition , and equipment in Gori , they were savouring a highly unusual scenario .
Not since the Afghan war had the Russians seized vast caches of US weaponry .
" People are sick to the stomach in Washington , " said a former Pentagon official .
And the Russians are giddy with success .
Celebrating the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism , the dogged pursuit by whatever means to avenge a long period of Russian humiliation and to deploy his limited range of levers - oil , gas , or brute force - to make the world listen to Moscow , the Russian prime minister has redrawn the geopolitical map .
In less than a week , Putin has invaded another country , effectively partitioned Georgia in a lightning campaign , weakened his arch - enemy , President Mikheil Saakashvili , divided the west , and presented a fait accompli .
The impact - locally , regionally , and globally - is huge .
" The war in Georgia has put the European order in question , " said Alexander Rahr , one of Germany 's leading Russia experts and a Putin biographer .
" The times are past when you can punish Russia . "
That seems to be the view among leading European policymakers who have been scrambling all week to arrange and shore up a fragile ceasefire , risking charges of appeasing the Kremlin .
" Do n't ask us who 's good and who 's bad here , " said Bernard Kouchner , the French foreign minister , after shuttling between Tbilisi and Moscow to try to halt the violence .
" We should n't make any moral judgments on this war .
Stopping the war , that 's what we 're interested in . "
His boss , President Nicolas Sarkozy , went to the Kremlin to negotiate a ceasefire and parade as a peacemaker .
Critics said he acted as Moscow 's messenger , noting Putin 's terms then taking them to Tbilisi to persuade
Saakashvili to capitulate .
Germany also refused to take sides while Italy warned against building an " anti-Moscow coalition " .
That contrasted with Gordon Brown 's and David Milliband 's talk of Russian " aggression " and Condoleezza Rice 's arrival in Tbilisi yesterday to rally " the free world behind a free Georgia " .
The effects of Putin 's coup are first felt locally and around Russia 's rim .
" My view is that the Russians , and I would say principally prime minister Putin , is interested in reasserting Russia 's , not only Russia 's great power or superpower status , but in reasserting Russia 's traditional spheres of influence , " said Gates .
" My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead . "
In Kiev certainly .
Ukraine 's pro-western prime minister , Viktor Yushchenko , Saaksahvili 's fellow colour - revolutionary , is chastened and wary .
His firebrand anti-Russian prime minister , Yuliya Tymoshenko , has gone uncharacteristically quiet .
Invasion
" An invasion of Ukraine by ' peacekeeping tanks ' is just a question of time , " wrote Aleksandr Sushko , director of Kiev 's Institute of Euro - Atlantic Cooperation .
" Weimar Russia is completing its transformation into something else .
If Russia wins this war , a new order will take shape in Europe which will have no place for Ukraine as a sovereign state . "
All around Russia 's rim , the former Soviet " captive states " are trembling .
Even Belarus , the slavishly loyal " last dictatorship in Europe " , went strangely silent , taking days before the regime offered Moscow its support .
" Everybody 's nervous , " said Wilson .
The EU states of the Baltic and Poland are drumming up support for Georgia , with the Polish president Lech Kaczynski declaring that Russia has revealed " its true face " .
That divides the EU since the French and the Germans refuse to take sides and are scornful of east European " hysteria " towards Russia .
Rahr in Berlin says the German and French governments are striving to keep the Poles and the Baltic states well away from any EU - led peace negotiations .
It was the Germans and the French who , in April , blunted George Bush 's drive to get Georgia into Nato .
They will also resist potential US moves to kick Russia out of the G8 or other international bodies .
There are many who argue that Putin 's gamble will backfire , that he has bitten off more than he can chew , that Russia remains weak , a " Saudi Arabia with trees " in the words of Robert Hunter , the former US ambassador to Nato .
Compared to the other rising powers of China , India or even Brazil - the companions referred to as the BRIC - Russia does indeed appear weak .
Its economy struggles to develop goods or services , depends on raw material exports and on European consumption and the price of oil for its current wealth .
Resources
But Putin 's talent is for playing a weak hand well , maximising and concentrating his limited resources , and creating facts on the ground while the west dithers .
" There is a lack of a clear and unified European policy towards Russia , " said Clements .
In the crucial contest over energy " the Russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any European response " .
Putin may now calculate he can call off the dogs of war , having achieved his aims and able to pocket his gains very cheaply .
The Georgia campaign becomes the triumphant climax of Putinism .
" In politics , it is very important to know one 's measure , " wrote Aleksey Arbatov , director of Moscow 's International Security Centre .
" If Russia continues to inflict strikes on Georgian territory , on facilities , on population centres , we may lose the moral supremacy we have today . "
But Wilson and many in eastern Europe worry that rather than being the climax of Putinism , the Russians in Georgia signal the start of something else .
" This may not be a culmination , but only step one , " said Wilson .
" If you do n't stop this kind of behaviour , it escalates . "
Secret Behind Indian Guru Levitation Revealed
Accounts of Indian Guru Yogis performing acts of levitation have been documented as far back as 1884 , but when a report and pictures were published in 1936 of Yogi Subbayah Pullavar , an Indian Guru , levitating for 4 minutes in front of some 150 witnesses , a serious interest into Yogis and their power of levitation .
However , even when Yogi Pullavar performed his trick there was some questions into why he was hidden in the tent before and after actually levitating in the air .
“ Yogi Pullavar ’s attendants erected a small tent in an open area .
Yogi Pullavar then entered the tent where he remained hidden from view for a few minutes .
The attendants then removed the tent .
Yogi Pullavar was seen suspended horizontally several feet above the ground .
He was in a trance , lightly resting his hand on top of a cloth covered stick . ”
A recent video has surfaced that uncovers at least one method that Gurus use to Levitate in front of audiences and it may be the secret behind Indian Guru Levitation .

Funeral Picketing Ban Upheld by Sixth Circuit :
Today 's Phelps - Roper v. Strickland upholds a ban on " ' picketing ' or ' other protest activities , ' within 300 feet of the funeral or burial service , from one hour before until one hour after the funeral or burial service . "
( " Other protest activities " is defined as " any action that is disruptive or undertaken to disrupt or disturb a funeral or burial service or a funeral procession . " )
The court concludes that the ban is content - neutral , serves the important government interest in " protect[ing ] the citizens of Ohio from disruption during the events associated with a funeral or burial service , " including disruption in the sense of " unwanted communication that implicates ... privacy interests " of a " captive audience . "
And :
Individuals mourning the loss of a loved one share a privacy right similar to individuals in their homes or individuals entering a medical facility .
Indeed , the Supreme Court has already recognized the privacy right of individuals to control the body and death images of deceased family members sufficient to prevent their disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
See Nat’l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish , 541 U.S. 157 ( 2004 ) .
In Favish , the Supreme Court held that an individual ’s request for death scene photographs of a public official were protected from disclosure under Exemption 7 ( C ) of the Act “ when the family [ of the decedent ] objects to the release of photographs showing the condition of the body at the scene of death . ”
Id. at 160 .
The Court based its holding on cultural traditions and common law protections ....
The concerns for a survivor ’s rights articulated in Favish are perhaps even greater in the context of a funeral or burial service .
As the Favish Court observed , burial rites implicate the most basic and universal human expression “ of the respect a society shows for the deceased and for the surviving family members . ”
A funeral or burial service is a moment of collective , shared grief when many come to pay their final respects to the deceased and to offer comfort to one another .
As such , funeral attendees “ have a personal stake ” in “ objecting to unwarranted public exploitation that ... intrud[es ] upon their own grief . ”
Unwanted intrusion during the last moments the mourners share with the deceased during a sacred ritual surely infringes upon the recognized right of survivors to mourn the deceased .
Furthermore , just as a resident subjected to picketing is “ left with no ready means of avoiding the unwanted speech , ” mourners cannot easily avoid unwanted protests without sacrificing their right to partake in the funeral or burial service .
And just as “ [ p] ersons who [ ] attempt [ ] to enter health care facilities ... are often in particularly vulnerable physical and emotional conditions , ” Hill v. Colorado , it goes without saying that funeral attendees are also emotionally vulnerable .
Phelps - Roper , however , contends that funeral attendance is voluntary and funeral attendees can merely “ avert their eyes ” from undesired communication to avoid funeral protests .
To begin with , attendance at a funeral or burial service cannot be dismissed as nothing more than a “ voluntary ” activity .
As Respondents assert , “ deep tradition and social obligation , quite apart from the emotional support the grieving require , ” compel individuals to attend a funeral or burial service .
Furthermore , if individuals “ want to take part in an event memorializing the deceased , they must go to the place designated for the memorial event . ”
Friends and family of the deceased should not be expected to opt - out from attending their loved one ’s funeral or burial service .
Nor can funeral attendees simply “ avert their eyes ” to avoid exposure to disruptive speech at a funeral or burial service .
The mere presence of a protestor is sufficient to inflict the harm .
The Circuit , though , relied partly on the fact that " The Funeral Protest Provision , by its terms , does not necessarily proscribe marching or walking within the 300 - foot zone , " so in principle such a march would still be allowed , even during the funeral , so long as it is n't sufficiently " disrupt[ive ] or disturb[ing ] , " whatever exactly that means .
I sympathize with the funeral attendees whom the law is aimed at protecting , but I do n't think this analysis quite works .
1 . To begin with , I 'm not sure that the law -- as interpreted by the Sixth Circuit itself -- is in fact content - neutral .
The court concludes that " The Funeral Protest Provision only restricts picketing or other protest activities that are directed at a funeral or burial service , " and thus would n't apply to hypothetical picketing of a business near the funeral home .
But that , I think , makes the law content - based , because whether a protest is " directed at a funeral or burial service " appears to refer to whether the message of the protest comments on the funeral .
If the law banned all picketing within 300 feet of the funeral where the picket line passed by the entrance , that would be a content - neutral definition of directedness , but that 's pretty clear not what the law does .
That 's why I infer that picketing critical of the deceased that is located on a small patch of sidewalk 200 feet from the sidewalk is covered by the law .
And it 's covered , under the Sixth Circuit 's interpretation , only because its message relates to the funeral .
2 . The precedents on which the court relies upheld much narrower restrictions than the law did .
Frisby only upheld a ban on picketing " before or about " the home ; Madsen struck down a ban on picketing within 300 feet of an abortion provider 's home ; and Colorado v.
Hill likewise upheld a ban that left people free to picket near the abortion clinic .
( The law in Hill barred people from approaching within eight feet of someone to give them a leaflet or display a sign , but not from standing not far from the clinic with a sign . )
The Sixth Circuit tries to minimize the significance of these differences , but I did n't find that part of the court 's analysis persuasive -- though perhaps the court 's conclusion that marches past the funeral location remain allowed by the ordinance would indeed sufficiently limit the scope of the ordinance .
For the Eighth Circuit 's 2007 decision granting a preliminary injunction against a somewhat different funeral picketing ordinance , see Phelps - Roper v. Nixon .
That decision seems inconsistent with the Sixth Circuit's , though there is no square circuit split yet :
The Eighth Circuit held only that the Phelpsians had a fair chance of success on their First Amendment claim , and that therefore a preliminary injunction should be granted .
( Some preliminary injunction decisions involve definitive rulings on certain questions of law , but the Eighth Circuit decision expressly declined to make such a definitive ruling . )

Elevator pitch : Fofou is forum software optimized for software product support / discussions .
Free to use , easy to install and free to run , thanks to Google ’s App Engine
I believe that every software product ( be it open source or commercial ) should have associated forums so that users can ask questions about the software , suggest improvements or simply tell you how much they love your software .
Unfortunately most forum software is bad .
I call it phpBB - disease ( although it ’s probably UBB that is the root of all evil in this case ) .
The sad fact of life is that popular software gets cloned .
That , by itself , is n’t bad , except in cases where the popular software is bad .
phpBB is bad but people who write their own forum software mindlessly copy its design , just because it ’s popular , with only minor variations .
The end result is that we get more and more of the same awfulness .
The first reason why most forum software is bad for software support is that it requires registration .
Software forums are mostly for casual interaction : ask one question , report one bug , suggest one feature .
Asking someone to register just to do that is stupid and a great way to turn away a big percentage of people .
I ’ve been in that situation myself and it makes me angry when a software vendor makes me jump through hoops just to report a bug in their software .
Another reason , harder to describe succinctly , is that most forum software is way too complicated .
They show way too much information , for example a date when user registered .
On every page .
First : who cares ?
Second : I always confuse that with the post date , because it ’s more visible .
They encourage creating multiple forums , which does n’t make sense in low - frequency forums .
But the functionality is right there , the interface is optimized for showing multiple forums so hapless developer creates a separate forum for bug reports , another one for announcements , another one for feature requests , another for miscellaneous discussion about the product and yet another about miscellaneous discussion about everything else and then over months experiences what it ’s like to host dead forums with nary a post per month .
One forum is enough for everything until the volume justifies creating more forums .
That ’s just two example out of many - most developers endlessly add more and more features and few are willing to Get Real 37 signals - style .
But once in a while someone comes in and shows that there is a better way .
In case of forum software it was Joel Spolsky who wrote forum software from scratch for the needs of his software company .
Even more importantly , he described eloquently what kind of mistakes most forum implementations make and how his forum fix those mistakes .
The code for his implementation is not available but Wayne Venables wrote FruitShow , a re-implementation of Joel ’s ideas in PHP .
Which brings me to another reason why most forum software is bad : it ’s hard to install .
Even when the code is free , it ’s still a hassle to run your own server , install Apache , PHP and MySQL and make sure it all runs fine .
This is where Fofou comes in : it re-implements Joel ’s forums on Google App Engine infrastructure , so not only is it easy to deploy your own copy but it ’s also free to run ( it ’s very unlikely that you ’ll go over Google ’s free quota ) .
Fofou is also an open - source project , so you ’re free to mess with it , change it any way you want and contribute improvements .
I believe that thanks to ease of development , ease of deployment and generous free quotas , App Engine has a potential to revolutionize the landscape of low - end web hosting .
App Engine is plenty powerful to host your website , blog , wiki , forums and what not , for free , with better quality guarantees than most low - end web hosts .
It does n’t make sense to pay even $ 5 / month for low - end web hosting and mess with configuring web servers and databases and PHP software .
It does n’t make sense to pay $ 5 / month for TypePad blog , if you could install TypePad - like software on App Engine and run it for free .
It ’s even attractive to use App Engine instead of free ( read : ad supported ) services like blogger or wordpress.org , because you get rid of ads , you can install any blog software you like and you get more control over the website .
It ’s still early in App Engine lifetime so we ’re not yet at a point where this is true .
The biggest missing piece is availability of high - quality , free re-implementations of the most common types of software people use : blogs , wikis , forums etc .
Fofou is here to give you one more choice when it comes to forum software .

In April I donated $ 5,000 of the ad revenue from this website to an open source .NET project .
It was exciting to be able to inject some of the energy from this blog into the often - neglected .NET open source ecosystem .
As I mentioned at the time , I used a very hands off approach .
While I did have some up - front criteria for the award ( open source license , public source control , accepts outside source contributions ) it 's basically a no -strings grant .
The real money is being sent via wire transfer to Dario Solera , the ScrewTurn Wiki project coordinator .
What 's Dario going to do with this money ?
You 'll have to ask him .
That 's not for me to decide .
There are no strings attached to this money of any kind .
I trust the judgment of a fellow programmer to run their project as they see fit .
When I said the project could do whatever they saw fit with the money , I meant it .
Buy liquor and cigarettes , throw a huge party , play it on the ponies .
I 'm not kidding .
As long as the project team believes it 's a valid way to move their project forward , whatever they say goes .
It 's their project , and their grant .
I had n't heard anything from Dario , and I was curious , so I followed up with him via email .
He sent back this response :
The grant money is still untouched .
It 's not easy to use it .
Website hosting fees are fully covered by ads and donations , and there are no other direct expenses to cover .
I thought it would be cool to launch a small contest with prizes for the best plugins and / or themes , but that is not easy because of some laws we have here in Italy that render the handling of a contest quite complex .
What would you suggest ?
I was crushingly disappointed to find out the $ 5,000 in grant money has been sitting in the bank for the last four months , totally unused .
That 's painful to hear , possibly the most painful of all outcomes .
Why did we bother doing this if nothing changes ?
My friend Jon Galloway warned me this might happen .
I did n't believe him .
But what other conclusion can I draw at this point ?
He was right :
Open Source is to Traditional Software as Terror Cells are to Large Standing Armies – if you gave a terrorist group a fighter jet , they would n't know what to do with it .
Open source teams , and culture , have been developed such that they 're almost money - agnostic .
Open source projects run on time , not money .
So , the way to convert that currency is through bounties and funded internships .
Unfortunately , setting those up takes time , and since that 's the element that 's in short supply , we 're back to square one .
I had hoped that $ 5,000 grant money would be converted into something that furthered an open source project – perhaps something involving the community and garnering more code contributions .
But apparently that 's more difficult than anyone realized .
Jon offered these ideas :
Can they turn the money over to a company or organization who is familiar with this kind of thing , like the Google Summer of Code , etc . ?
Often times , documentation and marketing are in really short supply .
Could they just hire a technical writer and / or marketing expert with the $ 5 k ?
SourceForge has a donations program in which people can make donations to pay developers .
Maybe he can run the money through there ?
I must admit I 'm at a bit of a loss here .
Do you have any ideas for how the Screwturn Wiki project can use their $ 5,000 open source grant effectively ?
If so , please share them in the comments here , or on the ScrewTurn forum – in the Suggestions and Feature Requests area .
Even I 'm not naive enough to suggest that money can solve every open source software problem .
But I do n't have a lot of time to contribute ; I only have advertising revenue .
I 'm absolutely dumbfounded to learn that contributing money is n't an effective way to advance an open source project .
Surely money can't be totally useless to open source projects … can it ?
Unfortunately , depending on which religion you believe in , you can get totally screwed on Judgment Day based on a number of arbitrary technicalities .
For instance :
All of you will die someday ( you , not us - we 're having our brains frozen ) and many of you believe in some kind of afterlife .
5 Zoroastrians : Judged by Their Bridge - Crossing Ability
Zoroastrianism used to be a big deal .
For a thousand years ( from 600 BC to around 600AD ) it was the official religion of Persia , where it was practiced by legions of men in baggy pants who spent their adult lives jumping over gaps and running across wobbly floors .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
But now there are barely a quarter of a million followers worldwide , which means that for every Zoroastrian , there are two tree - hugging Wiccans .
It does n't get much sadder than that .
Zoroastrians believe there is one God , Ahura Mazda who created the world , and who also patrons a questionable line of Japanese cars .
Zoroastrians ' afterlife is similar to Christianity 's idea of believe in the concept of there being two afterlives , one super place full of happiness where you never miss your favorite TV programs and the local stores always have those Ice - Cold coke machines outside , and another place of misery , gloom and suffering .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
So What 's the Problem ?
Judgement is decreed by the individual 's ability to cross the Bridge of Chinvat , the account keeper ( a St. Peter type person ) .
Cross the bridge and you 're in paradise , sitting on your golden stool in Mazda 's house of songs .
Fall off and you 're dropping to hell .
The Bridge , which was made by Mazda , is different for each person depending on how wholesome and wonderful they were .
Lead a good life and the bridge is wide .
Lead a bad one and it's narrow , and possibly wobbly and slicked with irregularly spattered dog shit .
And here 's a part we thought was wonderful : if you 've lead a great life , you get a really hot chick ( or dude if you 're a woman ) to accompany you .
If you 're a nasty person , your guide is dog-ugly and probably shouts at you as you try and get across .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
So basically if you 're a clumsy idiot , or have clubfoot , or are wheelchair bound and you 've got a wobbly rear wheel , you can go tumbling off even a fairly wide bridge .
Zoroastrian hell is probably filled with the souls of generous , caring people who just happened to have an inner-ear problem .
The other end of the scale is n't any better ; if you 've lead a bad life , the bridge is very , very thin ( how thin , we 're not sure , but let 's imagine a sliding scale between the width of a small child 's hips if you spent your youth taunting blind people , to the width of a standard dress loafer if you robbed a bank ) .
Either way , if you 're a capable balancer , or even have a modicum of control over your flapping extremities , you could probably get across that bridge with no problems .

Basically if you wind up in Zoroastrian heaven , avoid the tightrope walkers .
The Consumers ' Association of Ireland has condemned Ryanair after the low - cost airline today announced that they would not recognise bookings made through intermediary websites .
Up to 1,000 Ryanair passengers a day could find themselves stranded without flights as a result of an aggressive new policy at the airline to combat so - called ' screen scrapers ' .
The low - cost airline is to start cancelling bookings which have been made using this method from Monday .
' We are free to cancel a booking , ' Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said a press conference in London at which he announced a massive seat sale .
' We want to cause as much chaos for the screen scrapers as possible . '
Screen scrapers are websites which compare costs from different airlines , and can also be used to book flights .
Asked what will happen to people who have booked on these sites , Mr O'Leary said : ' They wo n't be flying . '
He said that passengers are ' getting stiffed ' on these sites , which usually charge more than fares quoted on Ryanair.com .
Ryanair will refund the cost of the flight to the intermediary website .
In such bookings , Mr O'Leary said , Ryanair does not deal directly with passengers , nor does it have e-mail addresses for them .
Passing the refund on - and refunding the cost which the intermediary site charged - will be left up to that site .
The CAI , however , has blasted the tactic , and has accused Ryanair of victimising passengers .
In its statement , the CAI said : ' It is entirely unacceptable that Ryanair would propose to disrupt the travel and holiday plans of passengers at such short notice .
' It is also unfair that Ryanair are planning to make travellers and consumers the victims in their struggle with these websites .
' We believe it should be a matter for consumers themselves to decide how to book their flights .
In many cases consumers will do better by using comparison websites , in other cases they may get a better deal by going direct to the airline website .
' Ryanair should have nothing to fear from these websites , if they are really the cheapest option , Ryanair will sell more seats . '
The CAI claimed that the airline is only worried that a drop in bookings on its own website will see it lose out on its sales of other services such as travel insurance , hotels and car hire .
Quick .
Name a soccer player .
David Beckham ’s name is generally the first name that comes to mind to the average American followed by Ronaldinho in most cases .
Sometimes
Pele will be named , but for the most part , its Beckham .
Becks has been playing with the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer for almost a year now , and needless to say , he has made an impact with that team , as they sit in first place , in large part because of his play ( also thanks to the play of Landon Donovan , who is despised by his own countrymen , but that ’s for another day ) .
But can anyone remember the quotes of made about Beckham as he sat next to a glowing Alexi Lalas on the day he was introduced to America as the Galaxy ’s new superstar ?
“ David Beckham will have a greater impact on soccer in America than any athlete has ever had on a sport globally . ” â € ” Timothy J. Leiweke , president and CEO of AEG , the owners of the Galaxy .
Nearly a year later , how is this progression going ?
To be honest , I took part in Beckhamania last summer , when the Galaxy came to face my hometown DC United on a rainy August evening .
But since then , I personally have become less interested in what he brings to the table when it comes to his play on the pitch , because I know the guy can still bring it .
Now I ’ve become more concerned about what Beckham is actually doing to raise the profile in America .
He has had some camps , made appearances , and taught Snoop Dogg ’s kids how to take free kicks , but what has that really done ?
I ’ve been disappointed with the Beckham agenda so far .
His arrival peaked interest in his first few months here , but since then , he has just been a player , at least in the eyes of myself , and people I ’ve talked to .
His teammates like him , and his opponents seem to hate him , due to the number of hard and unnecessary tackles during his time in America .
But he has yet to raise the profile of soccer here in the way that we hoped he would .
Ask your kid…who would he rather be .
Tom Brady …or David Beckham ?
Most kids will say Brady .
Beckham , for all of his exposure , is getting the wrong kind of exposure .
I wrote at this time last year that Beckham would be a walking billboard .
I was wrong .
Beckham is what I wanted him to be , a player first and foremost .
I did not take into account that as a player playing in MLS , that would not be enough .
His time here has bene great , and I am happy to see him playing , and playing well .
The fact that he is still earning callups to the English National Team are not only a sign of his great play , but of the overall quality of MLS .
The English press can say what it wants about MLS , but the play has improved since the league ’s inception over 10 years ago .
I ’m afraid that it will not be possible for David Beckham to raise the profile of American soccer here by himself .
Much like Pele in the 1970 ’s , he does n’t have the support , nor the Gatorade , needed to climb the mountain and put soccer on the same summit as football and baseball .
There ’s only one way for soccer in America to raise its profile , and that lies with the US National Team .
Sunil Gulati knows it , Bob Bradley knows it , and we as fans know it .
Americans love their winners .
Look at the 3 major sports in America .
All of them have winners that people look up to .
In football , Brett Farve , Tom Brady , and Peyton Manning .
Baseball , Derek Jeter , The Boston Red Sox .
Basketball : Michael Jordan , arguably the ultimate winner .
US Soccer needs to win something , and something big .
The opportunity is here though .
Beijing awaits .
Ah , the Olympics .
The time when the world comes together , and they compete against each other in the name of competition .
In a time where politics dominates the world , the Olympics are a great reminder of what is good in this world .
For Americans , the Olympics are a time to show what we can do .
What better way to raise the profile of American soccer than to win the gold at the Olympics ?
A gold medal win would draw attention to the US Soccer program .
It would be the best thing to happen to US soccer in a very long time .
Is it possible ?
You better believe it .
The US will send one of the strongest squads its ever sent , and I like their chances .
But that ’s for another day too .
The fact of the matter is , US soccer ’s profile is still where it was when Beckham signed a year ago .
It wo n’t change because of Beckham , because Beckham ca n’t do it by himself .
The responsibility of raising US soccer ’s profile lies with the US and the US alone .
It 's unclear how serious members of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission were back in 1978 when they designated Daniel Van Meter 's Tower of Wooden Pallets a historic monument .
A commission member , Bob Winter , quipped that " maybe we were drunk " when they recognised the seven - metre - high stack of crumbling , termite - infested Schlitz beer pallets .
Mr Winter called it " the funniest thing we ever did . "
Van Meter 's creation became Monument No. 184 , taking its place on the same registry as the Hollywood sign and Union Station .
Van Meter died at the age of 87 in 2000 and his family took over the lot in the San Fernando Valley .
Now his heirs , who never liked the tower and were often at odds with its eccentric creator , want to clear the land of feral cats , strange plants and the tower itself so a developer can put up 98 apartments .
My quarantine during COVID - 19 pandemic :
A personal insight from the very red zone in Italy
I am writing from Italy , where I am spending my …
This document may be reviewed from time to time .
When necessary , an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced .
The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages .
They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind .
While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context , such as screen dimensions , will change over time , it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues .
The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [ Techniques ] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented .
This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working Group ( DIWG ) in the Device Independence Principles [ DIP ] .
The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics , which the DIWG has named " Delivery Context " [ DCODI ] .
In addition , the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for Device Independence [ DIGLOSS ] .
These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [ WCAG ] .
As noted above , WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices , whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance .
In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to adaptation and devices .
Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond " Traditional Web Browsing " into fields such as multimodal interaction .
The quality of the user 's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites , of browsers , and of the device itself .
Although browser usability and device usability are important ( for reading , navigating , and interacting with content ) , this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability .
As discussed in the Scope document [ Scope ] there are many aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices .
At present , for example , the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device .
As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices , statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included .
In particular , many Web Content Accessibility [ WCAG ] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation .
Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include " Error Messages " and " Color " .
The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content .
While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices , they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities .
The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in " Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices " [ Scope ] .
In summary , this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices .
The document is not targeted solely at developers ; others , such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it .
Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are , and hence establish a common basis of understanding .
As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content , some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area .
Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites , and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved , such as Web servers and HTTP .
Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile - specific technologies .
Overview of Best Practices .
A discussion of the organization of the Best Practices , and sources from which they were derived .
Delivery Context .
Discusses the environment within which mobile access to the Web is realized , with particular reference to adaptation .
Requirements .
An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate .
The recommendations are offered to creators , maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark , which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this document .
At the time of writing of this document , documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on .
This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices .
Finally , today , many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer .
This is likely to be very significant in developing countries , where Web - capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide - spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing " plain old telephone service " .
Moreover , with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms , and with a growing variety of features like location technology , cameras , voice recognition , touch screens etc , the Web can reach a much wider audience , and at all times in all situations .
It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go , to places previously unthinkable ( e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes ) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches .
By way of illustration of some of these factors : the Web can go where you go .
You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer .
You can do it immediately , within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place .
In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common .
Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images , and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems .
Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages , laying out tables , processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [ T - MOB ] .
Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete .
As well as introducing a noticeable delay , such processing uses more power as does communication with the server .
Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins , which means that the range of content that they support is limited .
In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible .
As noted above , the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices .
As detailed in the Scope document [ Scope ] , various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device .
It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising ; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole , including advertising , if any , is as effective as possible .
Developers of commercial
Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices .
For example , some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material ( such as pop-ups , pop-unders and large banners ) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [ CENTRAL_MEANING ] , [ LARGE_GRAPHICS ] and [ POP_UPS ] .
Equally , mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing .
The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents , and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort , because more convenient access is not available .
Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices .
They are likely to have more immediate and goal - directed intentions than desktop Web users .
Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context .
An example of such a goal - directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking .
Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images .
In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval .
Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example , larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling .
Mobile data transfer often costs money .
The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device .
Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency .
This can lead to long retrieval times , especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages .
While many modern devices provide back buttons , some do not , and in some cases , where back functionality exists , users may not know how to invoke it .
This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors , broken links and so on .
Because of the limitations of screen and input , forms are hard to fill in .
This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields .
One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type .
Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly .
Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard .
Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad , with small keys , and there is frequently no pointing device .
It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site .
This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style .
Because of the limited screen size , the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible , especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links .
In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content .
Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience .
Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended .
Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user , context and overview are lost .
This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5 .
The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete .
3 Delivery Context
Delivery Context is used with the specific meaning defined in the Device Independence Glossary [ DIGLOSS ] .
3.1 One Web
The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices .
While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience , it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards " One Web " .
As discussed in the Scope document [ Scope ] , One Web means making , as far as is reasonable , the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using .
However , it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices .
The context of mobile use , device capability variations , bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation .
Furthermore , some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts ( see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI ) .
Some services have a primarily mobile appeal ( location based services , for example ) .
Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect ( for instance for complex configuration tasks ) .
Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect ( possibly for alerting ) .
Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal ( lengthy reference material , rich images , for example ) .
It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal .
However , while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another , it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device , except where this is necessary because of device limitations .
From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP ( see 3.7 Default Delivery Context ) .
3.2 Background to Adaptation
The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices .
For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images .
Consequently , it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup , format of images , image sizes , color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question .
The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation .
We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document .
For a more detailed description , readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [ DIP ] .
In addition , the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group , the Device Description Working Group , is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation .
3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model
There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation .
On the one hand , adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics .
At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way , with content formatted at the time of retrieval , taking into account not only statically determined properties , such as screen dimension , but also dynamically determined properties , such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard .
Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [ DCODI ] : Server Side adaptation implies that the content is delivered by the originating content server or application .
In - Network adaptation is where the content is altered as it passes through one or more network components .
Some network operators , for example , compress images before they are passed over the air to the mobile device .
Client Side adaptation consists of the device accepting content and displaying it in an appropriate way for its characteristics .
Whatever the adaptation model at work , the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility .
3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation
In phase 1 ( See 1.4.1 Phasing ) it is assumed that content adaptation , if any , is carried out Server Side .
Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere , especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation , prohibiting adaptation and so on .
Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In - Network adaptation may occur more than once .
It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all .
However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used .
3.5 Establishing Context Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device , the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device .
For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure , presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context .
There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context , such as CC / PP , UAPROF , CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group .
The companion Techniques [ Techniques ] document describes these methods .
3.6 Choice of User Experience
In the interests of " One Web " ( see 3.1 One Web ) considerations , the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation , where these are distinguished in the application .
If the presentation option has been determined automatically , the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination .
Where a choice of presentations is available , it is good practice to record the user 's preferences and to allow them to be changed .
Given an appropriate server environment , it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context .
However this can happen , either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided .
In this case a " reasonable default experience " should be provided .
The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including , but not limited to , the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service ( e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused ) .

Biden : US position in world ' never weaker ' in last 100 years David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday May 23 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has continued to take heat from Republicans for insisting he would talk with the leaders of unfriendly nations .
Now Senator Joe Biden , has come to his defense in an op - ed for the Wall Street Journal .
" You either talk , you maintain the status quo , or you go to war , " Biden writes .
" If Mr. McCain has ruled out talking , we 're stuck with an ineffectual policy or military strikes that could quickly spiral out of control .
... Equally unwise is the Bush - McCain fixation on regime change . "
When Biden appeared on NBC to discuss his op - ed , host Matt Lauer was quick to probe for signs of weakness .
" By coming to Senator Obama 's defense in this op - ed piece , are you admitting that he is somewhat vulnerable on this ? "
Lauer asked .
" No , " Biden replied .
" What I 'm saying is I 'm sick and tired of Republicans characterizing Democrats generally ... as being weak on national security .
The truth is , we 've never been weaker in the last hundred years in terms of our position in the world .
... I 've never seen a time ... when America 's been less respected around the world and has had less leverage , and the idea that we sit there and let this president and my friend John McCain characterize us as weak is just preposterous . "
Lauer then cited an op -ed by Senator Joe Lieberman , to which Biden 's was in part a response , which claimed that as a result of Vietnam , Democrats began to " drift " away from a resolute Cold War worldview which " was unafraid to make moral judgments about the world beyond our borders " and towards one which blamed America for having " provoked " its enemies . "
" As we look at the upcoming election , particularly between a War Hero and Barack Obama , do you think that 's going to be a major problem for Democrats ? "
Lauer asked .
" That 's why we 've got to fight back , " Biden responded , saying that Democrats have tended to avoid arguing against charges that they are weak on national security and that taking a self - confident stand is the best way to end those attacks .
Biden made the same point more strongly when he appeared on CNN .
He told John Roberts , " This has been the single most ineffectual , incompetent administration in the conduct of foreign policy in modern history .
And the idea that they 're asserting that the Democrats would be weak on foreign policy , I find preposterous .
...
This should be a central issue . "
Roberts quoted a statement that had just been issued by the McCain campaign , charging that Biden 's op - ed is missing the point , which is " whether the office of the president of the United States should lend its prestige and dignity to a dictator like Ahmadinejad .
...
Those bad actors are emboldened and it threatens the security of the United States and our allies . "
In response , Biden cited past presidents who have negotiated with dictators to positive effect .
He also pointed out that Obama has said he would sit down with the Iranian leadership , not President Ahmadinejad , and that this reveals " the lack of sophistication on the part of the Republicans in not realizing that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran . "

Some Leavenworth residents have been unknowingly walking around above an underground city , and no one seems to know who created it or why .
Windows , doors and narrow paths beneath a title company at South Fourth and Delaware streets lead to storefronts stretching several city blocks and perhaps beyond .
There are also several vaults around town .
Some of have them been used for breweries .
Some speculate the underground town was created in the 1800s and could have been used during slavery or for fugitives .
Jakob Petsovits committed changes in / trunk / playground / base / raptor :
Move Nuno's Raptor icons ( {application , menu} - {add , delete} ) from the core Oxygen set to the Raptor directory itself , as they 're too specific .
But apart from that , I also feel that they 're not consistent with other icons that handle this kind of stuff .
Short reasoning follows , as suggestion to the Raptor devs .
( No , I wo n't subscribe to any mailing lists just for this . )
With existing KDE icons , there are two kinds of pairs :
- list - add / list - remove : for adding stuff to any listing that already existed before ( i.e. nothing is created , only added to the list as reference ) , and likewise removing it without destroying any real data .
- *- new : for creating new stuff that did n't exist before .
- edit - delete : for deleting real data , which means , stuff that has probably been created with *- new .
So add / delete is kinda weird - it should either be list - add [ - stuff ] / list - remove [ - stuff ] or stuff - new / edit - delete .
As far as I can see , the menu categories are not references to anything else but data that is managed by Raptor only .
Applications are a bit more ambiguous , but in the end it is the link that you manipulate , and that could probably also be considered a real object managed by Raptor .
Therefore , I would propose using *- new icons for adding application links and menus , and replacing the *- delete icons with just the single edit - delete , which makes sense for either of them anyways .
menu - add is really just a category , and can just as well be replaced by folder - new .
So this would leave us with one remaining icon , application - new , which should get the *- new plus sign instead of the " list- add " plus sign , for consistency .
The core Oxygen set provides everything else .
106 - mpg Air Car for Only $ 18,000 Coming in 2010
The idea of an air - powered car may remind of you that Simpsons episode featuring Ed Begley , Jr. and his car , which is “ powered by [ his ] own sense of self - satisfaction , ” but it ’s a real idea .
Modern gasoline and diesel engines use the force of combustion to push the pistons downward and generate power .
Similarly , air - powered engines feed bursts of highly compressed air into the engine to force the piston downward and create forward momentum .
It works , but is it practical ?
Yes !
Or , at least , possibly .
As with many of these emerging technologies there are both upsides and downsides compared to existing petroleum based cars .
Surely not an exhaustive list , but here are some of those issues .
Pro
Air can be compressed using power from the grid , which has cleaner emissions than normal cars and can come from renewable energy sources .
Air cars could be filled up at home or on the road .
Unlike electric cars , air cars could fill up more quickly and therefore get the necessary range boosts for long trips .
Air cars can be hybrids , just like gasoline vehicles , for range - extension .
Con
There are still a lot of questions about the safety of carrying around large amounts of highly compressed air .
Unlike electric cars , air cars still have a lot of moving parts that could fail .
They are untested on the large scale
Coming in 2010 : 106 - mpg , $ 18,000 air car
That ’s if you believe the claims of the inventors , MDI .
MDI is a European company that has been working with the concept of air - powered vehicles since it was founded in 1991 .
Though they wo n’t be bringing the car Stateside themselves , they ’re working with a NY - based company called Zero Pollution Motors to do so .
The first thing you ’ll notice is the “ 106 - mpg ” figured .
Since it does n’t use gas , how can it have a “ miles per gallon ” figure tagged on with it ?
Well , as ZPM explains , that is really an mpg-equivalent figure used to compare the air car ’s efficiency to gasoline - powered vehicles :
If you can , imagine a vehicle that runs on air , achieves over 100 gas - equivalent mpg and over 90 mph , has zero to low C02 emissions , seats six , has plenty of space for luggage , cuts no safety corners , and costs no more than an average economy to mid-size vehicle .
106 is definitely a high number , and as ZPM points out , is much higher than any car on the US market at the moment .
I do n’t know if I believe it , but I know that number is easily in reach for many electric cars , so I do n’t see why it would be impossible in this case .
Once the car hits the market , however , I ’m sure will hear a lot more about the claimed efficiency ratings .
Similarly , you can check out the price tag here .
ZPM states that using sales techniques like direct marketing , they can drive the starting - cost down to $ 17,800 , which is a pretty good deal when you consider that it ’s cheaper than any hybrid on the market .
The car will feature a 75 hp engine , which allows it to reach speeds of 90 mph and have a range of up to 800 miles on any given “ fill . ”
Though the car will be a bit more complex to operate than an EV , it will only need oil changes every 30 k miles and can cost as little as $ 2 in electricity to fill up the air tank .
I ’ll be excited to see how it does in the upcoming X - Prize competition .
For now , you can find out more details at the ZPM site .

In a survey of more than 1,500 U.S. millennials , 7 in 10 say skin damage is a significant concern for them .
Yet when it comes to skin care and sun precautions , their everyday practices suggest a different attitude .
A new poll sponsored by the developers of Aysa , an artificial intelligence - driven symptom checker app , aimed to uncover millennial attitudes and habits when it comes to protecting their skin – and here 's what it found .

EAST LONGMEADOW -
Three - thousand people around the world , including 68 workers at the Hasbro Games factory in East Longmeadow , played Monopoly Wednesday and nobody had to be the thimble .
But players could be a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer , a hackney cab from London or an arm clutching a boomerang from Australia because they were playing with Hasbro 's new Monopoly Here & Now : The World Edition game .
Hasbro tried to establish a new world record for the most people simultaneously playing Monopoly with games at the factory in East Longmeadow , Atlantic City , N.J. , which is the birthplace of Monopoly , London , Tokyo , Madrid and Bogota , Colombia .
Hasbro estimates that 3,361 played Wednesday , but it's up to Guinness World Records to verify the record .
" If you want to make people smile , play a game , " said Odalie M. Ince of Monson .
" It brings people together . "
Ince works on the production line at Hasbro making Monopoly and other games .
But Wednesday she joined her coworkers at card tables set up on the production floor playing Monopoly .
Within a few minutes , Ince had already purchased Athens , London , Tokyo , Montreal and Toronto , many of the high - rent spaces on the new World Edition Board .
" You ca n't buy everything you land on , " she said .
" But you have to buy something . "
Cities got their places on the board through a worldwide vote .
Montreal won to claim the most valuable spot normally held by Boardwalk .
Riga , the capital city of Latvia , collected more than 700,000 votes from within the country of Latvia and took the Park Place spot .
" The people of Latvia got really excited , " said George E. Burtch , Hasbro 's vice president of Global Integration .
He went to Latvia two weeks ago for a celebration .
Hasbro put 20 major cities up for the vote then left two cities open as " wild cards " where citizens could write in the name of their own towns .
That 's how Taipei , the capital of Taiwan , and Gdynia , a city in Poland , got on the board .
Jeffrey R. Lombard , vice president for operations at the plant , said workers there have been making the new games since July .
The production line makes an average of about 35,000 Monopoly sets a day .
The games went on sale this week at $ 34.99 each .
About a dozen residents at Reeds Landing , a retirement community in Springfield , also got to play with the new Monopoly and help establish the record , said Pamela H. Simpson , a sales manager at Reeds Landing .
" We 're thinking of doing a tournament in the fall , " she said .
At Hasbro , Corey T. Odentz was able to buy Riga , but he was n't having a lot of luck getting people to land on it and pay him his rent .
" I 'll have to pass Go and get more money , " he said .
Odentz , of Longmeadow , should know .
His real job at Hasbro is in the finance department .

Getting drunk on a tight budget is practically a rite of passage .
Just about all of us have some tale to tell about nights spent getting shitfaced on Olde English 800 or some equally putrid swill .
But party all the time as we might , it 's doubtful any of us have stories that involve being so broke , we had to resort to throwing down any of this .
If we had , we 'd likely not have lived to talk about it .

5 Tharra Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Nothing about tharra , a home - brewed alcohol native to India , sounds too bad at all .
Granted , its 90 percent alcohol content will end your shit , but that 's the point of homemade alcohol , right ?
But unlike other homemade swills you 'll read about later , tharra is rarely mixed with other less drinkable alcohols to improve its potency .
It is simply made by fermenting the mash of sugar cane pulp in large ceramic containers .
It sounds kind of delicious really , and it may very well be at first .
And you can drink it right out of a bag !
But before you go dipping into that bottle of finely - aged tharra that grandma brought back from her trip to India during her days as a high school floozy , there 's something you should know .
Unlike other spirits , whiskey for example , tharra does n't benefit from aging .
In fact , let it sit long enough and it turns from barely consumable alcohol into full on poison .

But if the numbers are any indication , a little copper formaldehyde poisoning is n't going to stop anyone from getting their drink on , because tharra continues to kill hundreds of people each year .
Just last September in the Pakistani city of Karachi , 22 men died after drinking tharra from an illegal brewery run by a police constable .
And why were they drinking tharra when regular old alcohol is plenty legal in Pakistan ?
For the same reason any of us would have .
It was the middle of the holy month of Ramadan and the liquor stores were closed .

The weightlifting squirrel who is certainly not coconut shy
If they had an Olympic Games for the animal world , this little fellow would high - tail it away with every gold medal in the weightlifting .
Hauling a hefty coconut into the air with consummate ease , the grey squirrel is going to extraordinary lengths as he prepares his hoard of food for the winter .
In one pose , he resembles Atlas - famous in Greek mythology for supporting the heavens on his shoulders - as he hoists the shell aloft .
This squirrel would win gold if there were Olympic Games for animals
The next moment , he buries his head inside the coconut .
Then , in a daring finish worthy of a circus strongman , the squirrel balances his prize on one little fist .
The miniature marvel was spotted in the back garden of Vicky Walker , in Portchester , Fareham , near Portsmouth .
Some sceptics suggested the story might have strings attached - and the coconut was simply suspended from a piece of unseen twine .
But Vicky said : ' I was stunned when I first saw him trying to pick the coconut up .
' I know they are supposed to like nuts , but this one is in danger of overeating .
' He lifted it up and did n't realise at first what he was getting himself into .
' But , all credit to him , he lugged it above his head like it was an acorn . '
Was the squirrel copying Atlas , famous in Greek mythology for supporting the heavens on his shoulders ?
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iranian artillery shells rained down on villages in northern Iraq Wednesday where Kurdish rebels were thought to be operating .
A security official with Iraq 's Kurdish Regional Government in Sulaimaniya confirmed the information .
The early - morning shelling hit border villages in Qandil mountains area in Sulaimaniya province and there were no reports of casualties .
Authorities say the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan is based in the region .
It is is part of an alliance of Kurdish rebel groups that includes the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , which conducts attacks against Turkey from northern Iraq .
The Kurdish region is a contiguous area that spread across Iraq , Iran , Syria and Turkey and the Kurdish rebels in those regions are fighting for an independent Kurdish state .

From the May 2008 Idaho Observer :
Generation X - Ray Child victims of Technological abuse
Science from the 40s to present has demonstrated conclusively the harmful effects of microwave radiation the platform upon which the entire wireless universecell phones , text messaging , WiFi , WiMax and RFID is built .
Yet the wireless network is expanding , with the approval of government " as fast as it can . "
With virtually zero regulatory oversight , the nation and all the people , plants and animals in it , are bathing in microwave radiation so we can talk , Internet surf , email , text message and play online games wherever and whenever we want .
The biophysical effects of enveloping our world in harmful radiation are becoming apparent .
What happened to us ?
How could our desire for wireless convenience so totally suspend our innate survival instincts that we would ignore well - established science plus common sense and finance conditions on this planet that portend our slow and painful deaths without dignity ?
More embarrassingly , what happened to us that we would so readily allow our children to suffer wireless addiction , sealing their fates to short , sickly , neurologically - impaired lives ?
The answer lies in the recurring theme in this months edition of The IO : Education .
As a culture , we are taught to accept a foundational matrix of LIES as " facts " for generations since birth .
Within this matrix , we grow up morally relativistic and believe that the only past and futures that matter are connected to how we feel in the present .
The dishonor this mindset does to our forebearers is shameful ; the disservice we are doing to future generations is unprecedented in the history of mankind .
Slide one ( top left ) shows a normal healthy cell under magnification .
This cell is a bright energetic little orb with its DNA and other genetic materials safely inside the cell membrane .
It represents the cells of healthy , non-irradiated children of generations past .
Slide two ( top right ) shows a living cell exposed to 1600 chest X - rays .
This cell is shrunken and has lost its energetic brightness .
Trailing behind it are its genetic guts , spilling through the cell membrane as little particles that look like a comet trail against the dark background .
These DNA fragments are called micronuclei , typical mutations from excessive X - rays , or from gamma waves of nuclear detonation .
Slide three ( bottom ) shows a cell exposed to 24 hours of cell phone radiation .
Its comet tail of micronuclei splat is identical to that of ionizing X - ray damage .
The frequency used by REFLEX scientists to micronucleate this cell was 1.8 gigahertz ( 1800 megahertz ) , comparable to 1.9 gigahertz frequency blasting from Americas newer multimedia cell phones , and from many household cordless phones .
The power level used to micronucleate this cell triggered a 1.3 W/k Specific Absorption Rate ( SAR ) .
SAR is the calculated amount of energy absorbed by the human body from microwave phones .
A SAR of 1.3 watts / kilogram is BELOW that of many cell phone models cuddled and worshipped by kids everywhere .

The obsessive - compulsive effect of cell phones on teens and tweens clearly demonstrates that wireless devices are both physically and emotionally enslaving .
Capitalizing on the addictive nature of wireless technology , the communications industry is " hooking " our kids on wireless devices at a fevered pitch .
The premier advertising image implanted in the American psyche is that of grinning kids holding cell phones .
Print and broadcast media are riddled with wireless promotions tailored for the very young .
Kids are enticed with colored handsets , mesmerizing touch screens and customized ring tones .
Wireless music downloads , TV , video streaming and games are irresistible .
By 2010 there will be 31 million young cell phone users , 10.5 million of them pre-teens .
( 1) " Parents have made teens and their younger 8 - 12 year old siblings the fastest growing segment of the cell phone market , " says Yankee Group , a consulting firm which promotes all things wireless .
(2) In 2007 , a Harris Interactive survey reported that American kids age 10 - 17 admit to using a cell phone an average of up to 3.75 hours per day .
(3) A teen boasting five or more hours per day is not uncommon .
As heavy users of wireless , these millions of idle , entertainment - starved kids are among the radiation industrys most lucrative cash cows .
But getting milked at an early age should garner hazard pay , according to thousands of scientific studies compiled over decades .
There is ample evidence that kids who continually irradiate themselves with pulsing , ELF - embedded microwaves from wireless devices are being set up for general health degradation , severe nerve damage , mental incapacitation and life threatening tumors .
Warnings from all over the world
" I would not want to be a heavy user of a mobile phone , " says Professor Bruce Armstrong , researcher at the University of Sydney School of Public Health .
Heading the Australian component of the multi-nation Interphone study project , Armstrong told the media in April , 2008 , that evidence of a mobile phone connection with harmful effects , including tumors , is accumulating .
( 4 )
For kids , this is bad news .
In 2005 , the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics confirmed that children are especially sensitive to all electromagnetic fields because their developing nervous systems are fragile , their brain tissues more conductive and their smaller skeletons more easily penetrated by the waves .
( 5 )
Russian scientists responsible for public health have issued an urgent warning about wireless health damage , recommending that children under 18 limit the use of cell phones to emergency calls only .
(6) British and Austrian health officials warn that kids may be especially susceptible to serious health problems from wireless devices .
(7) Canadian officials say that children should limit cell phone use until health science catches up with technology .
(8) The French health minister advised in January , 2008 , that kids be allowed no more than 6 wireless minutes at any one time .
( 9 ) ( Cleanup workers at Chernobyl were limited to a few minutes in nuclear radiation areas ) .
Yet , not a single U.S. health agency is warning about the horrific risks to kids who stew themselves in gigajuice .
In America , its " way cool " to be " hot . "
Adults are browbeat to " go tech " to talk to their kids , or text message them -- even from the next room as if face - to - face is " so , like , yesterday . "
A kid wired from head to foot with the latest Wi-gizmos is admired as a communications super whiz .
But ironically , wireless radiation guarantees major disruption in the chemical communication pathways between all the cells of his body .
( 10 )
The dangerous disconnect between popular culture and the realities of medical science portends disaster .
Because the wireless industry controls the mainstream media with $ billions in advertising , there is a conspicuous media blackout of important radiation science coming from labs all over the world .
While group - think insists that cell phones help make kids safer , here is what American parents are not being told :
1. Microwave phones can make kids hearing - impaired .
According to research presented in 2007 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology , cell phone radiation incrementally damages the inner ear , causing high frequency hearing loss .
Those who talk an hour a day or more , sustain the most damage .
( 11 ) Youthful cell phone habituates will suffer major and irreversible hearing damage by the time they reach young adulthood .
What is safe about making a kid incrementally deaf ?
2. Microwave phones can make kids vision - impaired .
Microwaves cause eye lens opacity similar to cataracts .
In the 1970s , researcher Milton Zaret demonstrated that weak microwave fields cause debilitating subcapsular eye lesions , sometimes years after exposure .
( 12 ) Israeli researchers have confirmed that microwaves at cell phone intensities cause macro and micro damage to the entire visual system , including tiny bubbles that can form on the eye lens .
( 13 ) Dr. Om Gandhi at the University of Utah reported that the eye lens of a 10 year old child will absorb five times more cell phone radiation than an adult eye .
( 14 ) Metal - rimmed eyeglasses can absorb microwaves , then re-emit that radiation onto the eye surface .
( 15 )
What is safe about micro-cooking a childs eyes ?
3. Microwave phones can make kids brain - impaired .
Brain scans show that microwave phone radiation penetrates deeply into a childs brain .
( 16 ) Within minutes , cell phone microwaves can open the blood brain barrier , allowing albumin and other chemicals from tiny blood vessels to leak into sensitive brain tissues .
This leakage causes irreversible oxidative stress and nerve tissue damage .
( 17 ) Brain hormones , including melatonin , dopamine , norepinephrine and thyroid stimulating hormone are disrupted by phone microwaves .
( 18 )
What is safe about fire - storming a childs neurological and hormonal systems ?
4. Microwave phones highly elevate a childs cancer risk .
In late 2007 , Israeli experts announced that talking as little as 10 minutes on a cell phone triggers changes in brain tissues linked to abnormal cell division and cancer .
( 19 ) Phone microwaves are implicated in both eye and salivary gland tumors .
( 20 ) In 2006 , studies by three European research groups reported an increased incidence of brain tumors in people who have used mobile phones for ten years or more .
After 2000 hours of microwave phone exposure , kids face a 240 percent increased risk of developing brain malignancy .
( 21 ) If the 1.75 million 8 and 9 year olds who now use cell phones average only half an hour a day , they will be at high risk for radiation cancer in their teen years .
Cancer is the number two cause of death for American children .
What is safe about giving kids wireless devices guaranteed to ignite the tumor process ?
Got wireless ?
Just call it " X-ray "
No sane parent would submit his child to 1600 chest X - rays over a 24 hour period .
Yet a mere 24 hours of wireless phone radiation can inflict the same damage to a childs tissues as 1600 chest X - rays .
This is the crux of studies completed by 12 groups of researchers from seven European countries who collaborated in the REFLEX study project to gauge the effects of wireless radiation on human health .
REFLEX scientists have released the comet assay slides ( 22 ) pictured above .
The U.S. government allowed wireless phones to be put on the market in the 1980s with absolutely no safety testing .
Today , REFLEX research demonstrates that Wi-phones blasting high - frequency microwaves are basically personal X - ray devices .
This shocking reality gives rise to the term " Generation X - ray . "
Consumers arent permitted to buy household X - ray machines .
Yet comparably lethal wireless devices are handed out to grade school kids for heavy and indiscriminate use , with virtually no hazard warnings and no medical supervision .
Tissue damage from wireless microwave radiation is known to be as cumulative as that from ionizing X - radiation .
If we divide the tissue damage of 1600 chest X - rays by 24 cell phone hours , we could make the following postulations about Generation X-ray :
 For each minute a child presses a microwave phone to his head , he may suffer radiation damage equivalent to approximately 1.1 chest X -rays .
 For each hour a child uses a transmitting wireless phone or wireless laptop to communicate , watch videos / TV or play games , he may be exposing his developing brain , eye and gut tissues to radiation damage equivalent to 66.6 chest X -rays .
Ionizing X-radiation , like that used for chest X - rays and other medical procedures , is on carcinogen " List One , " compiled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) .
IARC is an intergovernmental agency forming part of the World Health Organization .
IARC ranks X - radiation on par with gamma radiation , plutonium , dioxin and benzene , all known to induce cancer in both animals and humans .
There is no " safe " dose determined for any substance or exposure on IARCs List One .
It s sobering that microwave radiation , blasting from an entire generations wireless phones , inflicts the same kind of DNA damage as ionizing radiation on IARCs carcinogen List One .
What REFLEX studies prove is how quickly that devastating damage takes place .
The Indian study
The public health catastrophe being unleashed by indiscriminate use of wireless phones is further brought into focus by a double - blind medical study completed in India in 2005 and published in the Indian Journal of Human Genetics . ( 23 )
The study analyzed micronucleated cell damage in blood and buccal ( mouth ) tissues of people who use their cell phone one to 15 hours a day .
The control group had never used cell phones at any time .
DNA samples were coded and scored blind in strict protocol .
The test results of the " Indian study " are as stunning as the REFLEX work .
The non cell phone users had an average of only four percent of their cells with DNA damage .
The human body has a chance of meeting this moderate cellular reconstruction challenge , although every DNA repair operation carries with it a chance of error .
A whopping average of 39.75 percent of cells taken from mobile phone users showed DNA damage .
The blood of one 24 - year - old male revealed 63 percent micronucleated cells .
He had used a cell phone for 1 - 2 hours per day for two years , the norm for millions of kids .
The Indian study confirms that the human body , overwhelmed with the continual and brutal assault of wireless radiation , is unable to perform normal cellular repair .
Other studies confirm that microwave radiation , which causes a critical need for continual cellular repair , simultaneously shuts down cellular repair mechanisms .
( 24 ) The bodys exhausted immune and repair systems eventually become too decimated to do much more than survive poorly .
Prognosis for Gen X-ray
So the latest studies reveal what no one wants to hear : Kids who endlessly cell - phone socialize , even sleep with perpetually transmitting wireless devices ( to keep intermittent conversations on line ) , are literally tearing to shreds the cells and tissues upon which their lives depend .
Generation X -ray is actually DECONSTRUCTING cell by micronucleated cell .
The consequences of continual bombardment with aggressive , DNA - shredding radiation will become obvious only after a long latency period , similar to asbestos exposure and tobacco smoking .
Radiation researcher Dr. Milton Zaret told congressional investigators years ago that the dangers of non-ionizing radiation cannot be overstated because " most non-ionizing radiational injuries occur covertly , usually do not become manifest until after latent periods of years , and when they do become manifest , the effects are seldom recognized . " ( 25 )
Generation X - ray will ultimately be the most cancer - ridden generation in modern history .
The hundreds of types of human cancers have one thing in common they all begin at the cellular level when genetic material in one or more cells becomes damaged .
This damage can be passed from parents , or caused by the effects of an environmental carcinogen .
" Genetic mutations in one single cell are sufficient to lead to cancer , " says Dr. Henry Lai .
Dr. Lai is a celebrated scientist at the University of Washington who has years of genetic and bioenergetics research to his credit .
( 26 )
The cancer victims of Gen X - ray will likely die more quickly than those of previous generations because wireless microwaves not only initiate the seeds of cancer , but also stimulate abnormal nodes to become more energetically cancerous .
( 27 ) An impressive body of work demonstrates that both extremely low frequency ( ELF ) and microwaves cause human cells to produce stress proteins , a further indication that the body recognizes wireless radiation as harmful .
( 28 ) Stress proteins can ultimately protect cancer cells and make them resistant to medical treatment .
( 29 )
Long before their epidemic cancers sprout , young X - rayers are destined to suffer the symptoms of neurasthenia , or what the Soviets used to call " radiowave sickness . "
The symptoms include headache , fatigue , skin rashes , weakness , tinnitus , dizziness , moodiness and sleeplessness .
These warning signs are just the beginning of a long , downward spiral of general deterioration , including circulatory ailments , immune dysfunction , allergies and premature aging .
How physically sick are American kids ?
A 2007 report from Harvard researchers warned about the poor health of American kids , confirming that the incidence of chronic , life - altering illness is increasing exponentially .
( 30 ) Obesity , diabetes and severe allergies now plague millions of our young .
Childhood Obesity .
Thyroid hormones are critical to a childs proper brain development and metabolic function .
The human thyroid gland does not prosper in a high radiation field .
A leading cause of thyroid cancer is excessive ionizing radiation .
The thyroid in the neck area is heavily zapped by cell and cordless phone emissions during wireless conversation and it readily absorbs microwave radiation .
Cell phone radiation also depresses the brains pituitary production of critical thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) .
( 31 ) Insufficient TSH leaves a child deficient in thyroid metabolic hormones T3 and T4 , hence obesity .
Childhood diabetes .
Recent studies by Canadian environmental toxicologist Magda Havas indicate that ELF and kilohertz electromagnetic frequencies may have a deleterious effect on some diabetics .
( 32 ) Dr. Havas work reveals that electromagnetic pollution , such as that from dirty electricity ( The IO , June , 2007 ) can cause rapid changes in blood sugar levels and may be a potent factor in blood sugar control .
Dr. Havas calls for urgent studies to determine if Type 3 Diabetes , an abnormal endocrine / blood condition , is instigated or exacerbated by non-ionizing radiation , similar to the pulsing ELF and kilohertz frequencies inherent in wireless communications .
Childhood Allergies .
Swedish scientists confirm that wireless phone radiation can cause drastic inflammatory and allergic reactions by activating mast cells , which underlie many tissues of the body .
The inflammatory response of mast cell activation in the skin includes rashes , swellings and itches , so common in both microwave poisoning and asthma .
Nearly one in 10 American kids now have asthma , a soaring epidemic that has medical science stumped .
Asthma is a severe allergy reaction , usually to something environmental .
So it is of grave concern that both ELF and radio frequency ( RF ) associated with wireless technologies have been shown in animal and human studies to incite a broad range of allergy - related immune responses . ( 33 )
Immune System Dysfunction .
A childs body , kept in chronic allergic stress by wireless phone radiation , may end up with an exhausted immune system which no longer responds effectively .
European experts prognosticate that many people heavily exposed to wireless radiation may eventually suffer the manifestations of electro - hypersensitivity ( EHS ) .
( 34 ) EHS is a devastating allergic , auto - immune - like condition in which over - irradiated persons become severely sensitive to both chemical and electromagnetic pollution .
Similar to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue , EHS symptoms can be so disabling that victims are often forced to isolate themselves from even the smallest electromagnetic fields .
How mentally sick are American kids ?
By 2005 experts declared that 1 in 5 American kids has a mental health disorder .
( 35 ) Millions of school kids , diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) are on brain - altering Ritalin , a stimulant reportedly more potent than cocaine , and among the most addictive prescription drugs in use .
Millions of other kids are medicated with one of the anti-depressants Paxil , Zoloft , Effexor or Celexa , even though , in 2004 , British researchers reported these drugs are unsafe and often ineffective .
( 36 ) In 2003 , a U.S. medical journal reported that 74 percent of children and adolescents have experienced an adverse event to these drugs over the course of their treatment .
( 37 )
Bipolar disorderonce called manic depression is also epidemic among American children .
In January , a Frontline documentary revealed that over 6 million American kids , many with a bipolar diagnosis , are prescribed drastic combinations of new psychiatric drugs .
In discussing the frightening side - effects of these experimental therapies , several experts admitted to Frontline that adequate studies on the safety and efficacy of psychiatric drugs for kids have never been completed .
( 38 )
Proper studies have never been done to ascertain the COMBINED EFFECTS to the brain of both psychiatric drugs plus near - field wireless radiation .
So now we nuke them ?
Surely what millions of mentally unstable and highly drugged kids need LEAST is the additional burden of brain - altering radiation .
Within two minutes of microwave phone exposure , the electrical activity of a childs brain is abnormally altered for up to one hour .
( 39 ) British radiation expert Dr. Gerald Hyland reported that cell phones which use repetitive , pulsing 2 Hz and 8.34
Hz frequencies can badly disrupt the delta and alpha stabilization process in a childs developing brain .
( 40 )
Dr. Hyland confirmed that cell phone energy can cause radical changes in human mood and behavior .
( 41 ) This is the case because microwaves at cell phone levels can unleash a cornucopia of radical damage to all parts of the brain , including the cortex , the hippocampus ( memory center ) and the basal ganglia .
To wit :
 Scientists have demonstrated that cell phone radiation causes immediate blood flow changes in the brain , and also deregulates calcium efflux from brain cells , causing cell membranes to weaken and leak . ( 42 )
 Researchers in Finland have shown that one hour of cell phone radiation causes brain cells to shrink , indicating permanent damage to cell structure as confirmed by REFLEX studies .
( 43 )
 The Max Planck Institute in Germany reported that cell phones can blast heat spikes into the brain which may flash burn cell membranes to the boiling point of water . ( 44 )
 British researchers have shown that weak microwave radiation can change the shape of brain proteins into formations resembling pathological fibrils associated with Parkinsons and Alzheimers Disease . ( 45 )
 Swedish scientists demonstrated that cell phone radiation makes holes ( lesions ) in rat brains and they predict a wave of early - onset Alzheimers in young cell phone users . ( 46 )
Could the past two decades of mass brain damage from wireless radiation be among the roots of our nations mental health crisis ?
Unlimited microwave exposure is bound to increase the numbers of our haywire young .
The Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection says that we may expect kids who use cell phones to suffer not only brain tumors and dementia , but also increased epileptic readiness and depressive mental illness . ( 47 )
And what about environmental transmitters ?
Millions of American kids , struggling with physical disabilities and mental manias , are heavily irradiated not only with Wi-toys , but also by ubiquitous environmental transmitters needed to feed those toys .
Nearly 200,000 cell tower and roof top transmitters continuously saturate American cities , playgrounds and passing vehicles with DNA - damaging waves equivalent to ionizing radiation .
Living in transmitter - zapped neighborhoods where microwaves pass easily into homes , millions of infants and small kids have no respite from daily , deadly radiation assault .
Unregulated Wi-Fi systems , wireless local area network routers , security monitors , cordless phone systems and other types of wireless transmitters X - ray the interiors of malls , airports , offices , schools , hospitals and millions of homes 24/ 7 .
Many commercial and retail enterprises are switching to wireless inventory systems .
These and retail inter-personnel push - to - talk radio systems literally " cook " stores and malls where kids congregate .
Many public transport systems are being wired for Wi-Fi .
Soon , commercial aircraft will offer Wi-Fi computer services , compelling all passengers to absorb the toxic rays of mid-flight entertainment .
Many vehicles are wired with GPS navigation and / or tracking systems .
These rolling hotspots zap not only passengers , but people passing by .
The federal government has never developed adequate safety standards for long - term environmental exposure to this barrage of wireless radiation .
U.S. standards are antiquated and calculated for short term exposure only .
In 2002 , the EPAs Radiation Protection Division confirmed that the FCCs current exposure guidelines are thermally ( burn ) based and do not apply to chronic exposure of non-thermal wireless pollution which now enshrouds the nation .
( 48 )
In 2007 , 14 world - class public health experts and radiation researchers announced in their BioInitiative Report on Electromagnetic Radiation that current public microwave exposure standards are thousands of times TOO LENIENT .
Having compiled the weight of evidence from thousands of studies , these experts conclude that current exposure standards must be drastically revised because they are absolutely NOT protective of the public health . ( 49 )
Criminal complicity of the schools
Given the latest science on the radical bio-effects of wireless radiation , the shocking rate of childhood illness plus expert testimony that current RF exposure standards are dangerous , surely the least appropriate location for microwave transmitters is near schools and daycares .
Yet , wireless phone providers are in a frenetic campaign to place microwave transmitters either directly on or near schools and play fields across the nation .
Because the radiation industry offers thousands of dollars annually to school districts that provide siting for transmitters , education facilities have become " hot zones " where torrents of pulsing radiation blast infants , children and young adults .
Kids are blasted with radiation while playing at many of the nations parks and playgrounds .
That parents and educators are going along with this travesty is a grotesque example of circular thinking : Sicken and prematurely kill kids in order to give them exercise and a " good " education .
Many
Utah schools are cases in point .
An ABC news affiliate in Salt Lake City reported last October that the Jordan School District south of Salt Lake had 41 wireless antennas , either on or adjacent to its school buildings .
Jordan School District transmitters have been " cooking " kids in their classrooms for about 10 years .
( 50 ) Parents , civic leaders and school officials cannot be THAT UNINFORMED !
The latest radiation science is available to anyone who chooses to research it .
 At least seven recent high quality epidemiological studies show that people living close to wireless transmitters consistently develop a long list of neurological problems , including depression , sleep and memory disturbances , with pronounced loss of ability to learn and concentrate .
( 51 )
 As chief of the British Health Protection Agency , Sir William Stewart warned that the main beam from mobile phone masts should never be allowed to hit school grounds .
( 52 )
 In 2004 the International Association of Fire Fighters ( IAFF ) passed a resolution opposing cell phone transmitters on fire stations after a California study showed that a group of exposed personnel developed serious neurological problems , including brain damage ( encephalopathy ) .
The IAFF position paper documents a large body of scientific evidence indicating that siting transmitters on or near schools is pure insanity .
( 53 )
Seduced by oodles of corporate money , many school officials , with an obligation to protect the health and safety of the children in their charge , have simply chosen to disregard the science while exposing their facilities and staffs to harmful and potentially lethal radiation .
Kids forced to sit directly under roof top antenna farms , generating hundreds of watts of invisible carcinogen , are a new generation of downwinders .
The carnage of this atrocity will one day be judged as abhorrent as open air nuclear tests that sent previous generations to the grave with leukemia , thyroid cancer and a myriad of other terminal illnesses .
Compulsory school irradiation is a violation of the basic human right to a safe environment .
It is also the most disgusting example of greed - driven child abuse we can think of .
Meantime , Gen - X -ray dives to stupid
Microwave radiation from any source can drastically impair the ability of kids to concentrate , learn and retain information according to Russian experts .
( 54 ) Studies show that wireless radiation can cause nerve conduction in the human brain to slow down , diminishing every category of mental skill including memory , reading , computation , reasoning and reaction time . ( 55 )
The dangerous consequences of radiation - reduced motor response time was reported in 2005 by researchers at the University of Utah .
Their study found that young adults using cell phones while driving had the delayed reaction time of elderly drivers .
These cell - phone drivers were actually more mentally impaired than drunk drivers with blood alcohol levels exceeding the legal limit .
The study found that cell phone users in traffic are over five times more likely to be in a car accident .
( 56 ) Could this explain the shocking 2006 report that 40 percent of U.S. teens get into a car accident within the first year of earning their drivers license ?
( 57 )
The cognitive consequences for millions of kids on the rays are seen in numerous education reports .
High dropout rates and poor test scores are being reported across the nation .
Last year , Washington state legislators had to " push back " math and science graduation requirements , allowing high school kids to focus their laborious efforts on bringing their reading and writing skills up to par .
( 58 ) Generations ago , most American students found reading and writing easy to master in early grade school .
The San Francisco Gate recently featured Mark Morfords column , " American Kids : Dumber than Dirt . "
Morford discussed the " absolutely horrifying " decline in the intellectual ability of high school kids , declaring that junk food and cell phones are " melting their brains . " ( 59 )
In 2006 , the Associated Press reported that a national literacy study revealed that at least half of Americas youngsters in high school and college are incapable of acquiring and processing new information .
The study confirmed that over half of college students nearing a college diploma are close to illiterate and cannot handle complex but common intellectual tasks , such as understanding the content of a newspaper editorial .
( 60 )
These , the highly impaired of the wireless age , are probably unable to read and understand the potentially life - saving information in this article .
However , much to the profit of the radiation industry , dialing a seven digit number or deciphering a three - word text message will always be manageable for Americas ever - growing army of functional illiterates .
The biggest lie youll ever hear
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the two agencies which " regulate " cell phones and other wireless devices have two basic things to say about wireless radiation hazards :
The big lie .
" There are no known risks from exposure to RF emissions from wireless phones . "
The disclaimer .
" There is no proof , however , that wireless phones are absolutely safe . " ( 61 )
This disingenuous and contradictive mantra has been adopted by both the FCC and the FDA even though the telecom industrys own Wireless Technology Research ( WTR ) program of the 90s showed that cell phone radiation at levels well below " safety " guidelines causes blood - brain barrier damage , animal tumors and a 300 percent increase in DNA damage to human blood . ( 62 )
Dr. George Carlo , the epidemiologist who coordinated the WTR studies would later write , " Surely , you must be thinking , this was the time that the FDA would perform its obligation to warn the public of the new findings and the increase need to act with caution and protect ourselves as we communicate in the wireless age The FDA chose instead to strike a public posture that was virtually indistinguishable from the industry it was supposed to be watching and regulating . " ( 63 )
Nothing has changed a decade later .
The lucrative " no evidence " lie is still the party line for both regulatory agencies at a time when thousands of published studies clearly show that ELF / microwave radiation has massive and far - reaching ramifications for every facet of a childs physical and mental health .
Comatose U.S. health experts barely stirring
To their credit , in 1986 , as the wireless revolution was just being unleashed , the EPA recommended that pulsed , non-thermal RF / microwave radiation be designated as a Class C ( probable ) carcinogen .
For obvious economic and political reasons , the EPA was slapped down on this proposal . ( 64 )
Again in 1990 , citing decades of animal cancer studies , the EPA produced an internal report discussing the probable carcinogenicity of electromagnetic fields generated by both extremely low ( ELF ) and ultra high radio frequencies within the microwave spectrum . ( 65 )
In 2000 , EPA scientist Norbert Hankin warned about the growing use of wireless technology by children and their schools : " Some research regarding rodents has shown adverse effects on short - term and long - term memory .
The concern is that if such effects may occur in young children , then even slight impairment of learning ability over years of education may negatively affect the quality of life that could be achieved by these individuals , when adults .
The potential effect on learning of exposure from telecommunications devices used by children should be considered for study by the Radiation Protection Project . " ( 66 ) Hankins important recommendation has never been implemented .
Now that the wireless horses are loose and on the run with our hapless kids in tow , the U.S. National Research Council ( NRC ) says that perhaps the barn should have had a door .
The NRC recommends that future studies of children and pregnant women be designed to determine whether there are wireless health risks to the very young .
Ignoring the mountain of radiation research already peer reviewed and published , the NRC admits that , " although it is unknown whether children are more susceptible to RF exposure , they may be at increased risk because of their developing organ and tissue systems . " ( 67 )
While U.S. regulators drag their feet in order to protect their corporate cronies and while U.S. health experts shuffle their musty papers and sort their foggy thoughts as to how they might one day duplicate science already long completed , total wireless minutes of use in the U.S. are increasing by 30 percent each year .
How this story will end
The sad reality , according to decades of science and supporting evidence in the field , is that legions of those hooked on wireless technology have already begun a painful march to their graves .
Like smokers who light up during the final gasping stages of emphysema , its a fair guess that a person who becomes a " chain dialer " in his youth , wont lay down his cell phone until the undertaker pries it from his cold , dead fingers , long deformed by the clutching reflex .
It took decades of study and years of consumer use to gather enough data to force the U.S. Surgeon Generals warning label on cigarette packs .
The day will come when someone elses second - hand radiation will be even more unwelcome than second hand tobacco smoke .
There are a number of radiation damage lawsuits against cell phone makers pending in many countries .
It may require only one major court victory to unleash an avalanche of lawsuits . ( 68 ) Given the sheer volume of data demonstrating the lethality of microwave radiation , the radiation industry will inevitably meet the same fate as the tobacco and asbestos industries .
There always comes a time when the horrific casualties of predation and prevarication can no longer be concealed .
Leading phone manufacturers , including Nokia , Ericsson and Motorola , publicly deny cell phone health hazards .
But behind the scenes , these companies have filed patents for devices claimed to help shield phone users from antenna radiation .
( 69 ) Unfortunately , such devices are not presently available for consumer phones because they provide inconvenient evidence that non-shielded phones are as dangerous as cancer - ridden plaintiffs testify they are .
Help save a kid from radiation abuse
We are on our own .
We have lots of work to do in raising public consciousness on wireless health issues .
The wireless industry and its legislative pawnsled by Senator and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain ( R - AZ ) -- have written current telecommunications laws to exclude consideration of human health in antenna siting .
Government regulatory agencies commissioned to protect public health and safety are allowing an entire industry to profitably peddle an array of wireless devices that are slowly killing us .
The best way to stop wireless genocide is for conscientious consumers to SIMPLY STOP BUYING RADIATION as a matter of principle .
Until future enlightenment delivers our society from the unconscionable barbarisms of the wireless revolution , let us resolve to spare as many kids as possible from the suffering of an over - irradiated childhood .
Through education and example , lets prepare our young to withstand the relentless commercial dunning and peer pressure of the wireless age .
We must model a different set of priorities to our kids .
Lets ask our kids if the instant gratification of wireless talking , messaging and gaming today is worth a decimated body tomorrow .
Should we not practice self restraint by eliminating frivolous wireless communication , stop playing wireless games and use wired phones instead to safeguard a healthy future ?
We must remove dangerous wireless devices from our homes .
Above all , lets get the cordless microwave phones and wireless routers out of our homes .
Any household phone which emits megahertz or gigahertz radiation should be replaced with the older style corded landline phones .
Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone ( DECT ) chargers are so powerful they can pass pulsing microwaves through walls and even irradiate the neighbors .
DECT bases continuously irradiate children at home .
A DECT house is child - abusive .
We must educate our officials .
Let s pressure schools and other public institutions plus commercial outlets to TURN OFF the WiFi and other microwave - intensive systems until it is proven that this radiation is completely safe for our kids ( That way , the X - rays will be off for a very long time ) .
Let public outcry forbid the leasing of school property for wireless transmitter sites .
If radiation from mobile phones immediately affects a childs cognitive processing , as Finnish researchers have demonstrated , ( 70 ) so does the same omni-directional radiation blasting from school transmitters .
We must demand accountability and mitigate the damage
The 2007 BioInitiative Report recommends that cell phones be reconfigured to work only with wired headsets or on speaker mode , so that eye and brain irradiation can be prevented .
( 71 ) At the very least , consumers should demand that these safety features be incorporated into their wireless devices .
For the protection of our kids , lets avail ourselves of technology , such as audio and digital radiation meters , which empower us to quickly identify microwave - intensive environments .
Let s educate legislators and demand that unbiased radiation research by impartial researchers be funded with a gains tax on telecom industry profits .
Let s demand that the industry be forced to properly label its carcinogenic devices with adequate health warnings .
The industry must be made liable for wireless health damage .
The state of Washington just passed the strictest safe toy law in the nation .
But this law does not address the wireless handsets kids are using for wireless entertainment services available through the Advanced Wireless Services ( AWS ) spectrum .
The FDA recently announced that popular impotence drugs must now be labeled with a warning that they may lead to sudden , severe and potentially permanent hearing loss .
Why has FDA not demanded a hearing loss warning for cell and cordless phones ?
Dr. Vini Khurana , an award - winning Australian neurosurgeon and brain cancer specialist , believes that the link between mobile phones and brain cancer will definitely be proven within the coming decade . ( 72 ) A child protected today from wireless abuse will thank an astute parent tomorrow when that terrible , unassailable " proof " becomes obvious to even the most fanatical of wireless advocates .
Generation Xd Out
Wireless radiation is not only neurotoxic and carcinogenic , but also grossly teratogenic ( causes the abnormal development of the embryo ) .
Scientists across the globe are warning about the potential of wireless microwaves to cause horrific damage to sperm , ova and fetuses .
As the clueless , trusting kids of Generation X - ray are encouraged by corporations to violate the basic laws of nature with wireless toys , they systematically damage the genes they will pass to their offspring .
Their genetically damaged children and grandchildren will be even more radiation - impaired than themselves .
This generally suppressed information will be the subject of part two of this series .
Amy Worthington has received international acclaim for her articles on vaccines , chemtrails , depleted uranium and the hazards of the wireless age .

The American gas giant Air Products & Chemicals announced this week that it will build the world ’s largest green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia .
It will be powered by 4 gigawatts of wind and solar power and the $ 5 billion USD project will be jointly owned by Air Products , Saudi Arabia ’s ACWA Power and Neom , a new mega-city planned near Saudi Arabia ’s borders with Egypt and Jordan .
You can see the vision in the image above , and the actual site in an image below .
The green ammonia made at the megaplant will made for export to global markets .
And the technology used in the project will include the innovative integration of over four gigawatts of renewable power from solar , wind and storage ; production of 650 tons per day of hydrogen by electrolysis using thyssenkrupp technology ; production of nitrogen by air separation using Air Products technology ; and production of 1.2 million tons per year of green ammonia using Haldor Topsoe technology .
The project is scheduled to be onstream , or online and working , by 2025 .
[ Translations : Italian ]
Scenius is like genius , only embedded in a scene rather than in genes .
Brian
Eno suggested the word to convey the extreme creativity that groups , places or “ scenes ” can occasionally generate .
His actual definition is : “ Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene .
It is the communal form of the concept of the genius . ”
Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their best work .
When buoyed by scenius , you act like genius .
Your like - minded peers , and the entire environment inspire you .
The geography of scenius is nurtured by several factors :
• Mutual appreciation —
Risky moves are applauded by the group , subtlety is appreciated , and friendly competition goads the shy .
Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure .
• Rapid exchange of tools and techniques —
As soon as something is invented , it is flaunted and then shared .
Ideas flow quickly because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility .
• Network effects of success —
When a record is broken , a hit happens , or breakthrough erupts , the success is claimed by the entire scene .
This empowers the scene to further success .
• Local tolerance for the novelties —
The local “ outside ” does not push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene .
The renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone .
Scenius can erupt almost anywhere , and at different scales : in a corner of a company , in a neighborhood , or in an entire region .
The history of art and science is crammed with episodes of scenius .
In modern literature there was the Algonquin Round Table , the Bloomsbury Group , the Inklings in Oxford , UK .
In art there was Paris in the 20s , the lofts in Soho , NYC , and Burning Man recently .
In science there was the Lunar Society in England , Building 20 at MIT , or the ever - spreading Silicon Valley .
The Oxford pub where the Inklings met .
I was reminded of scenius while watching a documentary about rock climbers in Yosemite .
The documentary Vertical Frontiers did not make my True Films list of best - ever docs , but it did reveal a new flavor of scenius I had not known before .
The particulars of this scene are a fine example of what makes scenius work .
Mountain climbers educated in the Alps discovered the vertical walls of granite in Yosemite in the 1930s and began to scale these monoliths .
By 1941 climbers occupied a new permanent camp set up in the north side of Yosemite Valley , Camp 4 .
They would often camp there illegally for the entire summer .
Most were climbing bums — young men with little money , lots of time , heedless of laws , and an overwhelming urge to climb in new ways .
They hacked together amazingly innovative equipment , techniques , and ethics .
Camp 4 became school , club , and summer home for many climbers , not a few who became well - known .
Camp 4 in Yosemite
Over the next 60 years this scenius would invent most of the modern techniques of rock climbing , and many innovations that would later spill into outdoor skills and gear in general .
But the geography of this scenius is unremarkable .
Camp 4 is a nondescript , bland , dusty campground .
Building 20 at MIT , the home of fantastic engineering exploits like the improvement of radar , was likewise architecturally boring , almost dilapidated .
Soho was blocks of unwanted industrial space .
Like these other places , Camp 4 was a generic space with flexibility .
However Camp 4 is also a walk - in camp .
You need to haul everything on your back .
That immediately filters out a lot of wannabes .
The absence of cars also keeps everyone around .
From the outside you would never guess there was anything special about the place .
I think that is true of most scenius .
The scenius of Camp 4 was threatened after century level floods in 1997 wiped out other camp sites in Yosemite and the Curry Company wanted to build lodges on the higher ground at Camp 4 .
Climbers around the world campaigned to have Camp 4 designated on the Register of Historic Places in order to keep it .
Ultimately they prevailed , and Camp 4 has remained a haven and incubator for climbing enthusiasts .
( There ’s a book about Camp 4 , which I have not read .
The film is available here from Netflix and Amazon . )
Although many have tried many times , it is not really possible to command scenius into being .
Every start up company , or university would like their offices to be an example of scenius .
The number of cities in the world hoping to recreate the scenius of Silicon Valley is endless , but very few have achieved anything close .
Innumerable art scenes begin and vanish quickly .
The serendipitous ingredients for scenius are hard to control .
They depend on the presence of the right early pioneers .
A place that is open , but not too open .
A buffer that is tolerant of outlaws .
And some flash of excitement to kick off the virtuous circle .
You just ca n’t order this .
What Camp 4 illustrated is that the best you can do is NOT KILL IT .
When it pops up , do n’t crush it .
When it starts rolling , do n’t formalize it .
When it sparks , fan it .
But do n’t move the scenius to better quarters .
Try to keep accountants and architects and police and do - gooders away from it .
Let it remain inefficient , wasteful , edgy , marginal , in the basement , downtown , in the ‘ burbs , in the hotel ballroom , on the fringes , out back , in Camp 4 .
When it happens , honor and protect it .
Maybe it 's because spring is on the way in the Northern Hemisphere .
Everyone seems to have acquisition love on their minds as of late .
We 've seen Microsoft - Yahoo ! , rumors of Google stepping in to look at Yahoo ! , and now , according to Brian Heater of AppScout , Google is now looking at buying CNET .
Though it is only a rumor at this point , it was enough to drive the stock of CNET up 7 percent in trading on Friday .
An Interactive Brokers Group equity options analyst , Rebecca Engmann Darst , told Reuters of another theory that is currently floating around .
" Another scenario , " she said , " is that these rumors have originated with call buyers who took a hit after CNET issued lackluster guidance this week and were left holding the bag . "
Could this be a new use for Google ?
The stock of a company you own is sagging , so it 's time to start a rumor that Google is looking to purchase said company ?
It 's a little difficult to think of a reason Google would want the tech news company , as Google does n't have a history of producing fresh content ; their news has always been served up in the form of aggregating from other news sites , not creating their own .
Google is currently not commenting on the rumor , and CNET is fighting off advances from a group of investors , led by the JANA Partners hedge fund , who want to expand the board and put their own people on it .
With everything else going on , and both companies preoccupied with so many other things , this one looks to remain pretty firm in the rumor zone .
Only 9,000 troops of a planned 26,000 - strong force have been deployed
Seven members of the joint UN - African Union peace mission in Sudan 's Darfur region have been killed and 22 hurt in an attack , the UN says .
UN officials said it was one of the deadliest attacks on its forces in recent years .
Sudanese state media reports that 40 armoured vehicles ambushed the peace force while on patrol in North Darfur .
The UN - AU mission has been struggling to contain the violence in the region , with just 9,000 troops .
Heavy weapons , including mortars and rocket - propelled grenades , were used in this attack , UN officials said .
It is not known who carried out the attack .
Those who died included four Rwandan peacekeepers , one policeman from Ghana and another from Uganda .
' Outraged '
Ten vehicles from the UN - AU Mission in Darfur ( Unamid ) were destroyed , Sudan 's state media reports .
" The mission is obviously outraged by the attack , " Unamid spokeswoman Shereen Zorba told Reuters news agency .
It is unclear who was responsible .
Numerous armed groups operate in Darfur - rebel factions , pro-government militias and criminals .
Last week , Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Djibril Bassole was appointed as the new UN and AU Darfur peace envoy .
Two outgoing peace envoys have questioned whether armed groups in the region are committed to ending the conflict .
Talks have been complicated recently because the rebels have split into more than a dozen factions .
Since the conflict began in Darfur five years ago , the UN estimates that some 300,000 people have died and two million have fled their homes .
The conflict began when rebels took up arms in protest at alleged government discrimination against the region .
Pro-government Arab militias have been accused of widespread atrocities against the black African population .
WHILE we all worry about where we ’re going to get more energy in an increasingly energy - obsessed world , there ’s also another alternative :
Use less power .
That may soon be simpler , thanks to the introduction of a bevy of inexpensive devices that let homeowners monitor how much energy appliances , TVs , PCs , and heating and cooling systems actually use .
Even energy - conscious people can go only so far in managing their home energy use .
Sure , we can fiddle with our thermostats , shun incandescent light bulbs and bring in Energy Star appliances .
Watching that new L.C.D. TV , however , might wipe out all those gains .
But we just do n’t know .
“ We have all the technology we want in our cellphones and plasma TVs and cars , but in electricity we ’re still like our grandparents were , ” says Ahmad Faruqui , an economist at the Brattle Group , a consultancy based in Cambridge , Mass .
Possibly coming to the rescue are home automation networks , which can help monitor all of our power - sucking devices ( the typical American household has 27 that are always on , according to the Electric Power Research Institute , an energy research and consulting firm ) .
She added : “ Our Oriental society is not like your Western society .
It seems in many of these cases the women have had their husband killed or sent to prison and she feels she has no choice , she is very depressed . ”
Female suicide bombers are not a new phenomenon in Iraq or elsewhere , but they have been relatively rare .
Since 2003 , 43 women have carried out suicide bombings in Iraq , a tiny percentage of the total , according to the United States military .
Though the first two cases came in the first year of the war , suicide attacks by women did not really become a trend until 2007 , when there were eight such bombings in Iraq .
All but one of the female bombers have been Iraqis and most are young , between the ages of 15 and 35 , according to the police and American military analysts .
Almost all the attacks have been attributed to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , which is also known as Al Qaeda in Iraq .
Diyala has been a stronghold for the group since it was chased from Anbar Province in the west in 2004 .
The province ’s attraction was clear : it offers easy hiding places in its palm groves and orchards , and a Sunni- majority population that includes many people who supported Saddam Hussein and are sympathetic to the insurgency .
But in the past year , American and Iraqi forces have had much greater success in killing and detaining the group ’s members in the province , as well as thwarting many of its bigger attack plots .
The rise in female suicide bombings has directly coincided with the timing , and the locations , of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia ’s biggest loss of manpower in Diyala , Baghdad and Anbar .
“ Al Qaeda is always innovating : finding new ways to work , ” said Ghanem al - Khoreishi , the police chief of Diyala .
“ When we destroyed them in fighting , they started to use new methods .
And because they knew that women are treated more gently than men , they began to use them .
“ The people do n’t search them so well even at checkpoints . ”
Interviews with police officers and politicians , American military analysts and Iraqi women yield different views of the phenomenon .
But many agree that the province ’s traditional , conservative and still largely rural society is a factor .

The magnets are linked up in a chain for 27 km A vast physics experiment - the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) - reaches a key milestone this weekend ahead of an official start - up on 10 September .
On 9 August , protons will be piped through LHC magnets for the first time .
Engineers had previously brought a beam of protons - tiny , sub-atomic particles - to the " doorstep " of the LHC .
The most powerful physics experiment ever built , the LHC will re-create the conditions present in the Universe just after the Big Bang .
It 's been a long - haul , and we 're all eager to get the LHC research programme underway
Lyn Evans , LHC project leader
There are over 5,000 magnets arranged end - to - end in a ring that runs for 27 km through a giant tunnel under the French Swiss border .
Once the LHC is fully operational , two proton beams will be fired down pipes running through these magnets .
These beams will then be steered in opposite directions around the main ring at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points along the tunnel , the beams will cross paths , smashing into one another with cataclysmic force .
Scientists hope to see new particles in the debris of these collisions , revealing fundamental new insights into the nature of the cosmos and how it came into being .
Precision timing
For the two - day " synchronisation test " , engineers will thread a low intensity beam through the injection system and one of the LHC 's eight sectors .
These two sectors have now reached a sufficient level of readiness to handle the energetic stream of particles , and this opened up the opportunity to run the test .
The purpose of the test is to help ensure that the LHC is working in step with its " injector " , known as the Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) accelerator .
Each detector is the sum of many complicated elements
Before a beam can be fired into the main ring , the proton beams have to be boosted to high energies in a chain of particle accelerators , or injectors .
The SPS is the last link in this chain ; it is from here that protons are fed directly into the LHC ring via two " injection lines " - one for each beam .
" The aim is to get the timings right between the two machines and in order to do that we will take some beam into sector 2 - 3 , " said Roberto Saban , the LHC 's head of hardware commissioning .
Cern , the organisation that operates the collider , said it will attempt to circulate two proton beams all the way around the ring on 10 September .
This is considered the giant lab 's official " switch -on " .
Beam collision " It 's been a long haul , and we 're all eager to get the LHC research programme underway , " said Lyn Evans , the project leader .
This full beam injection will take place at an energy of about 450 gigaelectronvolts ( GeV ) .
Over subsequent weeks , engineers will gradually boost the energy and fine tune the machine .
Roberto Saban said that in order to obtain high magnetic fields with a modest power consumption , the LHC 's magnets are required to be " superconducting " .
This is the property , exhibited by some materials at very low temperatures , to channel electrical current with zero resistance and very little power loss .
This requires cooling the magnets to a temperature of 1.9 Kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) .
Six out of eight sectors are currently at their operating temperatures ; cooling of the remaining two should be completed in the next few weeks .
Over August , scientists will continue electrical testing of the LHC hardware prior to circulating beams in early September .
This phase will continue through the month to ensure that the entire machine is capable of accelerating and colliding beams at an energy of five teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) .
Once stable , circulating beams have been established , they will be smashed together - in preparation for the LHC 's science phase .
BBC Radio 4 will broadcast live from Cern on 10 September .
The Big Bang Day starts in the LHC control room at 0830 BST for the official start - up , and then continues through the day with related programmes , from indepth discussions about particle physics to a special one - off radio version of the popular TV drama Torchwood .

What are these ?
The August issue of Ven­ture Cap­i­tal Jour­nal brings a very good piece on the emerg­ing brain fit­ness soft­ware ( also called “ neu­rosoft­ware ” ) cat­e­go­ry :
– Mind Games ( sub­scrip­tion required )
– Dakim , Lumos Labs , Posit Sci­ence and oth­er brain fit­ness star­tups are start­ing to gain mind share and cap­i­tal from ven­ture firms .
The reporter and I spoke as Lumos Labs received its $ 3 m round , and we dis­cussed oth­er fund­able start - ups , fea­tur­ing Cog­niFit .
Which , as men­tioned over the week­end , just raised $ 5 m .
If case you are a new Sharp­Brains read­er , per­haps vis­it­ing us after read­ing this VCJ arti­cle , let me pro­vide a quick overview of the cat­e­go­ry and our Mar­ket Report ( which is annu­al , not quar­ter­ly as the arti­cle states ) :
A ) Report High­lights
We esti­mate the size of the US brain fit­ness soft­ware mar­ket at $ 225 M in 2007 , up from $ 100 m in 2005 ( 50 % CAGR ) , ana­lyz­ing the size and trends of four cus­tomer seg­ments : con­sumers , health­care & insur­ance providers , K12 school sys­tems , and for­tune 1000 com­pa­nies , mil­i­tary , and sports teams .
Two seg­ments fueled the mar­ket growth from 2005 to 2007 : con­sumers ( grew from $ 5 m to $ 80 m , 300 % CAGR ) and health­care & insur­ance providers ( grew from $ 36 m to $ 65 m , 35 % CAGR ) .
Ten Spe­cif­ic High­lights from The State of the Brain Fit­ness Soft­ware Mar­ket 2008 report include :
1 ) 2007 was a sem­i­nal year for the US Brain Fit­ness soft­ware mar­ket , which reached $ 225 mil­lion in rev­enues up from an esti­mat­ed $ 100 mil­lion in 2005 .
2 ) Over 20 com­pa­nies are offer­ing tools to assess and train cog­ni­tive skills to four cus­tomer seg­ments : con­sumers ; health­care and insur­ance providers ; K12 school sys­tems ; and For­tune 1000 com­pa­nies , the mil­i­tary , and sports teams .
3 ) The Nin­ten­do Brain Age phe­nom­e­non has dri­ven much of the growth .
The con­sumer seg­ment grew from a few mil­lion in 2005 to an esti­mat­ed $ 80 mil­lion in 2007 .
4 ) There is major con­fu­sion in the mar­ket , so edu­ca­tion will be key .
Users and buy­ers need help to nav­i­gate the maze of prod­ucts and claims .
5 ) Over 400 res­i­den­tial facil­i­ties for old­er adults have launched com­put­er­ized brain fit­ness cen­ters .
Sales to the health­care and insur­ance provider seg­ment grew from $ 35 mil­lion in 2005 to an esti­mat­ed $ 65 mil­lion in 2007 .
6 ) More than five pro­grams have shown results in ran­dom­ized con­trolled tri­als .
Cog­ni­tive func­tions that can be trained include : visu­al and audi­to­ry pro­cess­ing , work­ing mem­o­ry , atten­tion , and deci­sion - mak­ing .
7 ) A prod­uct has obtained 510( k ) FDA clear­ance for reha­bil­i­ta­tion of stroke and Trau­mat­ic Brain Injury patients .
Anoth­er prod­uct is being used by a grow­ing net­work of ADHD spe­cial­ists .
8 ) Large - scale , ful­ly - auto­mat­ed cog­ni­tive assess­ments are being used in a grow­ing num­ber of clin­i­cal tri­als .
This opens the way for the devel­op­ment of inex­pen­sive con­sumer - fac­ing , base­line cog­ni­tive assess­ments .
9 ) The poten­tial for K12 Edu­ca­tion remains large­ly untapped due to lim­it­ed research link­ing cog­ni­tive train­ing to aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance .
10 ) Com­pa­nies , sports teams and the mil­i­tary are find­ing oppor­tu­ni­ties to improve pro­duc­tiv­i­ty .
The aging work­force will make this a must .

Beyond the fact that baby is always around mom and dad , baby 's first words are linked to sound patterns .
A baby 's first words are often " mama " and " dada , " much to the delight of parents .
Now scientists think they know why .
Beyond the obvious — Mommy and Daddy are around a lot and babies are drawn to them — languages in many cultures have apparently made the task easy by creating words for mothers and fathers that feature patterns of repeating sounds , a new study suggests .
To arrive at this finding , brain scans were made of 22 newborns ( age 2 days to 3 days ) while they listened to recordings of made - up words .
They heard words that end in repeating syllables , such as " mubaba " and " penana , " as well as words without them , such as " mubage " and " penaku . "
Brain activity increased in the babies ' temporal and left frontal areas whenever the repetitious words were played .
Words with non-adjacent repetitions ( " bamuba " or " napena " ) elicited no distinctive responses from the brain .
This suggests " mama " and " dada " ( or " papa " ) are well - chosen words to teach a baby , and it also indicates that the ability to more easily recognize these sorts of repetitive sounds is hard - wired in the human brain .
The research , led by University of British Columbia post - doctoral fellow Judit Gervain , was published online this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" It 's probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their ' child words , ' " Gervain said , citing " papa " in Italian and " tata " ( grandpa ) in Hungarian as examples .
" The language center of most right - handed adults is located on the left side of the brain , " Gervain said .
" This is consistent with our finding with newborn babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently . "
" The brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not ' learn ' how to process language during development , but rather , they are specialized — at least in part — to process language from the start . "

Guys :
Have you ever wondered why girls have such big handbags that always appear to be packed with junk ?
Your gut reaction might be that she 's packed it with toiletries , a wide selection of makeup and a variety of other ' essential ' items - but have you ever actually checked ?
After reading these stories you might be convinced to never , ever , question what 's inside those pretty purses - you might not like what you find , unless of course your girlfriend is Japanese and is carrying a vibrator - then you might be intruiged .
But then again she might just be carrying metal pliers which will just leave you confused .
So here are the strange and intruiging finds from the insides of women 's purses ( and before you ask - no I did n't go rummaging and I definately did n't get arrested ) .
Cat Urine , Not Meth
Florida police did not believe a woman when she told them a vial in her purse contained dried cat urine , not methamphetamine .
It 's not surprising really , who carries dried cat urine in their handbag ?
But they should have trusted her .
She sat in jail for two months until tests proved she was telling the truth .
In any case , I think the lesson to learn here is not to carry cat urine around with you , no matter how much you think it might come in useful .

Dead Dog in Duffel Bag
The loss of a pet can be devastating , but most of us deal with it a little better than Wendy Louise Washum .
The employees of a Wendy 's restaurant in Colorado found the grieving woman carrying her decaying dead dog in a duffle bag .
But it gets weirder .
Wendy told police she thought the dog would come back to life after 13 days .
Right .
And if you are going to carry a dead dog around with you , then you should at least want to do it in style with a Louis Vuitton dog carrier , not in a duffle bag !
The Denver Channel
Grandma with Grenades
No one would suspect an elderly Russian woman of carrying dangerous weapons , so it 's good thing a senior citizen carrying two grenades turned herself in .
The graying grandma carried the bombs in her handbag , but decided she should probably hand them in to the police .
And it 's a good thing she did !
The firing pin mechanism was damaged on one grenade , meaning it could have gone off at any time !

Son's Ashes Stolen
American Donetta
Ernst had only one thought when she discovered her bag had been stolen from her car : her son 's ashes .
The grieving mother carried the ashes of her dead three - year - old son in a heart - shaped silver box in her purse .
I guess the thieves are glad she cremated her son , unlike the dog lady !
Seriously I can't imagine carrying anything so precious , or so morbid , in my handbag !

Japan 's Buzzing Bags
What ca n't Japanese women leave home without ?
Their wallet ?
Keys ?
A cell phone perhaps ?
No , it seems young Japanese girls wo n't step out without their vibrator !
Attitudes have changed and the once taboo toys now come in a range of bright colors and cute shapes .
Apparently the adult toys are all the rage amongst young single girls , who do n't seem to care if their handbag starts emitting a tell - tale hum .

Human Skull in a Handbag
An innocent Canadian woman saw more than she bargained for when she opened an unattended ladies handbag .
She was searching for some identification , but instead found a human skull !
The shaken lady took her find to the police , who assured her the skull was not a new specimen .
The police have encouraged the owner of the bag , and its bizarre contents , to come forward .

Comedian Carries Metal Pliers
Scottish comedian Janey Godley faced a real dilemma when she received her first leather handbag at 20 .
She did n't wear makeup , or carry a diary , and she had no need for keys or pens .
So what does a woman place inside her pretty new purse .
Looking for something to add some weight and bulk to her new gift , Janey settled on an old pair of metal pliers .
There the tools sat until Janey had enough real essentials to tote !

Teen Boy Carries Severed Head
But women are n't the only ones stashing strange stuff in their bags .
A 17 - year - old Japanese boy allegedly killed his mother , then stuffed her severed head in his duffel bag .
He took it with him for a little downtime at an internet café before he turned himself in to the police .
I can't imagine the cops ' faces when he pulled this grisly specimen out of his tote !

Thought those stories were strange ?
Read these tales of amazing airport encounters to see the bizarre stuff people stash in their suitcases !
Found anything weird in a handbag ( or wanted to ) ?
Leave a comment below .
Really ?
Apparently " Michael " does n't share those beliefs because he tried to have me censored .
" Michael , " meet Mr. Hypocrite .
Mr. Hypocrite , meet " Michael Scott . " eek , I really can't stand treasonists who undermine our national security .
And the patriots operating in the field who 's lives become endangered from these types of partisan witch hunts have an even greater disdain for them than I do .
I hate irresponsible behavior , but unfortunately it 's par for the course for an anonymous keyboard commando like " Michael .
" I 'm sure there are enough Ron Paul nuts on the net who would champion the Rosenbergs as ' heroes ' too -- ya know , back when our elected leaders prosecuted treason as TREASON .
Everything -- and I mean EVERYTHING -- in this thread is pure conjecture and slander .
I ask him for evidence , he goes crying to a mod like the whiny unpatriotic coward he is .
It 's amazing how many sheeple can be fooled by contrived perception .
A guy accumulates a mailing list of a few hundred people , starts a thread in the Rx and then sends out the " call . "
Wow !
300 + viewers in our little intimate forum , folks !
That 's a record .
What 's going on ?
Why , it must be just like " Michael " said -- " intelligent posting " going on .
And btw , for anyone who cares .
" Michael " is a ghost of a previous poster .
I know who you are " Michael " -- the question is , do have any guesses as to * I * am ?
Folks , I 'm going to post a PUBLIC poll and see how many REAL RX members participate AND how many actually believe you , " Michael .
" Your little disruptive stunt is almost over .
Does just what its name says : supports civil liberties and constitutional rights
In more words it Supports : - SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE - this stance tends to generate controversy b/c many people think they are trying to stop religious expression by the people when they are really trying to keep the government 's nose out of religion and actually defend religious freedom ( see below ) - * GASP * FREEDOM OF RELIGION -
Yes , the ACLU defends people ( including * GASP * Christians ) who have been denied their rights to religious expression ( two recent cases are an elementary school student who wanted to sing Awesome God at a school talent show , and a high school student whose senior quote was a verse from the Bible .
-FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS -
( They even support the free speech rights of NAMBLA and the KKK , which some people mistakenly think this means they support the message ; they do not , they just affirm that these groups have the right to speak out peacefully about their beliefs ) .
The ACLU has also criticized the government for censoring " obscene " materials - FREEDOM FROM CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT - they oppose police brutality , prison rape and other prison abuse , and ( controversially ) the death penalty - FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE AND RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS - Many people think this makes them favor terrorists ; however if there was enough evidence to charge the " terrorists " with crimes , why does n't the government do it ?
Also remember people said the same thing about Japanese Americans in WWII , and back then the ACLU was the ONLY major national organization to oppose the internment camps - EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW - gay rights ( including marriage ) , rights of the poor , racial and gender equality , transgender rights and youth rights - they oppose curfews and rules that require u to be an " adult " to buy porn / see R- rated movies ( see free speech too )
Ok , so Firefox 3 final is out .
You do n't really care that much about its compatibility with every standard under the sun ; you just want to know which new features are actually useful ?
Good , so do we .
Here 's our rundown of the stuff that makes the latest iteration of this cool Web browser worth your while .
By the way , if you 're curious about how we 're so fast on this one ( apart from the fact that the final build is nearly identical to Firefox 3 RC3 ) , it 's easy : the final release of Firefox 3 has been up a couple of hours ahead of schedule .
However , we chose not to report on it because it would spoil the world record breaking attempt , and because the folks at Mozilla kindly asked everyone not to do that back when Firefox 2 was released .
* Update :
The final version of Firefox 3 was supposed to be available for almost an hour now , but Mozilla 's servers are dying under the load of millions of eager users hammering their servers .
Hopefully the issues will be resolved soon .
1. The Awesome Location Bar
We 're not calling it awesome because it 's really that awesome ; it was actually called the Awesome Bar at some point during its development .
It 's important to understand how it works because it's one of the new Firefox 3 features you 'll be forced to use , and , while it has advantages , it can also be a source of frustration .
It 's not a new feature ; it 's just a change in how the autocomplete feature in the location bar ( where you type the Web address ) works .
When you start typing something , it does n't only give you the corresponding Web addresses which start with the same letters ; it actually searches through your bookmarks and history and tries to present the most relevant results based on both frequency and recency of your visits .
For example , when I start typing " mas " I 'll get Mashable as the first couple of results , but I 'll also get Mashable if I start " soc " because it matches the site title , " social networking news . "
The location bar learns and adapts from your usage , which should in theory make it better over time .
However , some users might get annoyed at this new feature ; if you 're accustomed to writing the first couple of characters of the domain name and want that exact domain name as the first result , you wo n't immediately ( and , perhaps , never ) like the location bar .
Luckily , there 's a Firefox add - on called Oldbar which tweaks the location bar to give you the functionality similar to the location bar in Firefox 2 .
Another tip which you may find useful will let you change the number of results for the autocomplete feature : type " about : config " and find the item named " browser.urlbar.maxRichResults . "
Doubleclick it and change the number of results to whatever number you like .
2. Quick & easy bookmarking
This is a cool one .
See the star on the right in the location bar ?
Click it and the page you 're currently on will get insta-bookmarked and thrown into the " Unsorted bookmarks " section .
Click the star again , and you can edit the bookmark .
While we 're at it , we can mention tagging ; as you can see , you can now add tags for each bookmark .
The tags will work in the new location bar , so you can just type a tag and you 'll instantly get the sites you 've bookmarked with that particular tag .
Now , I know what you 're thinking .
What 's the keyboard shortcut for this quick bookmarking feature , and how do you change the Unsorted Bookmarks folder 's name into something else ?
The latter is easy ; right click , properties , and you can change its name and description like any other bookmark folder .
As for the former , well , I have n't been able to find a shortcut ; having exhausted many sources of information and tried all the logical combinations , I 've come to the conclusion that there is none .
If you know otherwise , please let us know in the comments .
Bookmarking in general has been improved somewhat .
Your Bookmarks Toolbar now contains a " Most Visited " folder , which can be useful in certain situations .
Furthermore , the Bookmarks menu now contains both your recent bookmarks and all the recent tags you used .
Finally , the " Places " folder available in your Bookmarks Toolbar is a handy tool for statistics junkies , as it shows you your recently starred , visited pages and tags and their various combinations .
3. Favicon info
Firefox 3 introduces the ability to click the favicon to get identity information for a Web site .
Not even Mozilla 's home page supplies this info , and we suspect no one else will , either .
Not really that useful , is it ?
Well , it can be : if you click on " More Information , " you 'll get the security info for the site you 're on .
The useful option is " View Cookies " , if you want to see which cookies this site is storing on your computer ( and get rid of them ) .
We 'd like to see some more information on the dialogue that opens when you click on the favicon , though .
4. Download manager
Although it still looks awfully plain , and it still does n't have everything we'd like it to have , Firefox 's Download manager has been improved .
Right click on any item , and you 'll be able to open the actual file , open its containing folder , go to the download page , copy the download link , or remove it from the list .
The unfinished downloads will have a tiny icon that lets you resume the download , regardless of when you started it .
5 . Text selection and general in - page goodness
A couple of easily missed improvements to the way you can interact with the Web sites in Firefox are actually real time savers .
Double click a word to select it ; triple click to select a paragraph .
If you need to select multiple batches of text , hold down Ctrl and select at will .
Changes have also been made to the way the zooming feature works .
Hold down Ctrl and move the mousewheel ( alternatively , press + or -) .
Firefox will zoom in or out the entire site ; both text and images .
Want to switch to the old , text - only way of zooming ?
Click on View in the menu and choose Zoom , then Zoom text only .
Your preference will be remembered on a per-site basis .
Finally , there 's been a tiny but useful change to the " Find " toolbar ; select text inside a web page , then hit Ctrl+ F , and the selected text will automatically be entered into the Find field .
6 . Speed , performance and resource usage
There is n't much one can actually do about this , but knowing that Firefox 3 is faster , more stable , and does n't hog all of your memory makes us feel warm around our hearts .
Having tried the final version of Firefox 3 , I can't say I 've noticed a big change from RC3 , but the improvements in relation to Firefox 2 - especially when it comes to stability - are definitely very noticeable .
Furthermore , your stuff - bookmarks , cookies , history and preferences - is now stored in a database , which means it ( probably ) wo n't get lost in case of browser or system crash .
7 . Tiny interface tweaks
If you 're jumping on the Firefox 3 bandwagon for the snazzy new look , you might be disappointed ; visually , it really is n't all that different .
However , spend some time with it and you 'll notice certain small improvements that are making your life easier .
A bigger " back " button is one of them ; being able to stretch the location and the search bar by simply dragging the tiny space between them left or right is another .
The new version also integrates better with Windows , Mac and Linux , inheriting icons , buttons and other visual elements from the platform it 's running on .
8. Security
When Firefox first came out , security was n't an issue ; by design , it was way more secure than Internet Explorer .
With time , however , Firefox became more popular and it became a bigger target for hackers and malware spreaders , and security concerns have resurfaced .
Besides the already mentioned favicon security info box , the Firefox team have introduced many other security features .
Most important are the malware and Web forgery protection ; if a site is suspected of either , you 'll have to click through a warning page such as this one or this one .
The new Firefox is also more wary of insecure add - ons , and it communicates with antivirus software better .
Finally , if you 're a parent ( not the kind that asks their kid to set up Outlook for them ) , you 'll be happy to know that Firefox now works with Vista 's parental controls .
—-
So , there we go ; I 've sifted through the release notes , played with the latest version (s ) for some time now , and found out that Firefox 3 indeed does have a lot to offer , although a lot of it is under the proverbial hood .
Have a favorite feature I 've missed ?

For Pennsylvania mom Stephanie Lenz , a closely watched copyright showdown in San Jose federal court is a simple matter of standing up to powerful music moguls and petulant pop stars .
“ I figure I have nothing to lose , ” Lenz said Friday in a telephone interview with the Mercury News .
“ The music companies are just going to keep doing this to people .
I think it ’s my responsibility to stand up to them and say , ‘ That ’s enough . ’ “
Lenz , whose case reached a critical stage Friday , finds herself at the heart of an epic copyright fight over Universal Music ’s attempt to force her to take down a YouTube video of her toddler learning to walk with the Prince song “ Let ’s Go Crazy ” blaring in the background .
Calling it a “ case of first impression , ” U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel on Friday considered Universal ’s attempt to dismiss Lenz ’s lawsuit , which maintains the media giant and Prince are abusing a 10 - year - old copyright law intended to curtail movie and music thievery on the Web .
Lenz is seeking unspecified damages and a court finding that she did not violate Universal ’s copyrights with the YouTube video .
‘ Takedown ’ letters
The case centers on a so - called “ takedown ” letter Universal sent to Lenz after she posted the video in February 2007 .
Music and movie companies send tens of thousands of such letters under the copyright law each year , essentially forcing the material to be at least temporarily removed unless the target fights the request .
Lenz fought back hard , backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco - based civil liberties organization .
She maintains that the video was a harmless , legal use of a popular song , and that her case exemplifies how a powerful industry can abuse the copyright law , known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Fogel dismissed a previous version of Lenz ’s lawsuit , but her lawyers filed a revised complaint that recasts the case as a test of what copyright holders must consider before sending out takedown letters .
Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyers urged the judge to keep the case alive , arguing that companies such as Universal have an obligation to investigate and evaluate a video such as Lenz ’s before firing off the threatening letters .
Claim of ‘ fair use ’
“ It ’s a tiny , blurry little home movie , ” said Corynne McSherry , the foundation ’s attorney on the case .
Lenz and her legal team depict the video as a “ fair use ” of the Prince song .
But Universal attorneys insist the company had the legal right to send the letter in Lenz ’s case , and that it would be unfair to artists and media companies to force them to undertake lengthy inquiries before asserting copyright violations .
Fogel took the company ’s request to dismiss the case under consideration and will rule later .
“ The copyright owner is arguing that this is infringing ; Lenz says it is fair use , ” said Mark Lemley , director of Stanford University ’s Law , Science and Technology clinic .
“ There are no cases directly on this question of user - generated content that incorporates songs as background .
Lenz will be the first . ”
In the meantime , Lenz is prepared to take her case as far as it goes in the courts .
The video is back up on YouTube , but that ’s not enough to appease Lenz .
“ Somebody needs to tell these music companies they ca n’t just throw out these ( takedown letters ) and accuse people of violating federal crimes , ” she said .
“ I did n’t like feeling like I ’d done something wrong , even though I knew I had n’t .
It made me panic . ”

Messrs Miliband and Cameron want Georgia to join Nato .
Such thinking is muddled , dangerous and defies the lessons of history
Hard on the heels of Nicolas Sarkozy and Condoleezza Rice , and keen to share their limelight , David Cameron arrived in Tbilisi yesterday .
His visit is a reward to the Leader of the Opposition for having expressed even more bellicose views on the Georgian crisis than the Americans , which should sound loud alarm bells for those of us who may quite soon be living under a Tory government .
In the official view of Washington , the expansion of Nato up to the borders of Russia was a benevolent spreading of democracy .
“ It is the right of the Georgian people and Georgian government to determine their own security orientation , ” says Kurt Volker , principal deputy assistant secretary of state , and Matthew Bryza , the American special envoy , adds that Russia would not have attacked Georgia if she had already belonged to Nato .
While Gordon Brown and David Miliband merely mouthed empty platitudes about the crisis ( although Miliband has been sympathetic to Georgia ’s Nato aspirations in the past ) , Cameron went startlingly further when he said that its membership of Nato should be accelerated .
His words so excited the Georgians that they asked him to meet their ambassador in London on Wednesday , and then fly out for his Caucasian photo - op .
Why are we pretending we would fight for Georgia ? : Information Clearing House – ICH .
Medical experts in the North - East of England believe they could have found the key to turning back the brain ’s biological clock and reverse the effects of dementia and memory loss .
Pioneering research at the University of Sunderland has shown that regular exposure to safe low level infra-red light can improve learning performance and kick - start the cognitive function of the brain .
The results are a scientific breakthrough as to date medical treatments for dementia can only slow down brain deterioration and now human trials are to start to see if the treatment could provide a cure to illnesses like Alzheimer's .
Independent research carried out at Sunderland has demonstrated that low power infra-red ( 1072 nm ) can improve the learning performance .
The low levels of infra-red light used are completely safe and occur naturally in sunlight .
They are currently being used in innovative new machines for the treatment of cold sores , which have been approved for NHS prescription .
Experts claim that early stage dementia patients should see an improvement in their cognitive function within four weeks , by wearing a lightweight helmet in their home for just ten minutes a day .
advertisement
Human testing of the ground - breaking infra-red treatment on the brain is due to start this summer and medical experts hope this will halt and even reverse the effects of dementia .
The new infra-red device was created by Dr Gordon Dougal , a director of Virulite – a medical research company based in Newton Aycliffe , County Durham – which is also behind the innovative cold sore machine .
He came up with the idea of using a safe level of infra red light on the human brain after it had proved effective in the treatment of cold sores – a process that relies on boosting the cells within the body responsible for killing the virus , rather than attacking it .
Dr Dougal said : “ The implications of this research at the University of Sunderland are enormous – so much so that in the future , we could be able to affect and change the rate at which our bodies age .
“ As we get older , cells stop repairing themselves and we age because our cells lose the desire to regenerate and repair themselves .
This ultimately results in cell death and decline of the organ functions , for the brain resulting in memory decay and deterioration in general intellectual performance .
advertisement
“ But what if there was a technology that told the cells to repair themselves and that technology was something as simple as a specific wavelength of light ?
Near infrared light penetrates human tissues relatively well , even penetrating the human skull , just as sunlight passes through frosted glass . ”
Dr Dougal , who claims that ten minutes of exposure to the infrared light daily would have the desired effect on the brain , added : “ Currently all you can do with dementia is to slow down the rate of decay – this new process will not only stop that rate of decay but partially reverse it . ”
The research by University of Sunderland neuroscientist , Dr Abdel Ennaceur has led Dr Dougal to arrange clinical trials with patients with age related memory problems . ”
Fellow neuroscientist Paul Chazot , who helped carry out the research , added : “ The treatment can indeed improve learning ability .
The results are completely new – this has never been looked at before .
“ Dr Dougal ’s treatment might have some potential in improving learning in a human situation by delivering infra red through the thinnest parts of the skull to get maximum access to the brain . ”
Further research work will continue in this area , funded by CELS , who support Healthcare research and development in universities , hospitals and companies within the North East of England .
Unofficial Twin Photos Spark Legal Action by Brad Pitt
Actor and new father of twins , is livid and he will prove it if you push him .
A photographer , armed with a special telephoto lens , was able to snap some shots of Brad and partnerand family on the grounds of their secluded estate , Chateau Miraval in the south of France .
The alleged photos are being shopped around now and Pitt has instructed his lawyer to threaten legal action against The Smoking Gun , the source who apparently first put them on their website .
Pitt 's legal team has issued stern letters to multiple sources , instructing them to immediately remove photos from websites .
They have also instructed The Smoking Gun to inform the Pitt legal team of any pertinent information relative to any ongoing attempts by other news sources to purchase photos .
They also forbid them from publishing the legal letter - but that did n't stop them from posting it on their site .
Reuters is reporting that the final price in the bid for the first exclusive photos of Vivienne Marcheline and Knox Leon is $ 11 million .
The couple are said to be donating all proceeds to charity .
But if photos hit news stands before the official release - the exclusive photo deal would be worth far less to the top bidder .
This situation may well push forward the release of exclusive photographs .
We can't wait to see them .

This year 's OSCON was treated to a chance to see the first RepRap " progeny . "
RepRap is a deluxe 3D printer that is capable of printing copies of itself .
On the way back , the TSA opened the case it was in and destroyed the printer .
On the return journey from OSCON , baggage handling found themselves outclassed .
Instead of simply smacking the box around a few times as had happened on the outbound trip , the TSA dismantled the custom hard - case for the RepRap by removing the 16 bolts securing the top panel rather than undoing the 8 bolts marked " Open " .
Unable to fit the panel back on again – it was not meant to come off so the nuts were not captive – they simply sent it on its way with the panel detached .

Keeping gas in the family truckster is slimming more than wallets these days and could have Americans tightening their belts – literally .
According to Charles Courtemanche , an assistant economics professor at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro , rising fuel prices are the ultimate crash diet for a nation that grew fat on cheap gas .
Courtemanche says a $ 1 increase in the price of gasoline could cut the obesity rate by 10 percent , saving 16,000 lives and $ 17 billion in health care costs each year .
He makes the case in " A Silver Lining ?
The Connection Between Gasoline Prices and Obesity , " his doctoral dissertation in health economics .
The paper , currently being peer - reviewed , can be summed up in the simple idea that people walk more , bike more and dine out less when gas prices rise .
Evidence suggests he 's on to something .
Courtemanche compared 20 year 's worth of government health surveys to fuel prices .
The percentage of American adults considered obese doubled to nearly one - third between 1979 and 2004 , and Courtemache says 8 percent of the increase can be attributed to low fuel prices .
" Cheaper gas during that period made us fat , " he told Wired.com .
" Presumably , the opposite would be true . "
His number - crunching suggests a permanent $ 1 increase in gasoline prices could cut the obesity rate by 10 percent within seven years .
The number of Americans who are overweight , but not obese , could fall by 7 percent in that time , he says , as people shun cars in favor of walking , biking or taking mass transit .
Granted , you do n't burn many calories sitting on the bus , but you burn quite a few walking to and from the bus stop , he says .
People also tend to eat out less frequently , opting instead to cook their own meals .
" These results suggest that the recent spike in gas prices may have the
' silver lining ' of reducing obesity in the coming years , " he writes in the paper .
Some doubt rising fuel prices will do much to shrink waistlines .
Dan Sperling , head of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis , says people do n't change their behavior when gas prices rise , they simply buy more fuel - efficient cars .
Nevertheless , evidence suggests they 're riding bikes more often .
National sales figures are n't available yet , but bike shops in cities from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York have seen sales rise 20 to 40 percent in the past month or so .
Those who are n't buying new bikes are digging that old Schwinn out of the garage .
" Bike shops are doing record business fixing up old bikes , " Tim Blumenthal , executive director of the national bicycle - advocacy group Bikes Belong , tells Wired.com .
" It 's off the chart . "
That said , Blumenthal does n't expect a big increase in the number of people biking to work .
Most people live too far away from the office , he says , and do n't have anywhere to clean up or stash their bikes once they arrive .
But Blumenthal expects increasing numbers of people to hop on a bike for that run to the store , or the gym , or any of the other short trips he says make up 40 percent of the trips Americans make each day .
" There 's a general perception that ( high gas prices ) are here to stay , and people are changing their habits , " he says .
Courtemanche can soon test his hypothesis .
The national average for a gallon of gas was $ 3.22 when he wrote his paper last year .
It 's now at $ 4.10 .
He 's planning a follow - up study .

Science & Exploration Integral locates origin of high - energy emission from Crab Nebula 29/08/2008 1102 views 0 likes
Thanks to data from ESA ’s Integral gamma-ray observatory , scientists have been able to locate where particles in the vicinity of the rotating neutron - star in the Crab Nebula are accelerated to immense energies .
The discovery put in place another piece of the puzzle in understanding how neutron stars work .
Rotating neutron - stars , or ' pulsars ' , are known to accelerate particles to enormous energies , typically one hundred times more than the most powerful accelerators on Earth , but scientists are still uncertain exactly how these systems work and where the particles are accelerated .
A step forward in this understanding is now accomplished thanks to a team of researchers from the UK and Italy , led by Professor Tony Dean of the University of Southampton , who studied high - energy polarised light emitted by the Crab Nebula – one of the most dramatic sights in deep space .
The Crab Nebula is the result of a supernova explosion which was seen from Earth on 4 July 1054 .
The explosion left behind a pulsar with a nebula of radiating particles around it .
The pulsar contains the mass of the Sun squeezed into a volume of about 10 km radius , rotating very fast – about 30 times a second – thereby generating very powerful magnetic fields and accelerating particles .
A highly collimated jet , aligned with the spin axis of the pulsar and a bright radiating ‘ donut ’ structure ( or torus ) around the pulsar itself , are also seen .
So , the Crab is known to accelerate electrons - and possibly other particles - to extremely high speed , and so produces high energy radiation .
But where exactly are these particles accelerated ?
Looking into the heart of the pulsar with Integral ’s spectrometer ( SPI ) , the researchers made a detailed study to assess the polarisation – or the alignment - of the waves of high - energy radiation originating from the Crab .
They used data from more than 600 individual observations of the nebula , and saw that this polarised radiation is highly aligned with the rotation axis of the pulsar .
So they concluded that a significant portion of the electrons generating the high - energy radiation must originate from a highly organised structure located very close to the pulsar , very likely directly from the jets themselves .
The discovery allows the researchers to discard other theories that locate the origin of this radiation further away from the pulsar .
Professor Tony Dean of the University ’s School of Physics and Astronomy commented that the discovery of such alignment – also matching with the polarisation observed in the visible band - is truly remarkable .
“ The findings have clear implications on many aspects of high energy accelerators such as the Crab , ” he added .
" The detection of polarised radiation in space is very complicated and rare , as it requires dedicated instrumentation and an in - depth analysis of very complex data ” , said Chris Winkler , Integral Project Scientist at ESA .
“ Integral ’s ability to detect polarised gamma- radiation and , as a consequence , to obtain important results like this one , confirms it once more as a world - class observatory . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in an interview aired on Sunday he had no interest in staying in his post beyond January when a new administration takes office .

“ I look forward to doing other things next year , ” Paulson said on NBC television ’s “ Meet the Press ” program .
The interview was taped on Saturday in China .
“ I ’m going to run right up until the end , ” he said .
“ I ’m focused on getting everything done I can get done between now and January 19th . ”
In March , Paulson proposed overhauling the U.S. financial regulatory system and giving more powers to the Federal Reserve in the wake of the financial market upheaval that exposed gaping holes in oversight .
Last month , he took heat from fellow Republicans in Congress who said his plan to backstop mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was akin to socialism because shareholders reaped the profits in good times but the government was on the hook for losses when things went bad .
Paulson offered a richer credit line to the two government - sponsored entities and pledged to buy their shares if needed to bolster investor confidence , although he has said it was unlikely the companies would need to use the lifelines .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finance nearly half of all mortgages in the United States and have been hurt as the housing crisis drove up delinquencies and foreclosures .
On Friday , Fannie Mae posted a $ 2.3 billion loss and cut its dividend .
Paulson said that loss was not surprising given the state of the housing market and did not change his view that the companies would probably not need government cash .
“ We have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions , ” he said in the NBC interview .
“ It was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because Fannie and Freddie are very important to our capital markets . ”
Paulson said it would be well beyond the end of 2008 before the housing problems were resolved .
Until that happened , the financial markets and the economy would remain strained , he said .
He dismissed the idea that the U.S. economy needed another round of economic stimulus after a $ 152 billion package passed earlier this year gave tax rebates to millions of households and incentives to businesses .
“ Let ’s see how this program works in the third quarter , ” Paulson said , noting that the stimulus package succeeded in supporting growth in the second quarter , which ended in June .

Ron Paul followers pose danger for McCain in West The Associated Press
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This By KATHLEEN HENNESSEY LAS VEGAS -- Dueling delegations pitting Ron Paul 's Nevada supporters against those of John McCain vow to take their fight to the Republican National Convention .
That 's just one sign that the outsider , Internet - fueled movement led by the feisty Republican congressman from Texas remains afloat in the wake of McCain 's victory in the GOP primaries .
In the libertarian - leaning West , where Paul 's message of distrust of the federal government and ardent individualism played particularly well , there is talk of Republicans straying from McCain .
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr has emerged as a favorite alternative for Paul activists , followed by Constitutional Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
Even if the numbers of such dissenters are small , in tight contests in key Western states they could spoil McCain 's chances , experts say .
" In Nevada , there 's absolutely enough to have an effect on the election , " said Chuck Muth , a leading conservative activist in a state in which early polls show McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama in a statistical tie .
" I think that you will see not just Libertarians who always vote for the Libertarian candidate but conservative Republicans saying we 've had it , we 've had enough and they 're going to go ahead and vote Libertarian , " Muth said .
Paul - or " Dr. Paul , " as his followers reverently refer to the obstetrician - turned - politician - ran as the Libertarian Party nominee for president in 1988 .
But this year he carved out a following as an antiestablishment Republican .
His campaign won more than 1 million votes and became a catchall for anti-war , anti-government voters and disaffected Republicans .
The eclectic coalition racked up significant numbers .
Paul placed second - ahead of McCain - in Republican caucuses in Nevada and Montana .
He posted strong showings in nominating contests in Colorado , Washington and Oregon .
In early June , he pulled away 14 percent of the vote from the already certain nominee in the New Mexico primary .
This is the West that McCain must win .
The interior West generally has been friendly territory for Republicans seeking the White House .
Nevada , Montana and Colorado voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 .
But history also warns of the impact of feisty Texans who preach small government .
" There 's little doubt Bill Clinton would not have won Montana if it were n't for Ross Perot , " said Bob Brown , a senior fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West at the University of Montana .
" And I think it 's clear those votes were Republican . "
The same could be said of Nevada , New Mexico and Colorado , states where the two - time independent candidate for president is often given credit for Clinton 's breaking a two - decade - long Republican presidential winning streak in 1992 .
The McCain campaign says they expect many Paul voters to come home to the GOP before Nov. 4 .
" At the end of the day , Republicans are going to vote for John McCain .
He 's a Western candidate who understands water issues , land issues .
He 's a fiscal conservative , " said Rick Gorka , a campaign spokesman .
" His message is appealing to a broad spectrum of voters . "
There 's little sign of that unification yet .
In Nevada , state GOP officials abruptly shut down the state convention as a group of well - organized newcomers were poised to win delegates for Paul .
The group led by Paul supporters then held its own rogue convention and elected its own delegates .
For its part , the state party could n't get enough delegates to attend a second convention and appointed delegates by committee .
A judge ruled against the Paul supporters when they filed suit .
They now plan to file a challenge with the Republican National Committee .
Both groups are heading to the national convention in St. Paul , Minn .
" We 're trying to say , ' Hey , you guys got to play by the rules , and if you do n't , you 'll face the consequences , ' " said Wayne Terhune , a 57 - year - old dentist in Sparks , Nev. , and a leading Paul activist in the state .
" They just took the football and went home . "
Even without Nevada , Paul will send at least a handful of delegates to the national convention .
Outside the convention hall , his supporters have reserved a 15,000 - seat basketball arena for a " mini-convention . "
As of Thursday , about 7,800 tickets had been sold , organizers said .
Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura also planned to speak about the disadvantage of the two - party system , said rally spokesman Jesse Benton .
Paul has n't endorsed , but it is clear whom he is not supporting .
" I do encourage all the alternatives , obviously , because I can't support either of the two candidates from the Republican or Democratic parties , " Paul said this month in an interview on Revolution Radio , an Internet - based station run by his supporters .
" I think that might send a message . "
In interviews with a dozen Paul voters from around the West , anti-administration sentiment rang loudest .
Most were newly active in politics but had been regular Republican voters .
They said their activism began with opposition to the Bush administration 's foreign policy .
As newcomers , they expressed little party allegiance and little concern that their third - party votes could benefit Obama , a candidate even further from their views than McCain .
" The notion is , let 's just break the GOP because the people who are running and holding office in it are n't respecting what the constituents want , " said Jay Weeldreyer , a Paul field director in Renton , Wash .
" So , if we can just let them suffer a massive loss , then maybe that will get through to them . "
Suzanne Gamboa in Washington contributed to this report .

“ A language is a culture , ” she said .
“ In Belgium the two cultures know very little about each other because they speak different languages .
There are singers known in one part , not in the other .
Television is different , newspapers , books . ”
Francophones have now come to talk about “ linguistic cleansing . ”
Flemish , many of them openly resentful of subsidizing poorer French - speaking compatriots , who for years lorded it over them economically and otherwise ( unemployment today is three times higher in rust - belt Wallonia ) , say the issue is preserving national heritage .
“ It ’s difficult to have a rational conversation , ” said Roel Jacobs , a writer born to Flemish parents who lives in bilingual Brussels .
“ There are six million Dutch speakers and they ’re angry about Francophone influence , but meanwhile they care nothing about the influence of English and Anglo culture , ” he went on , “ so it ’s not rational .
We ’ve forgotten our true cultural history .
In the 15th century Bruges was the most vibrant city outside Italy because it was full of foreigners .
Then it was Antwerp , when the foreigners left Bruges .
Today the national movement in Flanders is in complete denial of the past . ”
A century or so ago Émile Verhaeren , the Flemish Symbolist poet , who was born in Sint - Amands , near Antwerp , and educated at the University of Leuven , wrote in French .
Now the university has split into two , the one Flemish , the other French and moved to Wallonia , and the region around Sint - Amands is a stronghold of far - right , anti-immigrant Flemish nationalists .
“ Back then the Francophones did n’t want a bilingual country , ” Ms. Witte said .
“ French dominated , and it would have meant they would need to learn Flemish .
Educated Flemish spoke in French .
But then the electoral system changed and allowed everyone to vote , and more power went to the non-French - speaking Flemish middle and lower classes . ”
The other afternoon Francis Dannemark was at home in Brussels .
Through the open French doors in his library , a Ping - Pong table crammed the balcony , beyond the stacks of books and DVDs .
“ I do n’t think it will , but for the first time I really believe Belgium could disappear , ” he said .
Mr. Dannemark is an editor at Le Castor Astral , a French - language publisher .
He prints translations of Flemish writers from Dutch , a rarity here .
“ Most people do n’t know what goes on in an oil field , ” she said .
“ It ’s a war landscape .
Those boys are out there 24 hours , even when it ’s 50 below and the wind is blowing sideways . ”
After a day in and around Jackson , with its mega- mansions built by the super wealthy , including some from the energy industry such as Vice President Dick Cheney , Ms. Fuller offered a tour of the other Wyoming , the grit and beauty and working - class economy of Sublette County .
“ We ’ll take a look at the sausage factory , ” she said as she packed her skis for the trip .
On a brilliantly sunny day , on a sweeping landscape of glittering , snow - covered plains and mountains , we parked the car along the road and headed out on a three - mile cross-country schuss on snow so deep it buried the fence posts .
The route was fairly flat until the end , when it ascended through pristine , trackless snow in a grove of lodgepole pine and aspen that camouflaged her cabin .
Ms. Fuller opened the cabin for the first time in weeks .
When the road is open she spends weeks at a time at the cabin , but in winter , she uses it less because access is difficult .
Ms. Fuller said she wrote much of the book there on a laptop in her bed , covers pulled up , a box of tissues on the table next to her .
“ I cried a lot as I wrote , ” she explained .
After a lunch of fruit and bread at small table in the main room that is living room , dining room and kitchen , Ms. Fuller put on her skis and headed out .
She paused in front of her home at the crest of the hill and looked out over the prairie that rises up to the mountains known as the Winds .
She said that the view was bound to change .
“ It ’s all been leased , ” she said .
“ It ’s all slated for oil and gas development . ”
Later we drove past the tiny town of Pinedale , and across public land , where towering steel oil derricks flying American flags slice into the blue sky and a natural landscape once full of antelope , jackrabbits and sagebrush is now a vast industrial landscape .
White pickup trucks raise clouds of dust and fierce winds blow tumbleweeds across prairie scraped to bare dirt by bulldozers .
From Channel 2 Boise , Idaho :
BOISE - Two people have plead guilty to sexual assault against a 16 - year - old girl .
The Ada County Prosecutor 's office says John Rainey and Rose Gloria plead guilty to the incident , which occurred in June of 2007 .
Boise Police responded to a 911 call to a residence after Gloria reported that a household member had been raped by a stranger while she slept in her bed at home .
Police initially arrested an individual and held him in the Ada County jail on the charges for more than two weeks pending DNA analysis .
He was eventually cleared of the charges after the analysis .
This case highlights the reality that those who are guilty of a crime , and those who side with criminals , can and do falsely direct investigators to those they know are innocent .
Yet in many discussions of the harm done to innocent suspects it is only crime victims and those who freely decide to falsely claim to be crime victims who are given the blame for the harm done to those who are innocent .
The girl was raped while she slept and then told Gloria correctly about the identity of her rapist , but rather than protecting a girl who had just been raped this woman coerced this rape victim into saying she did n't know who had raped her .
Gloria also lied and said that Rainey was n't home at the time of the rape .
Threats against this girl did n't need to be explicit for them to be effective .
If this girl did n't agree to the deception , she likely would n't have been allowed to get a forensics exam done which would have allowed her rapist to escape justice and it may have resulted in additional rapes .
Thankfully , the police collected DNA from Rainey before he knew that DNA had been found in the rape kit .
Forcing or coercing rape victims into lying serves 2 purposes .
It misdirects the police and it paints the rape victim as someone who has no credibility in case the police realize they have been misdirected .
Anyone who blames this rape victim for being coerced either does n't understand crimes such as this one or understands and simply does n't care .

A cry for help goes out from a city beleaguered by violence and fear :
A beam of light flashed into the night sky , the dark symbol of a bat projected onto the surface of the racing clouds . . .
Oh , wait a minute .
That 's not a bat , actually .
In fact , when you trace the outline with your finger , it looks kind of like . . . a " W . "
There seems ...
The messages girls receive  from parents and teachers , from books they read , from movies and television shows they watch , and from behavior of the adults around them  can be so powerful that as women they may not even understand that their reluctance to ask for what they want is a learned behavior , and one that can be unlearned .
More recent research that I conducted with two colleagues , Hannah Bowles and Lei Lai , points to another reason that women do n’t ask :
They face a much chillier reaction  from men and from women  when they do negotiate for what they want .
Behavior that can lead a man to be seen as ambitious or a go - getter can brand a woman as too pushy and aggressive .
She may be called rude names , receive negative evaluations based solely on her personal style instead of her work and find herself closed out of networks or opportunities from which she might benefit .
My boss was pleased that I asked him for what I wanted .
A lot of women are n’t so lucky .
I ’ve concluded that this is a crucial leadership issue for any organization committed to sound management practices .
When I realized that the woman I ’d hired would be earning less than the man for doing equivalent work , I called her back and raised her salary .
I could n’t accept this disparity in my organization  not just because it was unfair but because I knew that it was bad for my organization , where it is crucial to attract and keep the best people .
Managers often watch talented women walk out the door when they discover that they ’ve been treated inequitably .
So good managers need to be on the lookout for these sorts of inequities and take steps to correct them .
THERE’S a lot that women can do , too .
They can recognize more opportunities to negotiate and master basic negotiation skills .
They can learn how to assess and strengthen their bargaining power ; research , prepare and practice before their negotiations ; and use strategies that wo n’t make them seem threatening and provoke a backlash .
I ’ve also founded an organization , Progress ( www.heinz.cmu.edu/progress), to teach young girls to negotiate .
In partnership with the Girl Scouts , we ’ve already developed a negotiation badge that takes girls through a series of 10 activities to develop their negotiation skills .
We ’ve created a video game that requires girls to negotiate in order to reach the highest levels and win .
The battle lines have been drawn today .
You 're with us or you 're against us .
You 're cool and hip or lame and square .
No , I 'm not talking about political lines ( for once ) , I 'm talking about the early adopters versus the mainstream , or as Robert Scoble framed it : the passionates versus the non-passionates .
What , though , is a passionate ( sometimes referred to as an ' evangelist ' ) ?
What is the definition of an early - adopter ?
Quite simply , and perhaps obviously , it 's a person who embraces new technology before most other people do .
Early adopters tend to buy or try out new hardware items and programs , and new versions of existing programs , sooner than most of their peers .
Remember , I 'm Describing the Stereotype ...
Early adopters in the Web punditry sector , though , have a particularly precise stereotype .
Just like all stereotypes , it 's not perfectly accurate across all examples , but it exists for a reason .
What is the stereotype then ?
Well , your typical Web early adopter has more logins and passwords than they could possibly ever keep track of .
They 're in a constant race to have the most followers of any kid on their block on the website du jour ( even while they may proclaim how against the idea of follower - collection they may be ) .
Their patron saints are Robert Scoble and increasingly Louis Gray .
They voted Democrat in the last election ( assuming they were old enough to vote ) , and are filled so full of party unity that every fifth post for the last three months has been something concerning Barack Obama .
They currently have a manga avatar on at least one website they visit regularly .
They love FriendFeed , and publicly denounce Twitter while secretly loving it .
They hate Facebook , because it 's sooo six months ago .
The starkly dividing hot - button political issue for this group of folks is n't abortion , homosexual marriage or the war on terrorism ( or any other petty Red / Blue issue that affects the real world ) - it 's whether or not they support Loren Feldman or Shel Israel .
Most importantly , though , they gravitate towards whatever tool suits their hyper - connected , always - on lifestyle ( rather than the tools that fit into the everyday lives of the regular folks of the world ) .
How Is This Good For The Company ?
Remember that wonderful movie Office Space , and that scene with Luhmberg and the Bob 's where they asked everyone at Innetech to ask themselves : " ... for every decision you make , is this good for the company ?
Am I helping with the company 's strategic vision ? "
Early adopters should be asking themselves a similar question as they try out new technologies and stay on the bleeding edge of the pretty , shiny tools we talk about every day here at Mashable .
Failure to do so can result in being considered largely irrelevant , both in the calibre of advice and review the early adopter provides , as well as in general as a person ( at least in the view of the average , mainstream Internet reader ) .
For instance , ask yourself why you take to tools like Twitter and Friendfeed .
Is it because it suits your always on lifestyle and constant need to be in communication with other early adopters like yourself ?
Or is it because the tool has a genuine ability to make a normal person 's life easier , and you see the value in that .
Some Quick Question to Help
You not be a New Media Douchebag
Will your mom use it ?
Think less about whether your other early adopter friends will like the product or service - think about your mom .
This is obvious - your mom does n't need another way to gossip about politics and the neighbors online .
Your great - uncle does n't need another way to share jokes .
They both have email for that .
They probably wo n't enjoy lifestreaming the way FriendFeed works .
They will , however , get into lifestreaming if it means there 's an effortless way to maintain a website that showcases their likes and dislikes on the web .
Consider introducing them to Tumblr , MyBlogLog or FriendFeed as a way to effortlessly update their home page .
Call it " low - impact blogging . "
Is it truly a time - sink or a time - saver ?
Most professionals do n't need distractions from their daily routine .
The only way you can sell addicting tools like Twitter or Facebook to someone who actually works for a living is to show them how they can add to their productivity with them .
Saying " this is the most fun thing in the world - I spend all day chatting there " makes it look as pathetic and useless as a subscription to World of Warcraft .
Is the tool an intrusion or an integration ?
Similar to the last question , ask yourself if this tool is a " configure - once and forget " or the type of tool you have to constantly maintain , tweak and engage with .
The beauty of automation and technology is that tools ( think I Want Sandy ) can be set up once and can run as background processes .
People are looking for ways to offload mundane tasks from their plate , not add to them .
Will it increase their bottom line ?
We like to get excited about new distribution technologies quite a bit in our world .
YouTube , RSS , podcasting , and blogging ... these things are great , as we 've learned , but it 's taken quite a bit of development and innovation after these concepts have been in existence for them to become seamless parts of our daily lives .
Tools like Utterz , UStream and Qik make creating video and audio a snap .
How long did embedded video , RSS and podcasting exist before it was so easy a six year old could do it ?
Years .
Likewise , when you come across a bleeding edge technology - it 's important to recognize the potential but be careful in your evangelism .
Chances are the mainstream might take your advice , try it out , and wonder what you were smoking when you thought it was a good idea .

Romanian villagers have voted to re-elect a dead man as their mayor , to prevent his living rival winning .
Neculai Ivascu - who led Voinesti for almost two decades - died from a liver disease on Sunday , too late to cancel the contest .
The village 's loyal residents still gave him 23 more votes than his rival , Gheorghe Dobrescu of the ruling National Liberal Party .
" I know he died , but I do n't want change , " one villager told Romanian TV .
In a controversial decision , the electoral commission declared the runner - up and rival Mr Dobrescu the winner .
Neculai Ivascu 's party , the opposition Social Democrat Party , has said it will contest the decision .
Some villagers have also called for a fresh vote .
Reader Chemisor advances a theory in his journal that a linguistic misunderstanding is at the root of many disagreements over different licensing philosophies , in particular BSD vs. GPL .
The argument is that GPL adherents desire the freedom of their code , while those on the BSD side want freedom for their projects .
" It is difficult to spend a week on Slashdot without colliding with a GPL advocate .
Eager to spread their philosophy , they proselytize to anyone willing to listen , and to many who are not .
When they collide with a BSD advocate , such as myself , a heated flamewar usually erupts with each side repeating the same arguments over and over , failing to understand how the other party can be so stupid as to not see the points that appear so obvious and right .
These disagreements , as I wish to show in this article , are as much linguistic as they are philosophical , and while the latter side can not be reconciled , the former certainly can , hopefully resulting in a more civil and logical discourse over the matter . "
Click below for Chemisor 's analysis of the linguistic chasm .
i += 2 ;
The first disagreement I wish to address concerns the statement " BSD projects are free , but GPL projects stay free . "
GPL advocates cannot understand why the BSD advocates are not getting this point , and BSD advocates make accusations of Communism , which are then argued to death by both parties .
The problem with the statement above is the different interpretation of the word " project . "
I , and I suspect many other BSD advocates , generally separate the concept of " project " from " code . "
While code is what projects are made of , I do not see it as valuable as the useful product a project provides .
When I write a program , be it a site scraper , or a todo program , or a UI framework , I think of my project as the entity that matters .
The fact that I may have copied some code from one to another is of no concern to me .
A GPL advocate sees an entirely different situation .
To him , it is the code that comes first , and the applications built from that code are a secondary consideration .
Even a single line of code is precious , whether it contains a complex spline formula or .
As an aside , I would expect this mindset to be more prone to reusing other people 's code instead of reimplementing it .
Where I would scoff at a piece of code , call it utter garbage , and rewrite the damn thing from scratch , a GPL advocate would probably wrap the garbage in another API that he finds more palatable .
In my opinion , this leads to bloat from wrappers , instability from the garbage that is still there , and loss of skills .
What programmer from the current generation is up to the challenge of reimplementing libjpeg ?
But , I digress .
I am here to explain , not bash , so please excuse this little rant .
The two different viewpoints outlined above lead to different interpretation of the expression " stay free . "
To a BSD advocate , his project will always " stay free , " and to assert otherwise is ridiculous .
Once it is published , what could possibly make it go away ?
I have projects that I wrote fifteen years ago which are still hosted on ibiblio.org FTP site and mirrored around the world .
I no longer maintain them and think them useless , but they 'll persist forever , and anyone at all who wants to download them still can download them .
The fact that some company can take it , write a little bit on top of it , and sell it , does not in any way affect my project .
To a GPL advocate , the project is not important ; the code is important .
So he looks not just at the project distributions he has made , but also of other projects that may incorporate any line of code he ever wrote .
In his mind there is no distinction between his original work and its encapsulation in a derived work .
He still thinks of both as " his code , " and as an entity that must stay free .
Naturally , any non -free derived work will anger him , because his code in it will no longer be free , even though his own copy of that code and his entire project will still be free .
The code / project distinction also leads to a different view of what it means to " use " a project , although this point is seldom argued explicitly .
A GPL advocate makes a rather arbitrary and vague distinction between a human using his code and a computer using his code .
Consider a situation where a user has a GPL - licensed program that converts a JPEG image to a GIF image and his own program ( which he sells , or distributes under some other incompatible license ) that can only view GIF images .
It is legal for him and his customers to call the GPL program from the command line to convert JPEG images and then view them with his program .
Suppose he gets fed up with this sequence and writes a shell script to do both operations in sequence .
Is this legal ?
Probably .
But what if he cuts out the conversion part of the GPL program and embeds it in his viewer ?
That would make his viewer a derived work , and so illegal to distribute under anything but GPL .
From the GPL advocate 's view , this is perfectly logical .
It is his code , and he wants all instances of his code to be free .
The instance can not be free if it is embedded in another executable that is not free , since it can not be easily modified , which was Stallman 's gripe and the reason for the GPL 's existence .
From the BSD advocate 's view , the situation is absurd .
His project is still free , and he does not really care how a user wants to use it .
A shell script calling the converter is no different than a closed source program embedding it .
They are simply different ways for a human to use the program .
Whether the object code for the project stays hackable is also irrelevant , since the human 's use of the project through a derived work project is just another way of use .
These different views of derived works are another bitter point of contention .
GPL code can only be legally embedded in GPL projects , and if a non-GPL project wants to use GPL code , it must either not do that , or become a GPL project .
This is why BSD advocates call the license viral , and thus elicit vehement denials from GPL advocates , who retort that nobody is forced to use GPL code , which lead to useless arguments over the meaning of " forced " or " viral " with no meaningful result .
It must be reiterated that the GPL advocates look at code , while the BSD advocates look at projects , and the " viral " debate can only be resolved by examining both viewpoints .
A GPL advocate sees a derived work as " his code " combined with some " other code " in a package , and his concern is that the package always be openable .
" His code " always remains his code , and he sees any use or distribution of the whole package as a kind of use or distribution of his code .
As a result , he feels justified in placing restrictions on how a user may use or distribute the derived work , even though he " owns " only a small part of the whole package .
This is following the philosophy of copyright and intellectual property , which , curiously , is a favorite target of derision of these same people .
A copyrighted work can never be wholly owned by the user , it is only rented , and so subject to control by the original creator .
A BSD advocate sees a derived work as his project being used by another project .
The derived project is wholly owned by whoever wrote it , even if it uses other people 's code .
This is similar to the property laws of the real world .
For example , suppose I sit on the curb and give away free lemons .
A kid next door might get the bright idea to get my lemons , make lemonade , and sell it .
The lemonade is clearly a " derived work , " since it is made from my lemons , but it is absurd to suggest I have any right to tell him what price to put on his lemonade or how much sugar he can use in it .
By the laws of private property in the real world , my ownership was relinquished at the time when I handed him my lemons .
Just as I do not own his lemonade , neither do I own the derived works he makes from my BSD - licensed software .
These distinctive views of ownership combine with considerations of money , and GPL 's anti-business mindset , resulting in accusations of Communism , and worse .
But I 'll save explaining that for another article .
For now I will simply suggest that GPL advocates should change their language a bit , to make themselves more easily understood by people who do not subscribe to their philosophy .
Specifically : " BSD code is free , but GPL code stays free .
" It would be better instead to say : " BSD code is free , but the GPL ensures all derived works are also free . " or " The GPL ensures your code will never be used by a closed - source application .
" These alternatives clarify that you are talking about derived works , rather than the original project , which , of course , will always stay free anyhow .
Also , do keep in mind the other points brought up in this article and make at least some effort to ensure you are speaking the same language before becoming too upset .
I will never agree with your philosophy , but at least you 'll know you were understood .

With the Supreme Court becoming more conservative , many people who support women ’s right to choose an abortion fear that Roe v.
Wade , the 1973 decision that gave them that right , is in danger of being swept aside .
When such fears arise , we often hear about the pre-Roe “ bad old days . ”
Yet there are few physicians today who can relate to them from personal experience .
I can .
I am a retired gynecologist , in my mid-80s .
My early formal training in my specialty was spent in New York City , from 1948 to 1953 , in two of the city ’s large municipal hospitals .
There I saw and treated almost every complication of illegal abortion that one could conjure , done either by the patient herself or by an abortionist  often unknowing , unskilled and probably uncaring .
Yet the patient never told us who did the work , or where and under what conditions it was performed .
She was in dire need of our help to complete the process or , as frequently was the case , to correct what damage might have been done .
The winner of LG's next phone design challenge has been announced - and by the looks of things , it appears that Spider - Man 's web shooter was a major source of inspiration .
The device is actually a pen-shaped cellphone / mobile projector that can throw images , video and other information on the back of the user 's hand when mounted on a wrist strap .
I 'm not sure if LG still plans on manufacturing the winning concept phone , but slinging a mini or pico projector image around like a web shooter has definite geek appeal .
UPDATE : This phone concept is actually a runner up .
Hopefully we will know more about the winning entry from designer Dave Schultze soon .

Aug. 7 , 2008  --
As the prices of educational laptops for children in developing countries creep upward , a group of researchers attempts to create a new , even lower - tech computer that would cost as little as $ 12 .
While wandering the streets of Bangalore , India , in February during an internship for Qualcomm , 27 - year - old graduate student Derek Lomas stumbled across a contraption that looked quite similar to the original Nintendo console that he played video games on as a kid in the 1980s .
Variations on that original console sell in India for anywhere between $ 10 and $ 20 and plug into your TV , complete with game controllers and a computer keyboard .
The consoles eventually expanded their game repertoire beyond " Duck Hunt " rip - offs to very basic word processing software .
After tooling around with the gadget , Lomas had an idea .
" I started thinking about how to make a project that would redesign some of the content and experience so it was more effective in teaching basic skills , " he said .
Lomas , along with designers and engineers from Ghana , Brazil , Peru and India , presented the idea this week at MIT 's International Development Design Summit , which challenges designers to create technology in four weeks that can help people in developing countries .
At the conference , the group presented the same console , but with modifications -- such as flash memory -- so users could save their work , and wireless connectivity , as well as development plans for more educational software .
For now , the computer is just a proposal , but according to Lomas , companies have already expressed interest .
He hopes that in a country like India , where half the population owns televisions , a device like this could introduce a whole new segment of the population to computers and potentially , a better life .
Having skills as simple as typing could push citizens , especially those in areas where data entry outsourcing is common , into a higher income bracket , Lomas hypothesized .
" We 're not going for the absolutely poorest person we can find , but aspiring middle class with very low incomes but [ who ] have access to a television , " he said .
The idea of a $ 12 computer sounds as fantastical as the idea of $ 100 laptop did two years ago when Nicholas Negroponte unleashed the long - awaited XO , the green - and - white solar - powered brainchild of One Laptop Per Child .
It turns out that the XO -- or at least its $ 100 price tag -- was fantastical .
The cost progressively moved upward before reaching its current price of $ 187 .
Just like the OLPC before it , the $ 12 price tag makes for great headlines , even if it is only " a step above a calculator , " as one expert put it .
" It 's a fascinating concept in that it tried to redefine the bottom of the computer segment , just like the OLPC decided to define the floor as $ 100 , " said Rob Enderle , a Silicon Valley Tech analyst .
" The floor was closer to $ 200 . "
For emerging countries , that price can make a huge difference , he said .
" Twelve dollars is an awful lot of money to them , and they might only need certain capabilities .
If you start with a $ 12 core you can probably add a lot of that stuff and stay under $ 50 , " Enderle said .
" Any time you move the bottom of a market down , anyone who 's building in that market gets concerned . "
But Chuck Kane , OLPC 's president and COO , did n't seem too concerned by the news of a plug - in computer .
" I applaud anyone who 's trying to get something out there to developing countries , but I just think it 's apples and oranges we 're looking at here , " he said .
Clearly , the XO and its U.S. - based competitor , the Intel Classmate , are quite different from Lomas ' ultra - basic computer concept .
The XO is a real laptop , albeit not a high - performance one like the MacBook Air .
But just as competition at the sophisticated high end of the computer market has engineered remarkable innovations , competition at the low end will also bring innovation .
" [ It 's ] one more example of the size of the competition Nick Negroponte kicked off when he first proposed the $ 100 laptop , " technology forecaster Paul Saffo wrote in an e-mail .
" And of course very much goes with the grain of Moore 's law . "
First mentioned by an Intel co-founder in the 1960s , Moore 's Law states that every year , more transistors can be place on a circuit doubles every two years .
The idea behind the law is that technology will exponentially get cheaper , faster and more useful .
Walter Bender , the former president of OLPC 's software and content , is heartened by the group 's new competitors and Lomas ' project , even if he does n't think it 's completely practical .
" It 's a very limited way of thinking about how you use computers and what you use computers for and how we use computers for our own learning , " he said .
" Nonetheless it 's certainly one approach in a problem that needs many solutions .
...
It 's certainly better than nothing , and for a lot of people that 's the choice . "
" There must be 30 different offerings in that space now , and some of them will be interesting , " said Bender .
" It 's great that there are people who are working in the space now . "
But not all consumer electronics expansion into the outdoor urban markets of Third World countries is going to be for solely altruistic reasons .
" In general , we see now the entire PC market more concentrated on the developing world , whether it 's Brazil or China or India , " said Steve Baker , an analyst at NPD Group .
In the United and States and Western Europe , " the markets for computers are pretty well saturated and are very mature .
...
And the PC companies or anybody who wants to sell to those markets is going to have to create product that deals with the income levels and usage patterns that go on in those places . "
Baker called the MIT presentation " a nice idea , " but questioned whether , at least in India , this was something that consumers wanted or needed .
" This is a nice thing but obviously the XO [ people ] have had a difficult time getting their propositions up and running and these guys are likely to find the same kind of thing happen , " he said .
" Maybe we 'd better off providing [ electricity ] . "
One sprouted .
Scientists initially estimated its age at about 2000 years old based on carbon dating of other seeds found at the site , but they had no way of directly testing the planted seed without risking its chance of survival .
After the Methuselah seed germinated , Dr Solowey found fragments of the seed shell clinging to the roots  enough for dating .
The fragments initially dated to AD295 , give or take 50 years , but a small percentage of " modern " carbon incorporated as the seed germinated made it appear 250 to 300 years younger .
Correcting for this factor , the researchers reported that the seed dated from 60 BC to AD95 , similar to the other seeds from the site .
That placed the seed at Masada around the Roman siege in the year 73 , when , according to the ancient historian Josephus , nearly 1000 Jewish Zealots in the fortress committed mass suicide rather than capitulate to the Romans .
They burned most of their food stores , leaving a single cache to show that they did not starve to death .
" These people were eating these dates up on the mountain and looking down at the Roman camp , knowing that they were going to die soon , and spitting out the pits , " Dr Sallon said .
" Maybe here is one of those pits . "
Archaeologists excavating the fortress of Masada originally unearthed the seeds in 1965 .
SpongeBob SquarePants made its debut in 1999 on Nickleodeon
Children 's cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants is being used as part of an art installation to protest against water - boarding as a form of torture .
The Water - boarding Thrill Ride by artist Steve Powers has been installed at Coney Island theme park in New York .
A sign on the outside shows SpongeBob saying " It do n't Gitmo better ! " - a reference to Guantanamo Bay - as another character pours water over him .
The US has admitted using the simulated drowning method on terrorism suspects .
For one dollar ( 50 p ) , visitors get to look through a barred window at a Guantanamo - like interrogation , enacted by animated robots .
A hooded figure leans over a man in an orange jumpsuit , whose face is covered with a towel and his body tethered to a tilted plane .
' Crazy '
Lights then come on and water pours into the man 's nose and mouth , producing convulsions for 15 seconds .
Powers says his aim is to provoke people into thinking about the interrogation technique , which simulates the feeling of drowning and is denounced by human rights groups as a form of torture .
" Robot water - boarding became a way of exploring the issue without doing any harm , " he told The New York Times .
" It 's putting a unique experience on the table .
And it does n't take a great leap of the imagination to look in there and say : ' That 's really what 's going on ?
That 's crazy . ' "
Marion Tracey , 57 , from New Jersey , said she found the installation disturbing and made her think of her father who had nightmares after returning from World War II .
" In all wars , horrible things happen - I 'd rather not see it , " she said .
Alex Soto , 23 , said he thought it was a good thing for people to learn about water - boarding , but added : " It is pretty twisted . "
Powers says he plans to subject himself to water - boarding by a professional trained in interrogation techniques later this month .
The installation will then be moved to Manhattan 's Park Avenue Armoury .
One of the most speculated mysteries by Christians is the location of the Garden of Eden .
The Book of Genesis is the primary source of information with regards to geography , but it contains very little on the garden ’s location .
Considering it was the birthplace of humanity and home to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil , it is no wonder we want to know where it was .
The Biblical scripture below gives some clues .
“ 10 Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden ; and from there it divided and became four rivers .
11 The name of the first is Pishon ; it flows around the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold .
12 The gold of that land is good ; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there .
13 The name of the second river is Gihon ; it flows around the whole land of Cush .
14 The name of the third river is Tigris ; it flows east of Assyria And the fourth river is the Euphrates . ”
There have been a number of claims as to the actual geographic location of the Garden of Eden , though some of these have little or no connection to the text of Genesis .
Most put the Garden somewhere in the Middle East , but this list shows a few more locations you might not have considered .
Let there be a list …
Jackson County , Missouri , USA
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints believe the Garden of Eden to have been located in Jackson County Missouri .
Founder of the Mormon church , Joseph Smith , discovered a stone slab that he claimed was an alter built by Adam after being expelled from the Garden .
The garden itself was located 40 miles south , near present - day city , Independence .
As for its location in the western hemisphere , some Latter - day Saints have presumed the continents were not yet separate before the Great Flood and that this approach would be consistent with the configuration of the super - continent Pangaea .
Mars
The Sky People , by Brinsley LePoer Trench stated the biblical description of the river watering the garden and then parting into four heads is not consistent with rivers in nature .
He wrote that only canals can be made to flow this way .
He then points to Mars as a location for the garden since canals have been theorized to have existed on the red planet .
Brinsley goes on to say The Garden of Eden was on Mars and created by Space People .
Along with Adam and Eve , Noah was also on Mars .
Our descendants were eventually forced to come to Earth .
Lemuria
In the nineteenth century , a theory was developed that a continent , Lumeria , occupied what is now the Indian Ocean
The wide range of the animals inspired the name Lemuria , which was coined in 1864 by the zoologist Philip Sclater in an article “ The Mammals of Madagascar ” in The Quarterly Journal of Science .
Puzzled by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India , but not in Africa nor the Middle East , Sclater proposed that Madagascar and India had once been part of a larger continent .
Other scientists have suggested Lumeria was the cradle of the human race and therefore must have been the site of the garden .
Praslin Island , Seychelles
General Charles Gordon supported the theory that Africa and India were part of the same continent .
During an expedition he found the Praslin Island in the Seychelles group .
He became convinced this was the location of the Garden of Eden , particularly the Valle de Mai .
His reasoning was based on the coco - de-mer , a rare tree , which is only found on one other island of the Seychelles .
Gordon concluded this was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
Sundaland
Another location that has been mentioned is Sundaland in the South China Sea .
In this theory , the current Tigris and Euphrates rivers would not be the ones referred to in the scriptures , but rather later rivers named after two earlier ones , just as colonists often name features of their new land after similar features in their homeland .
This idea also resolves the apparent problem in the theory that the rivers had a common source , which the current rivers lack .
Africa
Some people believe that Garden of Eden was somewhere in Northeast Africa .
Evidence given in support of this includes the fact that the oldest human remains have been found in Africa , and that the Gihon is usually thought to be a name for the Nile .
Israel
Many believe that the Garden must have been in the Holy Land and the original river that flowed into the garden before it split into four separate rivers must have been the Jordan .
The Gihon would be the Nile and the Havilah would be the Arabian Peninsulas .
Eden is also tied with Jerusalem by the prophet Ezekiel .
In Ezekiel 28:13 - 14 , he recorded , “ You were in Eden , the garden of God ; ” … “ You were on the holy mount of God . ”
In most Jewish and Christian traditions , “ the holy mount of God ” is Mt. Moriah , the Temple Mount in Jerusalem ( see Isaiah 2:2 - 2:3 , Psalm 48:1 - 2 e.g. ) .
Northern Iran
Another possibility was proposed by archaeologist David Rohl , based on archaeological evidence , putting the Garden of Eden in northern Iran .
According to him , the Garden was located in a vast plain referred to in ancient Sumerian texts as Edin east of the Sahand Mountain , near Tabriz .
He cites several geological similarities with Biblical descriptions , and multiple linguistic parallels as evidence .
The region today is bound by a large mountain range to the North , East and South , and marshlands to the west .
The eastern mountain region has a pass leading in and out of the Edin region .
This fits with the Biblical geography of Eden containing marshlands to the west , and the Land of Nod to the east , outside the Garden .
Eastern Turkey , Anatolia
Other scholars surmised the Garden of Eden was located in the eastern part of the region known as Eden , and that in Eden , the river divided into four branches : Hiddekel ( also known as Tigris ) , Euphrates , Pishon and Gihon .
While the identity of the first two rivers is commonly accepted , the latter two rivers have been the subject of much debate .
If the Garden of Eden had been near the sources of the Tigris and the Euphrates , then it might be located in eastern Anatolia , specifically the Armenian Highland in eastern Turkey .
Southern Iraq
Some biblical scholars believe the Garden of Eden was located in Sumer where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers merge .
This is now located in present - day Iraq .
They presume that the geographical references in Genesis refer to the time of ninth century BC and the Pishon and Gihon were tributaries of the Euphrates and Tigris that have since vanished .

A senior official from the world ’s fourth - largest oil exporter says crude prices will not hit $ 250 a barrel in the near future .
“ I think there is no real prospect of crude skyrocketing to $ 250 a barrel this year , ” said the Director of International Affairs at the National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) , Hojjatollah Ghanimifard .
“ When experts study oil hikes and declines , they first evaluate which factors should be taken into consideration and whether the processed information spans enough time , ” the Iranian official argued .
“ Figures [ that suggest a surge to $ 250 ] are perhaps predictions with no scientific basis , ” he told Mehr News Agency in a Friday interview .
Oil prices on Thursday surged to an all - time high of over $ 146 a barrel .
Brent peaked at $ 146.69 before falling back to $ 146.08 ; US crude jumped $ 1.72 to $ 145.29 after having hit $ 145.85 .
Chief executive of the Russian energy giant Gazprom Alexei Miller warned on June 10 that oil prices could hit as high as $ 250 a barrel by next year .
“ Today we are witnessing a very great change for hydrocarbons .
The [oil price ] is very high and we think it will reach $ 250 a barrel , ” Miller said .

Lt. -Col. Bob Bowman says citizens must counter corporate influences .
A retired U.S. air force colonel is coming to Vancouver to warn Canadians about the dangers of corporate influences on governments .
Lt. - Col. Bob Bowman , a former Pentagon director of advanced space programs development , told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview that he has been travelling across the U.S. for four and a half months to “ wake people up ” .
“ I ’m endeavouring to get the people in the United States to take back our country and disempower the billionaires and the multinational corporations who are driving our foreign policy , our international - trade policy , and our military policy — and wrapping Canada into it as well , ” Bowman said .
Bowman , who oversaw the Star Wars program during the 1970s , will be speaking tomorrow at 7 p.m. at the Maritime Labour Centre ( 1880 Triumph Street ) .
He said he wants to alert people to Canada ’s role in advancing the agenda of those he labels the “ lunatic fringe ” — U.S. vice president Dick Cheney , former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , ex–Pentagon adviser Richard Perle , and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz .
“ They represent the most dangerous aspect of the global elite , ” Bowman said .
He noted that a Canadian general was second - in - command of all coalition forces early on in the Iraq war .
“ Canadians supply a lot of logistical support for our troops in Iraq , ” Bowman said .
“ In addition , of course , by taking a major role in Afghanistan , the Canadian military has freed up American soldiers to play cannon fodder in Iraq . ”
Bowman , the 74 - year - old national commander of the Patriots , an antifascist group , said Barack Obama would be an improvement on George W. Bush as president .
However , he added that Obama will still likely be controlled by corporate interests .
Bowman noted that former president Bill Clinton , also a Democrat , did the corporations ’ bidding .
One of Obama ’s foreign - policy mentors is Zbigniew Brzezinski , a hawk who was Jimmy Carter ’s national security adviser .
Brzezinski helped arm the mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan so they could tie down the Soviet Red Army in the 1980s ; some critics have claimed this is what gave Osama bin Laden and other Muslim extremists a foothold in the country , leading to the rise of the Taliban .
Bowman predicted that if Obama wins the election in November , Brzezinski will become the national security adviser or the secretary of state .
“ Though he does not want a war with Iran right now and he has a more moderate policy toward the Middle East , he does want to get rid of Russia and China as competitors on the world stage , ” Bowman said .
“ So he ’s going to be playing some dangerous games as well .
What I ’m calling for is for the United States to return to having a government that follows the constitution , honours the truth , and serves the people . ”

CouchSurfing saved my life .
Well , possibly .
No one yet knows what role quality sleep plays in one ’s life , or whether one could die from sleep deprivation .
But if it were n’t for the Couchsurfing .com network , I would be–more or less–homeless .
Since I gleefully waved goodbye to my soggy , moldy tent in mid-July , I ’ve been faced with the dilemma of … well , now where do I sleep ?
For a week or so , I was wearing out my welcome at my friend ’s houses and at my boyfriend ’s place ( whose sleep schedule is around 5 hours off of mine ) .
Realizing that this was causing inordinate stress , both on me and on the parties involved , I knew I had to find a semi-permanent solution .
With no cash and no lease , where would I stay ?
Enter : Couchsurfing .
When I first heard about CouchSurfing , I had the same instant , emotional reaction I had when I heard about Free Ride : the oh , this is way too cool to be true !
feeling .
Of course , as with the other projects that I have blissfully filled my life with , it was true … and so cool I felt compelled to participate .
CouchSurfing is a website that connects travellers who need shelter for a brief stay , with hosts who wish to welcome them .
It is rare that someone will CouchSurf within their own city –yet that was exactly my situation after my grimy tent became more like a prison sentence than a home .
On the first night of staying at my current host ’s home , I was offered a key to the apartment and asked if I minded staying there alone while they went on vacation for two days .
I was dumbstruck .
The instant trust , good will , and sense of welcoming was unlike anything I could have expected .
This is my personal story of how and why CouchSurfing is a brilliant , vital element of sustainable travel .
The short version of CouchSurfing .com ’s mission is : “ Participate in Creating a Better World , One Couch at a Time . ”
This is why CouchSurfing.com has risen heads above other competing internet sites for traveller networking –their mission focuses on the role of intercultural exchange and the impact of world - wide mutual aid and tolerance .
People who gravitate towards these messages of universal humanity and intercultural education gravitate towards CouchSurfing .
If you ’ve never heard of CouchSurfing before , your first reaction may be to think “ it sounds so unsafe ! ”
But CouchSurfing.com has excelled in innovating security measures to protect the parties involved .
In order to grow your “ level of trust ” on the CouchSurfing network , people who have met you or know you face - to - face must “ vouch ” for you .
You must also “ verify ” yourself by confirming your address , credit card information , etc .
These confirming mechanisms provide safety and mutual trust for all involved –the system is operated so that no one could benefit from exploiting one another .
All participants are accountable and credited for their actions , whether negative or positive !
Now imagine … travelling to any city in the world for a life - changing vacation … yet not having to pay a dime for housing .
Say goodbye to hotels and the “ tourist traps ” … and say hello to an authentic interaction with the people and place you are visiting .
Sust Enable strives to present sustainable ideas that are accessible to nearly everyone ( ie , ones that do not cost money . )
CouchSurfing is as free as the birds .
In fact , I can almost gurantee you will gain something from your CouchSurfing experience .
The only thing you may lose … is a sense of cynicism about humanity .
After all , is n’t a welcoming home and an affirmation of the goodness of humankind … priceless ?

NATO Summit Squabbles Europe Waits Out the Bush Administration

The growth of shared Wi-Fi and other wireless computer networks has increased the risk of eavesdropping on Internet communications , but researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have devised a low - cost system that can thwart these " Man - in - the - Middle " ( MitM ) attacks .
The system , called Perspectives , also can protect against attacks related to a recently disclosed software flaw in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , the Internet phone book used to route messages between computers .
The researchers -- David Andersen , assistant professor of computer science , Adrian Perrig , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and public policy , and Dan Wendlandt , a Ph.D. student in computer science -- have incorporated Perspectives into an extension for the popular Mozilla Firefox v3 browser than can be downloaded free of charge .
Perspectives employs a set of friendly sites , or " notaries , " that can aid in authenticating Web sites for financial services , online retailers and other transactions requiring secure communications .
By independently querying the desired target site , the notaries can check whether each is receiving the same authentication information ( a digital certificate ) , in response .
If one or more notaries report authentication information that is different than that received by the browser or other notaries , a computer user would have reason to suspect that an attacker has compromised the connection .
Certificate authorities , such as VeriSign , Comodo and GoDaddy , already help authenticate Web sites and reduce the risk of MitM attacks .
The Perspectives system provides an extra measure of security in those cases but will be especially useful for the growing number of sites that do not use certificate authorities and instead use less expensive " self - signed " certificates .
" When Firefox users click on a Web site that uses a self - signed certificate , they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered , " says Andersen .
Once Perspectives has been installed in the browser , however , it can automatically override the security error page without disturbing the user if the site appears legitimate .
The system also can detect if one of the certificate authorities may have been tricked into authenticating a bogus Web site and warn the Firefox user that the site is suspicious .
" Perspectives provides an additional level of safety to browse the Internet , " Perrig says .
" To the security conscious user , that is a significant comfort . "
Andersen said the increased use of wireless connections to the Internet has increased the risk of MitM attacks .
These occur when an attacker tricks a computer user into believing that the user has established a secure link with a target site , such as a bank .
In actuality , the computer user is communicating with the attacker 's computer , which can eavesdrop as it relays communications between the user and the target site .
" It 's very , very , very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer " when making connections through public Wi -Fi , Andersen says .
A user who thinks he is linked to an airport or coffee shop " hot spot , " for instance , might actually be linked to a laptop of someone just a few seats away .
" A lot of people would n't even know they 've been attacked , " he adds .
Most Internet communications , such as to standard hypertext transfer protocol ( HTTP ) sites , are unsecured , but those involving encryption over a secured socket layer ( SSL ) and those using secure shell ( SSH ) protocol , which involves the use of a login and password , require that sites authenticate themselves with a digital certificate containing a so - called public key , which is used for encryption .
The exchange of this security information typically occurs without the computer user being aware of it .
But when something is n't quite right , a dialogue box such as " Unable to verify the identity of XYZ.com as a trusted site " is displayed by the Web browser .
" Most users do n't have a clue about what to do in those cases , " says Wendlandt .
" A lot of them just shrug and go ahead with the connection , potentially opening themselves up to attack . "
A vulnerability disclosed in July in the DNS software poses a different problem for computer users , but one that also is addressed by Perspectives .
The software flaw could enable an attack against an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) that would cause the ISP to connect users with a malicious site instead of the legitimate site they were seeking .
" With Perspectives , even if a client 's ISP has fallen victim to the attack , the client will be able to detect that the public key received from the fake site is inconsistent with the results returned from the notaries , " according to Wendlandt .
Andersen , Perrig and Wendlandt have launched their own publicly available network of notary sites .
They anticipate that ISPs , universities and large companies will eventually sponsor additional notary sites , in the same way that they voluntarily provide time servers and network diagnosis sites .
Morgan Freeman received an Oscar for Million Dollar Baby in 2005 Oscar - winning actor Morgan Freeman is in " good spirits " after surgery for injuries sustained in a serious car accident near his Mississippi home .
Mr Freeman 's spokeswomen said the surgery to reconnect nerves and repair damage to his left arm and hand lasted four - and - a - half hours .
She said the 71 - year - old Dark Knight star was now looking forward to being discharged " as soon as possible " .
The accident happened shortly before midnight on Sunday .
Mr Freeman 's car ran off the side of the road and overturned several times , landing upright in a ditch .
Mr Freeman , who was driving the car , and a female passenger were airlifted to Memphis 's Regional Medical Center , about 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of where the accident occurred in Tallahatchie County .
" He is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning , " said Mr Freeman 's spokeswoman , Donna Lee .
" He was walking this morning , and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible . "
The actor was initially reported as being in a " serious " condition .
Neither Lee nor the hospital had information about the condition of the woman , Demaris Meter of Memphis .
' No freebies '
Both passengers had been wearing seatbelts at the time of the accident , said Mississippi Highway Patrol Sergeant Ben Williams .

Watching the FDA trip over its own clumsy self while groping for answers on Salmonella is a sad affair .
Following the FDA - encouraged destruction of tens of millions of dollars of perfectly good tomatoes , this confused , bewildered agency admits that tomatoes may not have been the problem after all , and it has now set its sights on destroying the peppers industry .
Is there no vegetable safe from the destruction of the FDA ?
Tomatoes do n't harbor salmonella , by the way .
Neither do peppers , onions , cilantro or spinach .
Salmonella only festers in factory - farmed animals , folks , and that means the real source of contamination is no doubt some animal factory upstream from the vegetable processing centers .
So why is n't the FDA going after the animal factories that likely caused this whole fiasco ?
which would destroy virtually all the medicinal phytonutrients in plants .
As intelligent , informed consumers are now discovering to their own dismay , the FDA appears to be purposely dragging its feet on this food safety crisis , milking the fear for political gain just like President Bush after 9/11 .
Fear is a powerful tactic for pushing an agenda that the People would otherwise refuse to accept , and since most Americans are strongly opposed to food irradiation , the FDA is more than happy to drag out this salmonella issue as a way to make American consumers increasingly afraid of fresh vegetables .
This accomplishes three things the FDA supports :1) It advances the FDA 's pro-irradiation agenda where ALL fresh produce might someday be irradiated without your knowledge .
2 ) It makes consumers buy more processed , dead foods , which produces profits for the very same junk food companies that have strong influence at the FDA.3 )
If food irradiation is put in place , it will destroy the medicinal properties of fresh produce , thereby blocking the prevention of diseases like cancer , heart disease , diabetes , Alzheimer 's disease , etc .
This , in turn , has the effect of creating a windfall of sick people that will fill the coffers of drug companies ( who are , of course , the FDA 's clients ) .
Wait a sec .
Am I saying the FDA would purposely put American lives at risk in order to play politics with food safety ?
Well , gee , if you have n't noticed , the FDA has been putting American lives at risk for well over a decade , pushing dangerous pharmaceuticals that were recalled by other nations , colluding with drug companies to bury negative information about the drugs , outlawing safe , natural alternatives to dangerous pharmaceuticals and even going so far as to threaten its own top scientists who attempt to speak out against dangerous drugs .
Want to know the truth about the FDA ?
Read the shocking facts , if you dare , at www.NaturalNews.com/the_FDA.html
This salmonella scare , you see , is n't about tomatoes , peppers or cilantro .
It 's about creating a state of fear in the minds of consumers -- a state that can be invoked to further the FDA 's pro-irradiation agenda .
These scare stories , in other words , are a lot likein the military , where conflicts are staged against one 's own nation in order to blame the enemy and declare war .
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag
So as it turns out , the FDA is n't fumbling around so much after all .
It only acts like it 's clueless about these salmonella outbreaks in order to prolong the problem , generate more fearful press coverage , and then appear as the hero when it calls for widespread food irradiation .
Do n't be afraid of fresh food , folks .
Be outraged at the FDA 's use of fear as a manipulation tactic to invoke a backlash against fresh food .
Vegetables are not the problem , and food irradiation would make them LESS safe for consumers , not more .

Quote :
I do n't know if Obama 's campaign did n't include it in the copy they sent the Post , or if the Post decided to omit it to cover Obama 's rear end ( although I suspect the latter ) , but if anyone at the Post is interested , the paragraph occurred immediately after the following paragraph :
" And we 'll use technology to connect people to service .
We 'll expand USA Freedom Corps to create an online network where Americans can browse opportunities to volunteer .
You 'll be able to search by category , time commitment , and skill sets ; you 'll be able to rate service opportunities , build service networks , and create your own service pages to track your hours and activities .
This will empower more Americans to craft their own service agenda , and make their own change from the bottom up . "
The paragraph that was omitted is as follows :
" We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we 've set .
We 've got to have a civilian national security force that 's just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded . "
If you wish to verify this for yourself , the FULL SPEECH can be found on YouTube at :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2p6867_pw
The paragraph in question is at about the 16 min point .
Now , I do n't know about you , but I have a problem with a presidential candidate who announces he 's planning to establish " a civilian national security force that 's just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded " as our entire military .
I realize Obama was mentored in his youth by two members of the US Communist Party , but I thought he would wait until elected before he announced he was forming his own KGB .
I 'm also a little curious as to what he plans to do with the FBI , DEA , TSA , Border Patrol , ICE , etc when he forms this " civilian national security force . "
Do you think it might be too much to ask of the Post 's reporters to query him on these plans ?
If not now , then maybe during the DNC Convention next month ?
And please report his answer / evasion / obfuscation someplace prominent in the Post and not buried in the back somewhere .
I 'm sure your readers would appreciate some comprehensive political reporting for a change .
Thanks .
I realize that , as usual , the Post is in the tank for the Democrat candidate , but your lies are getting a little obvious .
Your " Full transcript of Obama 's prepared remarks " article in the 02/07/08 issue , covering Obama 's " Call to Service " speech in Colo .
Springs , was NOT the full transcript !
It was missing a very interesting paragraph outlining a plan of Obama 's that I consider somewhat alarming .
I do n't know if Obama 's campaign did n't include it in the copy they sent the Post , or if the Post decided to omit it to cover Obama 's rear end ( although I suspect the latter ) , but if anyone at the Post is interested , the paragraph occurred immediately after the following paragraph :

CHICAGO  A new TV commercial shows kids eating hot dogs in a school cafeteria and one little boy 's haunting lament : " I was dumbfounded when the doctor told me I have late - stage colon cancer . "
It 's a startling revelation in an ad that vilifies one of America 's most beloved , if maligned , foods , while stoking fears about a dreaded disease .
But the boy does not have cancer .
Neither do two other kids in the ad who claim to be afflicted .
The commercial 's pro-vegetarian sponsors say it's a dramatization that highlights research linking processed meats , including hot dogs , with higher odds of getting colon cancer .
LAY OFF THE LINKS : Sausages , lunch meats also called unsafe
HEALTH BLOG : Digging into the latest cancer studies
But that connection is based on studies of adults , not children , and the increased risk is slight , even if you ate a hot dog a day .
While compelling , it is not conclusive .
So what exactly is the truth about hot dogs ?
The 33 - second ad launched last month in several U.S. cities provides the perfect opportunity to separate fact from fiction about this mysterious yet so familiar meat .
It is to run in September in Chicago and Denver .
The bottom line from several nutritionists familiar with the ad is this :
Hot dogs are not exactly a " health food , " but eating one every now and then probably wo n't hurt you .
" My concern about this campaign is it 's giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk , " said Colleen Doyle , the American Cancer Society 's nutrition director .
" An occasional hot dog is n't going to increase that risk . "
Americans as a whole eat hot dogs more than occasionally .
According to the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council , U.S. consumers spent more than $ 4 billion on hot dogs and sausages last year .
That includes more than 1.5 billion pounds ( 680 million kilograms ) of hot dogs and sausages bought at retail stores alone .
The health concerns primarily come from their high fat and salt content and sodium nitrate and nitrite , commonly added preservatives and color - enhancers .
Nitrate - related substances have been reported to cause cancer in animals , but there is no proof they do that in people .
Hot dogs typically contain muscle meat trimmings from pork or beef .
Contrary to legend , they do not contain animal eyeballs , hooves or genitals , according to the Hot Dog Council 's Janet Riley .
But the government does allow them to contain pig snouts and stomachs , cow lips and livers , goat gullets and lamb spleens .
If they have these byproducts , the label should spell out which ones , a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman said .
Some also are made with leaner meats , including turkey , as well as tofu or soy protein .
Check the label of a name - brand hot dog , and chances are fat provides around 80 % of total calories , more than double what 's often advised .
What 's more , saturated fat and trans fat — the fats most strongly linked with artery - clogging — are common ingredients , in some cases providing at least half the fat content .
The hot dog council called the new ad an alarmist scare tactic , but the promoters , a group called The Cancer Project , defend their campaign .
Dr. Neal Barnard , president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , called the ad " a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern . "
Barnard also heads
The Cancer Project , an offshoot of his anti-meat advocacy group .
Hot dogs may be considered as American as apple pie , but Barnard said it 's time to change that tradition .
" Children are born with no traditions whatsoever , " he said .
" You or I might think a hot dog , that just goes with baseball ...
We can always change our traditions to be healthful . "
The new ad is based on an analysis of five studies in adults by scientists working with cancer research groups not affiliated with Barnard's .
Their report last November said eating 50 grams a day of processed meats for several years increases colorectal cancer risk by 21 % .
That equals about one hot dog a day or two deli slices of bologna or five slices of bacon .
The duration of daily consumption linked with that higher risk is uncertain .
Colorectal cancer was diagnosed between three and 19 years after the studies began , but participants could have been eating processed meats for years before that , said dietitian Karen Collins , nutrition adviser with the American Institute for Cancer Research , a group that analyzed the studies .
For a U.S. adult , eating one hot dog daily for several years would increase the average risk of getting colorectal cancer , which is 5 % , to 7 % .
On a population level , it would increase the number of people nationwide who get colorectal cancer each year from 50 per 100,000 people to 60 per 100,000 , Collins said .
" It 's not the kind of impact on risk that , say , tobacco smoking has on lung cancer .
But on the other hand , colon cancer is one of our most common cancers , so small changes still affect a lot of people , " Collins said .
She said the level of risk is smaller for eating a hot dog once or twice a month but that it can't be precisely quantified .
It would not mean up to a 1.4 % increase in colon cancer risk , as she had indicated .
" The risk we get from things like lack of physical activity , excess body weight , lack of adequate vegetables and fruits , these are much more important to work on . "
Scientists who analyzed the studies recommend avoiding processed meat — advice that makes sense , said Lilian Cheung , of the nutrition department at Harvard 's School of Public Health .
Cheung is not connected to Barnard 's group , but called its campaign " a good spark plug " to improve school foods and raise awareness .
The ad is part of a campaign to improve foods in schools and get the government to stop providing processed meats .
The government provides some , such as ham and processed turkey .
However hot dogs , pepperoni pizza , bacon and other popular processed meats are bought from local vendors , not the federal government , according to the USDA .
Cancer Project promoters want all processed meats off school menus .
They recently issued a report analyzing menus from one month last spring at 28 large school districts .
Half got failing grades for serving too much processed meat .

Did you know ?
All cats are born blind .
The ability to see comes during the first couple of weeks after birth !
Cats have rudimentary non-functional collar bones that allow them to squeeze themselves through tight spaces and help them in their balance and stride !
Cats often have a third eyelid that is not normally visible to us .
If you are seeing it more often - the cat may be ill !
Feline vision is similar to that of humans in daylight .
However , cats can see six times better than us in dim light - owing to larger pupils and the ability to gather light at the back of the eye due to a reflective retinal surface !
Field of vision in cats is slightly compromised for a more binocular vision .
This grants cats greater depth perception and also allows them to judge their prey 's position more precisely for making an attack in high speed pursuits !
Cats ' sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than ours - this means they can smell the odour in the litter box much earlier than us !
Cats have an acute hearing ability as well .
They are able to hear sounds of a quite high pitch .
Thirty two individual muscles in their ears allow them to pinpoint the exact location of a source of sound !
The individual positioning of whiskers is unique to all cats .
Whiskers are like finger prints .
They allow cats to feel their way in extreme dark and since their span , when fully erect , is nearly equal to a cat 's body width - it allows the felid to judge whether a space or passage is too narrow for it .
Whiskers are also usually indicative of a cat 's temperament .
Erect , forward pointing whiskers indicate that the cat is excited and animated .
Whereas laid back whiskers are often seen in resting , defensive animals .
Cats have sharp pointed teeth that are built for killing prey by crushing of windpipe or severing of spine .
A cat 's teeth are its greatest assets in the wild .
In proportion to body size , the elusive Clouded Leopard has the longest canines in the family felidae , whereas the Jaguar has the strongest jaws - it can bite through the shell of a turtle !
Cats have more spines than us since they also have spines in their tail .
Next time you see a kid pulling a cat 's tail - stop him - since it hurts .
Their vertebrae are also more loosely connected to each other than ours , allowing them great flexibility !
Flexibility of the spine is highlighted in the Cheetah - the fastest land mammal .
With big adrenals , flexible spine and a rudder - like tail , Cheetahs can outpace everything on the African savanna !
Tiger is the largest feline on earth .
An adult Siberian tiger may weigh up to eight hundred pounds and is one of the top predators on earth .
Tigers are excellent swimmers and are in fact the only big cats who seem to enjoy stepping in water ( the Jaguar in Americas frequently goes into water to hunt baby alligators and anacondas ) !
Lion is the only cat that lives in groups , called prides .
Family life gives lions edge over other felids as they cooperate in hunting and rearing of their young !
Leopards are highly secretive and are perhaps the best tree climbers and individual hunters amongst big cats .
Black leopards are called black panthers !
Lieberman praises pastor repudiated by McCain RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 23 , 2008
Print This Email This One of John McCain 's most prominent supporters on Tuesday praised an evangelical leader whom the Republican presidential candidate repudiated after a string of controversial remarks were made public .
Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , an independent who frequently campaigns with McCain , said pastor John Hagee 's support for Israel outweighed the remarks that led McCain to reject his endorsement .
Lieberman said he had been urged not to speak to Hagee 's group , Christians United for Israel .
" The bond that I feel with Pastor Hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that , and so I am proud to stand with you tonight , " Lieberman told several thousand members of the group , which urges U.S. support for Israel .
" I do n't agree with everything that Pastor Hagee 's done and said ... but there is so much more important than that that we agree on , " Lieberman said .
McCain , in an effort to reach out to evangelicals who are among the most loyal Republican voters , accepted Hagee 's endorsement in March but rejected him in May after learning that the Texas preacher once said that God allowed the Holocaust to happen because it led to the creation of Israel .
McCain addressed Christians United for Israel last year .
His campaign declined to comment .
Hagee , who heads the 19,000 - member Cornerstone Church in San Antonio , also was criticized for calling the Catholic Church " the Great Whore " and saying that God punished New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina for staging a gay - rights parade .
He has since apologized to Catholics .
Hagee said the spotlight had been unsettling and condemned what he said was misleading media coverage .
" What will I say when I 'm asked to endorse a presidential candidate ?
Never again , " he told the cheering crowd , which waved American and Israeli flags .
Think Progress caught the following from the Christians United for Israel event :
In response to what he termed the " pretty aggressive campaign , " Lieberman said in his speech , " The bond I feel with Pastor John Hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that and so I am proud to stand with you here tonight . "
Lieberman again drew a parallel between Hagee and biblical figures , this time saying biblical heroes , unlike the demigods of Greek mythology , " are humans  great humans , but with human failings . "
Lieberman said that Moses had his shortcomings , too .
" Dear friends , I can only imagine what the bloggers of today would have had to say about Moses and Miriam . "
Hagee has written that events in the Middle East point to an imminent apocalypse Christians should welcome , and in several books envisions a climactic battle in Israel leading to the second coming of Jesus .
Christians United for Israel takes an uncompromising stance toward Israel 's enemies and opposes giving land to the Palestinians .
Hagee said that it was up to Israelis to reach their own peace terms , and said the group was not trying to bring about a biblical apocalypse in the Middle East .
" We do n't believe that we can speed up the End of Days one second because we believe that God has shown that he will set the time , " Hagee said .
A organization supporting a negotiated peace in the Middle East , J Street , said it had delivered a 40,000 - signature petition to Lieberman 's office urging him not to speak to Hagee 's group .

ORLANDO , Fla .
-- PGA
Tour player Tripp Isenhour was charged with killing a hawk on purpose with a golf shot because it was making noise as he videotaped a TV show .
Isenhour was with a film crew for " Shoot Like A Pro " on Dec. 12 at the Grand Cypress Golf course .
The 39 - year - old player , whose real name is John Henry Isenhour III , was charged Wednesday with cruelty to animals and killing a migratory bird .
The charges carry a maximum penalty of 14 months in jail and $ 1,500 in fines .
Isenhour apologized in a statement and said he was only trying to scare the hawk away .
According to court documents , Isenhour got upset when a red - shouldered hawk began making noise , forcing another take .
He began hitting balls at the bird , then 300 yards away , but gave up .
Isenhour started again when the hawk moved within about 75 yards , Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer Brian Baine indicated in a report .
Isenhour allegedly said " I 'll get him now , " and aimed for the hawk .
" About the sixth ball came very near the bird 's head , and [ Isenhour ] was very excited that it was so close , " Baine wrote .
A few shots later , witnesses said he hit the hawk .
The bird , protected as a migratory species , fell to the ground bleeding from both nostrils .
" As soon as this happened , I was mortified and extremely upset and continue to be upset , " Isenhour said in a statement issued through his management company , SFX Golf .
" I want to let everyone know there was neither any malice nor deliberate intent whatsoever to hit or harm the hawk .
I was trying to simply scare it into flying away . "
Isenhour said his family has adopted three cats from a local shelter .
" I am an animal lover , " he said .
" We ask that everyone accept my sincerest apology , and please be respectful of my family 's privacy . "
Humane Society executive vice president Michael Markarian said Isenhour should face charges .
" Americans have no tolerance for cruelty to animals .
Such a petty , mean - spirited act against a wild bird is inexcusable and prosecutors are right to hold Isenhour accountable to the law , " he said in a statement released Thursday .
Isenhour has spent two full years on the PGA Tour , both times failing to keep his card .
He has won four times on the Nationwide Tour , including twice in 2006 .
" He just kept saying how he did n't think he could have hit it , which I think is a stupid thing for a PGA Tour golfer to say , " said Jethro Senger , a sound engineer at the shoot .
" He can put a ball in a hole from hundreds of yards away , and here he is hitting line drives at something that 's , I do n't know , a couple hundred feet away ? "
Senger said it was " basically like a joke to [ Isenhour ] . "
He said no one in the roughly 15 - person crew intervened , and many later regretted it .
" It was one of those cases where there 's some trepidation on whether or not they should speak up and do something , " Senger said .
Senger said the killing was not captured on video .
The bird was buried at the golf course and later dug up by Florida investigators .
The thrust of the news between now and Christmas is something I already know .
It may be a good time to talk some “ philosophy of science ” .
We learn in high school science classes that ...
Oil prices are plunging and the stocks in your 401 ( k ) retirement account are rebounding .
Time to fire up the SUV , head to the mall and whip out that credit card ?
That ’s what automakers , retailers , restaurateurs and other industries dependent on consumers are hoping , of course .
They need this economic malaise to blow over quickly , and that will require Americans to get back into a good mood and open their wallets again .
But there is a school of thought out there that says many people have been permanently changed by the economic blows the nation has suffered over the last year -- the unprecedented quadruple whammy of the dive in home prices , tumbling stock values , soaring energy and food prices , and the credit crunch .

We ’ve all been warned for years to spend less and save more .
Maybe we ’re taking that to heart now .
That ’s the view of David Rosenberg , a veteran economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .
He has a dour outlook for U.S. economic growth in large part because he thinks Americans have gotten religion about their personal finances .
For many consumers , Rosenberg says , “ frugality is now replacing frivolity . ”
That ’s evident , he said , in looking at the trends in Americans ’ personal spending in the last three quarters , as detailed in the government ’s data on gross domestic product .

Excluding outlays for three key necessities -- medical care , food and utilities -- real consumer spending shrank at a 0.3 % annual rate in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of ’ 08 , Rosenberg noted in a report this week .
In the second quarter , he said , that same gauge of consumer spending grew at an anemic 0.8 % annual rate -- despite the federal tax rebates to about 100 million families .
In fact , many people saved that rebate money instead of spending it , at least by the government ’s calculations , which subtract personal outlays from personal disposable income .
The savings rate derived from that data jumped from a mere 0.3 % of income in the first quarter to a six - year high of 2.6 % in the second quarter .
But what ’s to stop that money from ending up in some retailer ’s cash register in the current quarter ?

Rosenberg is betting that a large number of Americans have been frightened enough by what they ’ve seen unfold in the economy this year to keep them from sliding back into spendthrift mode .
What ’s more , he notes , a crucial factor that supported the spending wave of the last 20 years was the ability to borrow with abandon .
Those days are over , as banks , brokerages , auto companies and other lenders cut back on credit .
That shift “ is only starting to sink in to the general public , ” Rosenberg asserts .
Rather than borrow more , many people will be forced to pay down their debts , he said .
That , too , will divert money from spending .
One other point he makes , and maybe the most important :
For the 78 million baby boomers , retirement no longer is a far - off concept but an approaching reality .
And with home prices sinking in many regions of the nation , the original retirement plan for a huge number of boomers -- selling the McMansion at a big profit -- wo n’t cut it , Rosenberg says .
Advertisement
“ This , in turn , means that we are all collectively going to be relying less on assets and more on good old - fashioned wage and salary income for future savings , ” he said .
Rosenberg ’s case for a new national frugality sounds logical enough .
But we ’re talking about us , here -- the world ’s most devoted consumers .
For 25 years , it has been a consistently bad bet to count on Americans ’ keeping their pocketbooks sealed for very long .
Edward Yardeni , another veteran economist and head of Yardeni Research in Great Neck , N.Y. , says the era of McMansions and SUVs may well be over .
But he thinks it ’s a mistake to extrapolate those consumption shifts into a widespread frugality .
Advertisement
Spending is a function of income , Yardeni notes .
If people are earning money , they ’ll tend to spend most of it .
If employment does n’t collapse , and incomes keep rising , it ’s hard to fathom a sustained pullback in spending , he said .
And because U.S. workers ’ productivity keeps advancing -- it grew at a 2.2 % annualized rate last quarter , government data show -- that ’s keeping American companies competitive and , in theory , less likely to have to drastically pare payrolls in a tough economy .
But there ’s another , more practical reason to doubt that Americans will seek to substantially boost their savings at the expense of spending , Yardeni says :
Many people who know they ’re already far behind in building a nest egg for retirement are going to realize that catching up would be impossible , anyway .
“ There ’s just no way you can really save out of the median income in this country and retire comfortably , ” he said .
Advertisement
If you ca n’t possibly save enough , and your home wo n’t produce a windfall , there ’s only one answer , Yardeni said : working longer .
That ’s what millions were planning to do , anyway , he figures .
Of course , it ’s easy to say at age 52 that you ’ll work until you ’re 70 .
But what if your health wo n’t allow it ?
Or you just ca n’t find a job ?
That ’s the potential time bomb ahead if the New Frugality is a myth :
The people who do save are likely to have to pay dearly for those who do n’t .

According to a report in The Washington Post , you might want to leave your laptop , Nintendo DS , Sony PSP and even your iPod at home before travelling to the USA .
The report states that Homeland Security measures in the War on Terror mean that , " any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form , " including hard drives , flash drives , cellphones , iPods , pagers , beepers , and video and audio tapes ... can be retained and examined ... for a reasonable period of time to review and analyze information .
"
In a slab of bureaucratic waffle that makes most game company CorproBollox seem crystal clear , such seizures can happen , " absent individualized suspicion " - e.g. without any grounds to think you might be planning terrorist action .
The US government responded via Customs Deputy Commissioner Jayson P

The Shuttle X27 PC shown to scale .
Credit : Shuttle .
Shuttle , the Taiwan - based computer manufacturer , has been known for making small computers , but its newest PC will be its tiniest and greenest yet .
Called the X27 , the mini PC will run on Intel´s low - power Atom processor .
When in use , the computer uses 36 watts of power , and just 23 watts while in idling mode .
Even when running at full speed , Shuttle claims the computer´s noise level reaches just 23 decibels , similar to a very small fan .
Although it varies , most desktop PCs use between 70 and 100 watts , but some can eat up to 250 watts ( not including the monitor ) .
Laptops consume considerably less , anywhere from 15 to 45 watts .
So the X27 would be comparable to a typical laptop in terms of energy usage , and could cut a desktop user´s power bill in half .
At 10 inches long , 7 inches wide , and 2.75 inches tall , the X27 is also significantly smaller than most other PCs .
It ´s about the same size as Asus´ Atom - based Eee Box ( which sells for $ 350 ) .
As a so - called " Nettop " ( low - cost desktop ) , the X27 will likely compete with tiny computers such as the Eee Box and Dell´s Studio Hybrid , which uses Intel´s Core2 Duo processor .
Specific features of the X27 include an Intel 945GC chipset , Intel GMA 950 onboard video , 4 USB 2.0 ports , a gigabit Ethernet port , and analog 5.1 - channel audio .
Shuttle plans to launch the X27 in the US in mid-September , and will likely release it in the UK , although it´s not confirmed .
The company has not announced pricing .
The X27 will also be on display at the IFA consumer electronics show , which starts on August 29 in Berlin .

Land mines are controversial because they remain dangerous after the conflict in which they were deployed , killing and injuring civilians and rendering land impassable and unusable for decades .
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has sought to prohibit their use , culminating in the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction , known informally as the Ottawa Treaty .
The UN estimates that with current technology , it will take nearly 1,100 years to clear all the mines in the world .
10 Somalia
Landmine Count : 1 million
The mine problem in Somalia is a result of various internal and regional conflicts over an almost 40 - year period , with the first reported occurrence of mine - laying in 1964 .
Central and southern Somalia are heavily contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) .
The UN claims that the socioeconomic impact of landmines can be seen in almost every aspect of Somali society : reduced land available for livestock and agricultural production , increased transportation costs , poor performance of rehabilitation and development efforts , loss of life , disabilities , a general lack of security of communities , and obstacles to repatriation and reintegration .
Casualties continue to be reported from mines and UXO .
The UN also believes , however , that the mine and UXO threat in Somalia is “ a finite problem ” and one that “ given sustained attention , ” can be solved in a seven- to ten - year period with adequate resources .
Somalia cannot accede to the Mine Ban Treaty because it has been without a central government since the 1991 fall of the government of Siyad Barre .
9 Mozambique
Landmine Count : 3 million
After almost thirty years of war , Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in Africa .
Grain must be imported and the economy depends heavily on foreign aid .
Mozambique is faced with desertification , pollution of surface and coastal waters , and severe drought and floods in the central and southern provinces .
In addition , much of its farmable land is unusable because of landmines .
“ Perhaps the most devastating use of land mines was the random dissection of mines in fields and along access paths to stop peasants from producing food , ” notes Human Rights Watch Africa in a report entitled “ Land Mines and Economic Life ” .
Mines manufactured in 15 different countries were used by all sides in the fighting , accelerating a devastating famine cycle in the 1980s that sent a huge refugee exodus across the borders with South Africa , Zambia , Tanzania and Malawi .
According to Handicap International , an estimated 20 people step on landmines every month in Mozambique .
Sixty percent of them die because they lack access to health services .
In 1996 , Mozambique ’s Defense Minister estimated that there were still about 3 million landmines in Mozambique .
The devastation caused by mines in Mozambique is striking .
In addition to farmable land , power lines , roads , bridges , railroads , and airports , even schools , factories and cattle dip tanks were mined .
Wildlife is also threatened by mines : elephants have been found maimed by anti-personnel mines and killed by anti-tank mines .
The average life expectancy in Mozambique is about 46 years .
8 Bosnia -Herzegovina
Landmine Count : 3 million
Bosnia - Herzegovina is heavily contaminated with landmines and explosive remnants of war , primarily as a result of the 1992-1995 conflict related to the break - up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
The mine contamination is generally low density .
Mines were used extensively along confrontation lines , which moved frequently .
Most minefields are in the zone of separation between the two entities ; this is 1,100 kilometers long and up to four kilometers wide .
In southern and central Bosnia - Herzegovina , mines were often used randomly , with little record keeping .
Some of the affected territory is mountainous or heavily forested , but the fertile agricultural belt in Br? ko District is one of the most heavily contaminated areas .
Every month landmines kill or injure 30 - 35 people , 80 % of them civilians .
The presence of these deadly weapons is hindering reconstruction , severely reducing food production and diverting resources needed to rebuild society .
So far , only a small percentage of mine - contaminated land has been cleared according to humanitarian standards .
Most minefields remain unmarked .
7 Kuwait
Landmine Count : 5 million
Kuwait ’s history has been filled with stress due to the vast amount of oil found throughout the country .
During the Gulf War , Iraq occupied Kuwait from August 1990 until February 1991 .
The Iraqi troops planted millions of AP and AT mines in the “ Kuwait Theater of Military Operations . ”
Approximately 97.8 percent of Kuwait ’s land became mined or UXO affected .
Heavily mined areas were the northern cost of Kuwait Bay and the Kuwait - Saudi Arabia border .
Immediately after Kuwait ’s liberation , the government planned for an integrated mine action program .
The duration was 24 months and cost $ 128 million ( U.S. ) .
According to the Landmine Monitor Report , as of April 3 , 1999 , almost 2 million landmines had been recovered from coastal and desert areas of Kuwait .
A mine awareness program was also established to inform civilians about the dangers of landmines .
6 Cambodia
Landmine Count : 8 - 10 million
Three decades of war in Cambodia have left scars in many forms throughout the country .
Unfortunately , one of the most lasting legacies of the conflicts continues to claim new victims daily .
Land mines , laid by the Khmer Rouge , the Heng Samrin and Hun Sen regimes , the Vietnamese , the KPNLF , and the Sihanoukists litter the countryside .
In most cases , even the soldiers who planted the mines did not record where they were placed .
Now , Cambodia has the one of the highest rates of physical disability of any country in the world .
While census data for Cambodia is sketchy , it is generally accepted that more than 40,000 Cambodians have suffered amputations as a result of mine injuries since 1979 .
That represents an average of nearly forty victims a week for a period of twenty years .
While it is believed that no military groups are still deploying mines , the devices are still being used in new and horrible ways :
Civilians have used mines to protect property and settle disputes ; poachers are reportedly using mines to hunt tigers , which are prized for use in medicines in neighboring Vietnam ; and in once incident in 1998 , police surrounded a forest with mines in order to capture a murder suspect who had hidden there .
He emerged from the forest and stepped on a mine , and was then shot to death by police .
At the current rate of progress , it may take as many as 100 years to clear all the mines in Cambodia .
5 Iraq
Landmine Count : 10 million
Iraq is severely affected by mines and unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) as a result of the 1991 Gulf War , the 1980 - 1988 Iraq - Iran War , two decades of internal conflict , and even World War Two .
Landmines and UXO pose a problem in the north , along the Iran - Iraq border , and throughout the central and southern regions of the country .
The number of mines planted in Iraq is not known , but it is estimated by the United Nations to be at least 10 million .
A recently completed Landmine Impact Survey confirmed that all twenty - five districts in the three provinces ( governorates ) comprising northern Iraq are mine - affected , and 3,444 distinct areas suspected of mine and / or UXO contamination affect over 148,000 families ( more than one in five ) living in 1,096 mine - affected communities .
4 Afghanistan
Landmine Count : 10 million
Afghanistan has suffered greatly from war since 1978 , and all sides to the various armed conflicts have used antipersonnel mines , particularly Soviet forces and the Afghan government from 1979 to 1992 .
Landmines have been planted indiscriminately over most of the country .
Agricultural farms , grazing areas , irrigation canals , residential areas , roads and footpaths , both in urban and rural areas , are contaminated .
Mines are a major obstacle to repatriation , relief , rehabilitation and development activities .
Landmines kill or maim an estimated ten to twelve people each day in Afghanistan .
It is believed that almost 50 percent of landmine victims die due to lack of medical facilities .
3 Angola
Landmine Count : 10 to 20 million
Estimates of the number of Angolan landmines range between 10 and 20 million , which equates to at least 1 to 2 land mines for every person in the country .
U.N. estimates put the number of Angolan amputees resulting from the silent killers at 70,000 .
For three decades mines were scattered in Angola ’s fields , villages , roads , and other unexpected places to intimidate , maim and kill innocent victims .
Land mines have a devastating effect upon the environment by restricting the movement of people , deterring farming , disrupting economies , and killing and mutilating many innocent men , women , and children .
In 1993 a UN General Resolution moratorium on the sale and export of antipersonnel land mines was passed .
However , international consensus has yet to be achieved and Angola ’s problem continues unabated .
2 Iran
Landmine Count : 16 million
Landmine and unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) contamination in west and southwest Iran , particularly the provinces of Kurdistan , Western Azerbaijan , Khuzestan , and Kermanshah , results from the 1980 - 1988 Iran - Iraq conflict .
Government officials claim that Iraq planted some 16 million landmines in Iran during the 1980s , contaminating an area of over 42,000 square kilometers .
Landmines and UXO are reported to have severely limited agricultural production in the five provinces along the Iraqi border .
They also compromise exploitation of oil fields .
Mine and UXO contamination has affected historical sites and hindered archeological studies in southwest Iran .
1 Egypt
Landmine Count : 23 million
World War II and the Egypt - Israel wars of 1956 , 1967 , and 1973 have left Egypt a mine - affected country .
Egypt often cites a figure of 23 million landmines buried in the country .
Egypt ’s problem stems from the fact that its land mines are old and hard to locate and were designed for use against tanks , whereas international criticism is generally focused on anti-personnel mines .
According to the ministry of defense , mines have hampered human and economic development and have killed and injured thousands of civilians .
Seven million mines have been cleared from the western desert in the past 15 years and three million from the Sinai desert .
The nomadic people refer to waste tracts of desert minefields as “ The Devil ’s Garden . ”

Resolution to be read by Clerk of House
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) will formally introduce another article of impeachment against President Bush Tuesday as House leaders indicate they ’re willing to convene a hearing to consider the Ohio Democrat ’s arguments .
Kucinich will move for a vote on a privileged resolution Tuesday , which likely will result in the impeachment article being referred to the Judiciary Committee .
The lawmaker warned he would keep coming back with the resolution if the House voted to dismiss it .
The House Clerk will read the resolution into the record Tuesday before the vote by the full House .
“ If it is tabled , I will bring another impeachment resolution back this week , ” said Kucinich .
“ Our Constitution is being destroyed .
We are losing our nation to a war based on lies .
I am determined to get this bill to committee for a hearing , ” he said .
“ The President has conducted the affairs of the nation in a manner which cries out for justice and it is the Constitutional obligation of Congress to check his wanton abuses of U.S. and international law .
We have troops whose lives were put on the line because the President told them Iraq was a threat to the United States and it was not .
The loss of lives of our troops and of innocent Iraqi civilians is a direct result of the lies this president told to Congress .
He must be held accountable . ”
Earlier this week , Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said he would let Kucinich discuss his arguments for impeachment during a hearing later this summer , but he indicated the committee likely would not act on impeachment .
“ We ’re not doing impeachment , but he can talk about it , ”  the chairman said .
The Article of Impeachment alleges that President Bush falsely told the nation that it had no other choice to go to war because Iraq was an imminent threat in possession of weapons of mass destruction , and that the President had repeatedly implied that Iraq had abetted al Qaeda in its devastating attack of 9/11 .
Kucinich , in his Article , cited documents which assert the White House knew the statements were false at the time they were made .

My latest Internet Computing column , “ Convenience Over Correctness , ” ( PDF ) is now available .
It continues the exploration of problems with RPC - oriented distributed programming approaches that I ’ve been writing about in each of my three prior columns this year , as well as in columns from years gone by and in the erlang - questions mailing list .
For years we ’ve known RPC and its descendants to be fundamentally flawed , yet many still willingly use the approach .
Why ?
I believe the reason is simply convenience .
Regardless of RPC ’s well - understood problems , many developers continue to go down the RPC - oriented path because it conveniently fits the abstractions of the popular general - purpose programming languages they limit themselves to using .
Making a function or method call to a remote or distributed function , object , or service appear just like any other function or method call allows such developers to stay within the comfortable confines of their language .
Those who choose this approach essentially decide that developer convenience and comfort is more important than dealing with hard distribution issues like latency , concurrency , reliability , scalability , and partial failure .
Is this convenience for the developer the right thing to focus on ?
I really , really do n’t think it is .
There are ways of developing robust distributed applications that do n’t require code - generation toolkits , piles of special code annotations , or brittle enterprisey frameworks .
Perhaps the wonderful programming language renaissance we ’re currently experiencing will help us to finally see the light and put tired old broken abstractions like RPC permanently out to pasture .
Similar to the CSS Adjacent Sibling Combinator that I wrote about before , the indirect adjacent combinator is pretty nifty and supported by IE7 + , FF2 + , Opera 9.5+ , Safari 3 + , and even Konqueror .
It is actually part of the CSS3 spec but it ’s surprisingly well supported .
Here ’s how to use it and what it does :
Using the CSS Indirect Adjacent Combinator
h3 ~ p { color : #FFFFFF ; padding - left : 20 px ; border - left : 3 px solid ; }
This would affect each < p > element that is a sibling of a preceding < h3 > element .
This is different from the Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+ ) in that it affects all following < p > siblings instead of just the immediate sibling .
Let us see an example :
CSS Indirect Adjacent example
Example 1 : Adjacent Sibling combinator ( h4 + p ) test :
Heading 4 Paragraph 1 - This should be bold and red Paragraph 2 - This should NOT be red
Example 2 : Indirect Adjacent Sibling combinator ( h4 ~ p ) test :
Heading 4 Paragraph 1 - This should be bold and red Paragraph 2 - This should also be bold and red !!
Here is the CSS for the above example :
. adjacent h4 + p , .indirect-adjacent h4 ~ p { background - color : #CCC ; color : # F00 ; }
Cool , right ?
So you see how you can use this instead of the (+ ) selector to apply styles to the elements you want in basically everything except IE6 -!
This is a good example of something used for progressive enhancement that should be used to add detail to elements to give your users more information .
Update : Sorry for the name confusion .
The latest draft of the CSS3 spec calls this the “ General Sibling Combinator ” and I did n’t think it had changed from “ Indirect Adjacent Combinator ” when I first learned of it so I used the latter .
My apologies !
Have you ever used this ?
What was your experience and what ideas do you have for this CSS gem ?
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
In his frivolous Paris and Britney ad , Sen. John McCain has asked the right question : Is Barack Obama ready to lead this country ?
Since last January , Sen .
Obama 's fitness for the presidency has been the only question that matters in American politics .
The pollsters and pundits agree that if Obama can show the voters that he 's up to the job , he 'll win .
If not , he wo n't .
But that begs another question : Is McCain fit to lead America ?
That question has n't been asked , nor has it been answered .
The assumption seems to be that McCain 's years of experience in the military and in Congress of course give him the background and tools he'd need in the White House .
As Britney might say , " Duh !
For sure he 's qualified !!!
He 's Mac ! !! "
But is that true ?
Does McCain have the right stuff ?
A careful look at McCain 's biography shows that he is n't prepared for the job .
His resume is much thinner than most people think .
Here are some reasons why McCain would be a mediocre president .
Lack of accomplishments
Like the current occupant of the White House , McCain got his first career breaks from the connections and money of his family , not from hard work .
The son and grandson of Navy admirals , he attended Annapolis where he did poorly .
Nevertheless , he was commissioned as a pilot , where he performed poorly , crashing three planes before he failed to evade a North Vietnamese missile that destroyed his plane .
McCain spent more than five years in a prison camp .
After his release , McCain knew his weak military record meant he'd never make admiral , so he turned his sights to a career in politics .
With the help of his new wife 's wealth , his new father - in - law 's business connections and some powerful friends had made as a lobbyist for the Navy , he was elected in 1982 to a Congress in a district that he did n't reside in until the day the seat opened up .
A few years later , he succeeded Barry Goldwater as a senator .
McCain has n't accomplished much in the Senate .
Even his own campaign does n't trumpet his successes , probably because the few victories he 's had still rankle Republicans .
His campaign finance law failed to significantly reduce the role of money in politics .
He failed to get a big tobacco bill through the Senate .
He 's failed to change the way Congress spends money ; his bill to give the president a line - item veto was declared unconstitutional , and the system of pork and earmarks continues unabated .
He failed to reform the immigration system .
Every senator who runs for president misses votes back in Washington , so it's no surprise that McCain and all the others who ran in the primaries have missed a lot of votes in the past year .
But between the beginning of 2005 and mid-2007 , no senator missed more roll - call votes than McCain did , except Tim Johnson , who was recovering from a near - fatal brain aneurysm .
Shallow
McCain says he does n't understand the economy .
He 's demonstrated that he does n't understand the workings of Social Security , or the political history of the Middle East .
He does n't know who our enemies are .
He says he wants to reduce global warming , but then proposes ideas that would stimulate -- not reduce -- demand for fossil fuels .
McCain has done one thing well -- self promotion .
Instead of working on legislation or boning up on the issues , he 's been on " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart " more than any other guest .
He 's been on the Sunday talk shows more than any other guest in the past 10 years .
He 's hosted " Saturday Night Live " and even announced his candidacy in 2007 on " The Late Show with David Letterman . "
McCain has not articulated any lofty goals .
So far , his campaign theme has mostly been " McCain : He 's None of the Above . "
In the primaries , he campaigned on " I 'm not that robotic businessman , I 'm not that sanctimonious hick , I 'm not that crazy libertarian , I 'm not that washed - up actor , I 'm not that delusional 9/11 guy . "
In the general election , he 's emphasized that he 's not that treasonous dreamer .
No leadership
McCain has frequently taken on near - impossible missions that go against the grain of his party .
It 's the basis of his reputation as a maverick .
But McCain has never been able to bring more than a handful of Republicans along with him on issues such as campaign finance reform or immigration .
Democrats on the Hill have accepted McCain 's help on some issues , but except for a few exceptions ( John Kerry and Joe Lieberman ) , they 've never warmed to him .
To achieve anything as president , McCain would have to win over two hostile parties : The Democrats and the Republicans .
Living in the Sixties
McCain is still fighting the Vietnam War .
But he 's not fighting the real historic war , which taught us the folly of injecting ourselves into a civil war that was none of our business .
We learned that , in a world where even peasants have guns , explosives and radios , a determined and popular guerrilla force can defeat a modern army equipped with the mightiest technology if that army has no vital national interest to protect .
Instead , McCain is fighting an imaginary Vietnam War , where a sure victory could have been achieved with just a little more bombing , just a little more " pacification , " just a little more will to win at home .
This fantasy clouds McCain 's judgment on foreign policy .
Most of the other high - profile politicians who fought in Vietnam -- Colin Powell , Chuck Hegel , John Kerry , and Jim Webb -- are n't stuck in the past , and they do n't view the Iraq War as a chance to get Vietnam right .
No principles
After years of honing a reputation as a guy who'll say the truth regardless of the political consequences , McCain has crashed the Straight Talk Express .
On almost every issue where he took a principled stand against the Republican line -- taxes , immigration , oil drilling , the Religious Right -- he 's changed his views .
We ought to like politicians who change their mind when the facts change ; it shows maturity , judgment and flexibility .
But politicians who change their mind to suit the prevailing winds show the opposite .
The bottom line
Successful presidents come from two molds : visionaries , or mechanics .
The visionaries -- think Reagan or FDR -- see what others can't and say ' Why not ? " to inspire the country .
The mechanics -- think LBJ or Eisenhower -- know the ins and outs of government and are able to harness the power of millions of humans to accomplish great things , or at least keep the wheels from coming off .
McCain fits neither style .
He 's neither a dreamer , nor a detail guy .
His major accomplishment , in Vietnam and in the Senate , has been merely to survive .
Just surviving does n't make you 're a hero , or a decent president .
America needs to do more than survive the next four years .

With Passion for Bioinformatics ,
Ohio's Secretary of State announced this morning that a $ 1.9 million official study shows that " critical security failures " are embedded throughout the voting systems in the state that decided the 2004 election .
Those failures , she says , " could impact the integrity of elections in the Buckeye State . "
They have rendered Ohio's vote counts " vulnerable " to manipulation and theft by " fairly simple techniques .
" Indeed , she says , " the tools needed to compromise an accurate vote count could be as simple as tampering with the paper audit trail connector or using a magnet and a personal digital assistant .
"
In other words , Ohio's top election official has finally confirmed that the 2004 election could have been easily stolen .
Brunner 's stunning findings apply to electronic voting machines used in 58 of Ohio's 88 counties , in addition to scanning devices and central tabulators used on paper ballots in much of the rest of the state .
Brunner is calling for widespread changes to the way Ohio casts and counts its ballots .
Her announcement follows moves by California Secretary of State Deborah Bowen to disqualify electronic voting machines in the nation 's biggest state .
In tandem , these two reports add a critical state - based dimension to the growing mountain of evidence that the US electoral system is rife with insecurities .
Reports from the Brennan Center , the Carter - Baker Commission , the Government Accountability Office , the Conyers Committee Task Force Report , Princeton University and others have offered differing perspectives that add up to the same conclusion .
Coming in the state that decided the 2004 election for George W. Bush , Brunner 's confirmation of the electoral system 's vulnerabilities adds huge new weight to the charge that the Buckeye State 's vote count was stolen .
In a series of investigative reports dating to well before the 2004 election , the Columbus Free Press and Freepress.org have documented several dozen different means used by the Bush - Cheney re-election campaign to steal the official 2004 vote count .
The final official tally for Bush --- less than 119,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast --- varied by 6.7 % from exit poll results , which showed a Kerry victory .
Exit polls in 2004 were designed to have a margin of error of about 1 % .
In various polling stations in Democrat - rich inner city precincts in Youngstown and Columbus , voters who pushed touch screens for Kerry saw Bush 's name light up .
A wide range of discrepancies on both electronic and paper balloting systems leaned almost uniformly toward the Bush camp .
Voting procedures regularly broke down in inner city and campus areas known to be heavily Democratic .
In direct violation of standing federal election law , 56 of Ohio's 88 counties have since destroyed all or part of their 2004 election data .
The materials were additionally protected by a federal court injunction in the King - Lincoln - Bronzeville federal civil rights lawsuit ( in which we are attorney and plaintiff ) .
To date , no state or federal prosecutions have resulted from this wholesale destruction of presidential election records , including 1.6 million ballots , cast and uncast , needed for definitive auditing procedures .
However , two Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) election officials have been convicted of felony manipulation of an official recount .
The Cleveland Plain - Dealer , the state 's largest newspaper , recently editorialized that there is " no evidence " the 2004 election was stolen , but omitted mention of the destruction of the electoral records by more than half the counties in the state .
The Plain - Dealer and other mainstream media have consistently ignored findings by the Free Press and others indicating widespread manipulation and theft of the kind Brunner has now confirmed was eminently do - able within the Ohio system .
Brunner says " the results underscore the need for a fundamental change in the structure of Ohio 's election system to ensure ballot and voting system security while still making voting convenient and accessible to all Ohio voters . "
Among other things , she advocates replacing touch - screen machines with optical - scan units that include a paper balloting system .
The study was managed by the Battelle Corporation , and conducted by Columbus - based MicroSolved Inc. , SysTest Labs of Denver along with a consortium of academic subcontractors .
It was reviewed by a dozen county officials , and included scrutiny of voting systems produced by Election Systems & Software ( ES&S ) , Hart Intercivic and Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold ) .
Brunner is the Democratic successor to Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell , who administered the 2004 election as Secretary of State while also serving as state co-chair of the Bush - Cheney campaign .
The report comes as part of her pledge to guarantee a fair and reliable vote count in the upcoming 2008 presidential election .
Under Blackwell , Ohio spent some $ 100 million installing electronic voting machines as part of the Help America Vote Act , passed by Congress in the wake of the scandals surrounding the 2000 election .
Former Ohio Congressman Bob Ney , HAVA 's principle author , now resides in a federal prison , in part for illegalities surrounding his dealings with voting machine companies .
Blackwell , who was defeated in a 2006 race for the Ohio governorship , outsourced web hosting responsibilities for the 2004 vote count to a programming firm that also programmed the web site for the 2000 Bush - Cheney campaign .
Blackwell 's chosen host site for the state 's vote count was in the basement of the Old Pioneer Bank Building in Chattanooga , Tennessee , where the servers for the Republican National Committee , and the Bush White House , were also located .
Brunner has now recommended that all Ohio's voting be done on optical scan ballots , with reliance on central tabulation .
Voters with disabilities could use AutoMark touchscreen machines with built in audio systems that allow the marking of ballots with little or no additional assistance .
" It 's a testament to our state 's boards of elections officials that elections on the new ( federally ) mandated voting systems have gone as smoothly as they have in light of these findings , " Brunner said .
Conversely , it is also a testament to the ease with which the 2004 election was stolen by election officials who had clear conflicts of interest aimed at keeping George W. Bush in the White House .

“ Wait a sec , ” the Edutron Systems rep interrupted , cutting off the principal of River City High , “ your students still use pencils and paper to take exams ! ? ”
The rep insincerely chuckled , adding “ do n’t tell me you ’re still using slide rules to teach arithmetic ! ”
As shifty as the sales rep was , he did have a good point .
It was 1993 , after all , and the information superhighway was on the verge of explosive growth .
If the principal knew one thing , it was that he – and most certainly , his students – did not want to be left in the dust .
And if nothing else , Edutron Systems could help point River City High towards the onramp .
Edutron System ’s flagship product was Classroom Assistant , which served as “ an integrated digital notes organizer for today ’s high - tech , on - the - go students . ”
Informally , it was referred to as the “ digital Trapper Keeper ” that “ held a virtually unlimited number , each with a virtually unlimited number of pages . ”
In reality , Classroom Assistant was a glorified text editor that read and wrote files to the 3.5 " floppy disk that each student was supposed to carry around .
To be fair , Classroom Assistant did have several other modules in addition to the in - class note taking module .
Granted , none of them had anything to do with the “ information superhighway , ” but no one seemed to notice or care , as the software did run on a computer , which meant pretty much the same thing .
The module that everyone was excited about , however , was for test taking .
The test taking module was designed with two key goals in mind .
First and foremost , it made teachers ’ lives easier by “ digitizing ” the entire process and , secondly , it reduced cheating by making sure each student had a different copy of the test .
To create a new test , all teachers would have to do was write up a bunch of questions and then “ deploy ” them to each of the classroom ’s PCs .
Because Classroom Assistant was n’t a networked product , deploying the tests involved taking the 3.5 " disk containing the test questions and then loading the disk into each computer .
Taking the “ digital ” tests was even easier .
A student would simply select the appropriate test from the “ test library ” , run through the randomly selected questions , and then instantly see her results .
She ’d then raise her hand , and the teacher could then write down the test results as seen on the screen .
At least , that was the theory .
It took all of one test for the students to find a flaw in the system : if one received an unsatisfactory score , he could simply retake the test .
Classroom Assistant did n’t bother recording how many times each test was taken .
Sure , retaking the test several times was time - consuming , but generally worth the effort .
On the second test , students found a slightly easier workaround : they could simply run a different test .
Since the results screen did not indicate which test was taken , all one needed to do was open up the “ Test Taking Tutorial ” test and pass it with flying colors .
When the third test rolled around , yet another workaround was uncovered : the results screen displayed only the percentage of questions answered correctly and a list of incorrectly answered questions .
So long as they were able to answer the first question correctly , they ’d get an easy 100 % .
By the time the fourth test rolled around , the teachers had finally figured out a workaround of their own : they required that students enter the last question ’s answer in front of them to ensure that it was the right test and actually the last question .
Of course , students were already prepared with a counter - workaround : they could simply CTRL - C to DOS , navigate to the appropriate test folder , and then type in the following at the prompt :
ECHO CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
> answer.key
This would overwrite the particular test ’s answer key , ensuring that C was , in fact , always the correct answer .
Some students even patched together a batch file that overwrote all answer keys for all tests .
Shortly thereafter , River City High moved back to the paper and pencil tests .
I ’ve been reading a very interesting discussion over on the IntenseDebate blog with regards to the question , Who Owns Your Comments ?
IntenseDebate is one of three major third party commenting systems available .
The other two are Disqus and CoComment .
Before I dive into the WordPress aspect of this question , you need to know that IntenseDebate is asking this question because they are a third party commenting system .
Therefor , they act as a link between the blog and the commenting system which is outside of the in - house solution provided by publishing platforms such as WordPress .
Because of this fact , IntenseDebate needs to figure out how comment editing between the two will work out for the best .
However , the question IntenseDebate raised can be addressed to the realm of blogging in general .
When you browse around WordPress.com or self - hosted WordPress powered blogs and leave a comment , who really owns that comment ?
You or the blogger ?
Or should there be shared ownership between the two ?
A number of interesting points were made in the comments of the ID post .
For instance , some users did n’t care who owned their comments just as long as they could n’t be changed by the blog author .
Others believe that because of the way U.S. copyright law works , commenter ’s retain the ownership and copyright of their comments .
While still others believe that a Creative Commons commenting license is in order for Blog owners to display on their site .
Where do I fall on this issue ?
Bloggers have had the ability to edit comments for quite some time now .
I believe that editing a comment to misconstrue the original comment is morally wrong .
In fact , I believe the entire issue of what bloggers do with comments after they have been posted comes down to morality .
In my own experience , I have only edited a few comments due to misspelling or the posting of personal information such as phone numbers or email addresses .
I do n’t believe a commenting bill of rights needs to be created in which all blogs should follow .
However , I do think that each blogger should create and make publicly accessible a commenting policy .
This policy should clearly explain what you as the blog author will do with comments posted on your site , who retains ownership of those comments and explain circumstances which would require you to edit an end user ’s comment .
That ’s what I think .
Let me know what you think in the COMMENTS !
On Salon , Andrew Leonard ruminates on a new paper that tries to analyze gold farming ( doing repetitive in - game tasks to earn money that is sold to players ) with international development .
Richard Heeks 's ( University of Manchester ) new paper " Current Analysis and Future Research Agenda on " Gold Farming " : Real - World Production in Developing Countries for the Virtual Economies of Online Games " is the first paper to explore gold farming from a development perspective , and as the title suggests , it is mostly a literature review and an attempt to define the areas for future research on the topic .
This was a pure - gold find for me , as I 'm working on a young adult novel called For the Win that expands my story Anda 's Game ( about union organizers who sign up gold farmers in the developing world ) , and I 've been reading everything I can get my hands on about gold farming .
Heeks 's paper is absolutely enthralling ( for me , at least ) , a very broad and thorough survey of what we know , what we think we know and what we definitely do n't know about gold farming — it was even worth putting up with the world 's least readable typeface ( though it gave me a splitting headache ) .
( Coincidentally , Andrew Leonard is the Salon editor who bought and published Anda 's Game in the first place ) .
Continuing survival of the sub-sector also relies on overcoming some severe
information failures – absence , uncertainty , asymmetry , and communication
problems .
These have produced many examples of both opportunism and adverse
selection , with trading bringing uncertainty , risk and negative consequences .
As
expected , these seem likely to have suppressed real - money trading well below its
" natural " level , and to have induced sellers into ( potentially - hollow ) assertions about
their trustworthiness .
Because of its virtuality , though , real - money trading has seen
only a little of the localisation and intermediation one might otherwise expect in the
presence of such information failures .
Thirdly , continuing survival of gold farming relies on dealing with the many threats it
faces .
Some of these are business - generic such as ease of entry intensifying
competition , or rising labour costs .
Others are business - specific but just a low - level
nuisance such as character killing or account and IP banning or fraud .
Others still –
patching , game redesign and marketing channel blocks – require constant innovation
to stay one step ahead .
And a final category is much more serious such as game
company substitution or legal action by governments or game companies .
Game
companies probably take such action through a mix of economic , moral and personal
in - game experience rationales .
But one must recognise that gold farming bringsa
benefits to these companies , while action against gold farming brings both anticipated
and perhaps unanticipated costs .

Electric car maker Tesla Motors
Inc said on Monday it will manufacture the lower - priced follow - up to its Roadster sports car in California after the state offered a tax break to keep the operations there .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , speaking at Tesla ’s headquarters in San Carlos , California , said he was determined to prevent the automaker from setting up shop in New Mexico , which had offered it better incentives .
“ I myself bought one of the first Tesla cars , so for me to see this company build a plant in New Mexico drove me absolutely insane , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ My administration , of course , does not like to lose . ”
To keep Tesla in California , the state is offering a tax break to makers of zero-emissions vehicles ( ZEVs ) on equipment used to manufacture advanced transportation products .
Tesla will use the tax break to build its second - generation electric car , called the Model S , in Northern California .
The five - passenger sedan will cost about $ 60,000 and is expected to go into production in late 2010 .
Boosting investment in green technologies that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs is a top priority for Schwarzenegger , who in 2006 introduced landmark legislation to combat global warming .
The success of Tesla and other electric car makers is critical to that effort , as the state is requiring that automakers put 7,500 ZEVs on its roads between 2012 and 2014 .
Last week , state unveiled an ambitious plan to reduce pollutants by 10 percent from current levels by 2020 , in part by requiring cleaner cars .
Tesla began delivering its $ 100,000 Roadster sports cars earlier this year .
The company plans to offer more affordable vehicles as the cost of producing them declines .
At the press conference on Monday , Tesla Chairman Elon Musk said the company was working on producing an all - electric car that would sell for under $ 30,000 and appeal to a wider market .
“ This company is not out to solve a sports car shortage in the world , ” Musk said .

Last week , the 174th Air Force Fighter Wing flew its last manned combat sortie over Iraq in F - 16s , which have now been mothballed in favor of MQ - 9 Reapers .
This makes it the first combat - specific wing to ditch conventional aircraft entirely and toward a force of all unmanned robo - drones piloted from the ground .
Welcome to the Skynet era , everyone !

There are a few Wings currently manned by Predator UAVs , which can indeed carry Hellfire missiles , but unlike the Reaper , their main mission is reconnaissance .
Quite the contrary , the Reaper is the first true hunter - killer UAV , and its 66 - foot wingspan and the ability to carry up to 1.5 tons of laser - guided bombs and other ordnances makes the Predator look like a fluttering sparrow .
And over Iraq , the Reaper can do the targeting - pod recon and close - air support that manned jets most commonly find themselves tasked with at a fraction of the cost ( Reapers cost $ 18 million each , compared to three times that much for an F - 16 ) .
Not to mention without the operational expenses or potential danger to the pilots , who can be in Las Vegas munching Taco Bell with their families .

Imagine that you are not here anymore .
Your friends , your family , neighbors , all gone .
Even I , your favorite green blogger , have vanished like a snuffed candle flame–not just from the blogosphere but from the entire bloody biosphere !
This scenario of modern Earth minus its most problematic children , us , is the subject of Alan Weisman ’s The World Without Us .
In one of the most compelling , meticulously researched cultural thought experiments of recent years , Weisman examines the numerous ways that humanity has stamped its footprint on the Earth ’s face and then what would likely happen if we simply went away .
Weisman ’s books has received a lot of fanfare and awards , such as being Time magazine ’s # 1 non-fiction book of 2007 and a New York Times bestseller , so I have been anxious to read it for a while .
But any expectations I had , as you may have , of some misanthropic environmentalist ’s tirade against humankind quickly get exploded by Weisman ’s more nuanced , balanced , intelligent approach .
The result is an inspiring , if also at times disheartening , presentation of how life has endured and will endure with or without humans in the mix .
In this respect , Weisman ’s final sentence in the Prelude provides a provocative launching point into the book : “ Is it possible that , instead of heaving a huge biological sigh of relief , the world without us would miss us ? ” 1
Having this idea of nature missing us as or after it takes over again keeps the reader wandering what trick Weisman ( or nature ! ) has up his sleeve as he describes all the serious alterations we have made to the natural ecosystem .
It also challenges the widely held assumption that Earth would be better off without us–and so likely happy to see us gone !
Weisman ’s book is most engaging , perhaps , because he imagines and then describes the fate of some aspects of human civilization that you might not otherwise consider .
For example , he delves deeply into the destiny of plastics , briefly contemplates our tinkering with plant and animal genes through genetic modification , or looks at the arts .
In all cases , you cannot help but look up from the page and ponder his thoughtful prose .
For instance , faced with the prospect of GMOs , Weisman can only guess at what would happen without further modifications to the gene pool , since this practice is too new to have much evidence to support it .
He writes ,
Some [ genetically modified organisms ] will be roundly trounced by competition toughened over eons by evolution .
It ’s a fair bet , though , that others will pounce on an opportunity to adapt , and evolve themselves .
( 205 )
Even if we disappear , then , the various monsters we have created like Dr. Frankenstein may still linger and potentially wreak havoc…or coexist .
To conduct his flights of fancy with feet firmly on terra firma , Weisman adopts a very wise strategy of looking to the past in order to envision the future of dehumanized Earth .
This helps to support his descriptions / visions of nature returning to an earlier state by undoing what we have done–or at least redoing it in key ways .
It also shows how nature is already doing its best to undo the human factor , making clear that without constant defense our various constructs would be deconstructed with relentless efficiency –for example , how weather and critters and even mold spores would quickly , persistently “ unbuild ” our homes .
( You can also play with this prospect in virtual reality at the book ’s companion website , www.worldwithoutus.com.)
The result is fascinating and informative in each element of human life that he treats .
Ironically , Weisman ’s strength of building a firm foundation with facts about the past and present is also a bit of a weakness in The World Without Us–probably the only one I could find .
Weisman usually spends so much time laying out past and present facts as the basis for his visions of the future without us that he seems then to wrap up a given topic somewhat abruptly .
He may spend twenty or more pages on the past and present before giving the likely outcomes in several paragraphs–as happens in the chapter “ The World without War . ”
This often may leave you wanting more , be it facts or informed fiction .
But even this possible weakness , creating more a feeling of disproportionate amounts of material rather than of a flaw in the author ’s technique , does not detract from Weisman ’s The World Without Us .
And to send us off to keep imagining a humanless future , Weisman never really answers his question in the prelude about our being missed by something .
( Speaking for myself , though , I found it pretty hard to answer with a fully optimistic affirmative . )
Instead , he shows that with just about every bit of harm we humans have done to Earth , “ … these things , too , will pass ” ( 211 ) .
In the end , then , he closes with a remarkably beautiful image : human memories coming back , “ surf[ing ] aboard a cosmic electromagnetic wave to haunt our beloved Earth ” ( 353 ) .
Hopefully we would be much , much wiser at that point , too , since Weisman is most successful and praiseworthy for proving without doubt that life will carry on … and that it would be worth our long journey back .

In Barcelona , 95 % of the population understand Catalonia 's native Catalan language , while 74.6 % can speak it , 75 % can read it , and 47.1 % can write it .
Probably not the best place to learn Spanish on your first trip abroad .
Problem 1 : If at all possible , do not go abroad to study with large groups of people that share the same language .
On the first night of my summer study abroad program , our teaching fellow led 15 jet - lagged Harvard students through the narrow streets of Barcelona ’s Old City to a restaurant off La Rambla , the city ’s touristy yet iconic nucleus , which slices through the original part of the city .
Brought to a long table on the roof deck of the short building , we met our professor and his family .
The sun was setting , the wine flowed freely , and it felt like we could have been in the countryside rather than overlooking a bustling street .
Still in the honeymoon period of my time in Barcelona , I made a comment to my roommate after dinner about how “ European ” that experience was .
Her response ?
“ I do n’t know , I mean , everyone was speaking English . ”
Problem 2 : If you are going to study in a group , you need to set up a few ground rules beforehand .
A day or two later , I asked my friend who had studied here in the spring what she thought .
She suggested it was unnatural for people who share a native language to speak to each other in a different one .
My classmates and I have planned Spanish - only Tuesday , but it has n’t happened once .
My roommate has come in and tried to speak to me in Spanish , but I have trouble understanding her accent .
Problem 3 : Do n't go to a region that uses another language as often as the language you 're trying to learn .
There is also something ironic about the fact that we are taking Spanish courses in a region where Spanish is not the primary language .
While everyone here does speak the language , Catalan is more common , and almost all signs , ads , and menus are in Catalan .
The weekend that we went to Madrid , I was reminded that I am actually in Spain .

Included in this important interview is a discussion regarding a new article by Mr. Springmann titled , THE MISTAKE DEPARTMENT : One Example of Why American Foreign Policy is a Disaster that discusses the American Consulate General at Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , and it 's relationship to 15 of the 19 alleged September 11th hijackers .
In it , he says that " the Jeddah Consulate was not a State Department post but an intelligence services operation " , " the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) routinely demanded ( and got ) visas for sleazy characters with no ties to either their home country or Saudi Arabia , " and " these vile people were terrorists recruited by U.S. intelligence officers along with Osama bin Laden , then a CIA asset .

Mukasey : No prosecutions in Justice hiring scandal Associated Press
Published : Tuesday August 12 , 2008
Print This Email This NEW YORK - Former Justice Department officials will not face prosecution for letting improper political considerations drive hirings of prosecutors , immigration judges and other career government lawyers , Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Tuesday .
Mukasey used his sharpest words yet to criticize the senior leaders who took part in or failed to stop illegal hiring practices during the tenure of his predecessor , Alberto Gonzales .
But , he told delegates to the American Bar Association annual meeting , " not every wrong , or even every violation of the law , is a crime .
In this instance , the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws . "
Other intrusions of Bush administration politics into department hirings and firings remain under investigation .
Mukasey said he is awaiting reports on the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 and the hiring practices in the department 's civil rights division .
The political controversies prompted Gonzales ' resignation last year .
An internal investigation concluded last month that for nearly two years , top advisers to Gonzales discriminated against applicants for career jobs who were n't Republican or conservative loyalists .
The federal government makes a distinction between " career " and " political " appointees , and it's a violation of civil service laws and Justice Department policy to hire career employees on the basis of political affiliation or allegiance .
Yet Monica Goodling , who served as Gonzales ' counselor and White House liaison , routinely asked career job applicants about politics , the report concluded .
Mukasey , who once served as a federal judge in New York , said the Justice Department has taken steps under his leadership to prevent a recurrence of the hiring scandal .
" I have made repeatedly clear ... that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees , " Mukasey said .
If the problems were to recur , Mukasey said he is confident department employees would speak up .
That did not happen during Gonzales ' tenure , he said .
Gonzales appeared unaware of the political hiring process outlined by Goodling and his then - chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , the report said .
" There was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department .
And there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware , or should have been aware , of problems , " Mukasey said .
The ABA has been at odds with the Bush administration on a range of issues , including treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorist ties and the need for a federal law to shield reporters from subpoenas .
Mukasey said that on the issue of politics in his department , there was no disagreement with the lawyers ' group .
" Professionalism is alive and well at the Justice Department , " he said .
Some candidates for career Justice Department jobs who were excluded because of politics could be invited to apply for new positions , Mukasey said .
He also ruled out firing or reassigning those who were hired under the now - discarded evaluation process .
" Two wrongs do not make a right , " he said .
" People who were hired in an improper way did n't themselves do anything wrong . "
WASHINGTON  Former Vice President Al Gore said on Thursday that Americans must abandon electricity generated by fossil fuels within a decade and rely on the sun , the winds and other environmentally friendly sources of power , or risk losing their national security as well as their creature comforts .
“ The survival of the United States of America as we know it is at risk , ” Mr. Gore said in a speech to an energy conference here .
“ The future of human civilization is at stake . ”
Mr. Gore called for the kind of concerted national effort that enabled Americans to walk on the moon 39 years ago this month , just eight years after President John F. Kennedy famously embraced that goal .
He said the goal of producing all of the nation ’s electricity from “ renewable energy and truly clean , carbon - free sources ” within 10 years is not some farfetched vision , although he said it would require fundamental changes in political thinking and personal expectations .
“ This goal is achievable , affordable and transformative , ” Mr. Gore said in his remarks at the conference .
“ It represents a challenge to all Americans , in every walk of life  to our political leaders , entrepreneurs , innovators , engineers , and to every citizen . ”

Cyclone Nargis ( JTWC designation : 01B , also known as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis ) was a strong tropical cyclone that made landfall in Myanmar ( also known as Burma ) on May 2 , 2008 , causing catastrophic destruction and nearly 22,500 fatalities , with a further 41,000 people still missing .
It is the deadliest named cyclone in the North Indian Ocean Basin .
Nargis was the first tropical cyclone to strike the country since Cyclone Mala made landfall in 2006 .
The first named storm of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season , Nargis developed on April 27 in the central Bay of Bengal .
Initially it tracked slowly northwestward , and encountering favorable conditions it quickly strengthened .
Dry air weakened the cyclone on April 29 , though after beginning a steady eastward motion Nargis rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of at least 165 km/h ( 105 mph ) on May 2 ; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed peak winds of 215 km/h ( 135 mph ) .
The cyclone moved ashore in the Ayeyarwady Division of Burma near peak intensity , and after passing near the major city of Yangon ( Rangoon ) , the storm gradually weakened until dissipating near the border of Burma and Thailand ...

Final Fantasy : Twenty Years and a Massive Universe Later
Note from racketboy :
To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the original Final Fantasy , racketboy.com contributer , Fastbilly 1 has spent a great deal of time putting together a look back at this landmark RPG series .
This look back at both the original game and the extensive and diverse series that followed is filled with both an historical look at the games and personal experiences with each .
I hope you enjoy it !
“ I Garland , will knock you down ” are the infamous words that have brought fans delight for 20 years .
Of course Garland is the first boss in the original Final Fantasy and December 18th is the 20th anniversary of the Japanese release of the game .
The rest of the world actually received the game in 1990 but we ’ll celebrate the birthday of this landmark series based on its original release .
Since Final Fantasy is a Role - playing game , I thought it fitting to start with thoughts from one of the men who created Role - playing Games ?
Having a dream and knowing he was a kind man I asked the brilliant Gary Gygax one simple question :
What was his opinion on videogame RPGs ?
His response actually took me by surprise …
The computer search and destroy games erroneously called RPGs are not actually in the role - playing game genre .
Why ?
Simply ask yourself :
To whom does one role - play to when engaged in such a game ?
The answer is also evident : No one .
This is not to say that the “ CRPG ” is not a worthwhile playing experience .
The size of the audience for such games demonstrated unequivocally that they are compelling , nearly addictive .
Unlike a true RPG , where there is a game master and assembled player group , the CRPG can be played whenever the individual wishes , for as long a period as desired , without having to have a game master or associated players there .
Furthermore , the CRPG captures vividly most of the essential features of the true RPG –exploration , problem solving , combat , acquisition .
What is missing is the inter- personal role - playing and the vast range of possibilities provided by the game master .
Clearly many people find the trade off well worth the immediate availability of CRPG play .
Cheers ,
Gary
After I received his email it took a minute for his response to sink in , but everything he said is spot on .
One of the best parts of an RPG is the dynamic relationship that grows between the player and their friends .
Role - playing games transform us from our everyday selves into characters in far away lands were we battle evil and save the world .
Like many gamers , some of my fondest memories in college were late nights playing RPGs with a group of my friends .
We smashed skeletons , broke in doors , blew up buildings , and saved galaxies , all from the comfort of the Student Union .
But every so often we could not get enough people to make a good game so we had to rely on CRPGs .
And while they scratched the itch , they could never take the place .
Not even using Teamspeak and online tools to replicate the tabletop experience of an actual game .
So what does any of that have to do with Final Fantasy ?
Well the original version of Final Fantasy was fairly close to the original D&D in many aspects .
Sure , the characters were mutes and wooden , the plot is junk ( by today ’s standards ) , and there is little motivation to save this world .
But it did provide an amazing adventure , a dynamic tale about four heroes on a journey .
Final Fantasy also had a difficultly rarely seen by modern gamers and some parts that are just downright brutal .
It is an amazing game and it spawned a saga that no one expected .
The Origins of Final Fantasy
Final Fantasy was created by a small team lead by visionary , Hironobu Sakaguchi .
After a string of moderate successes and numerous flops ( Death Trap 1 & 2 , 3D World Runner , Rad Racer , Kings Knight , among others ) , Sakaguchi had one final idea he wanted to try .
A console role - playing game was something of a rarity back in the late 80s .
Sure , we had Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior , Richard Garriot ’s team had ported Ultima III with a moderate degree of success , Hylide was released to favorable reviews , and the Shin Megami Tensei series had just begun .
But all of these were missing something .
Whether it was missing the party dynamic , Dragon Quest , a bearable soundtrack , Hylide , or simply not dropping you off in the middle of no where with no indication which way you should go , Ultima III , console RPGs at the time had no standard .
This is not an attempt to say these games are bad — far from it — they are all excellent games on their own accord .
But for many people , no console RPG had hit on the right formula quite yet .
This , of course , changed when Sakaguchi started work on his “ final fantasy ” ( it is only a rumor that this is how the name came about , but it sounds so cool ) .
The game was released on December 18th 1987 to a fantastic level of fervor .
Video game enthusiasts wanted it because it was amazing , Role - playing fans wanted it because it was the closest available to a real session you could have by yourself .
More importantly , it fixed the problems that the other games had .
You had a party , four characters out of six available classes , the soundtrack was amazing , and the manual got you through the first couple hours of the game – not to mention the awesome map / bestiary that was also packed in .
To be cliché , the rest is history .
What Made Final Fantasy Special
Square did everything correct in the first rendition .
The game was ruthlessly hard , gripping , and had an edge to it .
Never before had I played a Light Warrior , nor did I even know what one was .
Sure .
I had saved the world , but never like this .
Quickly I was sucked into the game pretty deeply .
As we all know , you begin with a simple task : save the princess .
What you learn first is that if you do not actually equip your weapons , you will die when that first party of five imps decides to jump you .
Then when you do figure out your weapons , if you were not already a fan of Gary Gygax ’s Dungeons and Dragons , you soon learned that magic can be used only a few times a day , and then you must rest .
Though they took it a step further and you only regained your magic spells if you slept in an inn or a high level disposable ( cottage or house in the original – tent or cottage in subsequent releases ) .
Factor in status effects like stone , which can be nasty when you run into nice Cocktrices and they all have a chance to cause it , and you have a game that starts you off flying into a brick wall .
But for years we have kept at it .
At the time , Final Fantasy had a innovative storyline which involved elaborate myths and time travel .
This lead to a deeper experience , that many claim to be better than Enix ’s Dragon Quest .
With these groundbreaking characteristics , Final Fantasy , along with the original Dragon Quest , proved to be one of the most influential early console role - playing games , and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre on the video game console .
The original Final Fantasy may not be the best game , but pound for pound , Final Fantasy provides one of the best adventures ever created for a game .
And even though it has been made easier over the years in the ports , it still provides an experience worthy of your time .

The Many Flavors of Final Fantasy
For years , we have plugged countless hours into this game .
Personally I have had a version of it with me daily for the past five years ( emulated on my now - dead Zodaic 2 or the beautiful Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls GBA game ) .
There are very few games that I can go back and play for hours on end .
Luckily , Final Fantasy is one of them .
Fans obviously love this title as Square / Enix ca n’t help but releasing a number of remakes on a variety of platforms , especially mobile devices .
While all of these remakes contain various tweaks have been made in a variety of different areas , including graphics , sound , and specific gameplay elements .
However , at the heart of each port , the core legacy of this NES classic lives on .
There are seven ports of the original Final Fantasy :
NES
MSX2 ( Japan Only )
Wonderswan ( Japan Only )
PSX
GBA
Cellphone ( Japan only )
PSP
Personally I like the NES version the most , it is what I grew up with and the nostalgia I have with it is something the other versions will never have .
However the MSX version is just the NES one with a few tweaks – better graphics due to the MSX having more space and a stronger architecture .
However the one I have spent the next most time with is easily the GBA one .
The PSX version is simply the Wonderswan version with an easy mode and less load times ( which were by no means bad ) .
However the GBA version is the PSX version with additional items and dungeons .
The dungeons are just side - quest based around each fiend and the final bosses are from the other games .
The final bosses from Final Fantasy II and III bosses are present , along with the Ghost Train from VI , among others .
The extended weapon sets and items were not needed , but add some flavor and fun to the game .
Sadly the Giant Rat from FFIII was not present , but that is probably a good thing .
Any version you choose will be a good game , but as far as I count , I still say every RPG gamer should play the NES version at least once .
Even if they do not beat it , they owe it to themselves to at least give this fine game a sporting chance .
It has been surpassed in almost ever aspect ; story , graphics , sound , etc . but it is still the first console RPG to get everything right and set the standard .
The Rest of the Final Fantasy Saga
Since Final Fantasy has spawned such an impressive saga of installments that are loved by fans around the world , I thought it would be fitting to actually touch on the series as a whole .
A couple months after the first game was a success , Square released Final Fantasy II to mixed reviews .
Most gamers outside of Japan did not get a chance to play this game until the mid 1990s in raw form , or shortly after that in English , thanks to emulation and fan patches .
Unlike any other game at the time , FFII had you do some really unique things to progress , which made a lot of fans and reviewers lambaste it pretty hard .
Innovation was shot down .
The leveling system , which makes sense from a practical point of view , is not in a typical JRPG style , the characters are actually characters , not just nameless pastless killing machines , and the story is enjoyable .
The game itself is fun and while not as good as the first , it is still a very good game .
There are a lot of problems with it , like all early RPG ’s , and I do not agree with a lot of the changes , or those that people gave the game a hard time about but lets move into another rambling walkthrough .
Just like Final Fantasy VIII , many people hate this game .
They say that it deviated to much from the other games for its own good .
It was to different , to hard , or just bad .
I know , I was one of them for years .
But one day I gave it a second chance , sat down and gave it a good three hours of my time – which nowadays is a rare thing , and I loved it .
Sure it is not a perfect game , but it is a good game .
The nasty difficulty of the first is still present , though toned down , but there are more than enough reasons to draw you into the game .
Sure the game is really just one large fetch quest , but that is what most CRPGs are anyway , this one is just a little more obvious , stupid Altea …
But the game works .
The leveling system made the game unique and actually requires you to think and plan .
Simply put , it was different , and we all know that different is evil .
There are just as many versions of FFII are there of FFI , many of them are two packs .
And just like FFI , I have played the same copies .
Out of them all , the PSX version is my favorite .
While the WSC and GBA versions look the similar to it , the PSX one runs smooth , the game is beautiful , and the audio is simply unmatched .
While the GBA version has better visuals and is portable , it is not the same .
It is to zoomed in for my taste .
But all versions are worth your time , but do n’t take it from me , give it a couple hours on your own , just remember magic is worthless but Chocobos are awesome .

Here is where the series takes another hard left .
Like FFII , Final Fantasy III brings a lot of new things on the table .
Introducing my absolute favorite part of the entire series , the Job system , FFIII does some awesome things .
This game was introduced to me by a friend several years ago .
I played through the English patch on my GP32 back when I was in college .
Then a couple years later I heard rumors of a remake .
3D , remade music , and on the new Nintendo handheld , what was not to love ?
Well I got to play a copy of it right before it was released and hated it .
Gone was the simple brilliance , the game was in the vein of FFVII – more on this later .
In Final Fantasy III , you go through a lot of airships in this one , and there are several useless jobs .
But the game is simply stunning .
The interface and style are used in the next couple games in the series .
Even though it is only a Famicom game , it feels and flows like SNES RPG .
It is a lot of fun , and is a rock solid game .
The Nintendo DS version from 2005 is not quite as enjoyable , in my opinion , but it is still a good game .
I do not want to come off as a hypocrite , I hate to review games without putting sufficient time into them , but it is not the best version .
While the game is prettier and sounds a lot better , the best overall experience is from the Famicom version .

Final Fantasy IV ( released as Final Fantasy II on the US SNES ) was one of the first 16 - bit RPGs , displaying state - of - the - art music and cutting - edge Mode 7 graphics .
The story took gamers across three separate worlds with a slew of characters .
FFIV was also the first Final Fantasy to set love as a plot focus , popularized by later titles such as Final Fantasy VIII .
FFIV ’s battle system is a bit different as it is the first to use Square ’s infamous ATB ( Active Time Battle ) system .
With this system , there are no turns to take , but you can attack while your foes are still deciding on what to do , and vice versa .
This system was a bit innovative , but was not very intuitive , resulting in a mixed reception .
Final Fantasy IV ’s battles did occasionally feature “ Battlescripting ” which were bits of dialogue or scripted events that were used as plot devices .
This did help round out the dramatic elements in the game and brought the series closer to the cinematic experience that Final Fantasy fans have come to expect .
I actually have an ex-girlfriend who loves this game very much , but personally , I just got bored of it after Tellah said Edward was a spoony bard ( sorry Diggers , its been awhile ) .
I must have been spoiled since I played it after completing FFVI .
The game was later remade on the Playstation in 1997 for the Japanese audience and was eventually repackaged with Chrono Trigger for the US in the Final Fantasy Chronicles release in 2001 .
A Wonderswan Color version came soon after in 2002 which was eventually ported to the GBA in 2005 / 2006 /

This is the closest to a spiritual successor of FFIII .
The rocking Job system was tweaked to nigh perfection , the story was awesome , and the world was just brilliant .
The Active Time Battle combat also made a return from FFIV but this time there was a time gauge so you could see what character would be able to attack next .
( This technique was later used in Chrono Trigger )
All these characteristics in Final Fantasy VI took the experience that we were given in FFIII ( with the combat of IV ) and made it practically perfect .
It is not the best in the series , but it is in my top three .
Final Fantasy V was re-released ( with FFVI ) for the Playstation in 1999 as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology collection .
An enhanced version was also released for the GBA in 2006 .

Perfection .
In my opinion , Final Fantasy VI has it all : a compelling story , complex characters , a villain that is pure evil , and the NPC ’s telling .
All in all , this and Phantasy Star IV , are the two closest examples of 2D RPG perfection .
They are both exquisite games , and you would be remiss if you missed them .
In this installment , the Final Fantasy world has decided to do away with magic and is now based on steam power and other technologies from the Second Industrial Revolution .
The structure of society takes a cue from the latter half of the 19th century , with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game .
This setting served as an interesting contrast to the fantasy medieval themes of most RPGs .
At the time of its release , Final Fantasy VI boasted unprecedented graphics and sound helping it become one of the first truly epic stories in the history of video games .
All these technical capabilities required a then - impressive 24 - meg cartridge , making it one of the biggest RPGs up to that point in time .
It is also worth nothing that Final Fantasy VI was the first to be made without the influence of Hironobu Sakaguchi , yet this did n’t hinder it one bit .
The game is still considered to be the best game of the series and of its whole genre .
Final Fantasy VI was re-released on the Playstation in 1999 and the GBA in 2006 .

Anyone that is experienced with the Final Fantasy series or grew up with a Playstation in their home is probably quite familiar with Final Fantasy VII .
Transitioning into the world of 3D and cinematic gameplay , FFVII is a treasured classic in the minds of many fans .
The game also brought RPG games to the mainstream outside of Japan .
I , on the other hand , have a long and painful history with the game .
I picked the PC version up at my local Best Buy for $ 30 the day it came out .
I played it a lot of the game that summer and reached the Cosmo Canyon ’s Observatory cutscene before the game crapped out on me .
Nothing I could do would make it work .
The next week that computer ’s hard drive failed .
The next year I played it again , again got stuck in a cutscene — this time exiting Midgar ( this was the patched version ) .
Over the next three or four years I try to play it every once and a while .
Then one week I decided to finish the game off .
I load it up and get to the first Chocobo race and it crashes my PC .
The next day I pick up a copy of the Playstaion version at Software ETC .
Once I got home , I played through to Coast De Sol , and saved my progress .
The next day I fire it up and my memory card is erased .
This miffed me pretty good as I was playing a legit game on a stock PSX with both first party controllers and a reliable memory card .
So I gave up with the game for another couple years .
Then the last summer I was in college I sat down and decided once again to give this unicorn a shot .
Everything went fine on the first disk ( finally Aries / Arieth was dead ) and I was just about to go fight the Ultimate Weapon for the second time , but he was no where to be found .
I could not find him , but then I realized that the game thought he had already died , yet no Ultimate Weapon in my inventory ( but more that one Buster Sword in its place ) .
Then , when I tried to fight the Ruby Weapon , he never attacked back .
Several other problems later , I decided to stop playing and have not touched it since .
( Please do n’t harass me about different things to try … )
FFVII is my personal unicorn ( or white whale , if you like ) .
I felt that I will never finish it .
The worst part , however , is that I never really enjoyed the game .
I know I know , but to me the feel of the series was lost in the transition to 3D .

Final Fantasy VIII is the black sheep of the series and I will say for good cause .
Final Fantasy VIII was the first game in the series to consistently use realistically proportioned characters and the first to feature a vocal piece as its theme music .
FFVIII also removed Magic Point - based system for spellcasting , and it remains as one of the only titles to deviate from the series ’ traditional means of increasing a character ’s power .
Many critics complained about the combat system being overly complex , but I ’m sure many RPG fans found it interesting .
The main character was shallow , even if his weapon was beyond awesome .
I found the story very good , but just lost interest around the middle of the second disc .
I liked most of the characters but the world just did not draw me in at all , and I will not start on the music .
I feel if I played it again I may think better of it , but that will be some time in the far future .

Much to the delight of old - school RPG fans , Final Fantasy IX returned to the series ’ roots with a more traditional fantasy setting and heavily - inspired by the original Final Fantasy .
However , Final Fantasy
IX did introduce some new features to the series , such as the Active Time Event and a revamped equipment and skill system .
In the visuals department , Final Fantasy IX was drop - dead gorgeous game , even when compared to much of the PS2 ’s early library .
I loved the entire first disc , but once I passed that point , it started to fall apart for me .
There was a point where I just stopped caring – notice a trend here .
I could not attach myself to any of the characters and while I loved the style , the game started to drag .
Everything was going for it , then it hit the wall .
I find that once the games started to span multiple disc , they just got boring in the middle .

Final Fantasy
X was an early showpiece for the Playstation 2 and its beautiful cinematic experience attacted a new audience .
Final Fantasy
X was the first of the series to make the jump from pre-rendered 3D backdrops to ones that were rendered into fully three - dimensional environments on the fly by the console ’s hardware .
It was also the first to feature voice - over actors .
Personally , much like the earlier disc - based Final Fantasys , it lost me about halfway through .
Many other old - school fans were a bit turned off by it , but the majority of the gaming community welcomed and enjoyed it tremendously .
( Japanese Famitsu readers voted it the best game of all time )

Riding on the success of Final Fantasy X , Square did something they never did before : made a direct sequel .
The main character is Yuna from Final Fantasy X .
This game is slightly unique in that you there are only 3 playable characters who all happen to be female , and this is one of the few games of the Final Fantasy series to include different endings .

Dumbfounding the fans , Square went MMO .
I got into the Beta and hated it .
I loved the game , but the community was worse just awful .
If you were not a Warrior , Black Mage , or White Mage , no one wanted you in their party .
So my Thief was kinda shoved to the side every time , and you can only solo for so long in the game .
Years later I tried again on a friends account , the community had changed and developed much like the Earth and Beyond one , but was still far from Ultima Online , but it was fun .
I have not played the expansions , but pound for pound it is my favorite of the disc based Final Fantasy .

Keeping the MMO style gameplay , but putting it into an offline game was a good idea .
And being based in the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance universe meant that status effects were worthwhile , but it fell flat just like most MMOs , the grind just got to be to much .
I still like it though .
A real - time strategy spin - off / sequel on the DS by the name of Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings was recently released .
It blends in some of the gameplay elements found in the Tactics series and offers some unique gameplay for DS owners .

Final Fantasy Spinoffs
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest
This SNES title is the easiest of the entire series , but with only a two person party .
A beginner RPG and not worth your time , unless you like a cliché storyline and a hold A to win game .
Yes , even some of the most basic things that you expect in an RPG such as random battle , manual equipment , and use of a party are all eliminated to create a simpler game .
If you have young kids that you want to prepare for Pokemon , this might be a good one for them .

Final Fantasy Adventure
Technically this is the first game in the Seiken Densetsu ( Mana ) series , but it was branded Final Fantasy to sell in the states .
While it is a pretty bad Final Fantasy RPG , it is one awesome Zelda styled Action RPG , like most Seiken Densetsu games .
It has solid mechanics and is a hoot .
If Links Awakening was not its competition it would have been a shoe in for best Action RPG on the Gameboy at that time .

Final Fantasy Legend I , II , and III
Like Final Fantasy
Adventure , these are re-branded games from another series .
This time the Makai Toushi SaGa games were victim .
However all three of these games are amazing .
Sure they are clunky and have problems with slowdown , but they are excellent titles .
If you are a fan of 2D RPGs , and happen to have a Gameboy , GBA , or a suitable emulator , you may want to look into them , especially part III .
The caliber of game that they accomplished with what they had to work with is astonishing .
Gorgeous adventures , all three of them .

Final Fantasy Tactics
Though not the pioneer of the genre , Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most involved , serious , and well - rounded strategy RPGs .
Despite being more than 6 years old , it remains as playable and fascinating as ever .
Final Fantasy
Tactics is notable for its well - crafted storyline , which might actually be one of the best in the Final Fantasy series .
The classic combat gameplay found in Tactics is just as outstanding and is really the star of the show .
The game features a complex “ job ” system , first introduced in Final Fantasy V. Much like a game of chess , Tactics forces players to think carefully about each move , to plan ahead , and to bring the best possible strategies to duke it out against many challenging opponents .
Many games , since its time , have attempted to copy and improve on its formula , but none have managed to do so with the same dramatic flair and unusual style as Final Fantasy Tactics .
It is also worth mentioning that Tactics was actually developer by Quest , the same people who created Battle Ogre and Tactics Ogre ( originally for Enix ) .
This explains the many similarities and strengths behind these rock - solid games .
The new , highly - praised Final Fantasy Tactics :
The War of the Lions for the PSP is also a remake of the original Tactics and it definitely worth picking up if you have Sony ’s handheld .

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
Controversial is the best way to describe this one .
Taking the beloved Tactics gameplay and adding laws to the game , banning weapons among other things , many fans hated it .
I loved it my first time through , but when I went to play it again to finally get Cid , well I got fed up in the first fight .
I feel that this game is best played if you can keep the mindset for about a month .
If you put it down and pick it up a couple months / years later , you may go mad .
It was a fun game , but in no way , shape , or form the best SRPG on the system .
Final Fantasy Tactics A2 for the Nintendo DS is a direct sequel to Tactics Advance .
It has been released in Japan , but has yet to be released in any other countries .
Hopefully it will be on par with the Tactics : The War of the Lions from the PSP in terms of quality .

Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
Being that I am a Gauntlet fan , I love Crystal Chronicles .
My chances to play it are very rare , but every time I do it is a blast .
The game has some major problems if you are not playing one or four player , and it can get tedious , but when playing with three other people in the same room it is intense .
So much so that I am trying to get two more Gameboy Player equipped Gamecubes and two more small TVs and just have them setup in my gameroom , for impromptu games of course .
The best way to describe this is a PC hack - and - slash ( similar to Titans Quest , Dungeon Siege , or Diablo ) done in the Final Fantasy world , and using Gameboy Advances to manage your inventories .
Upcoming sequels for the DS and Wii are both on the way and it will be interesting to see how those turn out and how similar they are to the Gamecube original .

There are actually many more spin - offs and related game , but instead of covering them all , you should probably just check out this Final Fantasy Spin -Offs entry on Wikipedia .
The Saga Continues
Obviously , the Final Fantasy series has grown remarkably to transition from a last - ditch effort to keep Squaresoft alive to one of the most powerful and diverse gaming franchises of all time .
As I breifly mentioned a few times above , there are numerous new installments and spin - offs being released and under development that are exploring new gameplay mechanics and reaching new levels of cinematic experiences .
It will be interesting to see how things progress .
If you have enjoyed the Final Fantasy series , we ’d love to hear your thoughts , both nostolgic or current , in the comments section below .
With all the Final Fantasy games out there , I ’m sure almost everyone has been touched by at least one .
Special Thanks Goes
Out to …
Jessica Merriman ( founder of Momocon , one of the largest free conventions in the United States ) , Dale North of OCRemix
Children of the Monkey Machine of OCRemix ( Happy Anniversary , my friend ) , And of course Gary Gygax .
Her songs are all over a hit indie soundtrack , and new fans are mobbing her concerts .
Most musicians would see this as good news .
But for Kimya Dawson , the 35 - year - old den mother of the tiny anti-folk scene , all the attention for her music in the film “ Juno ” is a little troubling .
“ I ’m totally scared , ” she said recently at Southpaw , a small club in Brooklyn where she was playing a sold - out afternoon show open to all ages .
Literally all ages : among the toddlers in attendance was her 17 - month - old daughter , Panda , whom Ms. Dawson breast - fed backstage while explaining her fears of getting too famous too fast .
A do - it - yourself singer who writes in childlike , stream - of - consciousness verse and has “ LAFF LOUD ” tattooed on her fingers , she now finds herself competing with major celebrities like Alicia Keys , Mary J. Blige and Radiohead for the top spot on the Billboard album chart .
It ’s a strange situation for Ms. Dawson , who with her old band , the Moldy Peaches , became a leader of the loosely knit , underground punk - meets - folk scene .
Last week the soundtrack to “ Juno , ” the snarky romantic comedy about a pregnant 16 - year - old , reached No. 3 in a close contest , selling 68,000 copies , and this week the race for No. 1 looks just as tight .
On Monday morning Ms. Dawson is booked on “ The View ” on ABC to perform with Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches ; the group ’s song “ Anyone Else but You ” receives prominent treatment in the film .
