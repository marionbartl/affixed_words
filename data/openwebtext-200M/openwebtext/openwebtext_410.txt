Opinion A Marriage Made in Hell
She may be out of the campaign , but Hillary Clinton remains a powerhouse .
If Barack Obama is smart , he wo n't tap her as his vice presidential candidate .
Instead , he should make her his unofficial running mate .

A female bouncer at a gay nightclub was yesterday awarded £ 6,000 damages in a landmark case after claiming she was bullied by her boss for being heterosexual .
Sharon Legg , a married motherof - four , fought her case under legislation brought in to protect gay , lesbian and bisexual workers from discrimination .
The 33 - year - old is believed to be the first heterosexual to sue for harassment under the 2003 law .
She started work at Dream in Bournemouth in May 2005 and was promoted to head of security a year later by her boss Scott Rhodes .
However , he repeatedly mocked her as a " breeder " - a derogatory term in the gay community - she told an employment tribunal .
Door staff also refused to obey her instructions and constantly made life difficult for her , said Mrs Legg .
Matters came to a head in June last year - a month after her promotion - when she was sacked without warning after a dispute with a doorman .
Mrs Legg sued club owners Rubyz Limited and was awarded £ 3,000 for injury to feelings due to harassment and £ 3,222 for unfair dismissal because the company did not follow proper procedures .
" I did n't care about the money , " she said after the hearing in Southampton .
" I told my solicitor I would n't care if I only got five pence .
" I made this complaint for gay people , straight people , anyone who has ever been harassed .
" I 'm like a bulldog - I do n't let go .
I am friends with a lot of gay people and have had quite a lot of support from the gay community .
" I just think there are a few people who have a preference for their own kind . "
Her barrister , Sarah Courtney , said she believes it is the first time a heterosexual employee has used the sexual orientation regulations .
" The legislation was brought in to prevent gay and lesbian people from being harassed , " she added .
" This was an unusual case . "

Nick King , director of Rubyz Limited , may appeal against the tribunal ruling .
" We accept Sharon was dismissed without proper procedures being followed , " he said .
" But we have zero tolerance towards any kind of discrimination . "
Mrs Legg said her ordeal began when Mr Rhodes started working at the club , now called Rubyz .
" Everything was fine until then , " she added .
" He immediately promoted me , but then started saying , ' Urgh , you 're straight ' in passing .
" But he would say it in a jovial way and with a smirk - some might see it as banter .
" In the beginning , I just laughed it off .
Then he started saying , ' Urgh , you 're a breeder ' and that really started to grate .
" If I was saying , ' Urgh , you 're gay ' I do n't think he would have stood it .
" But he was my manager and I was the only straight woman in a gay environment , so I did n't know who to tell .
" It was like I was supposed to put up with it .
I also found that other members of staff were n't listening to me or following my instructions .
" I went into work one day and they basically said , ' It is n't working out - see you ' .
" That was it - I was given no reason for being sacked .
" There is law that protects all sexual orientations .
It should n't matter whether you are heterosexual , gay or bi - no one should be harassed at work . "
Success in the workplace depends on being a good time manager , because it does n't matter how good you are at your job if you never have time to do it .
Here are the four most important steps you can take to end that feeling that you “ ca n't get everything done ” .
Prioritize ruthlessly
Most people who are too busy to get everything done are not really too busy : they are procrastinators .
Everyone has time to do the most important thing on their to - do list each day .
Most people have time to do the top five things .
Problems arise when people do the number eight thing first because it 's easy .
Instead of doing the easy things , do the things that will have the most impact .
Many days , for me , that means doing one very difficult thing that has the potential for big , long - term reward .
The problem is that this one thing probably has a lot at stake ; if it goes poorly , then no long - term reward .
So I get nervous about doing it .
The number - eight task has little impact , so doing it poorly does n't scare me as much .
In the worst case , this sort of prioritization goes on all day .
If you choose to do the easy things first then at the end of the day , when there 's no time , you make yourself crazy trying to get the top of your to - do list done .
Whereas if number eight is not done , you can go home anyway .
Stop doing research
One of the biggest black holes on a to - do list is research .
“ I need to read this book before I start writing , ” or “ I need to have three more numbers before I start the project . ”
In most cases , you can start without all the research .
My friend Mary just fired someone who procrastinated so much she was frozen at her desk .
This person 's job was to write client work proposals , but in each case , she would say she needed more information in order to write the proposal .
Mary would tell her to make up assumptions for the information she did n't know , and fix it later .
But this employee could not do it ; she was so scared to get started on the proposals that she could always think of another number she needed from the client .
Sort immediately
Another form of procrastination is pile - making .
To read a piece of paper briefly and then put it in a pile to be read again is to double your work .
In most cases , though , a pile maker does not want to make a decision about that piece of paper until it is an emergency .
If you forced yourself to deal with every piece of paper as soon as you touch it , you will find that you deal with papers in 50 % less time .
Barnes &
Noble is so convinced of this theory that the company has made touch - it - once company policy .
When Barnes & Noble opens a new store , hundreds of workers unpack boxes of books .
Some books are easy to shelve and some are difficult .
Rather than shelving the easy ones right away and making a pile of difficult ones , employees touch a book only once : you can not put it down until you know where it goes .
Call a spade a spade
This morning I sat down at my computer to write a column .
But first I checked email .
( I have four accounts .
I checked them all . )
Then I rechecked because I thought I should have received a more interesting batch of mail the first time around .
Then I told myself I could surf for just a little .
I came a cross a study from the University of Carleton that said cyber - slacking is the new form of procrastination , and it's killing peoples ' productivity .
I saw myself in that study .
So I took my computer to a local cafe where I cannot connect to the Internet .
The Internet is useful , yes , but in most cases , it ’s a way to take a break from doing the hard stuff .
It seems that most of time management is being honest with yourself :
At each moment , ask if you ’re doing the most important thing or the easiest thing .
The more honest you are with yourself , the more time you ’ll find in your day .
Hong Kong is attracting more and more senior banking figures
The number of high - flying investment bankers moving from the US to Asia is set to increase , experts have said , as a result of the credit crunch .
A senior Credit Suisse executive is the latest in a string of " dealmakers " to relocate from New York to Hong Kong .
Big takeover deals are scarce in the US and Europe as the credit squeeze has made it hard for firms to source funds .
But corporate activity has remained buoyant in Asia , driven by Chinese firms and foreign private equity .
' Follow the money ' According to Dealogic , which supplies IT solutions to the banking industry , the number of acquisitions by private equity in Asia - excluding Japan - rose 15 % in the first quarter of the year while worldwide deals fell .
Vikram Gandhi , head of Credit Suisse 's Global Financial Institutions Group , is moving to Hong Kong to personally oversee the firm 's corporate finance business in the region .
Credit Suisse is a leading corporate adviser on merger and acquisitions in the region and is involved in deals , according to Dealogic , worth $ 12.5 bn this year .
Once you get critical mass in a location , it begins to snowball and that is what is happening in Asia
Professor Scott Moeller , Cass Business School Mr Gandhi , who will continue to run the group 's Americas business , will follow in the footsteps of executives from JP Morgan , Goldman Sachs and Blackstone Group who have also migrated to Asia in recent months .
" Investment bankers follow the money , " said Scott Moeller , a Professor at the Cass Business School and former executive with Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley .
" With sovereign wealth funds having a lot of money , with Asia having escaped the worst of the credit crunch and with the crunch having hit the US and Europe the hardest , it is not surprising at all .
" Once you get critical mass in a location , it begins to snowball and that is what is happening in Asia . "
Market competition
As investment banking profits are squeezed in US and Europe by the credit crunch , institutions are turning to Asia where many Chinese and Hong Kong firms are flush with cash , having raised capital by listing shares in recent times .
The dynamism of the Chinese economy and the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a financial centre meant this management trend was likely to continue even when financial markets returned to normality in the US and Europe , Professor Moeller added .
But indecision in China about how Hong Kong and Shanghai should compete as financial hubs was likely to ensure the former did not overtook London or New York , he said .
" I would be more worried if I was in a third tier financial centre like Paris or Frankfurt than in London or New York , " he said .
" I do n't think London or New York will be losing their crowns as leading financial centres any time soon . "
The most recent Global Financial Services Centre Index ranked Hong Kong in third place behind London and New York .

What are these ?
The most detailed scientific analysis to date disproves the theory that an earthquake that happened two - days before the mud volcano erupted in East Java , Indonesia , was potentially to blame .
The report by British , American and Indonesian and Australian scientists is published this week in the academic journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters .
It outlines and analyses a detailed record of operational incidents on the drilling of a gas exploration well , Banjar - Panji - 1 * .
Lead author , Prof Richard Davies of Durham University , UK , published research in January 2007 which argued the drilling was most likely to blame for the eruption of the ‘ Lusi ’ mud volcano on May 29 2006 .
This theory was challenged by the company that drilled the well and some experts who argued that the Yogyakarta earthquake two days before the eruption , which had an epicentre 250 km from the mud volcano , was the cause .
Graduate student Maria Brumm and Prof Michael Manga of University of California , Berkeley undertook a systematic study to test the claims that the eruption was caused by this earthquake .
They found that none of the ways earthquakes trigger eruptions could have played a role at Lusi .
Prof Michael Manga , of University of California , Berkeley , said : “ We have known for hundreds of years that earthquakes can trigger eruptions .
In this case , the earthquake was simply too small and too far away . ”
The new report concludes the effect of the earthquake was minimal because the change in pressure underground due to the earthquake would have been tiny .
Instead , scientists are “ 99 per cent ” certain drilling operations were to blame .
Prof Davies , of Durham University ’s Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems ( CeREES ) explained : “ We show that the day before the mud volcano started there was a huge ‘ kick ’ in the well , which is an influx of fluid and gas into the wellbore .
We show that after the kick the pressure in the well went beyond a critical level . ”
“ This resulted in the leakage of the fluid from the well and the rock formations to the surface – a so called ‘ underground blowout ’ .
This fluid picked up mud during its accent and Lusi was born .
He said chances of controlling this pressure would have been increased if there was more protective casing in the borehole .
Prof Davies added : “ We are more certain than ever that the Lusi mud volcano is an unnatural disaster and was triggered by drilling the Banjar - Panji - 1 well . ”
Prof Manga added : “ While this is a most unfortunate disaster , it will leave us with a better understanding of the birth , life and death of a volcano . ”
Lusi is still flowing at 100,000 cubic metres per day , enough to fill 53 Olympic swimming pools .
Recent research which Prof Davies was involved in showed it is collapsing by up to three metres overnight and could subside to depths of more than 140 metres , having a significant environmental impact on the surrounding area for years to come .
* The well is operated by oil and gas company Lapindo Brantas , which has confirmed the published data is correct .
Here is a screenshot I took while I was working recently , to document a fascinating project .
The project involves resurrecting a bit of technology from the 1600s .
In the screen snapshot , I am entering numbers into a text file .
I am copying the numbers , as you can see , from a digital facsimile of an old book that contains some curious latin writing .
The numeric tables in the book are copies of tables that were inscribed on wooden rods and stored in a box , or ark , called the Organum Mathematicum .
The Organum was invented by Father Athanasius Kircher , the Jesuit polymath , and described in detail by Kircher ’s disciple and associate , Kaspar Schott , in a 1668 book named after the device .
The tables I am copying come from this book .
The Organum , a kind of primitive slide rule or abacus , aided various kinds of mathematical calculations , including multiplication , fortifications , horology , astronomy , astrology and so on .
It was meant to be used the way we might use a laptop computer .
Like a modern laptop , it contained a distillation of various bits of knowledge in a convenient form .
There are 10 sets of rods in the Organum , and the 10th and final set of rods allow non-musicians to compose music for church services .
The rods contain short musical phrases that are intended to be combined together to create longer pieces .
It is the data on this 10th set of rods that I entered into my own laptop computer .
A few of these Organums still exist , including this beautiful late 18th century model in the History of Science Museum in Florence .
You can see some of the rods , which have been removed on the lower right .
There are also existing versions of a related device , the Arca Musarithmica or Arca Musurgica which contained tables for music only , and had a larger set of music tables than the Organum .
This device was described in detail in book 8 of Kircher ’s massive tome , Musurgia Universalis ( 1650 ) , shown below , with the fold - out illustration of the Arca .
I mentioned this book a couple of weeks ago , in connection with Cuckoo Clocks .
I am in the process of writing a computer program that executes Kircher ’s instructions for composing music , using the tables or tariffa in these two books .
My program , is a Perl script called Organum .
You provide the program with a few parameters , such as the title of a particular hymn that you wish to set to music , or a particular set of tables you wish to use , and it does the rest , randomly combining various musical phrases from these tables ( according to Kircher ’s instructions ) and assigning pitch and rhythmic values from the tables .
The program is basically working now , but still needs a little more data and some finessing .
I have a complete set of tables from the Organum , but do not yet have complete set from the Arca .
Here is a sample of music produced by Organum .
( Click for MIDI )
Organum outputs music in the ‘ ABC Plus ’ format .
There are some great open - source utilities for converting these files into sheet music and MIDI files on the ABC Plus web site .
Here is a sample 4 - part vocal score produced by my Organum , using some of the other tables from Kircher ’s Organum .
Here I have used the Organum tables to set the words to the hymn Ut Queant Laxis Resonare to music .
Coincidentally , this is the hymn from which we get the musical names “ DO RE ME FA SOL LA SI , ” originally “ UT RE ME … ” — these are the first syllables of each line of verse .
( Click for PDF )
Ut Queant , is in Sapphic meter , containing lines of 11 , 11 , 11 and 5 syllables .
There is a set of tables in the Organum for setting hymns in this style , as well as 3 other popular styles ( in 1650 ) .
Most latin hymns are Ambrosian or Gregorian , and are in iambic tetrameter , having 8 syllables per line .
Kircher refers to these as Archilochean verses , and provides tables for setting them in two different musical styles : the stylo simplico , or 1st species counterpoint , and the stylo florido , or 5th species counterpoint .
According to Kircher ’s instructions , the following choices can be made arbitrarily :
Which of 8 modes or scales ( Dorian , Lydian etc. ) to set the piece in .
, etc. ) to set the piece in .
The choice of pitch phrases for each strophe of verse ( typically 4 strophes , each with 6 or more phrase choices ) .
The rhythm to assign to each pitch phrase ( 6 or more per strophe ) .
Which melodic line to assign to each of the upper voices ( Canto , Alto , Tenor — 6 possible combinations )
Because of all the possible combinations , the Organum ( and my software ) is capable of producing about a million pieces of music .
Of course , since the music is generated from a small set of source phrases , and is intended to create polyphonic hymns in a particular style , its expressive range is limited .
Nonetheless , by substituting the tables , it would be possible to use Organum to generate music in other well defined styles ( with correspondingly limited expressive ranges ) , such as ragtime , or 50 ’s rock & roll .
Of course , algorithmic composition has come a long way since 1650 , and there are newer and better ways of accomplishing this , such as David Cope ’s Experiments in Music Intelligence .
Nonetheless , Kircher ’s algorithm has a very similar result to a method used in modern computer - aided compositions : Markov Chains .
In this style of composition , you analyse existing pieces of music for their statistical properties , recording which groups of notes are likely to follow other groups of notes .
You then use this information ( which is a kind of digest of the original piece ) to create new compositions in the style of the original piece .
Because Kircher has recorded little snippets of music in the tables in the style he wishes to emulate , the result is very similar to what you get with Markov Chains .
Eventually , I hope to build a physical Organum or Arca to house my software .
The box will resemble the real thing , and will contain wooden rods , which trigger hidden switches which operate the software .
The box will have a MIDI output in the back and will be used in live performance .
All in all , an interesting project which combines a number of interesting disciplines , including computer science , music , history and art .
I would like to thank Dr. Hans - Joachim Vollrath , professor of Mathematics at the University of Wurzburg ( where Kaspar Schott once taught ) , for his assistance in providing photographs of the tables in Organum Mathematicum .
You can learn more about the Organum and its other , non-musical capabilities , at Vollrath ’s excellent website .
I will post more files , including my perl scripts , when the project is a little closer to completion .
PEBKAC Attack :
When logging logons leads to leaks of luser 's lore
PEBKAC Attack :
When logging logons leads to leaks of luser 's lore
In a secure environment it 's usually in the best interest of the organization to log failed and successful user access r , but there are times when logs may contain information that is best kept secret .
I doubt I 'm the first to come up with this idea , but I 'd like to discuss it and give it a name for future reference :
The PEBKAC Attack .
Here 's a simple example of how this attack works that I think many of us security geeks will relate to .
I 've noticed in the past that once I know my logon password really well I can type it in without consciously thinking about it .
Sometimes I do it so fast I hit the wrong series of control keys and end up typing my password in the user name field by accident .
This happens to me fairly often on Windows boxes that I login to or unlock regularly .
This of course causes my password to be saved ( in plaintext ) as a name in a failed login attempt record ( assuming auditing is turned on ) .
This has led me a few times to have to go into Event Viewer and delete the record from the Windows Security event log ( Of course , this problem does happen on more than just Windows boxes , so * nix guys may want to check their / var / log / * files ) .
While doing security audits in the past I 've manually gone into logs to see if I could find just these sorts of user mistakes , what I like to call a PEBKAC Attack .
Rather than having to do it manually all of the time I 've decided to write a quick and dirty script in Autoit3 to automate the process of searching for such a series of events in the Windows Security log .
What my script does is :
1. Look in the event log for a failed logon ( Event ID 529 ) , and then notes the user name involved .
2 . Finds the next logon that was successful ( Event ID 538 or 540 ) , and then notes the user name involved .
3. Compares the two user names .
4 . If they do not match , the script prints both to Stdout .
The failed login name is presented as a possible password and the next successful logon as a possible user name for that password .
The command is simple to use , and I 've even included the source which you can compile in Autoit3 .
If you issue it without any parameters it queries the event log on the local box :
C:\> pebkac.exe
Irongeek 's PEBKAC Attack on the Windows Security Event Log ver .
1
Successful Login ( 18 ) : Adrian
Possible Password ( 2 ) : ir0n g33 k
Successful Login ( 871 ) : Adrian
Possible Password ( 869 ) : network logon password
C:\>
And if you specify the UNC name of another box it will try to parse the log from it :
C:\> pebkac.exe \\cthulhu
Irongeek 's PEBKAC Attack on the Windows Security Event Log ver .
1
Working on \\cthulhu ...
Successful Login ( 868 ) : Admin
Possible Password ( 864 ) : god
Successful Login ( 871 ) : Adrian
Possible Password ( 869 ) : network logon password
C:\>
Pretty simple over all .
Now , I know there will be some people who will question the usefulness of this sort of attack , so I will try to preemptively answer some of their questions .
1 . Do n't you have to be an admin to see the log ?
How is this useful ?
Answer :
Well , it 's easy to get local admin access on a workstation , I 've done many videos and articles on that subject .
After a pen-tester gained admin access on the local computer he could use this attack find a password for an Active Directory Domain user that fat - fingered his credentials .
This could work great for privilege escalation .
2 . Are n't there a lot of false positive ?
Answer :
Yes , there can be .
But with a little thought it 's easy to figure out which ones may be real passwords and which are just background noise .
Also , this script includes the record numbers in which it found the events if you want to open them up in Event Viewer and take a look at them and the surrounding events yourself .
Also , sometimes my parsing may be off as to which successful logon goes with which failure .
Feel free to contribute fixes for my lack luster programming logic .
3 . So , you have to be an admin to use this attack ?
Answer :
Well , for this specific tool , yes , but for some other systems the logs may be world readable .
Also , it 's possible to slightly modify the code to read an offline event log if you like .
Please send me your feedback on this script and attack method via the forums I frequent :

http://www.governmentsecurity.org/forum/?showtopic=29098
and if you try this attack on something other than a Windows Event Log I 'd love to see and host your script here .
Also , feel free to modify my script , but I 'd like to get a copy of any improvements so I can give them to others .
I 'll be sure to add your handle / name to the source credits .

It was possibly the most laborious and least informative interview ever conducted .
It took about five minutes , yielded a one - word answer , and gave little real flavour of the subject .
Still - it was conducted using two whiteboards , two marker pens , and it was done over a distance of 3,471 miles ( 5,585 km ) .
How ?
Well there are two answers to that .
If you believe artist and inventor Paul St George then his " Telectroscope " connects New York and London via a ( very ) long tunnel running through the earth 's crust , with the images bouncing back and forth using mirrors .
The other explanation is that it is all done by optical fibres - take your pick .
One end of the " tunnel " emerges next to Tower Bridge on the banks of the Thames in London - the other is next to Brooklyn Bridge on the banks of New York 's East River .
It looks like something HG Wells might have imagined .
Each end has a giant telescope - like construction which appears to punch its way out of the earth .
There are dials , and levers , and thermometer gauges on the side of the 20 m long brass and wood construction .
Peer into it and you can see people on the other side of the Atlantic .
Wave at them , they wave back at you .
Write on the whiteboard , and ask a question , and they will write back .
Mesmerising
It is rather like using a giant web -cam , live streaming ( though we are told the internet is not involved and there is no audio connection ) between two of the world 's biggest cities .
So now you know why the following interview took so long .
Once you have got the whiteboard , and written your message on it , you have to angle it correctly so they can read it over in Europe .
" What is your name ? " I wrote .
The stranger at the other end , standing in front of Tower Bridge and surrounded by onlookers , picked up his marker and replied .
" Mik , " came back the answer , once he had angled his board correctly .
" Where are you from ? "
It is a piece of art , and it's also a sort of curiosity in a public space
Peter Coleman
New York organiser " Bangladesh . "
" What do you think of this ? " I asked .
( Top journalism , huh ? ) " GREAT ! " came the reply .
Told you it was informative .
Still it is kind of addictive and mesmerising , which strikes me as strange in a world in which we type , text , and Twitter every day , within seconds , to individuals on the other side of the planet without even thinking about it .
Peter Coleman is the producer for the New York end of the project .
" It is a piece of art , and it's also a sort of curiosity in a public space .
London and New York are cities with millions of people .
" They can't believe that those are actually people in another city looking at them .
That 's what I find all these people are sort of amazed at .
It pulls you right into it . "
English sarcasm
A group of children from California now cluster round the " Telectroscope " - waving and writing messages to the London end .
" That 's so cool - they can see us ! " one says as they get a wave back from Tower Bridge .
" They 're like way over there , and you 're sort of talking to them .
This is so much fun ! "
A New York policeman stands in front with a message .
A man at the other end writes something down .
" How 's the band ? " " I 'm with the NYPD , not the group The Police , " the copper writes back .
English sarcasm clearly does not work down a tunnel .
A New York football fan who presumably supports the English club Chelsea steps up : " Man U. Suck ! " he writes .
Tunnel vision - the view of London from New York
The people in London look perplexed , and a little annoyed to be frank - until someone points out that perhaps to them it reads : " Man , you suck . "
Then everyone gets very excited .
There are two women at the London end who are from New York City - they are writing where exactly they come from .
They hold up their sign .
" Bay Ridge Brooklyn , yer , go Bay Ridge ! ! " the New York crowd shout , and for a moment , two groups of strangers , in two cities thousands of miles apart , jump up and down and smile at one another .

What are these ?
It may not lead to heaven but if you design your staircase with some creative thought it can look the part !
A custom built staircase is only limited by the designer ’s imagination , and can make use of a wide variety of materials to produce what are often strikingly original forms .
Most of us probably take our staircase for granted and think of it as a simple way to ascend or descend between floors .
Stairs usually take center stage at the entrance to our home , so we walk you through the wide range of staircase styles and trends to optimize their performance .
Here are few tips while choosing the right stairs design :
Style– match your staircase to the style of home
Needs – do you need storage underneath
Natural home lighting – staircases can be dark so strategically position windows
Flooring surface – match your floor with your stairs
Safety – what are the capabilities of the homeowners eg children / elderly
Avoid tripping points – differ surfaces on entering and exiting so your body visualizes and feels the change
Here are the 15 most Creative and Modern Staircases Designs .
Storage Stairs :
This modern staircase from London - based Levitate Architects comes even more fascinating than what we ’ve seen earlier .
So you want something that will help you get organized similar to the Storage In Stairs , but you find yourself too squashed by your massive book collection to move around your house .
The Spacesaver Staircase Library merges the two issues , creating one solution .
Here is another storage staircase .
If you ’re having some stairs constructed why not consider this .
Handy and hidden , a great storage idea for linen , winter woollies , books and papers , anything small in fact .
Alternating Treated Stairs :
Floating Staircase
Retractable Staircase :
Crooked Stairs :
Glass Stairs :
XXS House :
Some More Interesting Staircase Designs :
This modern Storey staircase by Europa Stairways , could update any decor , adding a fresh twist to a standard staircase design .
This unique , high quality model is composed of the finest materials available and has been constructed using exquisite craftsmanship .
Staircase Design by Albini and Fontanot
A goal that remained elusive for 25 years has now allowed astronomers to obtain the most precise measurement of the cosmic temperature at an incredible distance ; in a well - hidden galaxy whose light has taken almost 11 billion years to reach us - about 80 % of the age of the universe .
The only way this galaxy can be seen is through the imprint its interstellar gas leaves on the spectrum of an even more remote quasar [ 1 ] .
“ Quasars are here only used as a beacon in the very distant Universe .
Interstellar clouds of gas in galaxies , located between the quasars and us on the same line of sight , absorb parts of the light emitted by the quasars .
The resulting spectrum consequently presents dark ‘ valleys ’ that can be attributed to well - known elements and possibly molecules , ” explains Raghunathan Srianand ( Pune , India ) , who led the team making the observations .
Thanks to the power of ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and finding the right target among about ten thousand quasars , the team was able to discover the presence of normal and deuterated molecular hydrogen ( H2 , HD ) and carbon monoxide ( CO ) molecules in the interstellar medium of this remote galaxy .
“ This is the first time that these three molecules have been detected in absorption in front of a quasar , a detection that has remained elusive for more than a quarter century , ” says Cédric Ledoux ( ESO ) , member of the team .
The same team had already broken the record for the most distant detection of molecular hydrogen in a galaxy that we see as it was when the Universe was less than 1.5 billion years old ( see ESO 16/06 ) .
The interstellar gas is the reservoir from which stars form and , as such , is an important component of galaxies .
Furthermore , because the formation and the state of molecules are very sensitive to the physical conditions of the gas , which in turn depend on the rate at which stars are formed and their influence , the detailed study of the chemistry of the interstellar medium is an important tool to understand how galaxies form .
Based on their observations , the astronomers showed that the physical conditions prevailing in the interstellar gas in this remote galaxy are similar to what is seen in our Galaxy , the Milky Way .
But most importantly , the team was able to measure with the best ever precision the temperature of the cosmic background radiation in the remote Universe [ 2 ] .
“ Unlike other methods , measuring the temperature of the cosmic background using the CO molecule involves very few assumptions , ” declares co-author Pasquier Noterdaeme .
If the Universe was formed in a ‘ Big Bang ’ , as most astrophysicists infer , the glow of this primeval fireball should have been warmer in the past .
This is exactly what is found by the new measurements .
“ Given the current measured temperature of 2.725 K , one would expect that the temperature 11 billion years ago was about 9.3 K , ” says co-author Patrick Petitjean .
“ Our unique set of VLT observations allows us to deduce a temperature of 9.15 K , plus or minus 0.7 K , in excellent agreement with the theory . ”
“ We believe our analysis pioneers interstellar chemistry studies at high redshift and demonstrates that it is possible , together with the detection of other molecules such as HD or CH , to use interstellar chemistry to tackle important cosmological issues , ” adds Srianand .
NOTES :
The team is composed of Raghunathan Srianand ( IUCAA , Pune , India ) , Pasquier Noterdaeme and Cédric Ledoux ( ESO ) , and Patrick Petitjean ( IAP , France ) .
The same team already made the first measurement of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation , at a time when the Universe was only about 2.5 billion years old , also using UVES on the VLT ( see ESO 27/00 ) .
At that time , they could only measure a temperature in the range between 6 and 14 K .
[ 1 ] Quasars are extraordinarily luminous objects in the distant Universe , thought to be powered by supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies .
A single quasar could be a thousand times brighter than an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars , and yet this remarkable amount of energy originates from a volume smaller than our Solar System .
[ 2 ]
One of the fundamental predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory for the creation of the Universe is the existence of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ( CMBR ) .
This relic radiation of the primeval fireball was discovered in 1964 by means of radio observations by American physicists Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson , who were rewarded with the Nobel Prize in 1978 .
Precision measurements by the COBE and WMAP satellites later showed that this ancient radiation fills the Universe , with a present - day temperature of slightly less than 3 degrees above absolute zero ( 2.725 K [ Kelvin ] , or - 270.4 °C ) .
A particular prediction of the Big Bang theory is that the Universe cools when expanding , the temperature scaling with the dilution factor of the Universe ( 1 + redshift ) .
At the redshift of the galaxy ( 2.41837 ) , one would thus expect a temperature of 2.725 x ( 1 + 2.41837 ) = 9.315 K or - 263.835 degree Celsius .
From YouTuber , Anon4Christ :
“ Philadelphia has finally permitted anti Scientology group , “ Anonymous ” , to Protest against the Church of Scientology in the city .
For the past two months , protesters in Philadelphia were denied protest permits because Scientology had obtained them first and the two groups are not allowed to hold dual protests .
However , the Church ’s critics have provided conclusive evidence that the Church had not actually held any protests on the days that they claimed .
As a consequence , the City of Philadelphia has denied a request by the Church of Scientology to hold a “ protest ” on June 14th , 2008 .
This is the same day that “ Anonymous ” had applied for a city permit to protest outside the Church .
The Managing Director ’s office stated that Scientology is no longer allowed to file any form of protest permit , due to its abuse of the permit process in order to block legitimate protesting on city property . ”
I 've been doing some experimenting with the emedded grammar code I wrote for Factor , trying to make it easier to use and a bit more useful for real world projects .
My inspiration for the changes has been seeing the kinds of things OMeta can do and the examples in the Steps towards the reinvention of programming from the Viewpoints Research Institute .
The original parsing expression grammar code ( in the vocab ' peg ' ) produced a data structure composed of Factor tuples that was interpreted at runtime via a call to the word ' parse ' .
It still has the data structure of tuples but now it can be compiled into Factor quotations , which are then compiled to native machine code via the Factor compiler .
The ' parse ' word calls ' compile ' on the datastructure and calls it .
I created a parsing word that allows you to embed the peg expression directly in code , have it compiled to a quotation at parse time , and then called at runtime .
Usage looks like :
" 1+2 " [ EBNF expr= [ 0 - 9 ] '+ ' [ 0 - 9 ] EBNF ] call
The older peg code had an < EBNF ... EBNF > embedded language and each rule in the language was translated to a Factor word .
That 's now changed to an EBNF : definition .
An example :
EBNF : expr digit = [ 0 - 9 ] => [ [ digit > ]] number = ( digit ) + => [ [ 10 digits > integer ] ] value = number | ( " ( " exp " ) " ) => [ [ second ] ] fac = fac:x " * " value :y => [ [ drop x y * ] ] | fac:x " / " value :y => [ [ drop x y / ] ] | number exp = exp :x " + " fac:y => [ [ drop x y + ] ] | exp :x " - " fac:y => [ [ drop x y - ] ] | fac ;EBNF
This creates a word , ' expr ' , that runs the last rule in the embedded language ( the ' exp ' rule in this case ) on the string passed to it :
" 1+2* 3+ 4 " expr parse - result - ast . => 11
If you 've used peg.ebnf before you 'll see some new features in this code :
You can do character ranges using code like [ a - zA - Z ] to match upper and lowercase characters , etc .
to match upper and lowercase characters , etc. Factor quotations can be embedded to process the results of choices .
Anything between the [ [ ... ] ] will be run when that choice succeeds and the result put in the abstract syntax tree for that rule .
The default AST produced by the rule is on the stack of the quotation .
The example above drops this in some cases , and transforms it in others .
will be run when that choice succeeds and the result put in the abstract syntax tree for that rule .
The default AST produced by the rule is on the stack of the quotation .
The example above drops this in some cases , and transforms it in others .
Rule elements can have variable names suffixed to it and these can be referenced in the action quotations .
This is implemented using locals .
This can be seen in EBNF code like this : exp :x " + " exp:y => [ [ drop x y + ] ]
Usually that rule produces an AST consisting of a 3 element sequence , each element being the AST produced by the rules elements .
The action quotation is transformed into :
[ let* | x [ 0 over nth ] y [ 2 over nth ] | drop x y + ] with - locals
This is efficient and makes the grammar easier to read .
*
Another major new feature is grammars now handle direct and indirect left recursion .
I implemented this from the VPRI paper Packrat Parsers Can Support Left Recursion .
It makes converting existing grammars to peg grammars much easier .
* Semantic actions have been added .
These are like normal [ [ ... ] ] actions except they have stack effect ( ast -- bool ) .
Given an abstract syntax tree from the preceding element , it should return a boolean indicating whether the parse succeeded or not .
For example :
odd= [ 0 - 9 ] ? [ digit > odd ? ]?
Some of the syntax has changed .
Previously { ... } was used for repeating zero or more times and [ ... ] was for optional .
Now I use (... ) * , (... ) + , (... ) ? , for zero or more , one or more , and optional respectively .
The dot (. ) is used to match anything at that point .
Terminals can be enclosed in single or double quotations .
was for optional .
Now I use , , , for zero or more , one or more , and optional respectively .
The dot (. ) is used to match anything at that point .
Terminals can be enclosed in single or double quotations .
There is a ' rule ' word that can be used to get a single rule from a compiled grammar : EBNF : foo number = ( [ 0 - 9 ] ) + expr = number '+' number ; EXPR " 1+2 " foo parse - result - ast => { " 1 " " + " " 2 " } " 1+2 " " number " \ foo rule parse parse - result - ast = > " 1 "
Notice the ' rule ' word returns the parser object rather than the compiled quotation .
This is useful for testing and further combining with other parsers .
These changes are in the main Factor repository .
There is the peg.pl0 and peg.expr vocabs as examples .
The peg.ebnf code is in an experimental state and is likely to change a lot until I 'm satisfied with it so be aware that it might not be wise to use it in stable code unless you 're happy with tracking the changes .
I welcome feedback and ideas though .
One feature I 'm currently working on but have n't put in the main repository yet is the ability to use the embedded grammar DSL to operate over Factor arrays and tuples .
This allows writing an embedded grammar to produced an AST , and another embedded grammar to transform that AST into something else .
Here 's what code to transform an AST currently looks like :
TUPLE : plus lhs rhs ; EBNF : adder num = . ? [ number ? ]?
plus = . ? [ plus ? ]? expr:a expr:b => [ [ drop a b + ] ] expr = plus | num ;EBNF
T{ plus f 1
T{ plus f 2 3 } } adder parse - result - ast . => 6
This uses features I 've already discussed , like semantic actions , to detect the type of the object .
The difference is that the parser produced by EBNF : operates not on strings , but on an abstract sequence type that is implemented for strings , sequence , and tuples .
I 'm still playing around with ideas for this but I think it 'll be a useful way to reuse grammars and string them together to perform tasks .
Innovative Fundraising for Obama $ 1 Million in a Minute
The latest salvo in the presidential hopeful 's Web campaign is a site designed to process a million dollars in 60 seconds .
Von Matt Vella
But first the freshman senator had to go through all the ....
In his prepared remarks Obama was ready to start blasting Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , to show the Illinois Democrat is moving on to the general election campaign .
Naturally , this being the Northwest where everything is not ruined quite yet , his staff had Obama visit an eco-friendly company , Vernier Software & Technology , that makes products for science teachers .
He could get education in there too , see ?
So there he was in Beaverton today at the start of a two - day swing through Oregon , virtually ignoring his remaining Democratic opponent , what 's - her - name from New York , as part of his new strategy to act like the actual nominee while she flails around way behind in numbers .
...obligatory delighted to see you , delighted to be here part of stump speeches that also require that you actually know where you are .
Obama pulled that off O.K .
But then he drifted away from the text a tad , as rookies are wont to do sometimes , forgetting how exhausting this primary process is and should be .
And trusting in their instincts , their very tired instincts .
" It is wonderful to be back in Oregon , " Obama said .
" Over the last 15 months , we ’ve traveled to every corner of the United States .
I ’ve now been in 57 states ?
I think one left to go .
Alaska and Hawaii , I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit , but my staff would not justify it . "
The Times ' conscientious Robin Abcarian thought she heard something different there .
She checked her tape recorder .
It had captured what he had actually said -- 57 states now .
A new Louisiana Purchase that 's gone unannounced so far ?
Was he channeling his inner John Kerry - Heinz 57 personality ?
( UPDATE :
At a later stop Obama was talking with reporters and expressed concern he'd also mis-stated the number of potential cyclone victims in Burma .
He said , " " I hope I said 100,000 people the first time instead of 100 million .
I understand I said there were 57 states today .
It 's a sign that my numeracy is getting a little , uh . "
At that point , an aide cut him off and ushered journalists out .
Before he could mis-speak again ? )
Oh , and as far as Hawaii voters are concerned , they 're probably delighted to learn that Obama 's campaign staff does n't think that tiny state can justify an appearance by his eminence , even though he did a lot of growing up there .
Or maybe because he was there .
Let 's see what they do with that in the Honolulu media , which the Republicans have probably already notifed .
Maybe it 's Obama 's age .
He 's getting up there in his forties , you know .
( ANOTHER UPDATE : Because of a new development in this situation another item on this subject has been posted here . )

AFTER reading about how Internet companies like Google , Microsoft and Yahoo collect information about people online and use it for targeted advertising , one New York assemblyman said there ought to be a law .
So he drafted a bill , now gathering support in Albany , that would make it a crime  punishable by a fine to be determined  for certain Web companies to use personal information about consumers for advertising without their consent .
And because it would be extraordinarily difficult for the companies that collect such data to adhere to stricter rules for people in New York alone , these companies would probably have to adjust their rules everywhere , effectively turning the New York legislation into national law .
“ Should these companies be able to sell or use what ’s essentially private data without permission ?
The easy answer is absolutely not , ” said the assemblyman who sponsored the bill , Richard L. Brodsky , a Democrat who has represented part of Westchester County since 1982 .
During Tuesday 's Democratic Presidential Primary coverage on MSNBC , Chris Matthews and Tim Russert both admit to ignoring the countless gaffes and blunders committed by John McCain .
Download Download ( h/t Silent Patriot )
This is one of those clips that makes you want to throw things at your tee vee .
( please do n't ! )
Matthews and Russert admit that MSNBC can't -- or refuses to -- multi-task .
The basic message was this : as long as there is a campaign battle between Obama and Clinton , they MUST ignore John McCain .
Russert even admits to being flooded with e-mails about their abysmal McCain coverage , but he tells Democrats to just be patient , when the time is right , they 'll pay attention to the train wreck of a campaign being run by the aging senator from Arizona :
Matthews : ... " You think the Democrat warhorses know that as long as there 's a fire going on in one of those rings , the Barack Obama ring , we 're not going to focus much on John McCain 's weaknesses ? "
Russert : " Yes , they believed initially that ignoring the McCain campaign was beneficial and helpful to the Democrats , but as this has gone on , they see in their minds , and we get flooded with e-mails , Senator McCain making a mistake on Shi'a vs. Sunni , making a mistake about the first Persian Gulf War and the second , vis -à - vis oil , his own relationship with Pastor Hagee and why is n't that talked about and reported on the way Reverend Wright 's relationship with Senator Obama is talked about .
But , all that in time .
It is only May .
This has been going on for some time , but it 's going to be a long , long campaign and when Senator McCain is back in the media 's light , he 'll receive the same kind of scrutiny . "
This is outrageous .
McCain is only out of the media spotlight because the McCain Media takes him out -- intentionally -- and it is detrimental to our election process .
The free pass allows McCain to continue to raise more money , look more presidential than he really is and garner good poll numbers , which gives him advantages he does n't deserve and would n't otherwise get if he were properly scrutinized .
Timmeh says they 've been flooded with e-mails about this , but he ain't seen nothin ' yet .
Send an e-mail to MSNBC and let them know that it is completely unacceptable to tell us that we have to wait for any amount of time or any reason before we see balanced coverage and scrutiny of John McCain 's disastrous campaign .

The Ministry of Defence ’s ‘ private ’ police force is using wide - ranging powers to stop and search thousands of tourists and other suspects , it can be revealed .
Armed street patrols , who are not required to identify themselves as MoD officers , are questioning people queuing for boat trips on the Thames or having their photograph taken in front of Big Ben .
Officers – who are routinely armed with sub-machine guns – say they are targeting those who match “ certain profiles or behaviours ” to deter terrorist attacks .
Their uniforms make them virtually indistinguishable from other police forces , but unlike regular officers , who are overseen by the Home Secretary and civilian police authorities , the MoD patrols are “ under the command ” of the Defence Secretary and a committee of civil servants .

It ’s finally over … or is it ?
In an unfortunate turn of events , it looks like Carlos Miller , the Miami photographer and journalist who was arrested last year while photographing police , has been sentenced to one year probation , 100 hours of community service , anger management class and a $ 540.50 court cost payment .
Interestingly enough , a jury found Miller not guilty of both disobeying a police officer and disorderly conduct .
They did find him guilty , however , of resisting arrest without violence .
The prosecutor in the case , Ignacia Vasquez , was asking the the court for 3 months probation , according to Miller , but instead judge Jose L. Fernandez threw the book at him giving him the sentence above .
Apparently the judge also suggested that Miller needed to visit Arlington National cemetery where the “ real heroes ” who fought for our freedom are buried .
It ’s unfortunate that in the United States of America a photographer can be given probation for the crime of photographing the police .
If Miller was “ not guilty ” of disobeying the police , and “ not guilty ” of disorderly conduct ( his two other charges ) , then he should not have been arrested at all .
I do n’t really understand how he could have “ resisted arrest ” without violence .
Did he say “ no ” you ca n’t arrest me ?
Was it verbal ?
Did he go limp and make them carry him away in handcuffs ?
But whatever the case I ’m not sure that it warrants a one year probation sentence along with the rest of the judge ’s package .
I ’m sorry to hear about this decision Carlos and hope that you appeal an obviously biased judge ’s ( the you should visit Arlington cemetery to see real heroes quote is over the top ) decision .

5 Ways to Sharpen Your Ruby - foo
I recently got around to reviewing some of my notes and bookmarks from David A. Black ’s “ Ruby for Rails ” and found a number of nifty Rubyisms which are worth remembering .
As a side note , I would definitely recommend the book to every Ruby / Rails developer , it fills an important gap between the pickaxe ( Programming Ruby ) and Agile Web Development with Rails .
As such , Agile will give you a gentle introduction to Rails , pickaxe will be your Ruby reference , and Ruby for Rails will help you cross the chasm from an everyday Rails user to a power programmer who is comfortable with the crooks and crannies of Ruby .
It ’s a solid investment , and I say this without any affiliation to the author !
If you ’re curious about what makes Rails tick , this is a great book to look into .
Working with collections
Sorting is always on the agenda and Ruby allows a couple of interesting constructs to simplify the process .
For example , if you want to sort an array with respect to some arbitrarily defined order ( i.e. another array of values ) , you can use the following snippet :
# sort by preferred order , return 0 -> aka , equal to if item is not specified preferred_order = % w{flute oboe violin} % w{oboe violin flute} .
sort_by { | i | preferred_order .
index ( i ) || 0 } # modifying the above idiom , we can easily randomize a collection [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . sort_by { rand }
Hashes also have a number of interesting options .
For example , instead of returning nil when a key does not exist , we can either return a default value , or even automatically create and initialize the entry :
# Set default to 0 ( instead of nil ) hash = Hash .
new ( 0 ) # hash .
has_key ? ' no_such_key ' => false # hash [ ' no_such_key ' ] =>
0 # hash .
has_key ? ' no_such_key ' => false #
Instead of simply returning a default , we can automatically initialize the value hash =
Hash .
new { | hash , key | hash [ key ] = 0 } # hash .
has_key ? ' no_such_key ' => false # hash [ ' no_such_key ' ] =>
0 # hash .
has_key ? ' no_such_key ' => true
Method search order
On every method call , Ruby will search its object space in the following order :
Current instance , followed by class methods Mixed in methods Superclass instance ( repeat 1 ) Object methods , followed by Kernel mixin
I often get confused with mixin , class , and instance method precedence , so this is a useful model to revisit and keep in mind .
Comparing objects
Perusing through the conditional constructs section of the book , I found an interesting distinction between object comparisons inside the case statement , versus the ‘ normal ’ scenario :
# Comparing objects inside a ' case ' statement def === ( other_object ) ; self .
value == other_object .
value ; end # Comparing objects def < => ( other_object ) ; self .
value < => other_object .
value ; end
Case statement uses the three - equals method ( string comparison ) when it examines an object ; a nice gotcha if you ever tried switching on a non to_s friendly construct .
As such , this means that if you want your custom object to behave properly when compared on a specific value , you need to define both methods , not just the spaceship operator ( < = > ) .
Lambda vs Proc
The line between lambda and proc constructs is blurry to say the least , but here is one gotcha that you definitely have to be aware of : calling return inside a proc is different from calling it in lamba !
def return_test l = lambda { return } l .
call # will continue p " Still here ! " p = Proc .
new { return } p . call # exits here puts " You wo n't see this message ! "
end
Useful one - liners
Finally , no list of Ruby - foo techniques would be complete without a selection of Ruby one - liners , which by the very nature of Ruby often accomplish more than a dozen of lines in other languages .
So here are a few useful snippets to add to your repertoire :
# List instance methods without ancestor methods String .
instance_methods ( false ) #
List all local variables local_variables # = > [ " _ " ] a = " test " local_variables # = > [ " _ " , " a " ] # Converting to different base with to_i " 2 " . to_i ( 2 ) =>
0 # convert 2 to base 2 # Convert a string like " 1 - 10 " to a range object ( 1..10 ) class String ; def to_range ; Range .
new ( * self . split ( " - " ) . map { | i | i . to_i } ) ; end ; end
Sonia
King says she was appalled when one of her coworkers made the proposition :
If she would marry an illegal immigrant , she could make $ 10,000 in cash .
A single mother of three , King was working as a legal secretary in the Broward State Attorney 's Office , the agency that prosecutes crimes , including marriage fraud .
This was exactly what the 42 - year - old single mother of three considered her fellow secretary 's request .
King reported her coworker , Adriana Vanegas , and the secretary was fired .
Not Vanegas , who still works at the State Attorney 's Office , but King , who says her life was made miserable by management after she filed the complaint .
Internal SAO records support her claim that she was systematically bullied and badgered by management before she was finally given a pink slip on January 30 of this year .
And the allegation of marriage fraud ?
It was tossed aside by the agency with a cursory investigation .
King 's story shows not only how lax State Attorney Michael Satz 's office can be when it comes to policing its own ranks , but it also provides a rather outrageous example of a cliquish workplace , drumming out an employee for having the nerve to point out wrongdoing in the ranks .
That it happened in what is supposed to be the county 's foremost bastion of justice only makes it more egregious .
And it is all the more curious when one looks at King 's work history and job performance at the State Attorney 's Office before she was fired .
" Very sweet lady ; very reliable , " one former boss noted in a reference for her before SAO hired her in April of last year .
" Good employee , " another said .
" She was a very good worker , very reliable , " remarked still another former employer .
Based on the recommendations , SAO hired King in April 2007 to work part - time as a legal secretary in the north satellite office in Deerfield Beach , where she assisted prosecutors with their paperwork .
Helping to train her was Vanegas , a secretary who had been working for the SAO since 2006 .
After King had spent just seven weeks on the job , her supervisor , Deborah Murphey , wrote to SAO 's human resources director , Renata Annati , that King was proving to be an able and dedicated employee .
" The attorney in this division Anna Hall is very pleased with her performance , " Murphey wrote in a May 30 email .
" Anna has come to me several times to let me [ know ] what a great job she is doing .
I would like for Sonia King to be considered for secretarial position at North Satellite , she would be a great addition to our support staff . "
After her promotion to full - time ( with pay of about $ 24,000 a year ) , King successfully completed her probationary period on July 3 .
Murphey gave her a good evaluation with satisfactory marks in all categories except " attitude " and " stress tolerance " — in which King was graded outstanding .
Monica Hofheinz , executive director of the north satellite office , wrote to her : " Congratulations ... you can be very proud of your contributions to the office , the Division , and the people of Broward County . "
It was n't long before things went sour .
She says her relationship with Vanegas was professional , though not very close .
They both spoke Spanish , and both had roots in Colombia ; King 's parents emigrated from the country before she was born , and Vanegas was born and raised in Bogotá .
King says Vanegas pulled her aside one day last August during a break at work .
Near the office vending machines , Vanegas asked her in Spanish if she would consider marrying a friend of her husband 's for $ 10,000 to help him get citizenship .
" Even though I am Hispanic , I was n't brought up to be like this , " says King , who was born and raised in New York .
" I felt belittled when she asked me to do that .
I was shocked . "
King says she ignored the request , but Vanegas brought it up on two more occasions .
She says that when she refused , Vanegas ' " whole attitude " changed toward her .
The workplace became tense , and Vanegas began complaining about King to the supervisor , Murphey .
Vanegas and Murphey were close , often lunching together , King says , and soon , she felt as if the pair were ganging up on her .
As the working environment deteriorated , King decided to report the marital proposition .
At the start of October , she made the complaint , telling Assistant State Attorney Lee Cohen about the proposition .
At the same time , she requested a transfer out of the north satellite office .
" I am unhappy here , " King wrote in an October 3 email to Murphey and Annati .
" Please consider me for the transfer , it will be greatly appreciated .
I am a hard working person and I have had no complaints from the attorneys about me or my work performance . "
In her reply , Annati did n't argue about her performance , but she turned King down , saying that there was a staff shortage and they needed her there .
King says she felt trapped .
On October 9 , SAO investigator Robert Grimm interviewed King under oath about the Vanegas proposition .
Soon thereafter , Grimm met with Hofheinz about the matter and closed the investigation .
He wrote in his investigative report that he did n't think the case could be prosecuted because the alleged proposition was n't made in front of other witnesses and King did n't know the identity of the man she was asked to marry .
But Grimm never questioned Vanegas about the incident or attempted to identify others who might have been involved .
King says another secretary in the division was privy to what had happened , and that person also was n't interviewed .
In fact , the only work Grimm reported doing was interviewing King .
SAO spokesman Ron Ishoy defended the obviously shallow investigation in an email : " The investigator did n't take a sworn statement from Vanegas because , after taking the statements he did take , he did not feel there was enough supporting evidence to go any further . "
The termination of the investigation , as well as the transfer denial , seem to have sealed King 's fate .
She says Vanegas and Murphey continued their campaign against her in the office .
" It was like a conspiracy started at that time , " says King , who lives in Boynton Beach with her three children .
" I was getting written up and I was getting reprimanded for the slightest thing . "
King 's personnel file backs up her claim .
Murphey reduced King 's lunch hour to 30 minutes because she was sometimes late to work due to traffic .
She took the keys to King 's desk .
She began to complain about her work performance , which up to that time had been deemed excellent .
Murphey did n't respond to an interview request ( her office said she was on vacation ) .
The conflict came to a boil on December 11 .
Murphey forced King to move the computer on her desk so she could have a direct line of vision to her employee .
The ostensible reason was to make sure she did n't talk on her cell phone , but King considered it just more harassment .
After King moved her computer , Murphey asked her to move boxes of papers on her desk as well .
King refused , prompting Murphey to complain in an email to Annati :
" I asked her to move boxes , she said , ' Why ?
That is the way I work , you set your desk up the way you want and I set mine up the way I want . '
Sonia said , I have a problem with her , that everyday it is something .
I asked her if she liked working here , she then ask me did I like working here , I replied yes .
I then said I wanted boxes moved , she said she was not moving boxes , she wanted an e-mail from Mr. Satz indicating that she was to move boxes . "
The standoff prompted a meeting among King , Murphey , Annati , and other supervisors .
King wrote an email directly to Satz : " I would like you to be in this meeting , because I am constantly being harassed by Debbie , along with Renata [ Annati ] .
In case you can not make it , I would like for you to come to north and have a meeting , because my supervisor 's attitude and behavior was unacceptable . "
Satz did n't make it to the meeting , during which Murphey complained about King 's work and King countered that Murphey was bullying her for no reason .
King , meanwhile , had no idea that Grimm had already closed the investigation .
She contacted him about it , an action that sent waves through management .
" Sonia has apparently been calling the investigator regarding the status of her complaint , " Hofheinz wrote to deputy chief investigator James Leonard on December 27 .
" Has she been advised that we do not see state criminal charges here and that she should take her complaint to the Feds or [ the immigration service ] ?
If the accused secretary is running a scam like this , they may be interested in following up . "
Here , incredibly , you have an example of the SAO not only failing to investigate alleged criminal activity in its own ranks but also suggesting that its own employee search out federal agents to find justice .
King 's days , meanwhile , were numbered .
The workplace was toxic .
She was fired January 30 , the official reason being for her " unsatisfactory work performance . "
King said she consulted with an attorney about the case but was told there was nothing to be done .
She has a new job , but it is low - paying , and she wept when she spoke of the experience .
" I 'm a good person , " she told me .
" This was n't fair .
And I have my kids , and I do n't know what I 'm going to do . "
Ishoy , meanwhile , claims the SAO did nothing wrong .
" Sonia King 's termination and the [ marital fraud ] investigation were unrelated , " he says .
" Sonia King was terminated for her inability to effectively perform the essential functions of her job .
She was evaluated by more than one supervisor , and several attempts were made to train her . "
Perhaps , but it seems her greatest sins were getting on the wrong side of a gang - like bureaucracy and failing to keep quiet .
Amy Goodman made note of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of RFK today with a tribute that included a useful history of the life and times of RFK , but Goodman also parroted the establishment line that Sirhan Sirhan killed RFK .
Following this statement , Goodman played a segment of an interview with Sirhan 's brother , Munir .
During the segment , Munir notes that Sirhan has no memory of what happened that night at the Ambassador Hotel , and never has been able to remember what happened that night .
Goodman then talked to John Pilger on the telephone , and Pilger made the stunning admission that not only was he there that night 40 years ago , he heard multiple shots , says that the shots kept coming even after Sirhan had been wrestled to the ground , and he told this to the FBI .
Something tells me that Pilger would strongly agree with the recently released acoustic evidence ;
JOHN PILGER : ... Sirhan leapt up on a serving area , pointed a gun at him and fired .
He was wrestled .
Kennedy fell .
He was wrestled to the ground , and then there were other shots .
There ’s no question that there was another gunman , because one of the people who was hit , just grazed , was standing next to me , and that happened when Sirhan Sirhan had been wrestled to the ground .
So that ’s the interesting thing .
There was another assassin or another several assassins .
And then it was bedlam .
And as you know , Kennedy died about twenty - four hours later .
AMY GOODMAN : John Pilger , what about Robert Kennedy ’s views of Vietnam ?
Also , of course , your view is not the standard one , that there were other assassins .
I 'm not even going to attempt to offer an explanation for Goodman 's behavior here ... there are no words ...
The June 9 issue of " People " magazine has a disturbing photograph of actor Harrison Ford .
There he is , the hunk aka Han Solo and Indiana Jones , walking along the beach at the Cannes Film Festival wearing a man-bra .
I swear .
[ Men vs. Women : Our Key Physical Differences Explained ]
Ford is dressed in a pair of black pants and a slate blue T - shirt that shows off his buff mid section .
But that T - shirt also reveals the shadow of what has to be a manzeer , in the parlance of Seinfeld .
And he needs it .
Mr. Ford , for all his aging manliness , has a set of man boobs that many women would envy .
Which brings us to the age - old question that anthropologists have been answering for centuries :
Why do men have breasts and nipples ?
They have them because men start out as women .
As much as men hate to hear this , the human fetal blueprint is initially female .
We all begin as a ball of cells that quickly differentiates into various body parts .
At five weeks of gestation , the fetus sports a neural tube that eventually becomes the spine , but other than that , we all look like a wad of chewing gum .
Then at six weeks ' gestation , the outlines of eyes , arms , legs and a face ( and let 's not mention the tail that also shows up for a while ) appear .
It 's not until about week six that the fetus also begins to take on the biological accoutrements of gender .
If the fetus has a Y chromosome , testosterone will turn the buds for sexual organs into testes .
Once in operation , those testes will pump out even more testosterone and , voila , a penis appears .
Female fetuses are n’t swayed by testosterone and so they stick with the fallback blueprint that calls for ovaries and a vagina .
But the developmental secret here is that breasts and nipples are already in place before testosterone shows its hand and starts shaping cells into male organs .
In other words , men have breasts and nipples because they already had them before they became male .
But then why did n't evolution opt to remove those seemingly useless female parts ?
Because evolution does n’t simply wipe out unnecessary physical bits and pieces .
Those parts have to be a burden , or be in the way of survival and reproduction for evolution to take notice .
Since there 's no real caloric cost to men having boobs , evolution has no impetus to erase them .
In fact , men 's breasts are a good lesson in the higgledy - piggledy way that evolution works .
Natural selection chooses for and against body parts , but there is no master plan that aims for the perfect creature .
Men have boobs , women get facial hair , and we all stand in front of the mirror asking , " Why ? "
Each person is , in fact , a Rube Goldberg sort of organism pieced together by biology and made up of good parts , bad parts and parts that are inconsequential .
But Mr. Ford should also know that his fans really do n’t care about the manzeer .
Believe me , even with the moobs ( man boobs ) , any woman over 40 would be glad to have him for the night , even if it meant throwing a towel over his chest .
In fact , wearing a manzeer is probably not hurting Mr. Ford 's potential reproductive success at all .
I bet there are lots of women of child - bearing age , those who watched " Star Wars " as babies , or those seeing Indiana Jones for the first time this summer , who would also be happy to close their eyes for a moment with what we gals know in our heart of hearts is a real man .
Manzeer be damned , we love him .

The Corbett Report decided to call up Barry Cooper , a political theory and social sciences professor at the University of Calgary who happens to be one of many Bohemian Grove members whose name appears in the 2006 roster that was sent anonymously to the Infowars office .
Many of these members belong to the world of academia , and some are even listed alongside their university .
Cooper admitted to being a member of the Bohemian Club and to attending the grove annually , but declined to further discuss what goes on at the power meeting , though he did deny taking part in the Cremation of Care ritual that grove members take part in each year .
The Corbett Report asked a number of poignant questions that Cooper left untouched , among them , one addressing the lack of transparency about the real political power structure , even as Cooper himself admits he leaves his students in the dark about what goes on behind the scenes .
CORBETT REPORT : " Do you ever mention the Grove when you ’re talking to your students about the power structures that govern global geopolitics ? "
COOPER : " I doubt it . "
Clearly a key meeting of the shadow government is indeed relevant to that global power structure , though much of its power draws from secrecy itself .

Hands Off Internet Gambling

Before the Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Domestic & International Monetary Policy of the US House of Representatives , April 2 , 2008 : Hearing on Proposed UIGEA Regulations
Mr. Chairman , I stand opposed to the regulations being discussed today because I opposed the underlying bill upon which these regulations are based .
The ban on Internet gambling infringes upon two freedoms that are important to many Americans : the ability to do with their money as they see fit , and the freedom from government interference with the Internet .
The proper role of the federal government is not that of a nanny , protecting citizens from any and every potential negative consequence of their actions .
Although I personally believe gambling to be a dumb waste of money , American citizens should be just as free to spend their money playing online poker as they should be able to buy a used car , enter into a mortgage , or invest in a hedge fund .
Risk is inherent in any economic activity , and it is not for the government to determine which risky behaviors Americans may or may not engage in .
The Internet is a powerful tool , and any censorship of Internet activity sets a dangerous precedent .
Many Americans rely on the Internet for activities as varied as watching basketball games , keeping up on international news broadcasts , or buying food and clothing .
In the last few years we have seen ominous signs of the federal government ’s desire to control the Internet .
The ostensible reasons are to protect Americans from sex offenders , terrorists , and the evils of gambling , but once the door is open to government intrusion , there is no telling what legitimate activity , especially political activity , might fall afoul of government authorities .
The regulations and underlying bill also force financial institutions to act as law enforcement officers .
This is another pernicious trend that has accelerated in the aftermath of the Patriot Act , the deputization of private businesses to perform intrusive enforcement and surveillance functions that the federal government is unwilling to perform on its own .
In conclusion , I urge my colleagues to oppose these new regulations and support Chairman Frank ’s HR 2046 , of which I am a cosponsor .
Although this bill has been criticized by some for its regulatory aspects , this act does not create any new federal laws and merely ensures that Internet gambling firms comply with existing federal law .
The passage of HR 2046 would restore the right of Americans to decide for themselves whether or not to gamble online .

Pentagon docs reveal ' murder , ' ' torture ' charges : ACLU RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Documents released by the Pentagon detail charges that detainees in Afghan prisons were beaten and doused with cold water before being forced into the snow , the ACLU charges .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which obtained the documents , says they provide the first " on - the - ground reports of torture " at a detention facility in Gardez , Afghanistan .
 These documents make it clear that the military was using unlawful interrogation techniques in Afghanistan ,  said Amrit Singh , an attorney with the ACLU .
 Rather than putting a stop to these systemic abuses , senior officials appear to have turned a blind eye to them . 
Military interrogators assaulted Afghan detainees in 2003 , using investigation methods they learned during self - defense training , according to Pentagon documents released Wednesday .
Detainees at the Gardez Detention Facility in southeastern Afghanistan reported being made to kneel outside in wet clothing and being kicked and punched in the kidneys , nose and knees if they moved , according to the documents .
A 2006 Army review concluded that the detainees were not abused but that the incident revealed misconduct that warrants further action . 
The documents , which were turned over Wednesday evening to the American Civil Liberties Union , focus on the 2003 death of Afghan detainee Jamal Nasser , who died in U.S. custody at the Gardez facility .
The documents detail interrogation techniques used on eight detainees , including Nasser , who were suspected of weapons trafficking .
The Army review found that abuse did not cause Nassers death .
But the documents include interviews with some interrogators who acknowledged slapping the detainees  a technique they learned during survival training at the Armys SERE school .
SERE stands for Survive , Evade , Resist and Escape .
 You say you gave permission for [ redacted ] to hit detainees during interrogations ; did you have a memorandum or order from your higher headquarters authorizing that ? a military criminal investigator asked one of the interrogators , according to a November 2004 transcript among the more than 300 pages of documents .
 No , I did not have a memorandum and had not seen one ,  the interrogator answered , according to the transcript .
 I used tactics that were used in SERE . 
The investigator continued :  Did you see [ redacted ] hit detainees during the interviews ? 
 Yes , open or closed slaps , not punches ,  the interrogator answered .
In another interview that day , according to the documents , the Army investigator asks whether  you ever heard of a tactic of pouring cold water or a water and snow mix on persons captured ?
 They do spray cold water on prisoners ,  the interrogator answered , referring to SERE lessons .
That interrogator was unaware , however , of men in his unit pouring cold water over the detainees , as the Afghans later complained .
ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said such interrogation techniques are taught at SERE schools only to show soldiers how to withstand them from enemy captors .
She called the methods , when used together , a form of torture .
 They were intended to be defensive methods , not offensive methods ,  Singh said .
 This raises serious questions about the interrogation methods that were being applied in Afghanistan . 
SERE methods were also used on detainees by military interrogators in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Singh said .
The Pentagon and the Army did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening .
The 2004 criminal inquiry of Nassers death was among a string of probes into alleged abuse of prisoners in U.S. jails in Afghanistan .
Trying to deflect the kind of scandal that followed the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ordered a review of their secretive network of about 20 jails at bases across Afghanistan .
Nasser was among eight detainees who were held at Gardez for between 18 and 20 days .
The Army concluded he died of a stomach ailment .

Friend & Manager Says Palfrey ‘ Feared for Her Life ’ ; Believes Behavior Before Death Disputes Hasty Suicide Ruling
Aaron Dykes / Jones Report | May 6 , 2008
A new handwriting sample [ See pages 1 – 2 – 3 ] obtained from Palfrey ’s building manager , Joseph Strizack , could be instrumental in determining the cause of ‘ DC Madam ’ Deborah Jean Palfrey ’s suspicious death .
Strizack provided a copy of a handwritten letter Palfrey mailed him in April 2004 in hopes that a comparison with the alleged suicide letters found by authorities could shed light on the truth in what he believes was murder .
In a cursory analysis of the alleged suicide letters , it is readily apparent that the writing was done slowly , carefully and very meticulously ( as one might in forging a permission letter from a parent ) .
A comparison between Palfrey ’s 2004 note shows a difference , for example , in the number " 2 " ( which is curled in the suicide letter but not in the note ) and in letters like " T . "
Other characters are more alike , while the overall writing style is clearly similar , and if forged , then obviously imitated .
" She insinuated that there is a contract out for her and I fully believe they succeeded , " Strizack previously told WESH 2 news .
Writing sample from 2004 letter sent from Palfrey to Strizack .
Strizack cited a conversation with Palfrey only days before her death where she told him that she ‘ feared for her life ’ had been ‘ followed ’ in the D.C. area .
According to Strizack , Palfrey said she felt ‘ safe ’ at her Florida residence at Park Lake Towers because it has a closely - monitored surveillance system .
Strizack told the Alex Jones Show that Palfrey also confided that her client list went " from the White House on down , " including " a lot of influential people " from both political parties .
Certainly , the political weight of her client list indicates reason enough to treat her death as suspicious– as silencing her would be a strong potential motive in the case of murder .
Alleged suicide note to Palfrey ’s mother .
Palfrey stated on at least two programs , including the Alex Jones Show , that she would ‘ never commit suicide , ’ also telling Jones privately to suspect murder if she were found dead .
These statements correlate with accounts from both Strizack and Palfrey ’s mother indicating that she was not suicidal
While forensic analysis and comparison could prove whether or not Palfrey wrote the suicide letters , it may not rule out murder .
As Alex Jones has discussed in the past , political assassinations made to look like suicide are sometimes covered - up by forcing the victim to write a suicide note under threat of harm coming to their family .
As Paul Watson pointed out , many of the reasons indicated in the letters contradict the Palfrey ’s stated attitude towards her impending court case and potentially serving time in prison .

I have a good friend , Kate , who I happen to really like because she is one of the few people on the playground who will actually make an effort to talk to me .
This is a big deal when , as the sole father , you ’re surrounded by moms who will only give a man the time of day if he ’s got a binky in his mouth .
Now as you may have guessed , one of our favorite things to talk about is our children .
Kate is a firm believer that being a parent not only makes us feel young again , but it makes us better people .
While I disagree with the part about feeling younger since I feel so old , I wholeheartedly agree that my children have made me a better person , and they have accomplished this by giving me no choice in the matter .
For some of us , the best way to better oneself is when we are forced into it .
I know that for myself , it is the only way .
You see , before we had children , I was more than a little self - absorbed .
I tended to value every situation only for what was in it for me , and my relationships were based on the concept of “ what have you done for me lately . ”
Needless to say , I spent a great deal of time alone , whining and feeling sorry for myself , which , by the way , are trademark qualities of the self - absorbed .
To make matters worse , I tended to give up and run away from challenges , and my life was basically without purpose or ambition .
Apparently , I ’m not alone .
In his recent book , Boys Adrift , the writer Leonard Sax examines a growing trend in under - performing boys who lack any motivation or drive .
Covering the entire demographic spectrum , these young men are devoid of purpose , relying on their parents or girlfriends well into their thirties for support while they drift aimlessly through life , feeling not a shred of remorse for their actions , or lack thereof .
So I guess in a way I was at the forefront of this movement .
A pioneer , if you will .
And it took my children to rescue me .
They accomplished this through one simple feat : they forced me to grow up and deal with my life .
Children , after all , do n’t come with an exit plan .
You ca n’t just walk away , although plenty of us probably try .
They rely on us in so many ways , and regardless of how tenaciously we hold onto our self - absorption , they will always find a way to pry away the spotlight and shine it on themselves , thereby forcing us to make sacrifices .
It is the process of making sacrifices that is the key to being a good parent , and along with the willingness to compromise , goes a long way to making us better people , as well .
It is n’t always easy .
Our kids challenge us in ways we never imagined , pushing us to the edge of tolerance on a daily basis , denying us the things that we hold so dear .
Sleep ?
Who needs it ?
A nice quiet meal ?
I would n’t count on it .
Sex ?
Let ’s not even go there .
I think it ’s fair to say that nothing in our lives adequately prepares us for what ’s in store , no matter what you ’ve been told or seen on TV .
In the words of the late John Lennon , “ Nobody told me there ’d be days like these ! ” except as parents , we find ourselves repeating this every day .
But it is through the odyssey of parenthood that we come to have a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses , not to mention how much we can actually accomplish if we just try .
These are questions that we rarely confront when we sequester ourselves within the safety and security of our daily routines , i.e. , our comfort zones .
This is especially true for men , for the things that we ’ve come to rely on to define us , like money , power , sexual prowess , and our hair all mean nothing to our children .
Instead of turning to our masculine default mechanisms for coping with any given situation , we are forced to respond with finesse and ( gulp ! ) sensitivity .
Somewhere along the way , we are able to achieve a greater balance .
But perhaps most importantly for moms and dads alike is that children give us purpose , and who does n’t benefit from having a little purpose ?
It helps us find our place in the grand scheme of things , to take stock of what is really important in our lives and to see things within the context of something larger than simply ourselves ; namely our families .
I know that for myself , being a father inspires me to want to be a better person .
I can now cope with hardship and adversity , forsaking my usual whining and complaining because not only does my wife not want to hear it , but my children are better at it than I am .
Having endured the challenges that parenthood has thus far presented to me , and I know it ’s only the beginning , I am more confident in my abilities and am less inclined to quit or give up ( as if I had a choice ) , even when every fiber of me being is begging me to .
As cliché as it may sound , feel like I can do anything , and at the very least , am more willing to try .
And finally , being a father has restored a lot of the magic in my life ( I know , it sounds corny , but such is the life of a parent ) .
I now take less for granted and celebrate the simple things .
Life has once again become a journey of discovery , to be shared with the ones I love .
All too often , when we ’re immersed in the daily grind , we lose sight of this and need to be reminded of it .
We can count on our children for that .

Then after the last night of primary ballot - counting , Clinton and Obama spoke briefly about each other .
McCain uttered one sentence ...
But then in the final weeks of the primary season , as the inevitable delegate math closed in on Clinton , she attacked Barack Obama , of course .
He was ahead .
And she clearly did n't want four more years of President Bush .
John McCain , already running for the general election , attacked Obama .
And Obama fired back at the Republican .
But why would the Democratic candidate mention the Republican at all ?
Let alone in a positive way as qualified to be president in comparison to a fellow Democrat ?
A pretty good zinger that got Clinton into the day 's news flow while her plane was heading to an Austin , Texas , rally .
She 'd shaken hands at a factory gate in Toledo , Ohio , then before flying to Texas held a media availability where she said : " Sen .
McCain brings a lifetime of experience to the campaign .
I bring a lifetime of experience .
And Sen. Obama brings a speech he gave in 2002 . "
It 's one of those things that sneaks up on you in politics , a sense of things happening not quite as you expected .
It started in April when our Times colleague Louise Roug called with a quote from Sen. Hillary Clinton .
... about Obama .
And then the Arizona Republican said this about the wife of the only Democrat to be elected twice since FDR : " Sen. Clinton has earned great respect for her tenacity and courage .
The media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of Americans , and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received .
" As the father of three daughters , I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach .
I am proud to call her my friend . "
And then a week ago this morning it became clear that the Democratic Party was forcing Clinton to end her bid .
On Saturday , Obama went golfing .
Clinton and her family dressed as if for a funeral and went to thank their supporters with a grateful speech and , on paper , a hearty , full endorsement of Obama .
But something was missing .
Not one word in the speech about the Republican nominee that Obama must now confront for the White House .
As she was speaking , the McCain campaign 's new website blog , The McCain Report , posted a special tribute to the losing Democratic candidate , familiarly headlined " Hillary Out , " something the Obama campaign did n't fully match for two days .
" Sen. Clinton has really grown on us , " McCain blogger Michael Goldfarb wrote .
" She ran an impressive campaign ... an impressive candidate ... inspired a generation of women .
... Sen. Clinton also did n't mention John McCain once during her speech .
This came as something of a surprise over here , and a pleasant one at that .
But it 's clear that John McCain and Hillary Clinton respect each other -- and there is a genuine affection for her here at McCain HQ . "
The blog post included a photo of McCain and Clinton together on a ship in the Arctic during one of their several journeys as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
These things do not happen on official campaign websites spontaneously or by accident .
Nor does the enemy get accidentally omitted from a major speech .
So The Ticket called a bunch of people who know both McCain and Clinton .
It 's true , they confirmed , there is a special friendship between them .
And it apparently started in January of 2001 , when Clinton became the first former first lady elected to public office and walked into the U.S. Senate .
It has always been a gentlemen 's club , if not always populated by gentlemen .
And the warmth toward Clinton was missing .
Until McCain walked up and heartily welcomed the newcomer and showed her around .
" They really hit it off , " said one friend .
They shared many things , including a candid tongue .
Both also have at times been at odds with their own parties .
They found they could work together across the aisle as committee members and enjoyed each other 's company on fact - finding trips around the world .
In Estonia , according to one famous tale , Clinton challenged McCain to a vodka shot - drinking contest , which he readily accepted .
Later , McCain remarked to friends " she was one of the guys , " a high compliment among guys .
Learning about their unexpected friendship got us to thinking about a few things .
What if McCain and Clinton , both their party 's front - runners a year ago today , ended up confronting each other in the general election ?
Would we have seen a more civil campaign for a change ?
According to several sources , including the Atlantic 's respected Marc Ambinder , McCain came within a breath of publicly promising last year that his would be a one - term presidency .
Aides convinced him it was an unnecessary chip to discard then .
Meanwhile , Clinton appears to be delivering early on her commitment to help Obama , steering her financial supporters to assist him in recent days , though some demur .
She 's promised " to do all that I can " to help ensure his election , which sounds good but is practically hard to define .
There will be some grand unity event soon .
And at the Denver convention .
But we 'll see about the fall come fall .
The fact is , many of her 18 million supporters may not go for Obama .
Would n't it be an amazing end scenario to an amazing political season if the working - class supporters , especially women , of the Clinton who so many Republicans love to hate helped elect the GOP senator from Arizona that so many Republicans have their own doubts about ?
Such a Republican win , even a narrow one , as unlikely as it seems right now , would erase the present presidential hopes of the usurper Obama and could clear the way in 2012 for another try by that same Clinton , who 'll only be 64 then .

While deeply held feelings about string theory ( " Genius ! " " Total Bunk ! " ) may sometimes drive us apart , all of us can certainly get behind the theory that chocolate is a net good .
However , in spite of its appeal as a tasty eatable ( with or without bacon ) , it 's actually a bit of a pain to work with .
If you 've ever tried to use chocolate in its melted form , you 've probably discovered that chocolate has a number of peculiarities that frequently thwart your best culinary efforts .
For example , if your melted chocolate becomes contaminated with an errant drop of water , the chocolate siezes up .
If you try to reharden chocolate that 's been melted ( say , in making chocolate covered strawberries ) , you 're frequently left with a matte finish and crumbly texture that in no way resembles the dark glossy chocolate you began with .
The reasons for this should be familiar to any solid state physicist ( or at least , they were to the one who made my wedding cake and first clued me in ) .
Cocoa butter , one of the dominant ingredients in chocolate , contains several triglycerides that lock into a crystal form when cooled .
However , there is not just one form that the triglycerides can lock into , but six of them ( β ( I ) through β ( VI ) ) .
Each successive form is more stable and has a higher melting point .
Almost all commercial chocolate is in the β ( V ) form -- from what I can tell , you only get to sample β ( VI ) in the afterlife , if you 've been very , very good .
When chocolate goes all wrong , it is usually a failure of the melted and cooled chocolate to recrystallize into the β ( V ) state .
Similar problems can affect commercial chocolate suppliers as well , leading to chocolate that develops that unsightly chalky film we associate with old chocolate .
Even previously stable β ( V ) chocolate can wind up with the same unsightly film after temperature fluctuations break down the crystal structure , or melt and reharden a thin layer on the surface .
Given the commercial implications , there 's been some solid technical work on the structure of the magical β ( V ) form , which has been studied with x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation ( more technical data here ) .
Given the above , when cooking with chocolate , one 's goal is to coax the cooled chocolate back into the β ( V ) form if one wants the end product to look glossy , be solid at room temperature , and have a nice crisp snap when bitten .
The traditional mechanism for this is known as tempering ( video here ) .
Traditional tempering involves carefully controlling the temperature of the chocolate as it cools , so that the chocolate favors the preferred crystalline state .
However , there is a vastly simpler mechanism , namely , seeding the crystal .
If you take a lump of unmelted commercial chocolate , toss it into your bowl of melted chocolate , and stir for a bit , you 'll melt the new lump while cooling the melted chocolate .
The cooling chocolate will then prefer the same crystal structure as the melting lump , such that when it hardens completely , you 'll find it in the luscious β ( V ) state .
PS .
I can verify that the above works exactly as advertised .
Last weekend I made the wedding cake above for the same solid state physicist who made mine a decade ago .
( The cake was alternately described as looking like the Heatmiser 's hair , Mordor , and Garrett Lisi's E 8 symmetry group , so you can imagine it was a pretty techie crowd ) .
Making the thin chocolate sheets from which I cut the decorations , I got huge swaths of perfectly glossy chocolate .
Occasionally , though , there 'd be a small section with a matte surface , that was clearly a different crystalline form .
Science .
It works , bitches .

I will start out by describing the Ada predefined types , and the complex types , and move onto the simple language constructs .
Section 2 will start to introduce some very Ada specific topics and section 3 describes the new Ada - 95 Object Oriented programming constructs .
Section 5 describes the Ada tools for managing concurrency , the task and protected types , these are worth investing some time getting to grips with .
Section 6 is a tour of the Ada IO library and covers some of the differences in concept and implementation between it and C stdio .
Please feel free to comment on errors , things you do n't like and things you would like to see .
If I do n't get the comments then I can't take it forward , and the question you would like answered is almost certainly causing other people problems too .
If you are new to Ada and do not have an Ada compiler handy then why not try the GNAT Ada compiler .
This compiler is based on the well known GCC C/C++ and Objective - C compiler and provides a high quality Ada -83 and Ada - 95 compiler for many platforms .
Here is the FTP site see if there is one for you .
Current Status
Section 2 More on 2.3 ( data hiding ) and 2.4 ( Hierarchical packages ) Section 3
First issue of this section , 3.6 , 3.7 , 3.8 and 3.9 have additional work planned .
They may also require re-work pending comments .
Section 5 Section 5.3 ( streams ) not yet done .
Section 6
New sections to be added for each language .
Section 7
Major re-work following comments from Bill Wagner , 7.2.7 added , requires some more words , and section 7.3 requires more justification etc .
Wish List
I would like to use a consistant example throughout , building it up as we go along .
The trouble is I do n't think I have space in an HTML page to do this .
One thing before we continue , most of the operators are similar , but you should notice these differences :
Operator C/C++ Ada Assignment = := Equality == = NonEquality != /= PlusEquals += SubtractEquals -= MultiplyEquals *= DivisionEquals /= OrEquals |= AndEquals &= Modulus % mod Remainder rem AbsoluteValue abs Exponentiation ** Range ..
One of the biggest things to stop C/C++ programmers in their tracks is that Ada is case insensitive , so begin BEGIN Begin are all the same .
This can be a problem when porting case sensitive C code into Ada .
Another thing to watch for in Ada source is the use of ' the tick .
The tick is used to access attributes for an object , for instance the following code is used to assign to value s the size in bits of an integer .
int a = sizeof ( int ) * 8 ; a : Integer := Integer ' Size ;
First
Last
Integer ' First to Integer ' Last
Note that ' objects ' are defined in reverse order to C/ C++ , the object name is first , then the object type , as in C / C+ + you can declare lists of objects by seperating them with commas .
int i ; int a , b , c ; int j = 0 ; int k , l = 1 ; i : Integer ; a , b , c : Integer ; j : Integer := 0 ; k , l : Integer := 1 ;
Another difference is in defining constants .
const int days_per_week = 7 ; days_per_week : constant Integer := 7 ; days_per_week : constant := 7 ;
Ada is a strongly typed language , in fact possibly the strongest .
This means that its type model is strict and absolutely stated .
In C the use of typedef introduces a new name which can be used as a new type , though the weak typing of C and even C++ ( in comparison ) means that we have only really introduced a very poor synonym .
Consider :
typedef int INT ; INT a ; int b ; a = b ; // works , no problem
type INT is new Integer ; a : INT ; b : Integer ; a := b ; -- fails .
new
INT
Integer
INT
int
This strong typing can be a problem , and so Ada also provides you with a feature for reducing the distance between the new type and its parent , consider
subtype INT is Integer ; a : INT ; b : Integer ; a := b ; -- works .
Integer , Long_Integer etc.
Any Ada compiler must provide the Integer type , this is a signed integer , and of implementation defined size .
The compiler is also at liberty to provide Long_Integer , Short_Integer , Long_Long_Integer etc as needed .
Unsigned Integers
Ada does not have a defined unsigned integer , so this can be synthesised by a range type ( see section 1.1.5 ) , and Ada-95 has a defined package , System .
Unsigned_Types which provide such a set of types .
Ada -95 has added a modular type which specifies the maximum value , and also the feature that arithmatic is cyclic , underflow / overflow cannot occur .
This means that if you have a modular type capable of holding values from 0 to 255 , and its current value is 255 , then incrementing it wraps it around to zero .
Contrast this with range types ( previously used to define unsigned integer types ) in section 1.1.5 below .
Such a type is defined in the form : type BYTE is mod 256 ; type BYTE is mod 2**8 ;
The first simply specifies the maximum value , the second specifies it in a more ' precise ' way , and the 2**x form is often used in system programming to specify bit mask types .
Note : it is not required to use 2**x , you can use any value , so 10** 10 is legal also .
Character { 3.5.2}
This is very similar to the C char type , and holds the ASCII character set .
However it is actually defined in the package Standard { A.1} as an enumerated type ( see section 1.1.5 ) .
There is an Ada equivalent of the C set of functions in ctype.h which is the package Ada .
Characters .
Handling .
Ada Also defines a Wide_Character type for handling non ASCII character sets .
Boolean { 3.5.3}
This is also defined in the package Standard as an enumerated type ( see below ) as ( FALSE , TRUE ) .
Standard
As in C the basis for the string is an array of characters , so you can use array slicing ( see below ) to extract substrings , and define strings of set length .
What , unfortunatly , you cannot do is use strings as unbounded objects , hence the following .
type A_Record is record illegal : String ; legal : String ( 1 .. 20 ) ; end record ; procedure check ( legal : in String ) ;
array [ 4 ]
0..3
1..4
Name : String := " Simon " ;
Name
String ( 1..5 )
" Simon "
For parameter types unconstrained types are allowed , similar to passing int array [ ] in C .
To overcome the constraint problem for strings Ada has a predefined package Ada .
Strings .
Unbounded which implements a variable length string type .
Float
Long_Float
type FloatingPoint1 is new Float ; type FloatingPoint2 is digits 5 ;
Float
The second line asks the compiler to create a new type , which is a floating point type " of some kind " with a minimum of 5 digits of precision .
This is invaluable when doing numeric intensive operations and intend to port the program , you define exactly the type you need , not what you think might do today .
If we go back to the subject of the tick , you can get the number of digits which are actually used by the type by the attribute ' Digits .
So having said we want a type with minimum of 5 digits we can verify this :
number_of_digits : Integer := FloatingPoint2 'Digits ;
Fixed point types are unusual , there is no predefined type ' Fixed ' and such type must be declared in the long form :
type Fixed is delta 0.1 range - 1.0 .. 1.0 ;
There is a specific form of fixed point types ( added by Ada - 95 ) called decimal types .
These add a clause digits , and the range clause becomes optional .
type Decimal is delta 0.01 digits 10 ;
-99,999,999.99
+99,999,999.99
type Boolean is ( FALSE , TRUE ) ;
You have already seen a range in use ( for strings ) , it is expressed as low .. high and can be one of the most useful ways of expressing interfaces and parameter values , for example :
type Hours is new Integer range 1 .. 12 ; type Hours24 is range 0 .. 23 ; type Minutes is range 1 .. 60 ;
Hours24
Hours
Hours
Integer
Now we come to the rules on subtypes for ranges , and we will define the two Hours again as follows :
type Hours24 is new range 0 .. 23 ; subtype Hours is Hours 24 range 1 .. 12 ;
range 0 .. 25
Now we come to the combining of enumerations and ranges , so that we might have :
type All_Days is ( Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , Sunday ) ; subtype Week_Days is All_Days range Monday ..
Friday ; subtype Weekend is All_Days range Saturday .. Sunday ;
Day
Day : All_Days := Today ; if Day in Week_Days then go_to_work ; end if ;
if Day in range Monday ..
Friday
Ada provides four useful attributes for enumeration type handling , note these are used slightly differently than many other attributes as they are applied to the type , not the object .
Succ
This attribute supplies the ' successor ' to the current value , so the ' Succ value of an object containing Monday is Tuesday .
Note :
If the value of the object is Sunday then an exception is raised , you can not Succ past the end of the enumeration .
Pred
This attribute provides the ' predecessor ' of a given value , so the ' Pred value of an object containing Tuesday is Monday .
Note : the rule above still applies ' Pred of Monday is an error .
Val
This gives you the value ( as a member of the enumeration ) of element n in the enumeration .
Thus Val ( 2 ) is Wednesday .
Note : the rule above still applies , and note also that ' Val ( 0 ) is the same as ' First .
Pos
This gives you the position in the enumeration of the given element name .
Thus ' Pos( Wednesday ) is 2 .
Note : the range rules still apply , also that ' Last will work , and return Sunday .
All_Days ' Succ( Monday ) = Tuesday All_Days ' Pred( Tuesday ) = Monday All_Days 'Val(0 ) = Monday All_Days ' First = Monday All_Days 'Val ( 2 ) = Wednesday All_Days ' Last = Sunday All_Days 'Succ( All_Days ' Pred( Tuesday ) ) = Tuesday
First
This provides the value of the first item in a range .
Considering the range
0 .. 100 then ' First 0 .
Last
This provides the value of the last item in a range , and so considering above , ' Last is 100 .
Length
This provides the number of items in a range , so ' Length is actually 101 .
Range
This funnily enough returns in this case the value we gave it , but you will see when we come onto arrays how useful this feature is .
Some example :
char name [ 31 ] ; int track [ 3 ] ; int dbla [ 3 ] [ 10 ] ; int init [ 3 ] = { 0 , 1 , 2 } ; typedef char [ 31 ] name_type ; track [ 2 ] = 1 ; dbla [ 0 ] [ 3 ] = 2 ; Name : array ( 0 .. 30 ) of Character ; -- OR Name : String ( 1 .. 30 ) ; Track : array ( 0 .. 2 ) of Integer ; DblA : array ( 0 .. 2 ) of array ( 0 .. 9 ) of Integer ; -- OR DblA : array ( 0 .. 2,0 .. 9 ) of Integer ; Init : array ( 0 .. 2 ) of Integer := ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) ; type Name_Type is array ( 0 .. 30 ) of Character ; track ( 2 ) := 1 ; dbla( 0,3 ) := 2 ; -- Note try this in C. a , b : Name_Type ; a := b ; -- will copy all elements of b into a .
non -zero based ranges .
Because Ada uses ranges to specify the bounds of an array then you can easily set the lower bound to anything you want , for example : Example : array ( - 10 .. 10 ) of Integer ; non-integer ranges .
In the examples above we have used the common abbreviation for range specifiers .
The ranges above are all integer ranges , and so we did not need to use the correct form which is : array ( type range low .. high ) which would make Example above array ( Integer range - 10 .. 10 ) .
Now you can see where we 're going , take an enumerated type , All_Days and you can define an array : Hours_Worked : array ( All_Days range Monday .. Friday ) ; unbounded array types .
The examples above did demonstrate how to declare an array type .
One of Ada 's goals is reuse , and to have to define a function to deal with a 1..10 array , and another for a 0..1000 array is silly .
Therefore Ada allows you to define unbounded array types .
An unbounded type can be used as a parameter type , but you cannot simply define a variable of such a type .
Consider : type Vector is array ( Integer range <> ) of Float ; procedure sort_vector ( sort_this : in out Vector ) ; Illegal_Variable : Vector ; Legal_Variable : Vector ( 1..5 ) ; subtype SmallVector is Vector ( 0..1 ) ; Another_Legal : SmallVector ;
This does allow us great flexibility to define functions and procedures to work on arrays regardless of their size , so a call to sort_vector could take the Legal_Variable object or an object of type SmallVector , etc .
Note that a variable of type Smallvector is constrained and so can be legally created .
array range attributes .
If you are passed a type which is an unbounded array then if you want to loop through it then you need to know where it starts .
So we can use the range attributes introduced in 1.1.5 to iterate over a given array thus : attributes for array types .
Consider : Example : array ( 1 .. 10 ) of Integer ; for i in Example ' First ..
Example ' Last loop for i in Example ' Range loop
Note that if you have a multiple dimension array then the above notation implies that the returned values are for the first dimension , use the notation Array_Name ( dimension ) ' attribute for multi-dimensional arrays .
Initialisation by range ( Aggregates {} ??? )
When initialising an array one can initialise a range of elements in one go : Init : array ( 0 .. 3 ) of Integer := ( 0 .. 3 => 1 ) ; Init : array ( 0 .. 3 ) of Integer := ( 0 => 1 , others => 0 ) ; The keyword others sets any elements not explicitly handled .
Slicing Array slicing is something usually done with memcpy in C / C ++.
Take a section out of one array and assign it into another .
Large : array ( 0 .. 100 ) of Integer ; Small : array ( 0 .. 3 ) of Integer ; -- extract section from one array into another .
Small ( 0 .. 3 ) := Large ( 10 .. 13 ) ; -- swap top and bottom halfs of an array .
Large := Large ( 51 .. 100 ) & Large ( 1..50 ) ; Note : Both sides of the assignment must be of the same type , that is the same dimensions with each element the same .
The following is illegal .
-- extract section from one array into another .
Small ( 0 .. 3 ) := Large ( 10 .. 33 ) ; -- ^^^^^^^^ range too big .
struct _device { int major_number ; int minor_number ; char name [ 20 ] ; } ; typedef struct _device Device ; type struct_device is record major_number :
Integer ; minor_number : Integer ; name : String ( 1 .. 19 ) ; end record ; type Device is new struct_device ;
Ada uses the same element reference syntax as C , so to access the minor_number element of an object lp1 of type Device we write lp1.minor_number .
Ada does allow , like C , the initialisation of record members at declaration .
In the code below we introduce a feature of Ada , the ability to name the elements we are going to initialise .
This is useful for clarity of code , but more importantly it allows us to only initialise the bits we want .
Device lp1 = { 1 , 2 , " lp1 " } ; lp1 : Device := ( 1 , 2 , " lp1 " ) ; lp2 : Device := ( major_number => 1 , minor_number => 3 , name => " lp2 " ) ; tmp : Device := ( major_number => 255 , name => " tmp " ) ;
tmp : Device ; -- some processing tmp := ( major_number => 255 , name => " tmp " ) ;
This facility improves readability and as far as most Ada programmers believe maintainability .
type struct_device is record major_number : Integer := 0 ; minor_number : Integer := 0 ; name : String ( 1 .. 19 ) := " unknown " ; end record ;
Ada access types are safer , and in some ways easier to use and understand , but they do mean that a lot of C code which uses pointers heavily will have to be reworked to use some other means .
The most common use of access types is in dynamic programming , for example in linked lists .
struct _device_event { int major_number ; int minor_number ; int event_ident ; struct _device_event * next ; } ; type Device_Event ; type Device_Event_Access is access Device_Event ; type Device_Event is record major_number : Integer := 0 ; minor_number : Integer := 0 ; event_ident : Integer := 0 ; next : Device_Event_Access := null ; -- Note : the assignement to null is not required , -- Ada automatically initialises access types to -- null if no other value is specified .
end record ;
When it comes to dynamically allocating a new structure the Ada allocator syntax is much closer to C++ than to C .
Event_1 := new Device_Event ; Event_1.next := new Device_Event '( 1 , 2 , EV_Paper_Low , null ) ;
record.element
Ada allows you to assign between access types , and as you would expect it only changes what the access type points to , not the contents of what it points to .
One thing to note again , Ada allows you to assign one structure to another if they are of the same type , and so a syntax is required to assign the contents of an access type , its easier to read than write , so :
dev1 , dev2 : Device_Event ; pdv1 , pdv2 : Device_Event_Access ; dev1 := dev2 ; -- all elements copied .
pdv1 := pdv2 ; -- pdv1 now points to contents of pdv2 .
pdv1.all := pdv2.all ; -- !!
There is a good reason for this , Ada does not have one .
To digress for a while , Ada was designed as a language to support garbage collection , that is the runtime would manage deallocation of no longer required dynamic memory .
However at that time garbage collection was slow , required a large overhead in tracking dynamic memory and tended to make programs irratic in performance , slowing as the garbage collector kicks in .
The language specification therefore states { 13.11 }
" An implementation need not support garbage collection ... " .
This means that you must , as in C++ manage your own memory deallocation .
Ada requires you to use the generic procedure Unchecked_Deallocation ( see 1.3.4 ) to deallocate a dynamic object .
This procedure must be instantiated for each dynamic type and should not ( ideally ) be declared on a public package spec , ie provide the client with a deallocation procedure which uses Unchecked_Deallocation internally .
Casting ( wow )
As you might expect from what we have seen so far Ada must allow us some way to relax the strong typing it enforces .
In C the cast allows us to make anything look like something else , in Ada type coersion can allow you to convert between two similar types , ie : type Thing is new Integer ; an_ Integer : Integer ; a_Thing : Thing ; an_ Integer := a_Thing ; -- illegal an_ Integer := Integer ( a_Thing ) ;
This can only be done between similar types , the compiler will not allow such coersion between very different types , for this you need the generic procedure Unchecked_Conversion ( see 1.3.4 ) which takes as an argument one type , and returns another .
The only constraint on this is that they must be the same size .
Procedure types .
{} Ada -83 did not allow the passing of procedures as subprogram parameters at execution time , or storing procedures in records etc .
The rationale for this was that it broke the ability to statically prove the code .
Ada -95 has introduced the ability to define types which are in effect similar to C's ability to define pointers to functions .
In C/ C+ + there is the most formidable syntax for defining pointers to functions and so the Ada syntax should come as a nice surprise : typedef int ( * callback_func ) ( int param1 , int param2 ) ; type Callback_Func is access function ( param_1 : in Integer ; param_2 : in Integer ) return Integer ; Discriminant types { 3.7} .
Discriminant types are a way of parameterising a compound type ( such as a record , tagged , task or protected type ) .
For example : type Event_Item is record Event_ID : Integer ; Event_Info : String ( 1 .. 80 ) ; end record ; type Event_Log ( Max_Size : Integer ) is record Log_Opened : Date_Type ; Events : array ( 1 .. Max_Size ) of Event_Item ; end record ;
First we declare a type to hold our event information in .
We then declare a type which is a log of such events , this log has a maximum size , and rather than the C answer , define an array large enough for the maximum ever , or resort to dynamic programming the Ada approach is to instantiate the record with a max value and at time of instantiation define the size of the array .
My_Event_Log : Event_Log ( 1000 ) ;
If it is known that nearly all event logs are going to be a thousand items in size , then you could make that a default value , so that the following code is identical to that above .
type Event_Log( Max_Size : Integer := 1000 ) is record Log_Opened : Date_Type Events : array ( Integer range 1 .. Max_Size ) of Event_Item ; end record ; My_Event_Log : Event_Log ;
Again this is another way in which Ada helps , when defining an interface , to state precisely what we want to provide .
Variant records { 3.8.1} .
Anyone who has worked in a Pascal language will recognise variant records , they are a bit like C/C++ unions except that the are very different :-)
Ada variant records allow you to define a record which has 2 or more blocks of data of which only one is visible at any time .
The visibility of the block is determined by a discriminant which is then ' cased ' .
type Transport_Type is ( Sports , Family , Van ) ; type Car( Type : Transport_Type ) is record Registration_Date : Date_Type ; Colour : Colour_Type ; case Type is when Sports => Soft_Top : Boolean ; when Family => Number_Seats : Integer ; Rear_Belts : Boolean ; when Van => Cargo_Capacity : Integer ; end case ; end record ;
So if you code My_Car : Car( Family ) ; then you can ask for the number of seats in the car , and whether the car has seat belts in the rear , but you cannot ask if it is a soft top , or what its cargo capacity is .
I guess you 've seen the difference between this and C unions .
In a C union representation of the above any block is visible regardless of what type of car it is , you can easily ask for the cargo capacity of a sports car and C will use the bit pattern of the boolean to provide you with the cargo capacity .
Not good .
To simplify things you can subtype the variant record with types which define the variant ( note in the example the use of the designator for clarity ) .
subtype Sports_Car is Car( Sports ) ; subtype Family_Car is Car( Type => Family ) ; subtype Small_Van is Car( Type => Van ) ; Exceptions { 11.1} .
Exceptions are a feature which C++ is only now getting to grips with , although Ada was designed with exceptions included from the beginning .
This does mean that Ada code will use exceptions more often than not , and certainly the standard library packages will raise a number of possible exceptions .
Unlike C++ where an exception is identified by its type in Ada they are uniquely identified by name .
To define an exception for use , simply parameter_out_of_range : Exception ;
These look and feel like constants , you cannot assign to them etc , you can only raise an exception and handle an exception .
Exceptions can be argued to be a vital part of the safety of Ada code , they cannot easily be ignored , and can halt a system quickly if something goes wrong , far faster than a returned error code which in most cases is completely ignored .
System Representation of types { 13} .
As you might expect with Ada 's background in embedded and systems programming there are ways in which you can force a type into specific system representations .
type BYTE is range 0 .. 255 ; for BYTE use 8 ; This first example shows the most common form of system representation clause , the size attribute .
We have asked the compiler to give us a range , from 0 to 255 and the compiler is at liberty to provide the best type available to hold the representation .
We are forcing this type to be 8 bits in size .
type DEV_Activity is ( READING , WRITING , IDLE ) ; for DEV_Activity use ( READING => 1 , WRITING => 2 , IDLE => 3 ) ; Again this is useful for system programming it gives us the safety of enumeration range checking , so we can only put the correct value into a variable , but does allow us to define what the values are if they are being used in a call which expects specific values .
type DEV_Available is BYTE ; for DEV_Available use at 16#00000340 # ;
This example means that all objects of type DEV_Available are placed at memory address 340 ( Hex ) .
This placing of data items can be done on a per object basis by using : type DEV_Available is BYTE ; Avail_Flag : DEV_Available ; for Avail_Flag ' Address use 16#00000340# ;
Note the address used Ada 's version of the C 0x340 notation , however the general form is base #number # where the base can be anything , including 2 , so bit masks are real easy to define , for example : Is_Available : constant BYTE := 2#1000_0000 # ; Not_Available : constant BYTE := 2#0000_0000 # ; Another feature of Ada is that any underscores in numeric constants are ignored , so you can break apart large numbers for readability .
type DEV_Status is 0 .. 15 ; type DeviceDetails is record status : DEV_Activity ; rd_stat : DEV_Status ; wr_stat : DEV_Status ; end record ; for DeviceDetails use record at mod 2 ; status at 0 range 0 .. 7 ; rd_stat at 1 range 0 .. 3 ; wr_stat at 1 range 4 .. 7 ; end record ;
This last example is the most complex , it defines a simple range type , and a structure .
It then defines two things to the compiler , first the mod clause sets the byte packing for the structure , in this case back on two - byte boundaries .
The second part of this structure defines exactly the memory image of the record and where each element occurs .
The number after the ' at ' is the byte offset and the range , or size , is specified in number of bits .
> From this you can see that the whole structure is stored in two bytes where the first byte is stored as expected , but the second and third elements of the record share the second byte , low nibble and high nibble .
This form becomes very important a little later on .
Firstly we must look at the two ways unions are identified .
Unions are used to represent the data in memory in more than one way , the programmer must know which way is relevant at any point in time .
This variant identifier can be inside the union or outside , for example :
struct _device_input { int device_id ; union { type_1_data from_type_1 ; type_2_data from_type_2 ; } device_data ; } ; void get_data_func( _device_input* from_device ) ; union device_data { type_1_data from_type_1 ; type_2_data from_type_2 ; } ; void get_data_func ( int * device_id , device_data* from_device ) ;
The next step is to decide whether , when converting such code to Ada , you wish to maintain simply the concept of the union , or whether you are required to maintain the memory layout also .
Note : the second choice is usually only if your Ada code is to pass such a structure to a C program or get one from it .
If you are simply retaining the concept of the union then you would not use the second form , use the first form and use a variant record .
type Device_ID is new Integer ; type Device_Input ( From_Device : Device_ID ) is record case From_Device is when 1 => From_Type_1 : Type_1_Data ; when 2 => From_Type_2 : Type_2_Data ; end case ; end record ;
for Device_Input use record From_Device at 0 range 0 .. 15 ; From_Type_1 at 2 range 0 .. 15 ; From_Type_2 at 2 range 0 .. 31 ; end record ;
We can also use the abilities of Unchecked_Conversion to convert between different types ( see 1.3.4 ) .
This allows us to write the following :
type Type_1_Data is record Data_1 : Integer ; end record ; type Type_2_Data is record Data_1 : Integer ; end record ; function Type_1_to_2 is new Unchecked_Conversion ( Source => Type_1_data , Target => Type_2_Data ) ;
Type_1_Data
Type_2_Data
Type_1_Object : Type_1_Data := ReadData ; : Type_2_Object : Type_2_Data := Type_1_to_2 ( Type_1_Object ) ;
Note : All Ada statements can be qualified by a name , this be discussed further in the section on Ada looping constructs , however it can be used anywhere to improve readability , for example :
begin Init_Code : begin Some_Code ; end Init_Code ; Main_Loop : loop if Some_Value then exit loop Main_Loop ; end if ; end loop Main_Loop ; Term_Code : begin Some_Code ; end Term_Code ; end A_Block ;
{ declarations statements } declare declarations begin statement end ;
Note : Ada does not require brackets around the expressions used in if , case or loop statements .
if ( expression ) { statement } else { statement } if expression then statement elsif expression then statement else statement end if ;
switch ( expression ) { case value : statement default : statement } case expression is when value => statement when others => statement end case ;
This leads to a slight problem , it is not uncommon to find a switch statement in C which looks like this :
switch ( integer_value ) { case 1 : case 2 : case 3 : case 4 : value_ok = 1 ; break ; case 5 : case 6 : case 7 : break ; }
case integer_value is when 1 .. 4 => value_ok := 1 ; when 5 | 6 | 7 => null ; end case ;
null
loop ... end
loop statement end loop ;
while ( expression ) { statement } while expression loop statement end loop ;
do { statement } while ( expression ) -- no direct Ada equivalent .
for ( init - statement ; expression - 1 ; loop - statement ) { statement } for ident in range loop statement end loop ;
Firstly , the variable ident is actually declared by its appearance in the loop , it is a new variable which exists for the scope of the loop only and takes the correct type according to the specified range .
Secondly you will have noticed that to loop for 1 to 10 you can write the following Ada code :
for i in 1 .. 10 loop null ; end loop ;
10 .. 1
for i in reverse 1 .. 10 loop null ; end loop ;
while ( expression ) { if ( expression1 ) { continue ; } if ( expression2 ) { break ; } }
In Ada there is no continue , and break is now exit .
while expression loop if expression2 then exit ; end if ; end loop ;
while expression loop exit when expression2 ; end loop ;
loop statement exit when expression ; end loop ;
while ( (! feof ( file_handle ) && ( ! percent_found ) ) { for ( char_index = 0 ; buffer [ char_index ] != '
' ; char_index ++ ) { if ( buffer [ char_index ] == ' % ' ) { percent_found = 1 ; break ; } // some other code , including get next line .
} }
Main_Loop : while not End_Of_File( File_Handle ) loop for Char_Index in Buffer ' Range loop exit when Buffer ( Char_Index ) = NEW_LINE ; exit Main_Loop when Buffer ( Char_Index ) = PERCENT ; end loop ; end loop Main_Loop ;
return value ; // C++ return return value ; -- Ada return
label : goto label ; < < label > > goto label ;
In C++ there is no exception type , when you raise an exception you pass out any sort of type , and selection of the exception is done on its type .
In Ada as seen above there is a ' psuedo - type ' for exceptions and they are then selected by name .
Firstly lets see how you catch an exception , the code below shows the basic structure used to protect statement1 , and execute statement2 on detection of the specified exception .
try { statement1 } catch ( declaration ) { statement2 } begin statement1 exception when ident => statement2 when others => statement2 end ;
try { function_call( ) ; } catch ( const char* string_exception ) { if ( ! strcmp(string_exception , " the_one_we_want " ) ) { handle_it( ) ; } else { throw ; } } catch ( ... ) { throw ; } begin function_call ; exception when the_one_we_want => handle_it ; when others => raise ; end ;
You will also notice the similarity between the Ada exception catching code and the Ada case statement , this also extends to the fact that the when statement can catch multiple exceptions .
Ranges of exceptions are not possible , however you can or exceptions , to get :
begin function_call ; exception when the_one_we_want | another_possibility => handle_it ; when others => raise ; end ;
throw ( const char * ) " the_one_we_want " ; raise the_one_we_want ;
return_type func_name( parameters ) ; return_type func_name ( parameters ) { declarations statement } function func_name ( parameters ) return return_type ; function func_name ( parameters ) return return_type is declarations begin statement end func_name
void func_name ( parameters ) ; procedure func_name ( parameters ) ;
void func1 ( int by_value ) ; void func2 ( int* by_address ) ; void func3 ( int& by_reference ) ; // C++ only .
type int is new Integer ; type int_star is access int ; procedure func1 ( by_value : in int ) ; procedure func2 ( by_address : in out int_star ) ; procedure func3 ( by_reference : in out int ) ;
void func_name ( ) ; void func_name ( void ) ; int func_name ( void ) ; procedure func_name ; function func_name return Integer ;
Overloading Ada allows more than one function / procedure with the same name as long as they can be uniquely identified by their signature ( a combination of their parameter and return types ) .
function Day return All_Days ; function Day ( a_date : in Date_Type ) return All_Days ;
The first returns you the day of week , of today , the second the day of week from a given date .
They are both allowed , and both visible .
The compiler decides which one to use by looking at the types given to it when you call it .
Operator overloading { 6.6 }
As in C++ you can redefine the standard operators in Ada , unlike C++ you can do this outside a class , and for any operator , with any types .
The syntax for this is to replace the name of the function ( operators are always functions ) with the operator name in quotes , ie : function " + " ( Left , Right : in Integer ) return Integer ; Available operators are : = < <= > >= + - & abs not * / mod rem ** and or xor Parameter passing modes C++ allows three parameter passing modes , by value , by pointer and by reference ( the default mode for Ada ) .
void func ( int by_value , int* by_pointer , int& by_reference ) ;
Ada provides two optional keywords to specify how parameters are passed , in and out .
These are used like this : procedure proc( Parameter : in Integer ) ; procedure proc( Parameter : out Integer ) ; procedure proc( Parameter : in out Integer ) ; procedure proc( Parameter : Integer ) ;
If these keywords are used then the compiler can protect you even more , so if you have an out parameter it will warn you if you use it before it has been set , also it will warn you if you assign to an in parameter .
Note that you cannot mark parameters with out in functions as functions are used to return values , such side affects are disallowed .
Default parameters { 6.4.1} Ada ( and C++ ) allow you to declare default values for parameters , this means that when you call the function you can leave such a parameter off the call as the compiler knows what value to use .
procedure Create ( File : in out File_Type ; Mode : in File_Mode := Inout_File ; Name : in String := " " ; Form : in String := " " ) ;
This example is to be found in each of the Ada file based IO packages , it opens a file , given the file ' handle ' the mode , name of the file and a system independant ' form ' for the file .
You can see that the simplest invokation of Create is Create( File_Handle ) ; which simply provides the handle and all other parameters are defaulted ( In the Ada library a file name of " " implies opening a temporary file ) .
Now suppose that we wish to provide the name of the file also , we would have to write Create ( File_Handle , Inout_File , " text. file " ) ; would n't we ?
The Ada answer is no .
By using designators as has been demonstrated above we could use the form : Create ( File => File_Handle , Name => " text. file " ) ; and we can leave the mode to pick up its default .
This skipping of parameters is a uniquely Ada feature .
Nested procedures
Simple , you can define any number of procedures within the definition of another as long as they appear before the begin .
procedure Sort( Sort_This : in out An_Array ) is procedure Swap ( Item_1 , Item_2 : in out Array_Type ) is begin end Swap ; begin end Sort ;
procedure increment ( A_Value : A_Type ) ; procedure increment ( A_Value : in out A_Type ; By : in Integer := 1 ) ;
Ada is also commonly assumed to be a military language , with the US Department of Defense its prime advocate , this is not the case , a number of commercial and government developments have now been implemented in Ada .
Ada is an excellent choice if you wish to spend your development time solving your customers problems , not hunting bugs in C / C++ which an Ada compiler would not have allowed .
Ada-95 has introduced these new features , Object Oriented programming through tagged types and procedural types which make it more difficult to statically prove an Ada - 95 program , but the language designers decided that such features merited their inclusion in the language to further another goal , that of high reuse .

The point of this section is that by default all of these checks are enabled , and so any such errors will be trapped .
Unchecked_Conversion
This generic function is defined as : generic type Source ( <> ) is limited private ; type Target ( <> ) is limited private ; function Ada.Unchecked_Conversion ( Source_Object : Source ) return Target ; and should be instantiated like the example below ( taken from one of the Ada - 95 standard library packages Ada .
Interfaces .
C ). function Character_To_char is new Unchecked_Conversion ( Character , char ) ; and can then be used to convert and Ada character to a C char , thus A_Char : Interfaces .C.char := Character_To_char ( 'a ' ) ; Unchecked_Deallocation
This generic function is defined as : generic type Object ( <> ) is limited private ; type Name is access Object ; procedure Ada.
Unchecked_Deallocation ( X : in out Name ) ; this function , instantiated with two parameters , only requires one for operation , type My_Type is new Integer ; type My_Ptr is access My_Type ; procedure Free is new Unchecked_Deallocation ( My_Type , My_Ptr ) ; Thing : My_Ptr := new My_Type ; Free( Thing ) ;
It is worth first looking at the role of header files in C / C ++.
Header files are simply program text which by virtue of the preprocessor are inserted into the compilers input stream .
The #include directive knows nothing about what it is including and can lead to all sorts of problems , such as people who #include " thing.c " .
This sharing of code by the preprocessor lead to the #ifdef construct as you would have different interfaces for different people .
The other problem is that C/C++ compilations can sometime take forever because a included b included c ... or the near fatal a included a included a ...
Stroustrup has tried ref [ 9 ] ( in vain , as far as I can see ) to convince C++ programmers to remove dependance on the preprocessor but all the drawbacks are still there .
Any Ada package on the other hand consists of two parts , the specification ( header ) and body ( code ) .
The specification however is a completely stand alone entity which can be compiled on its own and so must include specifications from other packages to do so .
An Ada package body at compile time must refer to its package specification to ensure legal declarations , but in many Ada environments it would look up a compiled version of the specification .
The specification contains an explicit list of the visible components of a package and so there can be no internal knowledge exploited as is often the case in C code , ie module a contains a functions aa ( ) but does not export it through a header file , module b knows how a is coded and so uses the extern keyword to declare knowledge of it , and use it .
C/C++ programmers therefore have to mark private functions and data as static .
-- file example.ads , the package specification .
package example is : : end example ; -- file example.adb , the package body .
package body example is : : end example ;
#include " example . h "
Working with the example package above let us assume that we need to include another package , say My_Specs into this package so that it may be used .
Firstly where do you insert it ?
Like C , package specifications can be inserted into either a specification or body depending on who is the client .
Like a C header / code relationship any package included in the specification of package A is visible to the body of A , but not to clients of A . Each package is a seperate entity .
-- Specification for package example with Project_Specs ; package example is type My_Type is new Project_Spec.
Their_Type ; end example ; -- Body for package example with My_Specs ; package body example is type New_Type_1 is new My_Specs .
Type_1 ; type New_Type_2 is new Project_Specs .
Type_1 ; end example ;
You can see here the basic visibility rules , the specification has to include Project_Specs so that it can declare My_Type .
The body automatically inherits any packages included in its spec , so that you can see that although the body does not include Project_Specs that package is used in the declaration of New_Type_1 .
The body also includes another package My_Specs to declare the new type New_Type_2 , the specification is unaware of this include and so cannot use My_Specs to declare new types .
In a similar way an ordinary client of the package example cannot use the inclusion of Project_Specs , they would have to include it themselves .
To use an item , say a the type Type_1 you must name it My_Specs .
Type_1 , in effect you have included the package name , not its contents .
To get the same effect as the C #include you must also add another statement to make :
with My_Specs ; use My_Specs package body example is : : end example ;
It is usual in Ada to put the with and the use on the same line , for clarity .
There is much more to be said about Ada packages , but that should be enough to start with .
There is a special form of the use statement which can simply include an element ( types only ) from a package , consider :
use type Ada. Calendar .
Time ;
In C this is done by presenting the ' private type ' as a void * which means that you cannot know anything about it , but implies that no one can do any form of type checking on it .
In C++ we can forward declare classes and so provide an anonymous class type .
/* C code */ typedef void* list ; list create ( void ) ; // C++ class Our_List { public : Our_List ( void ) ; private : class List_Rep ; List_Rep * Representation ; } ;
List_Rep
In Ada this concept is formalised into the ' private part ' of a package .
This private part is used to define items which are forward declared as private .
package Our_List is type List_Rep is private ; function Create return List_Rep ; private type List_Rep is record -- some data end record ; end Our_List ;
List_Rep
limited private
You may not in the public part of the package specification declare variables of the private type as the representation is not yet known , we can declare constants of the type , but you must declare them in both places , forward reference them in the public part with no value , and then again in the private part to provide a value :
package Example is type A is private ; B : constant A ; private type A is new Integer ; B : constant A := 0 ; end Example ;
List_Rep
package Our_List is type List_Access is limited private ; function Create return List_Access ; private type List_Rep ; -- opaque type type List_Access is access List_Rep ; end Our_List ;
package Outer is package Inner_1 is end Inner_1 ; package Inner_2 is end Inner_2 ; private end Outer ;
package Outer is package Inner_1 is end Inner_1 ; end Outer ; package Outer .
Inner_2 is end Outer .
Inner_2 ;
Inner_2
Consider :
with Outer ; with Outer .
Inner_1 ; package New_Package is OI_1 renames Outer .
Inner_1 ; type New_type is new OI_1.A_Type ; end New_Package ;
OI_1
Sorting_Algorithms
Inner_1
Insertion_Sort
Sort renames Sorting_Algorithms.Insertion_Sort
Similarly if you want to include 2 functions from two different package with the same name then , rather than relying on overloading , or to clarify your code text you could :
with Package1 ; function Function1 return Integer renames Package1 .
Function ; with Package2 ; function Function2 return Integer renames Package2 .
Function ;
for device in Device_Map loop Device_Map ( device ) .
Device_Handler.Request_Device ; Device_Map ( device ) .Device_Handler.Process_Function(Process_This_Request ) ; Device_Map ( device ) .Device_Handler.Relinquish_Device ; end loop ; for device in Device_Map loop declare Device_Handler : Device_Type renames Device_Map ( device ) .
Device_Handler ; begin Device_Handler.Request_Device ; Device_Handler.Process_Function(Process_This_Request ) ; Device_Handler.Relinquish_Device ; end ; end loop ;
class
struct
class A_Device { public : A_Device ( char* , int , int ) ; char* Name ( void ) ; int Major ( void ) ; int Minor ( void ) ; protected : char * name ; int major ; int minor ; } ;
The code above also introduces a constructor , a function with the same name as the class which is called whenever the class is created .
In C++ these may be overloaded and are called either by the new operator , or in local variable declarations as below .
A_Device lp1 ( " lp1 " , 10 , 1 ) ; A_Device * lp1 ; lp1 = new A_Device ( " lp1 " , 10 , 1 ) ;
lp1
Ada has also extended its equivalent of a struct , the record but does not directly attach the member functions to it .
First the Ada equivalent of the above class is
package Devices is type Device is tagged private ; type Device_Type is access Device ; function Create ( Name : String ; Major : Integer ; Minor : Integer ) return Device_Type ; function Name ( this : Device_Type ) return String ; function Major ( this : Device_Type ) return Integer ; function Minor ( this : Device_Type ) return Integer ; private type Device is tagged record Name : String ( 1 .. 20 ) ; Major : Integer ; Minor : Integer ; end record ; end Devices ;
lp1 : Devices.Device_Type := Devices .
Create ( " lp1 " , 10 , 1 ) ;
tagged
class
struct
The tag can be accessed by the attribute ' Tag but should only be used for comparison , ie
dev1 , dev2 : Device ; if dev1 ' Tag = dev2 ' Tag then
Another important attribute ' Class exists which is used in type declarations to denote the class - wide type , the inheritence tree rooted at that type , ie
type Device_Class is Device ' Class ; -- or more normally type Device_Class is access Device ' Class ;
Device
Device
char* name
Name : String
A pure virtual function maps onto a virtual member function with the keywords is abstract before the semicolon .
When any pure virtual member functions exist the tagged type they refer to must also be identified as abstract .
Also , if an abstract tagged type has been introduced which has no data , then the following shorthand can be used :
type Root_Type is abstract tagged null record ;
Create
Create Copy Destroy
Ada does provide a library package Ada .
Finalization which can provide constructor / destructor like facilities for tagged types .
Note : See ref 6 .
For example , let us now inherit the device type above to make a tape device , firstly in C ++
class A_Tape : public A_Device { public : A_Tape ( char* , int , int ) ; int Block_Size ( void ) ; protected : int block_size ; } ;
package Device .
Tapes is type Tape is new device with private ; type Tape_Type is access Tape ; function Create ( Name : String ; Major : Integer ; Minor : Integer ) return Tape_Type ; function Block_Size ( this : Tape_Type ) return Integer ; private type Tape is new Device with record Block_Size : Integer ; end record ; end Device .
Tapes ;
Device
Devices
Device
Top mimic C++ private interfaces you can choose to use the method above , which in effect makes them protected , or you can make them really private by using opaque types ( see 2.3 ) .
class base_device { public : char* name ( void ) const ; int major ( void ) const ; int minor ( void ) const ; enum { block , character , special } io_type ; io_type type ( void ) const ; char read ( void ) = 0 ; void write ( char ) = 0 ; static char* type_name ( void ) ; protected : char* _name ; int _major ; int _minor ; static const io_type _type ; base_device ( void ) ; private : int _device_count ; } ;

package Devices is type Device is abstract tagged limited private ; type Device_Type is access Device ; type Device_Class is access Device ' Class ; type IO_Type is ( Block , Char , Special ) ; function Name ( this : in Device_Type ) return String ; function Major ( this : in Device_Type ) return Integer ; function Minor ( this : in Device_Type ) return Integer ; function IOType ( this : in Device_Type ) return IO_Type ; function Read ( this : Device_Class ) return Character is abstract ; procedure Write ( this : Device_Class ; Output : Character ) is abstract function Type_Name return String ; private type Device_Count ; type Device_Private is access Device_Count ; type Device is abstract tagged limited record Name : String ( 1 .. 20 ) ; Major : Integer ; Minor : Integer ; Count : Device_Private ; end record ; Const_IO_Type : constant IO_Type := special ; Const_Type_Name : constant String := " Device " ; end Devices ;
void sort ( int * array , int num_elements ) ;
void sort ( void * array , int element_size , int element_count , int ( * compare ) ( void* el1 , void * el2 ) ) ;
void *
Now let us consider an Ada generic version of the sort function :
generic type index_type is ( <> ) ; type element_type is private ; type element_array is array ( index_type range <> ) of element_type ; with function " return Boolean ; procedure Sort ( the_array : in out element_array ) ;
range <>
index_type
with
I think that you should be able to see the difference between the Ada code and C code as far as readability ( and therefore maintainability ) are concerned and why , therefore , Ada promotes the reuse philosophy .
Now let 's use our generic to sort some of MyType s .
MyArray : array ( Integer 0 .. 100 ) of MyType ; function LessThan(el1 , el2 : MyType ) return Boolean ; procedure SortMyType is new Sort ( Integer , MyType , MyArray , LessThan ) ; SortMyType( MyArray ) ;
LessThan
MyArray
MyType
Integer
Note : The Ada compiler instantiates the generic and will ensure type safety throughout .
generic type Element_Type is private ; package Ada.Direct_IO is
type My_Struct is record ... end record ; package My_Struct_IO is new Ada.Direct_IO( My_Struct ) ; use My_Struct_IO ; Item : My_Struct ; File : My_Struct_IO ; ... My_Struct_IO.Write ( File , Item ) ;
type X is private
We can know nothing about the type , except that we may test for equality and we may assign one to another .
If we add in the keyword limited then even these abilities are unavailable .
type X ( <> ) is private Added for Ada - 95 , this is similar to the parameter above except that we can define data items in the body of our package of type X , this may be illegal if the type passed is unconstrained , ie String .
Ada -95 does not allow the instantiation of generics with unconstrained types , unless you use this syntax in which case you cannot declare data items of this type .
type X is ( <>)
The type is a discrete type , Integer , Character , Enumeration etc. type X is range <>
The type indicates a range , ie 0 .. 100 . type X is mod <>
The type is a modulus type of unknown size ( Added for Ada - 95 ) .
type X is digits <>
The type is a floating point type .
type X is delta <>
The type is a fixed point type .
type X is tagged private
The type is a tagged type , ie an Ada - 95 extensible record .

Text_IO
Sequential_IO
Direct_IO
The most common problem for C and C++ programmers is the lack of the printf family of IO functions .
There is a good reason for their absence in Ada , the use in C of variable arguments , the ' ...' at the end of the printf function spec .
Ada cannot support such a construct as the type of each parameter is unknown .
Ada.Text_IO
Put
Get
A simple program below uses Text_IO to print a message to the screen , including numerics !
These are achieved by using the types attribute ' Image which gives back a String representation of a value .
with Ada.Text_IO ; use Ada.Text_IO ; procedure Test_IO is begin Put_Line ( " Test Starts Here > " ) ; Put_Line ( " Integer is " & Integer ' Image ( 2 ) ) ; Put_Line ( " Float is " & Float ' Image ( 2.0 ) ) ; Put_Line ( " Test Ends Here " ) ; end Test_IO ;
Ada . Text_IO
Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO
with Ada.Text_IO ; type My_Integer is new Integer ; package My_Integer_IO is new Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO( My_Integer ) ; use My_Integer_IO ;
with Ada.Direct_IO ; package A_Database is type File_Header is record Magic_Number : Special_Stamp ; Number_Of_Records : Record_Number ; First_Deleted : Record_Number ; end record ; type Row is record Key : String ( 1 .. 80 ) ; Data : String ( 1 .. 255 ) ; end record ; package Header_IO is new Direct_IO ( File_Header ) ; use Header_IO ; package Row_IO is new Direct_IO ( Row ) ; use Record_IO ; end A_Database ;
declare Handle : Header_IO.File_Type ; A_Header : File_Header ; A_Row : Row ; begin Header_IO.
Open( File => Handle , Name => " Test " ) ; Header_IO.Write ( Handle , A_Header ) ; Row_IO .
Write ( Handle , A_Row ) ; Header_IO.Close ( Handle ) ; end ;

When designing a package , if you want to avoid this sort of problem ( the designers of these packages did intend this restriction ) then embed the generic part within an enclosing package , thus
package generic_IO is type File_Type is limited private ; procedure Create ( File : File_Type .... procedure Close ..... generic Element_Type is private ; package Read_Write is procedure Read ( File : File_Type ; Element : Element_Type ... procedure Write ..... end Read_Write ; end generic_IO ;
with generic_IO ; package A_Database is type File_Header is record Magic_Number : Special_Stamp ; Number_Of_Records : Record_Number ; First_Deleted : Record_Number ; end record ; type Row is record Key : String ( 1 .. 80 ) ; Data : String ( 1 .. 255 ) ; end record ; package Header_IO is new generic_IO .
Read_Write ( File_Header ) ; use Header_IO ; package Row_IO is new generic_IO.
Read_Write ( Row ) ; use Record_IO ; end A_Database ; : : declare Handle : generic_IO.File_Type ; A_Header : File_Header ; A_Row : Row ; begin generic_IO .
Open ( File => Handle , Name => " Test " ) ; Header_IO.Write ( Handle , A_Header ) ; Row_IO .
Write ( Handle , A_Row ) ; generic_IO.Close ( Handle ) ; end ;

Unlike C/C++
Ada defines a concurrency model as part of the language itself .
Some languages ( Modula - 3 ) provide a concurrency model through the use of standard library packages , and of course some operating systems provide libraries to provide concurrency .
In Ada there are two base components , the task which encapsulates a concurrent process and the protected type which is a data structure which provides guarded access to its data .
fork
In a multi - threaded environment multiple concurrent processes are allowed within the same address space , that is they can share global data .
Usually there are a set of API calls such as StartThread , StopThread etc which manage these processes .
Note :
An Ada program with no tasks is really an Ada process with a single running task , the default code .
task X is end X ; task body X is begin loop -- processing .
end loop ; end X ;
task type X is end X ; Item : X ; Items : array ( 0 .. 9 ) of X ;
The Ada tasking model defines methods for inter-task cooperation and much more in a system independant way using constructs known as Rendezvous .
A Rendezvouz is just what it sounds like , a meeting place where two tasks arrange to meet up , if one task reaches it first then it waits for the other to arrive .
And in fact a queue is formed for each rendezvous of all tasks waiting ( in FIFO order ) .
in out
procedure
entry
accept
is begin
do
Consider the example below , a system of some sort has a cache of elements , it requests an element from the cache , if it is not in the cache then the cache itself reads an element from the master set .
If this process of reading from the master fills the cache then it must be reordered .
When the process finishes with the item it calls PutBack which updates the cache and if required updates the master .
task type Cached_Items is entry Request ( Item : out Item_Type ) ; entry PutBack ( Item : in Item_Type ) ; end Cached_Items ; task body Cached_Items is Log_File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type ; begin -- open the log file .
loop accept Request ( Item : out Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; -- if had to get new , then quickly -- check cache for overflow .
accept PutBack ( Item : in Item_Type ) do -- replace item in cache .
end PutBack ; -- if item put back has changed -- then possibly update original .
end loop ; end Cached_Items ; -- the client code begins here : declare Cache : Cached_Items ; Item : Item_Type ; begin Cache.Request ( Item ) ; -- process . Cache.PutBack ( Item ) ; end ;
accept
Cache.Request( Item )
If the client task calls Request before the owner task has reached the accept then the client task will wait for the owner task .
However we would not expect the owner task to take very long to open a log file , so it is more likely that it will reach the accept first and wait for a client task .
When both client and owner tasks are at the rendezvous then the owner task executes the accept code while the client task waits .
When the owner task reaches the end of the rendezvous both the owner and the client are set off again on their own way .
Request
Request
PutBack
PutBack
Request
To get around this problem we use a select statement which allows the task to specify a number of entry points which are valid at any time .
task body Cached_Items is Log_File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type ; begin -- open the log file .
accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; loop select accept PutBack ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- replace item in cache .
end PutBack ; -- if item put back has changed -- then possibly update original .
or accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; -- if had to get new , then quickly -- check cache for overflow .
end select ; end loop ; end Cached_Items ;
select
Request
entry
In effect the addition of the select statement means that the owner task now waits on the select itself until one of the specified accept s are called .
Note : possibly more important is the fact that we have not changed the specification for the task at all yet !.
accept
task body Cached_Items is Log_File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type ; Number_Requested : Integer := 0 ; Cache_Size : constant Integer := 50 ; begin -- open the log file .
accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; loop select when Number_Requested > 0 => accept PutBack ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- replace item in cache .
end PutBack ; -- if item put back has changed -- then possibly update original .
or accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; -- if had to get new , then quickly -- check cache for overflow .
end select ; end loop ; end Cached_Items ;
delay
delay 5.0 ; -- delay for 5 seconds delay Ada. Calendar .
Clock ; -- delay until it is ... delay until A_Time ; -- Ada -95 equivalent of above
Duration

It is more interesting to note the effect of one of these when used in a select statement .
For example , if an accept is likely to take a long time you might use :
select accept An_Entry do end An_Entry ; or delay 5.0 ; Put ( " An_Entry : timeout " ) ; end select ;
delay
accept
delay

delay
It is possible to protect procedural code in the same way , so we might amend our example by :
task body Cached_Items is Log_File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type ; Number_Requested : Integer := 0 ; Cache_Size : constant Integer := 50 ; begin -- open the log file .
accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; loop select when Number_Requested > 0 => accept PutBack ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- replace item in cache .
end PutBack ; select -- if item put back has changed -- then possibly update original .
or delay 2.0 ; -- abort the cache update code end select ; or accept Request ( Item : Item_Type ) do -- satisfy from cache or get new .
end Request ; -- if had to get new , then quickly -- check cache for overflow .
end select ; end loop ; end Cached_Items ;
The else clause allows us to execute a non-blocking select statement , so we could code a polling task , such as :
select accept Do_Something do end DO_Something ; else -- do something else .
end select ;
terminate
abort
The terminate alternative is used for a task to specify that the run time environment can terminate the task if all its actions are complete and no clients are waiting .
loop select accept Do_Something do end Do_Something ; or terminate ; end select ; end loop ;
abort
if Task_In_Error( Cache ) then abort Cache ; end if ;
then abort
delay
then abort
end select
delay
select delay 5.0 ; Put ( " An_Entry : timeout " ) ; then abort accept An_Entry do end An_Entry ; end select ;
Timed entry call Conditional entry call Asynchronous select
protected type Cached_Items is function Request return Item_Type ; procedure PutBack ( Item : in Item_Type ) ; private Log_File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type ; Number_Requested : Integer := 0 ; Cache_Size : constant Integer := 50 ; end Cached_Items ; protected body Cached_Items is function Request return Item_Type is begin -- initialise , if required -- satisfy from cache or get new .

Impressive :
The ‘ ring of the devil ’ is capable of attacking this kind of electronic motor lock on two ways .
Scenario 1 : An electronic motor is nothing more then a metal part on an axe that turns because of a changing magnetic field .
Turning electro magnets on and off will generate a pulling force on the metal part , making it rotate .
The ring does the same thing .
By turning the ring , the metal part in the electro motor starts turning , opening the lock .
As Rop suggested in the comments of the previous posting , a bunch of bigger magnets and maybe a high - speed drill can amplify this effect some more .
Scenario 2 : A dynamo is nothing more then a coil charged by a changing magnetic field .
So any coil in the lock will start generating current when a magnetic field is rotating around it .
If the coil is in the path of the electro motor , it might generate enough current for the motor to start turning .

He is the young Justice Department lawyer — thirty - four at the time — who wrote the Bush administration 's first decisions on prisoner detention , interrogation , habeas corpus , military commissions , and the Geneva Conventions .
He is the man who defined torture as pain equivalent to " death or organ failure , " who said that the president could crush the testicles of a child to make his father talk , who picked the lock on Pandora 's box and unleashed the demons of Abu Ghraib .
He 's been accused of war crimes and compared to the Nazi lawyers who justified Hitler .
Many good Americans would like to see him fired , shamed , even imprisoned .
But in his classroom at Berkeley School of Law , John Yoo is a charming and patient teacher , popular with students and cordial to all .
He 's wearing an elegant blue suit offset by a shiny silver tie .
His face is more like a shield than a face , expressionless and almost perfectly round , but his voice is relaxed and warm .
At this moment , he 's trying to get his students to define war .
" So Judge Tatel says it 's not so hard to say what a war is — casualties .
What else ? "
" Aircraft flying everywhere . "
" There were no wars before Kitty Hawk ? "
" Ships sailing around . "
" So maybe the use of armed forces .
But in the 1980s the U.S. bombed Libya .
It lasted an hour , less than a hundred people were killed .
Would that meet your standard for a war ? "
No , the student says .
" How about use of troops ?
The U.S. sent troops to Somalia , primarily to reduce civilian casualties .
Is that a war ? "
" I do n't think so . "
The questions keep coming until the student hits overload .
" There are scholars who spend their lives studying this ! "
Yoo chuckles .
" Unfortunately including myself . "
It seems grotesque , does n't it ?
To sit in a comfortable classroom as the future lawyers of America clack away on their laptops , parsing definitions with the man whose legal mind turned America into a torturing nation ?
Jose Padilla 's lawyers certainly think so .
" We are talking about the torture of an American citizen in an American prison by American officials , " one of them told me , indignation rising fresh in his voice .
Padilla is the former Chicago gang member who was arrested in O'Hare Airport in May 2002 as he returned from terrorist training camps in the Middle East with plans — or so the government believed — to explode a " dirty " nuclear bomb in the United States .
After he was convicted on more general terrorism - conspiracy charges , his lawyers took the extraordinary step of filing a lawsuit against the junior - level lawyer they saw as the first link in the chain .
" Defendant Yoo prepared the Torture Memos , " they said , referring to several Justice Department opinions , including a memo that was signed on August 1 , 2002 , and withdrawn in shame two years later .
" He knew the Torture Memos would be transmitted to senior government officials , including officials at the White House and Department of Defense , and would be relied upon by military and intelligence officers in formulating and implementing programs of confinement and interrogation for suspected ' enemy combatants . '
" Yoo also wrote the memo that put the " enemy combatant " label on Padilla .
As a result , the lawsuit claims , Padilla was held without charges for three years and eight months , completely alone under twenty - four - hour camera surveillance , with his windows blacked out and no clock or radio or TV to help him mark time .
Sometimes the lights were left on for days , sometimes he was left in the dark for days , sometimes the cell was extremely hot , sometimes extremely cold .
His sleep was constantly interrupted and he was threatened with death and given disorienting drugs and shackled and forced into stress positions for hours at a time .
Whenever he was moved , he wore a blindfold and noise - canceling headphones to reinforce his isolation and helplessness .
After a few years of this intentional effort to break his will and destroy his mind , Padilla was given to " involuntary twitching and self - inflicted scratch wounds " and his jailers often observed him weeping in his cell , so broken and passive that he had become " like a piece of furniture . "
Padilla 's claims have not been proven .
Some of them , like the accusations of death threats and use of drugs , go beyond even Yoo 's liberal interpretation of interrogation laws .
But they remind us of what we have done and what we will continue to do .
Consider the fight over Michael Mukasey 's nomination for attorney general , when Mukasey refused to call waterboarding torture .
He said he did n't want to put the CIA officers who made these judgments in the heat of battle " in personal legal jeopardy . "
It seemed so ridiculous , right out of 1984 .
The Khmer Rouge used waterboarding .
We prosecuted Japanese generals for doing it .
But Mukasey was confirmed anyway , and four months later President Bush vetoed a law that banned waterboarding .
Consider also that courts and Congress have endorsed many of Yoo 's opinions , including the use of military commissions and the extended detention without criminal charges of " enemy combatants " who are American citizens .
And consider this — we still can't even agree on the basic question that Yoo is asking his law class today , which turns out to be not a quibble or a technicality but the very first question that landed on his desk on the afternoon of September 11 , 2001 :
Is this a war ?
How can the president respond ?
Can he use the Army ?
Will he need congressional approval ?
Is this a war ?
" It 's like pornography , " one student says .
" You know it when you see it . "
It 's just semantics , says another .
" When there 's something as powerful as war , we do n't want the president to just go ahead . "
But why not ?
Yoo asks .
" Because we like checks and balances and we like the Constitution ? "
" So you 're worried about one person making mistakes .
War is so dangerous , the stakes are so high , you would n't want one person making that decision ? "
" That 's why it 's so important to have checks and balances , " the student agrees .
" Otherwise the president could run wild .
Like we have today , with the powers of an unchecked president — I call that running wild . "
" So you 're worried about errors , " Yoo answers , perfectly calm .
" That 's certainly the case with Iraq .
We overestimated the benefits and underestimated the costs . "
But now the hour is up and the students gather their papers — and Yoo still keeps shooting out last - minute questions .
" Is the president really prone to error more than the other branches ?
Is n't that also true of Congress ?
If you require Congress to give preapproval for every conflict , what is the cost ?
Why did n't Truman ask for a declaration of war in Korea , even though Congress would have given him one ? "
These are hard questions .
Most of us shrug them off and judge Yoo and Bush through the lens of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo .
But
Yoo did n't shrug them off .
He put them at the center of his thinking .
As a consequence , he is being hauled before Congress in May and will be forever defined by the abuses of the Bush administration .
From his office , he has a million - dollar view of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge .
There are law books everywhere .
His screen saver is a picture of his wife .
His iPhone screen saver is a picture of his wife too , which helps take the edge off all the hate calls .
On the floor , there 's a shopping bag from a local hippie institution called Amoeba Music .
On the wall , a framed goodbye card from the Department of Justice .
" Thank you for your excellent service to America , " John Ashcroft wrote .
" We are stronger and safer because of you . "
He turns out to have lots of unexpected quirks .
He 's pro-choice .
He thinks flag burning is a legitimate form of free speech .
He thinks the government is " wasting a lot of resources " in the war on drugs .
He thinks the phrase " war on terror " is misleading political rhetoric .
He 's cowriting an article that makes a conservative case for gay marriage .
" Our argument is , the state should just stay out of these things , because it does n't hurt anybody . "
And he 's definitely alarmed by the more theocratic Republicans .
" When Mike Huckabee says he wants to amend the Constitution so that it 's consistent with God 's law , that scares the bejesus out of me . "
We go for a stroll down Telegraph Avenue , and he's a bit disappointed there are n't more tie - dyed renegades .
" Usually this is the land time forgot . "
" Do you often come here to mock the hippies ? "
" I do n't come here specifically for that .
I try to multitask . "
The hippies might be worn out from protesting , he says .
Two weeks ago , the Berkeley City Council called the local Marine recruiters " unwelcome intruders " and it turned into a huge controversy , with Republicans threatening to cut millions in city funds and thousands of protesters massing outside City Hall with signs that said " Waterboarding is Torture " and " Take a Stand Agaisnt Torture . "
" I think the city was nuts , " Yoo says .
" You can be against the war , but to be against the armed forces ?
It 's crazy . "
" People are n't always as coherent as you 'd like them to be . "
" It shows you what a strange place this is . "
" Or how unpopular the war is . "
" It 's the level of anger that really shocks me , " he says .
" I 'm surprised that you 're surprised , " I say .
The anger is often directed at him .
Protesters in Guantánamo orange have disrupted his class and dogged him in public forums .
I talked to another Berkeley law professor who refuses to attend faculty meetings with him .
" Until he atones , " he said , " I do n't want to be in the same room with him . "
But Yoo shrugs it all off .
He likes living among liberals , he says .
" Liberals from the sixties do a great job of creating all the comforts of life — gourmet food , specialty jams , the best environmentally conscious waters . "
We stop in at Amoeba Music and he cruises the sci - fi shelves — he 's a fan of Ghost in the Shell , the anime that inspired The Matrix .
Usually he buys classical music , but his taste in pop runs to anthemic bands like the Who and U2 .
" Nothing too esoteric .
I do n't have any fancy tastes in pop music . "
He seems very pleased that the entire record store smells like marijuana .
" That 's what Berkeley smells like ! "
At Steve 's Korean B.B.Q. ,
Yoo talks about his parents .
They were teenagers during the Korean War , a serious pair who both became doctors and moved to the U. S. out of gratitude and a love of democracy .
" They saw the United States as saving their country , and I agree with them , " he says .
" It did save their country .
And then it let people in .
It was extraordinarily generous .
I would n't be here if it was n't for the generosity of the United States . "
He grew up in the elite Main Line area of Philadelphia and went to a prep school where he wore a suit and tie and learned Greek and Latin .
He seems to have been a natural - born conservative , attracted even as a teenager to Ronald Reagan 's message of anticommunism , low taxes , and small government , values that resonated with the immigrant dream of personal freedom .
But he was never angry or righteous about it .
" He was completely open and tolerant of everyone , " says Gordon Getter , a prep-school classmate .
" He had a genuine sense of humor , " says Thomas Schwartz , one of his professors at Harvard .
" He would argue and people would get mad at him , but he never seemed to take it personally . "
He was also exceptionally brilliant , Schwartz says .
" These were extraordinary students , and John was a star among them . "
As an undergraduate in the history department , Yoo developed a deep interest in presidential power .
His senior thesis was about Eisenhower 's plan to share nuclear weapons with the other members of NATO .
The example of Truman in Korea was never far from his mind — with North Korean troops sweeping south , Truman rushed U. S. troops to war without pausing for a congressional debate and tried to seize the steel companies to guarantee arms production .
But when
Yoo arrived at Yale Law School , everyone seemed to agree that Congress was the dominant policymaker and should approve every war .
It was the standard liberal position in the wake of Vietnam , but Yoo saw Vietnam through the lens of Korea , imagining how life would have been for his parents under the savage dictatorship of Kim Il Sung .
His preference for Truman 's lonely fortitude only deepened when he became a clerk for Laurence Silberman , one of the leading champions of the " unitary executive " theory of expansive presidential powers .
In free moments around the courthouse , Silberman painted Congress as a flock of tiny men with tiny ropes intent on binding the president down — annoying in peace but dangerous in war .
Over the next few years ,
Yoo alternated between stints as a professor at Berkeley and jobs in Washington , first with Justice Clarence Thomas and next with Senator Orrin Hatch .
Though he disagreed with them on basic issues like abortion and the attempt to remove Clinton from office , he was drawn to their lonely integrity .
Hatch was " one of the few guys in the Senate who really would go to the mat on principle , " he says .
He also picked up another crucial lesson during the Whitewater investigation , when Senate committee members would demand documents and President Clinton refused to provide them , each side insisting that the Constitution supported its position .
" But they worked out deals , " Yoo says .
" The system is almost designed for them to come into conflict , and they work out a deal .
So that had a big effect on me . "
Back at Berkeley , he started putting it all into a book .
As the first chapters hit the legal journals , he became a star on the lecture circuit , a young hotshot with a provocative theory .
His basic idea was that the Constitution has tons of rules on how to pass legislation but almost nothing on war .
So the president takes action and Congress fights back , an improvisation with one partner leading , and that is the way it was meant to be — the real reason Truman did n't ask Congress for an authorization before going into Korea , the reason Clinton continued to bomb the Serbs in defiance of the War Powers Act , the reason Bush has resisted every attempt by Congress to restrict his war policies .
Yoo 's analysis hinges on the Declare War Clause .
Most scholars — most people — believe it was intended to give Congress power to decide whether to go to war and that the founders saw this as an essential bulwark against tyranny .
Yoo makes a case that it was really meant as a formal recognition of wars already under way , and the founders intended the real bulwark against tyranny to be Congress 's power of the purse .
" Several times every year , Congress has a chance to vote on funding the Iraq war , " he keeps telling me .
" It 's an amazing power — if 51 percent of them refuse to vote for it , the war is over . "
Abraham Lincoln is
Yoo 's best argument .
Congress had already passed a statute laying out an explicit legal procedure for freeing slaves , but Lincoln ignored the law and freed the slaves under his " unilateral executive authority in wartime as commander in chief to take measures necessary to win a war , " as Yoo puts it .
Lincoln used the same grounds to suspend habeas corpus , a right the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress .
If you really believe that Yoo is all wrong and the unitary - executive theory completely false , you kind of have to say Lincoln behaved like a tyrant .
Jonathan Freiman , Jose Padilla 's attorney , bristles when I run Yoo 's arguments down for him .
" The Supreme Court has said every time it 's been asked since 9/11 , a state of war is not a blank check .
The Constitution applies . "
But Congress and the Supreme Court also accepted the military commissions and the enemy - combatant designation and even the indefinite detention of an American citizen named Yaser Hamdi , Yoo would say .
Freiman concedes the point .
But Hamdi was arrested in a foreign country in the zone of combat , he says .
" That 's a pretty small category , a battlefield in a foreign country .
It 's not a category that encompasses Padilla . "
But that 's exactly the problem .
Padilla was arrested a few months after his associates killed three thousand people in New York City .
So where is this battlefield ?
It 's a dangerous question , Freiman says .
" The argument that the entire United States has become a battlefield by virtue of those heinous attacks on 9/11 is just an argument to make the Constitution completely optional , an argument to extend presidential power to the level of monarchy — to every inch of life in this country . "
For the next two hours , he pounds
Yoo from every possible angle :
They already had Padilla under arrest and could have held him under charges like conspiracy or levying war .
But they wanted to interrogate him and they wanted to use harsh methods , so they just made up their own rules .
This was the natural result of rejecting the Geneva Conventions instead of treating Al Qaeda members as ordinary war criminals .
" Before 9/11 , you 're either a criminal or a soldier .
What the government said was ,
We want a third category where the black shade is drawn , where there are no protections whatsoever , where there is no law . "
Freiman is particularly passionate when he rips into the torture memo itself .
Did I know that the Justice Department was now investigating how it ever came to be written ?
Did I know that the man who took over
Yoo 's department withdrew it , calling it " deeply flawed , sloppily reasoned , overbroad , and incautious in asserting extraordinary constitutional authorities on behalf of the president ? "
What Yoo should have done was look at the Eighth Amendment , which forbids cruel and unusual punishment .
He should have considered international treaties against torture and cruelty and civil rights along with a host of domestic laws and statutes .
But
Yoo was n't acting as an honest lawyer , he says .
As the Padilla lawsuit states , he was " a key member of a small , secretive group of executive officials who exerted tremendous influence over antiterrorism policy and who were known as the ' War Council . '
" So he bent the law to justify a course of action he was already determined to take .
Freiman is especially scornful about the " necessity argument , " as legal philosophers call it — the idea that the president can take extraordinary actions in an emergency to protect the nation , that the information in Padilla 's head was worth cracking it open .
" That 's the argument that every despotic regime in every corner of the globe has been making for sixty years , " he says .
" Necessity , national security .
The Nazis invoked necessity too .
The question is , How do you deal with those threats ?
Are you bound by human rights , or are you not ? "
This is why Freiman filed Padilla 's lawsuit against Yoo .
To redraw that line , he says , to recover our sense of justice and decency , to salvage the idealism that once shone so bright , America must pass judgment on John Yoo .
So let 's go back to that moment in the heat of battle .
The way Yoo tells the story , he was sitting at his desk at the Justice Department when the first plane hit the World Trade Center .
He had only been working there two months , hired to answer the White House 's questions on foreign - policy laws at a time when the biggest legal issue before him was a treaty about polar bears .
When the order came to evacuate Washington and people began heading out into the streets , someone from the attorney general 's office told him to stick around .
Soon the questions came :
Is this a war ?
Do we need to declare war ?
Can we scramble planes ?
And again : Is this a war ?
There was no obvious precedent .
Yoo considered the level of violence and the source , thousands of civilians killed in coordinated attacks by a foreign enemy intent on crippling our government .
He considered the Civil War , when people asked if it was a war or a rebellion and if Southerners should be treated as traitors or members of a foreign nation .
He considered our history of warfare against nonstate groups like Indians and pirates .
He considered the level of military response that might be likely , because a military response itself would imply a state of war .
He may have considered his friend Barbara Olson , dead on one of the planes .
He found himself returning to this thought :
If a nation had done it , would we have any doubt it was a war ?
So yes , it was a war .
That 's the decision he made while the buildings were still burning .
He stayed till two or three in the morning and when he left Justice and crossed the Fourteenth Street Bridge , the Pentagon was still burning .
He saw the flames reaching up so high they lit the sky .
But he did n't sleep because his phone kept ringing , each call another variation on the theme :
Can we use force ?
What standards would guide the use of force ?
Is this a war ?
Everyone reviewed his war memo .
Ashcroft signed off .
And Congress passed the Authorization to Use Military Force with only one opposing vote .
If this was the first mistake in the war on terror , as many now believe , it was a mistake the nation made together .
The decision on military commissions came next and seemed like a no - brainer , Yoo says .
We had always used military commissions in wartime because they were less cumbersome and many civilian laws ( like stalking and assault ) made no sense in a war context .
It also seemed like a good idea to keep the prison camps distant from U. S. soil , both for safety and to insulate them from those same domestic laws .
The Geneva Conventions issue came up in December 2001 .
In retrospect it may seem obvious that any departure from Geneva was a policy mistake , the first step down the slippery slope , but Yoo points out that President Reagan explicitly refused to extend Geneva rights to terrorists in 1987 .
There were also technical problems , such as Geneva requirements that POWs be held in barracks instead of prisons , which did n't seem a practical approach to enemies who did n't wear uniforms and deliberately killed civilians , war criminals by definition .
The Taliban was a tougher issue because Afghanistan had something closer to regular - army units and had signed the Geneva Conventions , but Yoo argued that Afghanistan was a failed state , so its signature did n't mean anything — which even he admits was pushing it .
The point was , they were n't massing orderly brigades to attack the United States .
They gave safe haven to terrorists .
With Colin Powell pushing back , Bush finally decided to deny Geneva rights to Al Qaeda but to extend them to the Taliban — a necessary improvisation , Yoo says , a recognition that something new had entered the world .
The interrogation question came up only briefly , Yoo insists .
In one meeting he attended in the White House Situation Room , someone worried that under Geneva , " we would only be able to ask Osama bin Laden loud questions , and nothing more . "
But this was all just an academic exercise until late March 2002 , when the CIA captured Al Qaeda 's chief of operations , a man named Abu Zubaydah .
They approached Yoo and said they had solid reasons to believe that Zubaydah knew the names of hundreds of terrorists and the details of attack plans that could include nuclear weapons .
On top of that , Zubaydah was an expert in interrogation and how to resist interrogation .
If it was n't exactly the famous " ticking bomb " scenario come to life , where you are certain there is a bomb and certain your captive knows where it is , it was close enough .
Yoo insists that nobody ever proposed crossing the line into outright torture and that he personally considers torture repugnant and unjustified under any conditions .
But they did believe that this was a strange new kind of war , where the front lines were inside the heads of men like Padilla and Abu Zubaydah .
So , what about things like isolation , prolonged interrogation , forced exercise , and limited sleep ?
Where was the line , exactly ?
" How long did it take to come up with an answer ? "
" I do n't remember . "
" Weeks ?
Months ? "
" Probably weeks . "
The Eighth Amendment did not apply , Yoo decided .
It forbade cruel and unusual punishment , but punishment came only after a criminal conviction .
His critics savage him for not considering American laws against coerced confessions and police brutality , but Yoo points out that the memo only applies to noncitizens " outside the United States . "
They say he should have considered our treaty obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture , which also forbids " cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment , " but Yoo believed that treaties were only binding when Congress passed statutes translating them into domestic law , a position recently affirmed by the Supreme Court .
That meant the binding law was the antitorture statute Congress passed in 1994 in the wake of the convention , a statute that forbade " severe " physical pain and " prolonged mental harm . "
So these were the critical questions :
How do you define " severe pain " ?
How do you define " prolonged mental harm " ?
Some say this is where he should have balked .
" Torture violates the very premise of the legal system itself , that there is something irreducible and inviolable about every person , " says Yoo 's fellow Berkeley law professor
Robert H. Cole .
" You can't write a memo about it the way you would write about snowmobiling in Yosemite . "
At the very least , they say , Yoo should have warned of the moral danger the question posed to the essence of America .
Yoo says he shared those concerns .
He says he thought he was writing a memo for exceptional cases , for the highly trained specialists of the CIA .
" I never thought it would be a good idea for the Army to do it , to put it in the hands of eighteen - year - old kids .
But it would be inappropriate if I had that worry and it changed the way I interpreted the law . "
So he buckled down to one of the world 's most thankless jobs , defining the limits of acceptable pain .
He knew it would be easy to draw a vague standard that sounded good and then give the CIA a meaningful wink .
But that would n't be fair to the officers in the field .
He wanted to draw a clear line .
The problem was , the Justice Department had never prosecuted anyone under the antitorture statute , so there were no judicial opinions to guide him .
Dictionaries defined severe as " extreme " and " hard to endure . "
Yoo studied all the international precedents he could find , including the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Ireland v. the United Kingdom , which found that the use of hoods , continuous loud noise , sleep deprivation , reduced diet , and a stress position called " wall - standing " were all cruel and degrading but not torture .
So where was the line ?
He got the crucial phrasing about organ failure and death from a U. S. law concerning health care .
I can't let this pass .
" John , you 're a very engaging guy .
I like you .
I can't picture you writing that phrase , ' organ failure or death . ' "
" It 's the phrase Congress used , " he says .
" But health care and interrogation are wildly different subjects . "
" That 's a fair criticism .
But it 's still the closest you can get to any definition of that phrase at all . "
" But this is n't legal theory anymore .
It 's going to have a body count . "
" It 's a difficult issue , I admit .
It 's the use of violence .
It 's unpleasant .
I do n't disagree with that . "
" You could have drawn the line in a different place . "
" I really tried to distinguish between law and policy , " he insists .
Despite
Yoo 's shocking language defining severe pain as " equivalent to " organ failure or death , he points out that the memo clearly defines as torture mock executions , threats of imminent death , and beatings .
He also says it 's unfair for people to confuse the war crimes of Abu Ghraib with the aggressive interrogations he authorized .
His memo also includes a long list of examples of acts that various courts have found to be torture , page after page of severe beatings and electric shocks and even one case where guards shackled a man to a bed , placed a towel over his face , and poured water down his nose — a nearly exact description of waterboarding , " which people ignore because they focus on that one sentence , " Yoo says .
" So if you read the whole opinion , I do n't think of it as a license to do anything you want to . "
It 's true , the list is there , the cautionary intent clear .
I 've never seen it mentioned by any of his critics .
But so is
Yoo 's pet theory about the president 's unlimited war powers in an emergency , the passage that would , at least in theory , justify crushing testicles : " Congress may no more regulate the President 's ability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop movements in the field . "
This is the section that drives people crazy .
When the new head of the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel officially withdrew the memo , he singled it out for its " unusual lack of care and sobriety , " its " cursory and one - sided legal arguments . "
No matter what Lincoln or Truman did , they say , Yoo never should have tried to make presidential lawbreaking legal .
But
Yoo insists that suicide terrorism in the age of nuclear weapons is precisely the kind of situation he anticipated in his law - school theory , the reason the founders left the president 's war powers vague .
" But at the same time , " I say , " you know that by writing that opinion , by using those words , you 're opening the gates . "
" I agree , " he answers .
" The language is not pleasing , it 's not politically savvy -- I did n't see that as my job . "
" And you did n't have any moral qualms ? "
He looks me right in the eye .
" I think there are some moral questions .
But the other side of the moral question is the lives you might save .
I have a hard time believing any responsible American president would have said , ' No , absolutely not , do not ask him any more questions , give him a lawyer . '
I do n't think Al Gore would have said that . "
But those harsh interrogation techniques migrated straight to Iraq .
What about that ?
" That was definitely not permitted under the decision - making level I was at , " Yoo says .
" It was clearly not .
The Geneva Conventions fully applied in Iraq . "
And the memo he wrote that was made public this spring , which justified harsh interrogation techniques for military interrogators ?
That worried him , he says .
But it only applied to interrogators of Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantánamo , and Yoo says that he expressed his concerns to officials " at high levels of the Department of Justice , the White House , and the Department of Defense . "
Is it possible that partisan loyalty blinded him to the dangers of putting all that power into the hands of a president so reckless and extreme , the worst combination of cowboy machismo with this radical theory of executive power ?
" I can see why people have that view , but I just do n't think this is the product of people who have this radical worldview . "
" But Cheney was primed .
He said we would have to go to the dark side . "
Yoo does n't say anything for a moment , then answers in his usual measured tone .
" In World War II , we interned people , tens of thousands of citizens .
We tried citizens who were enemy spies under military commissions which had no procedures at all .
We let the Air Force kill hundreds of thousands of civilians in firebombing runs in Europe .
We dropped a nuclear weapon on Japan .
Waterboarding we think is torture , but it happened to three people .
The scale of magnitude is different . "
" But if the war goes on forever , we 've created a torture state . "
" We 've done it three times , " he repeats .
" The White House launched an elective war against a country based on false premises . "
" They made a mistake . "
" But your theory puts the power in the hands of a person who then can invade the wrong country . "
" Who can make a mistake .
The Constitution can't protect against bad decisions , " he insists .
" What the framers were really worried about was not that the president would make a mistake , but that the president would become a dictator , and I really do n't think Bush has become that . "
And looking back ?
Does he still think it was the right decision ?
" I still think I would have done the same -- with Abu Zubaydah .
But I did n't want the military to use these methods .
My advice was not taken on that . "
Yoo left the Justice Department in May of 2003 , just after Mission Accomplished , three months before Major General Geoffrey Miller was sent to Iraq to " Gitmoize " Abu Ghraib .
So what is severe pain ?
We asked John Yoo , and he drew the line for us , and now he is tainted in our eyes , rendered unclean by his contact with the unspeakable .
The broken figure of Jose Padilla and the horrors of Abu Ghraib will loom behind him forever .
" I got a call from the L.A .
Times asking me if he was a war criminal , " says his old Harvard professor sadly .
" All my friends see him in that light . "
But if you read the thousands of essays and books and blogs that rage against him , you will find very few that give a satisfactory answer to the question
Yoo was asked .
How would you define severe pain ?
If thousands of lives are at stake and time is of the essence ?
Would you allow sleep manipulation ?
Heat and cold ?
Isolation ?
Hunger ?
I asked Jose Padilla 's lawyer three times .
Where would you draw the line , Mr. Freiman ?
He dodged it twice .
The third time he said outright , " I 'm not going to draw that line for you .
But I 'll tell you where I would have looked -- I would have first looked at the Constitution to see what was permissible , then I would have looked at the Geneva Conventions .
. . . "
So we still do n't have an answer to the question .
Some people take comfort in the argument that torture never works .
Others say that only an imminent threat to the existence of the nation would justify it .
Some say that torture should always be against the law as long as we remember that some laws are meant to be broken , a camp that includes John McCain and Judge Richard Posner in his recent book , Not a Suicide Pact : The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency : " In national emergencies most soldiers and other security personnel are willing to do what the situation demands and leave their legal liabilities to be sorted out later .
They live for such emergencies , and are selected for courage . "
Was that Yoo 's real mistake ?
Saying it out loud ?
I ask him the question nobody in the Bush administration wants to answer .
" Is waterboarding torture ? "
He does n't hesitate .
" It 's on the line .
It does n't cause long - term or permanent pain , but it does cause intense pain .
It seems to meet the requirements of the statute in some ways -- but not all .
So it seems to me that in very limited circumstances , you can use it . "
Is what was done to Jose Padilla morally wrong ?
" I really cannot talk about that , however much I would like to , because of the litigation brought by Padilla against me , " Yoo says .
" But perhaps I can say that the memos only applied to captured Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders held outside the United States .
They would not apply to an American citizen or permanent resident alien held anywhere in the world , or to anyone held within the United States . "
He has other regrets .
" I could have tried to press harder on what the Army should have done , " he says .
But he wo n't back down on the rest .
He 'd write the torture memos the same today , he told me .
Alone among Bush administration officials , he does not run from what he has done .
He writes editorials and participates in as many as forty public forums a year .
In Los Angeles , I even saw him debate a professor of queer theory , an absurd spectacle .
" No man is above the law , " she said , wanting it to be simple .
" This is a question of tragic choices , " he answered , insisting it is not .
Not that anyone is listening .
Yoo has become the focus of national anger about every excess in the war on terrorism , and minds are made up .
But dismissing him as a monster just means that we do n't have to think about why he did what he did .
Grant him his good intentions , entertain the possibility that he did it to save lives , recognize the honor in his refusal to hide , and his story becomes a cautionary tale about the incremental steps that can lead a nation to disaster .
Back in his class , the ghosts return .
" Let 's turn to Hamdi v. Rumsfeld on page 172 , " he says .
The students open their books .
" Did you all do Mathews in civil procedure ?
Remember , it was a case about terminating welfare benefits , and it was all a question of balancing different interests .
So what is Hamdi's interest ? "
" To not be detained -- liberty . "
" And what is government 's interest ? "
" To wage war . "

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld a lower court 's ruling that the smell of burned marijuana is not enough to allow police to arrest someone and conduct a warrantless search .
" The smell alone can't constitute the grounds because the smell of burnt marijuana — as opposed to raw marijuana — gives an inference that the material is gone , it 's dissipated into the atmosphere .
So how can you say you 're in possession of something that does n't exist ? " said Ronald Piche , Janvier 's lawyer .
" There may be suspicion that the person is in possession of marijuana but that 's not enough to base an arrest . "
The Crown appealed the decision and the trial judge 's decision was upheld .
A study funded by the US government has concluded that conservatism can be explained psychologically as a set of neuroses rooted in " fear and aggression , dogmatism and the intolerance of ambiguity " .
As if that was not enough to get Republican blood boiling , the report 's four authors linked Hitler , Mussolini , Ronald Reagan and the rightwing talkshow host , Rush Limbaugh , arguing they all suffered from the same affliction .
All of them " preached a return to an idealised past and condoned inequality " .
Republicans are demanding to know why the psychologists behind the report , Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition , received $ 1.2 m in public funds for their research from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .
The authors also peer into the psyche of President George Bush , who turns out to be a textbook case .
The telltale signs are his preference for moral certainty and frequently expressed dislike of nuance .
" This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar , to arrive at premature conclusions , and to impose simplistic cliches and stereotypes , " the authors argue in the Psychological Bulletin .
One of the psychologists behind the study , Jack Glaser , said the aversion to shades of grey and the need for " closure " could explain the fact that the Bush administration ignored intelligence that contradicted its beliefs about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
The authors , presumably aware of the outrage they were likely to trigger , added a disclaimer that their study " does not mean that conservatism is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false " .
Another author , Arie Kruglanski , of the University of Maryland , said he had received hate mail since the article was published , but he insisted that the study " is not critical of conservatives at all " .
" The variables we talk about are general human dimensions , " he said .
" These are the same dimensions that contribute to loyalty and commitment to the group .
Liberals might be less intolerant of ambiguity , but they may be less decisive , less committed , less loyal . "
But what drives the psychologists ?
George Will , a Washington
Post columnist who has long suffered from ingrained conservatism , noted , tartly : " The professors have ideas ; the rest of us have emanations of our psychological needs and neuroses . "
On World Malaria Day , Chris and Xand Van Tulleken , working with the aid agency Merlin , highlight the devastating link between conflict and rates of malaria infection .
When we were studying tropical medicine in London , a favourite trick of one professor was to ask students what we thought the deadliest animal in the world might be .
One Ghanaian colleague suggested a lion riding on the back of an elephant , eating and trampling everything in sight .
Conflict causes 30 % of malaria deaths in Africa .
Picture : Jacqueline Koch .
But the required answer was the humble mosquito - or more precisely , the anopheles mosquito , the carrier and transmitter of malaria , a disease which kills over one million people every year .
This rather clever answer is n't entirely true .
Anopheles mosquitoes are found in harmless abundance in many places on earth .
Malaria , once widespread even in Kent , has been eradicated from Europe and North America , as well as many parts of Asia .
Why then does it persist with such deadly effect in some parts of the world ?
Information vacuum Poverty and weak health systems contribute hugely to the problem , but another , largely overlooked , factor is responsible for nearly 30 % of all malaria deaths in Africa - conflict .
In 2007 , 26 million people were driven from their homes by conflict .
The effects of climate change - and conflict over limited resources like water , food and land - mean that every year , larger numbers of people are likely to be displaced .
Nets do n't work so well if , like many displaced people , you have no bed , and no home
In pictures : Malaria in conflict
When people flee conflict , they do n't take hospital records with them .
They do n't take demographic data or disease patterns or any of the other details needed to tackle malaria .
They are often settled on land which has been abandoned because of the risk of malaria , or forced to live in over - crowded camps with limited health services , water , food and shelter .
In this vacuum of information and mass displacement , malaria is at its most deadly : frequently , more people die from the disease than the actual violence .
The British medical aid agency , Merlin , has been running emergency mobile clinics in Kenya 's Rift Valley province since post-election violence forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes .
More than 32,000 terrified people flooded into Nakuru district in the Rift Valley alone .
Medics working on the ground simply do n't have records of drug resistance levels or immunity for the displaced families now living in camps .
Cases of malaria are normally quite low in Nakuru , but with so many new people in the area , Merlin is aware that the chance of disease patterns changing is high , as is the risk of an outbreak .
Monsieur Paracheck
Experience shows that there is no single effective solution to controlling malaria ; mosquitoes , resistance to drugs and people 's immunity all vary greatly from place to place .
Insecticide - treated bed nets have a vital role to play in preventing malaria , as Gordon Brown 's recent pledge of $ 200 m to fund mass net distribution demonstrates .
Drugs used in one part of the world may be useless in another .
But nets do n't work so well if , like many displaced people , you have no bed , and no home .
Likewise , destruction of mosquito breeding sites can control the disease , but first you must know whether the local bugs breed in dirty , sunlit ground water or clean water in dark places .
Applying insect repellents to skin helps , but only if you know when the mosquitoes are likely to bite ; anopheles gambiensis bites indoors at night ( so bed nets work well ) , anopheles bellator bites outdoors at dusk .
Diagnosis poses similar problems .
Parachecks are rapid - test malaria kits , much like pregnancy tests .
I used them to monitor for a malaria outbreak in Darfur ; they were quick and easy for local staff to learn to use .
My colleague who performed the tests was so proficient that he was popularly , and respectfully , known as Monsieur Paracheck .
These tests are not however appropriate in all settings and their usefulness depends on the number of people affected with the disease , the types of malaria , and the diagnostic information needed .
Treatment , again , varies .
Drugs which can be effective within hours in one part of the world , may have such high resistance elsewhere to render them useless .
Malaria prevention , diagnosis and treatment require intensive , local information gathering which is often extremely difficult when people are still migrating or when violence is rife .
But all are essential to understand quickly and implement early if , as predicted , the trend for mass displacement caused by conflict continues to rise .
Insecticide on burkas Solutions have to be tailored to specific circumstances .
Even in desperately vulnerable , displaced communities , it is possible to greatly reduce the number of people who die from the disease with well - designed , locally effective control programmes
An effective programme for Afghan refugees in Pakistan , rested on the discovery that the malaria mosquitoes there mostly feed on animals , and the displaced communities often live with their livestock so are constantly exposed to bites .
" Research showed that by coating the livestock with insecticide , malaria rates plummeted " , explains Merlin 's malaria advisor , Dr Ahmed Fayaz .
" But there were also unexpected benefits : the animals gained weight and milk production increased .
These welcome side - effects ensured farmers continued to use the insecticide which protected them from malaria . "
Sadly , these methods wo n't work in Africa , where mosquitoes tend to feed on people .
Nonetheless it is ideas founded in local knowledge such as these , or the technique of applying insecticide to women 's burkas in Muslim countries , which can help save lives .
Malaria is a curable illness and a preventable disease .
Even in desperately vulnerable , displaced communities , it is possible to greatly reduce the number of people who die from the disease with well - designed , locally effective control programmes .
As conflict forces more people from their homes , the need to put malaria control at the heart of any humanitarian response has never been more urgent .

The report by MPs challenges the use of national tests
The national testing system in English schools is being misused to the detriment of children 's education , says a report from a committee of MPs .
The Commons schools , children and families committee says teachers spend too much time " teaching to the test " .
" The inappropriate use of national testing could lead to damaging consequences , " warns the report .
Schools Minister Jim Knight welcomed MPs ' recognition that the " principle of national testing is sound " .
With hundreds of thousands of 11 - year - olds in England taking " Sats " tests this week , the select committee report warns that the tests are being used in a way that does not benefit children or the schools system .
New type of test " In an effort to drive up national standards , too much emphasis has been placed on a single set of tests and this has been to the detriment of some aspects of the curriculum and some students , " says committee chairman Barry Sheerman .
TESTING FIGURES
Pupils in England on average take 70 national tests while at school 54,000 examiners employed in national tests 25 million test papers each year Source : GTC
School tests around the UK
While supporting the idea of national tests , the report from MPs says that an " over - emphasis " on their results can distort how children are taught and " children 's access to a balanced education is being compromised " .
It also criticises the single - level tests which are being piloted as a possible alternative .
These tests , taken when teachers think pupils are ready to go up a level , are likely to perpetuate the drawbacks of the Sats , such as narrowing the curriculum , suggests the report .
Barry Sheerman says too much emphasis is put on national tests
And it warns that the single - level tests ' " one - way ratchet " system will lead to an " artificial " improvement in results , in which pupils will be " certified to have achieved a level of knowledge and understanding which they do not in truth possess " .
The report calls for a reform of the school performance tables , which for primary schools are based on the national test results .
It suggests that accountability should be based on a wider range of measures , including Ofsted reports .
Schools Minister Jim Knight defended the use of national tests as part of the process of assessing progress for pupils , schools and the education system .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" That 's why they are here to stay .
Parents do n't want to go back to a world where the achievements of schools are hidden from them . "
Mr Knight was asked on the Today programme on BBC Radio Four whether pupils were being put under too much stress at too early an age .
" If you do n't have the tests at 11 and 14 then there 's a danger that children then hit the very high stakes , high stress of GCSEs across the whole curriculum - not just English , maths and science - and the preparation that they get through sitting these Sats at 11 and 14 is in that respect good for them even though it might be a slight level of stress . "
' Disapproval ' But Christine Blower , acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said the report identified the " poisonous effects of testing " .
" The government now stands isolated on the future of national curriculum testing .
It has steadfastly resisted the mounting evidence of the damage caused by the tests to the curriculum and children 's learning , " said Ms Blower .
Chris Keates of the NASUWT teachers ' union said : " It is pleasing to note that some aspects of the report confirm what the NASUWT has been saying for years , that the root of the problem is not the system of national testing but the performance league tables and other aspects of the not - fit - for - purpose accountability regime into which the test results are fed . "
John Dunford , leader of the ASCL head teachers ' union , said that the government should now " finally take seriously this groundswell of disapproval of the current testing regime " .
" The original purpose of examinations , to assess students ' progress , has become confused with school accountability and the performance management of teachers , " said Dr Dunford .
The heads ' union calls for random sampling to monitor standards , rather than targets based on national tests .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia has advised its citizens in Lebanon , especially families living there , to leave immediately due to the security situation , a Lebanese government source said on Saturday .
The source said the Lebanese government had confirmed the news with the Saudi embassy after several Saudi nationals said they received a text message with the advice .
Many countries already advise their nationals against non-essential travel to Lebanon , but it was unclear why Saudi Arabia had upgraded its own travel warning into one urging its citizens to leave immediately .
Saudi diplomats were not available for comment .
Tensions have increased after the United States said on Thursday it had deployed the USS Cole off the Lebanese coast because it was concerned about the political deadlock in Lebanon .
They have also been fuelled by the assassination in Damascus last month of a commander of the Lebanese Hezbollah group .
Hezbollah said Israel was behind the killing of Imad Moughniyah .
Israel has rejected the charge .
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia is a major supporter of the Sunni-led government in Lebanon which has been locked in a 15 - month - old political standoff with an opposition led by Iranian - and - Syrian backed Hezbollah .
The crisis has left Lebanon without a president since November and the deadlock has threatened to disintegrate into sectarian violence and continues to mar inter-Arab relations in the run-up to an Arab league summit in Syria on March 29 - 30 .
“ DIPLOMACY OF WARSHIPS ”
Arab League chief Amr Moussa has been spearheading an Arab initiative to bring about reconciliation among Lebanon ’s rival leaders , but has failed .
Lebanon ’s presidential election was postponed again this week to March 11 from February 26 , the 15th delay , after the rival leaders failed to make a deal .
Syria has accused the United States of prolonging the Lebanese crisis by deploying the USS Cole and said Washington could not impose a solution by “ flexing its muscles ” .
Hezbollah said the United States was endangering regional stability with the deployment and vowed to defy what it called an act of military intimidation .
“ The slogans of democracy and freedom that Washington calls for seem fake and deceitful because they contradict with the diplomacy of warships and cannon muzzles , ” the group said in a statement on Saturday .
Last month Saudi Arabia issued an advisory urging its citizens not to travel to Lebanon because of deteriorating political and security conditions .
Kuwait and Bahrain followed with similar calls .
Several Kuwaiti nationals said they also received messages telling them to leave immediately but both the Kuwaiti embassy and the Lebanese source denied any new warning had been issued .
Lebanon is one of the most popular destinations in the Middle East for Arabs seeking its relaxed atmosphere compared to more conservative Arab countries , and Gulf nationals play a major role in the Lebanese economy .

Oh hi , how 's it going ?
It 's me !
Every girl ever .
I 'm really looking forward to this date .
I 'm not nearly as attractive as you remember me being because when we met the bar was dark and you were drunk .
Come on in .
Let 's start off with the unavoidable tour of my incredibly typical post - college - girl apartment .
You 'll notice that I went ahead and purchased everything that Ikea and Pier 1 have ever produced .
There 's my decorative birdcage over there even though I do n't have a bird , and there 's my gay wicker basket with bamboo poles in it .
I do n't know what the hell that 's thing 's all about , but I bought it .
Hey check it out , I have more candles in here than a Roman Catholic Church .
Does n't it smell like Hazelnut !?
If I were to light all of my candles at once you could see my apartment from space !
I fucking love candles !
Come on into the living room .
Oh , I see you met my cat there .
That 's " Freddy Paws Jr . "
Why do n't you pet him and act like you like cats even though you hate cats ?
There you go .
Oh , he took a little swing at your eye there huh ?
Yeah , he 'll do that .
Hey , let 's check out the kitchen .
Hey look at my refrigerator .
There are pictures all over it !
Look at all these pictures of me and my equally vacuous friends from college !
We were so crazy !
You can tell we 're really good friends because our faces are all pressed up against each other like that .
And check it out , we 're holding up alcoholic beverages to the camera in every single picture .
That 's to prove that we were partying .
College was so fun !
But of course I do n't talk to any of these girls anymore because now they 're all bitches .
Let 's go back into the hallway !
Hey , before we leave I 'm going to go in the bathroom for ten minutes for some mysterious reason .
Why do n't you sit awkwardly in my big , stupid , round papizan chair over there while you wait for me .
It 's like you 're sitting in a hug !
Be right back ... Sorry that took a half an hour , I do n't know what the hell I was doing in there .
Let 's go !
Wow !
Thanks for opening my car door for me !
I 'm totally going to blow that meaningless gesture out of proportion and delude myself into thinking that you 're a really good guy because that 's what I want to believe .
Well , here we are at the restaurant .
No thanks waiter , I do n't need to see a menu , just bring me some expensive things .
Hey I know , while we wait , I 'll tell you all about my unspeakably boring job .
I hate my boss .
He 's a jerk !
I might get another job .
Maybe something in pharmaceutical sales .
Now let 's talk about my family .
I love my family .
I want you to love my family .
I want my family to love you .
I want you to make love to my family !
I want you to go golfing with my semi-retarded brother Travis .
That would be so God damned cute !
Wow !
I can't believe I ordered all this food !
I have no intention of eating any of it .
No thanks waiter , we do n't need a box .
Just throw it out .
Hey , I 've got an idea , let 's go to a bar and have an after dinner drink !
It 'll be great , it will be just like how we 're drinking here , only it will be louder and we 'll have to stand up .
Come on !
See , is n't this better ?
Oh hey , what a coincidence .
Look over there !
It 's a group of my friends that I knew was going to be here .
Let 's go over there so that they can judge you !
Hey , I have to go to the bathroom for a half an hour again for some reason .
You can stay here and talk to my unbelievably hideous friend Christine !
Christine 's so ugly she scares kids !
Talk to her !
She has a job and a family that she wants to talk to you about too .
Be right back .
I 'm back !
Sorry I was gone for three hours , there was a line .
I want to go home now .
Well here we are at my door again .
This was really fun for me and not you .
You should pretend like we 're going to do it again sometime !
Maybe I 'll see you at Target a few months from now and we can avoid eye contact because you never called me .
Here , have this awkward goodnight kiss that 's as empty as my soul .
Good night !
WASHINGTON 
Tax breaks for Gulf Coast residents whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and for struggling manufacturers were overwhelmingly endorsed by the Senate on Friday as lawmakers continued their work on a bill meant to ease the housing crisis .
By 74 to 5 , the Senate approved an amendment to protect residents of Louisiana and Mississippi from having to pay taxes on homebuilding grants received after the catastrophic hurricane of 2005 .
And by 76 to 2 , the senators approved an amendment to let ailing companies use accumulated tax credits to help offset new plant and equipment investments .
Despite the ease with which the amendments were approved , it is by no means certain that they will be enacted into law , since whatever legislation the Senate approves must be reconciled with a housing - relief package being deliberated in the House .
The Katrina - related amendment was offered by Senator Mary Landrieu , Democrat of Louisiana .
The plant and equipment measure was put forth by Senators George Voinovich , Republican of Ohio , and Debbie Stabenow , Democrat of Michigan .
Hemp can be used to make building blocks , plaster or insulation Forget potatoes , wheat or barley ... hemp is the newest crop gracing the fields of the north west .
About a dozen farmers in County Londonderry have started to grow the plant - a variety of cannabis - for its non-intoxicating uses .
The material is primarily used in the building industry , but can be found in everything from pharmaceuticals to food .
Robert Moore grows 300 acres of hemp at his farm at Ballougry outside Derry .
" I 'm licensed from the department of health and from the police , and before anybody starts coming up to pinch some , you could smoke it from now to Christmas and it would n't give you any sort of charge .
" There is no drug value in it all , " he said .
Mr Moore said that hemp as a crop has " huge potential " .
You could smoke it from now to Christmas and it would n't give you any sort of charge
Robert Moore
" You can use the fibre as roof insulation or wall insulation , and it's a very environmentally - friendly product .
" I think there are over 2,000 different uses - I even saw hemp oil when I was at the Balmoral Show last week . "
Marcus McCabe is from Hempire Building Materials in Limavady .
His company has spent the last few years experimenting with ways of processing hemp , including mixing it with lime to create plaster .
" We certainly have enough hemp to plaster 4,000 houses between now and next year .
" When we need is to get architects involved , councils involved , even individuals involved .
Click here for more stories from the BBC 's new Foyle and West service " Anybody who is building , we need them to think about these sustainable materials , " he said .
Derry farmer John Gilliland specialises in sustainable crops .
He said hemp is a great crop for the environment .
" It locks up the carbon dioxide in the hemp itself , so it 's a very useful tool to both provide a fibre and help the environment . "
Robert Moore is convinced the crop has huge potential .
" I would love to see 3,000 acres of it rather than 300 , because it works for us and it has the environmentally - friendly aspect as well , " he said .

Reid hints that Lieberman may be booted from committee chairmanship RAW STORY
Published : Thursday June 5 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Sen. Joe Lieberman 's recent antics on behalf of Republican John McCain 's presidential campaign have n't helped his popularity in the Democratic caucus in recent days .
First Democratic nominee Barack Obama gave the Connecticut Independent a stern talking - to on the Senate floor Wednesday -- after Lieberman slammed Obama 's speech on Israel .
Now Lieberman 's position as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee may be in danger , according to the subscription - only Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reports : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) on Thursday left open the possibility that Sen. Joe Liebermans ( Conn. ) status as an influential chairman in the Democratic Conference may not be solid for the long term , even as he reiterated the Independent Democrats importance on key party priorities .
Reids mixed messages on Lieberman come one day after the Connecticut Senator launched public attacks on the Democrats  newly anointed presidential hopeful , Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill . ) .
Lieberman has long backed the presumptive GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) , but took that support to a different level in attacking Obama this week .
 Ive had a conversation with Joe Lieberman of some length 
Im not going to discuss those conversations here ,  Reid told reporters , but he was quick to add that well let the future decide 
Liebermans long - term role as a key party chairman and member of the Conference .
Reid said he was not going to threaten anyone here . 
The Majority Leaders posture Thursday mirrored the fine line hes walked on the delicate issue of Liebermans role in the party for months .
Reid has been reluctant to criticize Lieberman  a longtime friend  ever since he switched from the Democratic party to become an Independent Democrat nearly two years ago .
Lieberman 's stature among Democrats has fallen precipitously since his 2000 White House campaign as Al Gore 's running mate .
Much of the animosity toward 's Lieberman is based on his vocal support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and his continued defense of President Bush 's war policies ; he also has sided with the Bush administration on issues like warrantless wiretapping and the Patriot Act .
After losing a primary campaign in Connecticut in 2006 , Lieberman left the Democratic party to become an Independent , and the held on to his Senate seat in the general election .
Reid has generally defended Lieberman because he continues to vote with Democrats on some issues .

One of the first things that recipients notice about scam e-mails is their shoddy , bizarre and stilted use of the English language .
To some , the only difference between politicians and these online con artists is their vastly - different skill levels in the use of language and rhetoric .
To make the point , David Alpert , a political organizer whose day job is product manager at Google , recently established a new web site named Gastaxscam.com .
The greeting page reads :
CONFIDENTIAL / URGENT
POLITICAL PROPOSAL
Dear Sir
First we must solicit your confidence in this issue .
This is by virtue as being utterly confidential and " top secret " .
We are SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON , the wife of the former United States head of state , PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON , and also SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN , friend and associate of current head of state PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH .
We got your contact through business inquiries as we were searching for contacts of a citizen who can help save our and our family 's political careers since our country has been frustrating us .
We are top officials of the United States Senate Government who are interested in importation of oil into our country with funds that are presently trapped in the FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION TRUST FUND dedicated to improving transportation .
We wish to send this money to overseas accounts in the MIDDLE EAST but cannot due to restrictions in Congress Transportation Equity
Act requiring that this money must be spent to build roads , bridges and high speed trains .
...
Alpert , of course , supports Democratic presidential front - runner Barack Obama .
The
Illinois senator opposes the idea of giving American drivers a summer " holiday " from paying federal taxes on gas because it does n't address the fundamental problems that are driving high gas prices .
Both New York senator Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain have pushed the idea of giving voters a summer breakfrom paying federal taxes on gas .
Experts have weighed in on the idea , and concluded that it stinks .
Nevertheless , the issue has become a major rhetorical pivot point on the campaign trail as voters headed to the polls in Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday .
MSNBC's Tim Russert reports that Obama 's strategists used the issue to divert the campaign conversation away from Obama 's association with Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
" I started thinking about the idea of a ' scam ' , the way Clinton and
McCain were trying to fool people , " writes Alpert in an e-mail to THREAT LEVEL .
" That led to thinking about various scams , and suddenly I hit on the idea of the Nigerian spams .
Some of them are even about oil , and they 're all about promising money which wo n't actually be delivered .
That 's the same dynamic here .
I found some samples of these spams , and the letter almost wrote itself , down to the fact that many of them purportedly come from relatives of former heads of state and the concept of sending money overseas , which we are doing by consuming so much gas . "
Alpert says that he 'd already been blogging about the issue , but that Clinton 's attacks on Obama sent him over the edge .
" When Hillary Clinton started not only pushing her terrible plan , but attacking Obama with it and calling on Members of Congress to take a position , it motivated me to do something , " he writes .
" I think we as a country need to seriously start investing in infrastructure like high - speed rail or more local commuter trains and buses that enable people to go about their everyday lives without consuming a lot of gas , and Clinton and McCain were moving us in the wrong direction .
Not only is it bad policy , but they were out there persuading that high gas prices could be solved with a quick fix , and that 's very dangerous as well as wrong . "
Clinton has repeatedly defended the plan as having real benefits for the trucking industry and the economy .
She has also called for reducing reliance on foreign oil , as well as for investments into research into alternative sources of energy .
So has McCain .
So far , 1,493 people have signed Gastaxscam 's petition , which made its debut Monday .
It 's likely to get more attention , as this chartfrom Google Hot Trends shows that searches for the subject are spiking .
The site promises : " We wo n't sell or rent your email address to anyone .
We 'll keep you updated about energy and transportation in the Presidential race , and you can unsubscribe at any time . "
No word yet on whether your e-mail may be swapped with other non-profit organizations , which is common in the political world , nor whether the online signatures will really be delivered to the campaigns .

May saw the biggest jump in unemployment in over 20 years
The US economy may have avoided a major decline , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said .
Mr Bernanke said the risk of a substantial downturn had " diminished over the past month or so " .
Playing down recent unemployment rises , he said a series of interest rate reductions combined with tax cuts was helping the US offset its difficulties .
Earlier , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama attacked his rival John McCain 's economic policies .
In his first speech since Hillary Clinton left the presidential race , Mr Obama accused Mr McCain , the Republican party 's candidate , of " a full - throated endorsement " of President George W Bush 's economic policies .
The McCain camp responded by saying that measures Mr Obama was proposing would weaken the US economy .
Inflation fears Mr Bernanke gave his assessment of how the US economy was faring at a bankers ' conference in Chatham , Massachusetts .
He said that " the risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so " .
He added that despite a recent rise in unemployment , which last month saw its biggest jump in 20 years , a series of reductions in interests rates in the last nine months combined with tax cuts had helped to offset the risks threatening the economy .
Mr Bernanke did say , however , that rising energy prices - which saw the cost of oil hit a record high on Friday - risked pushing up inflation .
Mr Bernanke said recent rate reductions and tax cuts had helped " The latest round of increases in energy prices has added to the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations , " he said .
If consumers and businesses believe the record oil prices will continue to rise , they could change their spending habits to make inflation a self - fulfilling prophecy , says the BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington .
That , and a weak dollar , our correspondent added , could force the Fed to raise rates later this year or next , though Mr Bernanke said that the Fed would be robust in dealing with this issue .
" The Federal Open Market Committee will strongly resist an erosion of longer - term inflation expectations , as an unanchoring of those expectations would be destabilising for growth as well as for inflation , " Mr Bernanke said .
Our correspondent says that there has been progress in repairing the credit markets that sparked the US housing slump , the Fed has made swingeing interest rate cuts and the government is spending $ 168bn on top of tax rebates to help stimulate recovery .
But last week 's jump in unemployment rates and record fuel prices rocked already jittery markets , our correspondent says , and for the average American , Mr Bernanke 's soothing words may seem hard to believe .
' Different vision '
Polls indicate that the economy has surpassed the war in Iraq as the biggest concern for American voters .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Obama hopes that focusing on the economy will persuade undecided voters to support him , correspondents say .
Speaking in Raleigh , North Carolina , Mr Obama launched his Change That Works for You tour - a nationwide schedule of speeches focusing on the economy .
" When it comes to the economy , John McCain and I have a fundamentally different vision of where to take the country , because for all of his talk about independence , the centrepiece of John McCain 's economic plan amounts to a full - throated endorsement of George Bush 's policies .
" I have a different vision for the future .
Instead of spending $ 12bn a month rebuilding Iraq , I think it 's time we invested in our roads and schools and bridges . "
Mr Obama pledged " an immediate $ 50 bn " to those hardest hit by the US " downturn " .
He also accused Mr McCain of doing nothing to help 1.5 m people facing foreclosures across America , " even as he [ Mr McCain ] supported spending billions to bail out Wall Street " .
He promised to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of American oil companies .
The McCain camp hit back by portraying Mr Obama as a tax - and - spend liberal .
" While hardworking families are hurting and employers are vulnerable , Barack Obama has promised higher income taxes , social security taxes , capital gains taxes , dividend taxes , and tax hikes on job creating businesses , " campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
On Monday , Mr McCain was holding fundraising events in Virginia and in the capital , Washington .

What are these ?
Here ’s one the mainstream media is n’t going to tell you : County sheriffs in Wyoming are demanding that federal agents actually abide by the Constitution , or face arrest .
Even better , a U.S. District Court agreed according to the Keene Free Press :
The court decision was the result of a suit against both the BATF and the IRS by Mattis and other members of the Wyoming Sheriff ’s Association .
The suit in the Wyoming federal court district sought restoration of the protections enshrined in the United States Constitution and the Wyoming Constitution .
Guess what ?
The District Court ruled in favor of the sheriffs .
In fact , they stated , Wyoming is a sovereign state and the duly elected sheriff of a county is the highest law enforcement official within a county and has law enforcement powers exceeding that of any other state or federal official . ”
Go back and re-read this quote .
The court confirms and asserts that “ the duly elected sheriff of a county is the highest law enforcement official within a county and has law enforcement powers EXCEEDING that of any other state OR federal official . ”
And you thought the 10th Amendment was dead and buried — not in Wyoming , not yet .
Bighorn County Sheriff Dave Mattis comments :
“ If a sheriff does n’t want the Feds in his county he has the constitutional right and power to keep them out , or ask them to leave , or retain them in custody . ”
“ I am reacting in response to the actions of federal employees who have attempted to deprive citizens of my county of their privacy , their liberty , and their property without regard to constitutional safeguards .
I hope that more sheriffs all across America will join us in protecting their citizens from the illegal activities of the IRS , EPA , BATF , FBI , or any other federal agency that is operating outside the confines of constitutional law .
Employees of the IRS and the EPA are no longer welcome in Bighorn County unless they intend to operate in conformance to constitutional law . ”
The implications are huge :
But it gets even better .
Since the judge stated that the sheriff “ has law enforcement powers EXCEEDING that of any other state OR federal official , ” the Wyoming sheriffs are flexing their muscles .
They are demanding access to all BATF files .
Why ?
So as to verify that the agency is not violating provisions of Wyoming law that prohibits the registration of firearms or the keeping of a registry of firearm owners .
This would be wrong .
The sheriffs are also demanding that federal agencies immediately cease the seizure of private property and the impoundment of private bank accounts without regard to due process in Wyoming state courts .
This case is not just some amusing mountain melodrama .
This is a BIG deal .
This case is yet further evidence that the 10th Amendment is not yet totally dead , or in a complete decay in the United States .
It is also significant in that it can , may , and hopefully will be interpreted to mean that “ political subdivisions of a State are included within the meaning of the amendment , or that the powers exercised by a sheriff are an extension of those common law powers which the 10th Amendment explicitly reserves to the People , if they are not granted to the federal government or specifically prohibited to the States . ”
It appears to me that one office where the Libertarian Party should focus it ’s limited resources is County Sheriff .
The change that could be made is nothing to laugh at .
Meanwhile , there are still a bunch of nuts wasting valuable resources supporting those that seek offices that will never be won .
Will anyone in America care ?
Prolly not , but still awesome !

In 2008 He'll Have to Face the Democrats ' Insider - Approved Candidate Before He Can Run Again in Florida Against his Own Crooked Republican Arch - Nemesis , Rep. Tom Feeney
And He 's Taking None of it Lying Down ...
Jim Cirile Byon 4/7/2008 , 9:54 am PT
Special to The BRAD BLOG by Jim Cirile
Clint Curtis does n’t know when to quit .
The Florida computer programmer turned infamous whistleblower was allegedly asked by Jeb Bush crony ( and future FL - 24 - R Congressman ) Tom Feeney to write vote - flipping software for him in 2000 ( here 's the quick summary version of BRAD BLOG 's coverage of the scandal ) .
At the time , Curtis , then a loyal Republican , delivered the vote - rigging prototype to Feeney under the assumption that his software would be used to prevent e-voting manipulation by Democrats .
When Curtis learned that the true purpose was to game the election results in South Florida , he blew the whistle .
A stacked - deck investigation by the Florida Ethics Commission --- where 6 of the 8 members of the panel are either Bush or Feeney appointees , or closely tied to one or both --- dismissed Curtis ’ allegations without allowing him to testify , and without examining email and other evidence in the case , in violation of FL law .
But Curtis would not go quietly .
He became a crusader , speaking at election integrity events around the country and eventually delivering jaw - dropping testimony ( video here ) to a stunned Congressional committee ( who did nothing in response ) .
Curtis even passed a lie detector test administered by the retired chief polygrapher for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement .
Meanwhile , Feeney has been branded among the “ Top 25 Most Corrupt in Congress , ” for three years straight , by CREW , the non-partisan DC ethics watchdog group , most notably for his involvement --- and golf junket to Scotland --- with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
In 2006 , Curtis launched his first congressional bid --- now as a Democrat --- taking on Feeney himself for his FL - 24 seat .
A pre-election Zogby poll showed Curtis in a statistical dead heat with Feeney --- despite Feeney ’s big-money smear campaign against Curtis ( ‘ CrazyClintCurtis.com ’ featured doctored photos of Curtis wearing a tin foil hat ) .
But on election night , Feeney was announced the winner 57%/43 % .
Problem is , those election results did n’t make much sense based on the Zogby poll or Curtis ’ own internal polling .
So Curtis did something remarkable .
He filed a Congressional election challenge .
His team went door to door collecting signed affidavits from FL - 24 voters testifying as to how they voted .
They found the results to be wildly off , by double digits in some places .
Despite this evidence , the Democratically controlled House committee summarily dismissed his election challenge , along with several others , without bothering to even review Curtis ' evidence .
And yet , Curtis is once again going after the FL - 24 Congressional seat .
Only this time , he ’s not just running against Feeney .
First he must defeat an attempt to challenge him by the Democratic party 's hand - picked candidate .
We caught up with Curtis on the campaign trail where he made it clear , in our exclusive interview , that he had no intention of lying down or rolling over for naysayers , Democratic insiders , the woman chosen by the DCCC to challenge him , and certainly not the corrupt Tom Feeney ...
BRAD BLOG : Clint , bring us up to speed on the fund raising deadline the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hit you with .
CLINT CURTIS :
Well , we ’ve been talking to the DCCC .
And they said basically , “ Your problem is you ca n’t raise any money . ”
They do n’t care about policies .
They do n’t care if you ’re doing anything interesting .
All they care about is if you can raise money .
We ’ve talked to them before , and they ’ve always been just about the money .
To them , it ’s like a business deal .
So I said , okay , well , how much will it take to get your support ?
And they said , “ Well , if you could raise $ 250,000 in this next quarter , we would be interested . ”
And of course , we were n’t close .
Our base is grassroots , and grassroots does n’t have money to throw around like that .
They give what they can , but they do n’t have that much to give .
Our average contribution last time [ Curtis ’ ’ 06 congressional bid ] was $ 11 .
BB : So they ’re looking for the big - money corporate donors .
CURTIS :
They select who they ’re going to support based on who has money in the bank .
The problem with people who have money is , sometimes they ’ve kind of sold themselves to get into politics .
BB : Was the DCCC willing to listen at all to how you built the whole grass roots network --- or that you might well have won , were it not for some dubious election results ?
CURTIS : Well , the party in general had never really gotten on board before the election .
They never really helped us with election issues or with the campaign .
The DCCC promised to support us if we won the [ ’06 ] nomination .
Well , we won the nomination , and they never did .
And they ’re still not on board with election reform issues , which is why the challenges [ by him and 4 other candidates in 2006 ] have n’t gotten anywhere in Congress .
They are basically a status quo operation .
They want to raise money .
I do n’t think they really care that much about beating the Republicans , because if they stay equal , it ’s all status quo .
They ’re calling each other names so they can raise money .
It ’s kind of sad , but I think that ’s where they are .
They asked questions like , “ If you get elected , are you going to vote with Speaker [ of the House Nancy ] Pelosi ? ”
Of course my response is , “ No . I represent the people of District 24 .
If she has good plans , good policies , we ’ll listen .
But if my constituents do n’t like it , then that ’s not the way we go . ”
I do n’t think that impressed them much .
They do n’t understand that the only reason Feeney is vulnerable is because we ’ve exposed him as basically being a crook .
He ’s basically selling his vote out .
If they understood that , they would n’t have [ recruited former Florida legislator Suzanne ]
Kosmas , because she has the same issues .
According to The Orlando Sentinel , in 1998 Kosmas was part of a 2 - member board that recommended Volusia County purchase a $ 25,300 sculpture for a library for more than twice the county ’s allocated budget .
The artist was in fact a friend of Kosmas and contributed $ 1,000 to her campaign .
BB : Do you know Suzanne Kosmas ?
Why do you think they picked her ?
CURTIS : She was in the [ Florida ] legislature for eight years , and she has , I think , $ 3 million in the bank , and I think that was as far as it went .
In the legislature , all she really did --- I think she sponsored one bill that got through the entire time she was there , something about kids could n’t ride in the back of a pickup truck .
If you ’ve ever driven in Florida , you know that bill ’s not been too effective .
There may be a law on the books ; I do n’t know if there is or not , and apparently , no one else knows either .
You see kids hanging out of the back of a pickup truck going down the road all the time .
BB : Was there even a courtesy call from the DCCC telling you they ’d recruited Kosmas ?
CURTIS : Nope .
We found out the same way as everybody else .
We actually ran a little poll .
She wo n’t win in Brevard [ County ] .
She wo n’t win in Seminole .
She might be able to pick up something in Orange and Volusia .
The problem is she ca n’t take the high ground .
She ca n’t say [ about Feeney , ] “ I ’m running against this guy , and he ’s corrupt . ”
They ’ve blown their Abramoff card if she actually wins the primary , because you ca n’t come out and say he took vacations and sold his vote when she tried to give away tax dollars to one of her contributors in a contest , where she was one of two people who got to make the decision .
BB : She ’ll likely take the high ground anyway , facts be damned .
Still , it boggles my mind that some people still do n’t get that it does n’t matter how much money you spend if you can't have confidence in how the votes are counted .
CURTIS : I wonder if they ’re not trying to just make the whole thing go away .
I talked to the Supervisor of Elections last night , and I told him after the election , we wanted to do an audit --- basically the audit protocol I ’m trying to [ spread nationwide . ]
I prefer to do a 10 % audit ; this was our chance to show that the audits work , and how long they take --- probably one or two days in each section .
But we have paper ballots in Florida now , so I think it may be harder to cheat if people know we ’re going to check it .
The problem is , most people will never check it .
[ Election fraud perpetrators ] think the elections can be flipped , and they can make the audit go away .
Well , they can try .
BB : Right , case in point : the New Hampshire primary , which defied all the polls which had Obama ahead by a double digit margin , anomalously resulted in a Clinton win .
Yet once again , none of the Democratic candidates ( except Dennis Kucinich ) , nor the corporate media paid attention to all of the evidence of problems found after the election .
There has been some progress on e-voting issues , but practically speaking , do you think it will be any better by election time ?
CURTIS : In Florida , we have paper .
But right now , the audit procedure in Florida is terrible .
The ballots that are now paper are still counted by machines .
So the flip can still occur .
The only difference is now you ca n’t get away with it if someone checks .
And since we ’re running , we ’re going to check .
Even though we do n’t have good audit procedures in Florida , we have the ballot inspection procedure .
Which means , as a candidate , you ’re allowed to see every ballot in your race , minus the couple of handicapped ballot machines , for the people who vote on that .
Last time we did n’t have that .
BB : None of that does any good if you go to Congress with your challenge and all the evidence , and they do n’t even want to listen to you .
CURTIS : At minimum , we had prima facie evidence ... if you have all these affidavits , and you go to court , that ’s prima facie evidence , and you have a case .
At a minimum , Congress could have done a walk just like we did and asked people .
It ’s not like we had to force ( people to cooperate ) .
People were quite willing to tell you how they voted .
It ’s very simple to do ; it could have been done on a volunteer basis and still receive 80 to 90 percent participation .
And they chose to bury it , which is kind of sad .
They said , “ We ’re not going to do anything . ”
In Christine Jennings ’ case [ FL - 13 , where she lost by 369 votes in 2006 , despite 18,000 votes disappearing on touch - screen machines in Sarasota , ] they stretched it out for 16 months , and then finally rejected her challenge in February .
BB : I just cannot understand why the Democrats think this is good policy .
Why constantly bury their heads in the sand ?
It ca n’t be good for them as a party , let alone the nation .
CURTIS : I think they think they can control it .
They do n’t like what we ’re saying , so they ’ll make us go away .
And they ’ll run a millionaire against us --- and they ’ll run the advertising --- and their hook is , people are stupid enough that they ’ll make it go away .
If Kosmas gets elected , she wo n’t do anything about the war .
She wo n’t do anything about voting .
She wo n’t do anything about anything .
She ’ll vote with Pelosi .
BB : Let ’s fast forward .
You ’re going against Kosmas in the primary for the Democratic nomination .
When is the primary ?
CURTIS : The primary is August 7th .
BB : Wow .
So that ’s a long time ‘ til the primary , and not much time to prepare after that .
CURTIS : I ’ve been running for a long time .
That grassroots organization has stayed out there and developed our base .
We ’d like to develop a little bit of money .
We do n’t need millions and millions .
But if we can raise $ 300,000 , we can be very effective .
She ’s got $ 3 million .
She ’s not going to spend all $ 3 million of her own money .
And she does n’t really do fund raisers out and about .
BB : The progressives are pretty much fed up with Pelosi and the Democrats constantly rolling over on the most important issues --- like election fraud and impeachment --- and refusing to even listen to the people .
CURTIS :
They ’re actually passing laws that validate what [ Bush ] did that they should have impeached him for .
BB : So if Kosmas is branded as another do - nothing corporate Dem , and the vast majority of the people are dissatisfied with Congress , it could be easy to knock off Kosmas .
But getting elected is another story .
CURTIS : If they had run someone with a squeaky clean , impeccable record , then we would have had to fight them and then fight Feeney .
But since Kosmas also has corruption issues ...
BB : After you get the nomination , that does n’t leave you with much time to campaign for the general election .
CURTIS : Nope , about 8 weeks .
That ’s why we have to raise money now .
There is no time to raise money after the primary .
Republicans generally raise money early .
Democrats do n’t .
It ’s almost too late before they can ... it ’s harder for them .
BB : Would you debate Kosmas ?
CURTIS : We asked her , and they said they ’d get back to us .
We ’re still waiting to hear .
She has issues , because one of the only resolutions she actually passed in the Florida legislature was a resolution supporting George Bush ’s invasion of Iraq .
So it ’s going to be hard for her to move away from that .
But it would be nice to have more contributions to help get the word out .
BB : How is the fund - raising going ?
CURTIS : We have a very loyal and passionate team and amazing community support on the local level , and exposure on the national level from bloggers and activists .
Without the deep - pocket backers like the corporately backed candidates , we have to appeal to our grassroots and raise what we can .
We have people sending in 2 bucks .
That ’s amazing .

Pokémon
Go has been released in July 2016 and everyone was excited about this game , but it did n’t take long for most of the players to leave it .
The concept of the game was quite easy as you will just need to walk around and search for Pokémon and , of course , catch them .
The game also comes with in - app purchases for additional game items that will help you in your journey .
The game has received some mixed reviews , as some critics were praising the game ’s concept , but there were many technical issues , which also made many players leave the game .
At the end of February 2017 , Niantic has officially announced that the Pokémon Go has surpassed 650 million downloads , but that ’s not that good if most of the users have just uninstalled the game from their devices .
According to John Hanke , the CEO and founder of Niantic , Pokémon
Go currently has 65 million monthly active players , which is quite impressive if this is true .
However , it seems that the developing company is trying to lure some players back to Pokémon Go , as according to the latest reports , the mentioned title will receive a co-op feature .
We ’re not sure yet how this co-op feature will actually function , but it is believed that there will be some sort of “ raid bosses ” where two or more players will be able to join in order to defeat them .
If this turns to be true , we think that there are very high chances that some players will return to the game .
In addition , we think that there will also be new players that will try out this game just because of this new feature , as there are many co-op fans out there .
We think that in the following weeks Niantic will come with some details about this co-op feature that will hit Pokémon Go .
Rheumatoid arthritis can be extremely debilitating A regular tipple cuts the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis by up to half , Swedish research suggests .
The Karolinska Institute assessed 2,750 people in two studies , Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases reports .
The risk was up to 50 % lower for those who drank the equivalent of five glasses of wine a week compared with those who drank the least , they found .
However , arthritis experts warned that drinking too much alcohol increased the risk of a range of health problems .
Rheumatoid arthritis - an auto - immune disease caused by a malfunctioning immune system - is a condition which results in tender , stiff and swollen joints .
It affects 400,000 people in the UK .

The two separate studies assessed environmental and genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis .
Participants were quizzed about their lifestyle , including how much they smoked and drank , while blood samples were taken to check for genetic risk factors .
Smoking highlighted Researcher Dr Henrik Kallberg stressed the most important finding of the study was that smoking was a very significant risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis , reinforcing findings from previous studies .
However , he added : " In addition , it is important to know that moderate alcohol consumption is not deleterious and may in some contexts be beneficial concerning risk for future onset of rheumatoid arthritis . "
There are known to be links between moderate alcohol consumption and a reduced risk of other inflammatory processes , such as cardiovascular disease .
However , the reason for this is still unclear .
Professor Robert Moots , from the Arthritis Research Campaign , said it was possible that drinking alcohol may have a protective effect against rheumatoid arthritis .
But he said the study was not conclusive and any protective effect was not properly understood .
He said : " There is no doubt that drinking too much is very bad for our health in many ways and these risks by far outweigh any potential benefit for reducing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis , which this study points to , without being conclusive .
" We must also remember that drinking alcohol in excess can be especially dangerous in patients taking some anti-rheumatoid drugs that may cause liver damage .
" There are many modifiable lifestyle risk factors for developing rheumatoid arthritis and , as this study also points out , smoking is by far the greatest . "
A spokesman for Arthritis Care said : " It 's too early to say what these findings may mean , so people with rheumatoid arthritis should continue to work in partnership with their health professionals to address their specific health needs . "

What are these ?
A study recently conducted by consumer research group Nielsen found that younger gamers spend most of their time playing the Xbox 360 , and older gamers while away the hours with the PlayStation 3 .
In both age groups , the Wii came in a distant second in total amount of play time received .
Conducted April 2007 to February 2008 , gamers ages 10 to 26 spent almost 63 percent of their gaming time playing the Xbox 360 .
The same age group spent a quarter of their time playing the Wii and only 12 percent playing the PlayStation 3 .
The average number of play sessions per day were about equal for each console : 2.20 for the 360 , 2.12 for the PS3 , and 2.07 for the Wii .
On the 360 and PS3 , each play session lasted about 73 minutes .
The reason for the discrepancy in total play times for these systems is because gamers played their 360 almost 28 days a month while the PS3 was only turned on 21 days a month .
The Wii was played 19.66 days a month and each play session lasted about 53 minutes .
Looking at gamers over 26 years old , the 360 and PS3 switch places and leave the Wii in the middle ground .
The PS3 took up almost 52 percent of gamers ' time ; the Wii 28 percent ; the 360 almost 20 percent .
Older Wii gamers played fewer sessions in a day : 1.80 .
Even though this age range spent much less time playing the 360 than the PS3 , they played more 360 sessions each day -- 2.57 , as compared to 2.20 on the PS3 .
The length of an average play session was shorter for each console in this age group : 55 minutes on PS3 , 52 on 360 , and 47 on Wii .
These gamers also only turned their Wiis on 12 days a month , as compared to almost 22 days for the 360 and 19 for the PS3 .
Kelowna Airport in British Columbia has bad ass security .
They know how to shake you down , and nothing gets past them .
And if you do n't want a hassle and a half at their security checkpoints , one thing is clear : do n't try to bring a gun onto the plane - even if it 's under two inches in length , has no moving parts , and is hanging from a necklace around your neck .
On Monday , Marnina Norys , a Toronto resident and PhD student studying Social Political Thought , was put through the bureaucratic and culture - of - fear rigmarole while trying to board a place in Kelowna - all because she wore a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a gun ( the classic Colt45 , and the actual pendant depicted in the above photo ) .
Hijacking a plane using a tattoo of a gun or the latest issue of Guns & Ammo magazine are just as likely scenarios .
--
First she was told by an agent at security that she could n't wear it , and that the " replica " would have to go in her carry - on bag .
But a second agent who was tasked with searching her carry - on bag found the gun pendant and told her that although harmless ( and against all common sense ) her gun would have to go in her checked baggage .
Racing back to the check - in desk , concerned that she was going to miss her flight , Norys ended up just checking her whole carry - on bag ( since her checked luggage was already long gone ) .
At first she was angered by the experience , and she was concerned that she 'd lose the pendant , but now that a few days have passed she 's able to joke about the incident .
In a telephone interview this afternoon , when asked why she wears a gun pendant , she quickly responded , " I grew up watching Charlie Angels , " before adding that her friend Dana , a Toronto - based jeweler made it , and that it 's a really well - made piece .
So there we have it .
Instead of the folks at Canadian Air Transport Security investing their resources in ensuring passenger safety , they instead end up on the phone today to issue an apology to Norys and cleaning things up after a bit of an embarrassing public relations mess .
Red - tape trumps common sense , and a choice quote from an article appearing in Kelowna 's The Daily Courier back up my claim :
" How do you know it was n't a real gun ? " asked Guy , a security agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority , who also declined to provide his last name .
" Who knows if there is a gun that small that can shoot bullets ?
You do n't know that .
They followed the rules . "
This silliness serves as just one more reminder - we 've lost our ability to embrace logic , and the terrorists have won .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Google is expected to receive unconditional approval from European Union regulators next week for its $ 3.1 billion takeover of ad firm DoubleClick , people familiar with the situation said .
The approval has long been expected because the European Commission decided in January not to object formally to the transaction .
The Commission , the EU ’s top competition watchdog , has never rejected a deal without sending formal objections .
Privacy advocates have objected to the deal , saying it would give the two firms unprecedented access to information about consumers .
The Commission has said privacy considerations are outside the scope of its authority over mergers .
The deal would combine Internet search engine giant Google ’s dominance in pay - per- click Web advertising with DoubleClick ’s market - leading position in flashier display ads .
The planned acquisition won approval from the Federal Trade Commission in December .
For the past six years , the EU has never rejected a merger approved by U.S. authorities .
The merger is part of a consolidation within the Internet advertising industry .
Microsoft Corp bought aQuantive for $ 6 billion , Yahoo Inc acquired BlueLithium for $ 300 million and Time Warner Inc ’s AOL unit bought Tacoda for an undisclosed amount .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Hannah Montana ” star Miley Cyrus took a drubbing on Monday in the media and from some parents of her young fans who were angry over sexually provocative pictures of the 15 - year - old superstar despite her apology one day earlier .
Singer Miley Cyrus poses at the Kids ' Choice Awards in Los Angeles , March 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
The fresh - faced Disney Channel star released a statement on Sunday saying she was “ embarrassed ” by the photos , some of which surfaced on the Internet over the past week and others set to be published in Vanity Fair magazine .
The Internet pictures show Cyrus tugging down her top to show off a bright green bra and draped suggestively across the lap of her then - boyfriend , her midriff bared .
The Vanity Fair photos , taken by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and which hit newsstands on Wednesday , show the church - going teen apparently nude but clutching a satin sheet over her breasts , her hair tousled and a sultry look on her face .
The Vanity Fair cover picture was plastered across the front of the New York Post newspaper on Monday , along with the screaming headline : “ MILEY ’S SHAME . ”
While some posters to Cyrus ’ official MySpace page offered the teen superstar support , others slammed her as having crossed a line with her young fans .
“ Miley I am the mother of an almost seven year old .
I am wondering what choices you will make next , ” a woman named Amy wrote .
“ Up until now I have n’t questioned your integrity .
My daughter absolutely loves you .
“ I do n’t agree with the photos .
Please if you are a Christian then carry yourself in a more modest way . ”
‘ REALLY SLUTTY ’ PICTURES
A 15 - year - old poster , Linzz , wrote on the MySpace page that Cyrus needed to be a better role model for young girls .
“ Those pictures were really slutty , ” Linzz wrote .
“ You ’re losing a lot of fans doing that stuff .
If you keep it up you ’re going to be like Britney Spears . ”
Leibovitz , meanwhile , said that her portrait of Cyrus had been “ misinterpreted ” in the media .
“ Miley and I looked at fashion photographs together and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it , ” Leibovitz said in written statement .
“ The photograph is a simple , classic portrait , shot with very little makeup , and I think it is very beautiful . ”
The Disney Channel has also backed up the rising star , saying “ a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15 - year - old in order to sell magazines . ”
Late last year , some candid photos of Cyrus frolicking with a female friend in underwear during a sleepover raised some eyebrows .
She said at the time that there was “ nothing wrong ” with those photos .
Cyrus rocketed to fame as “ Hannah Montana ” on the Disney Channel ’s TV show of the same name about a girl who leads a double life as a teenager and singing sensation .
“ Hannah Montana ” ranks first among TV series of U.S. cable television for children aged 6 to 14 .
Her concert tour last year , “ Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds ” was a sensation , sparking a movie that topped the box office chart .

Talking to people working to defeat a ballot initiative this fall to amend the California Constitution to ban gay marriage ( now allowed , despite two vetoes by Gov. Schwarzenegger , thanks to a decision by the California Supreme Court ) , the sentiment was that initial polling would likely show some opposition to gay marriage , but that it would be tight enough to overcome throughout the course of the election season .
Given that Californians appear happy to vote " no " on just about every initiative ( my default position as well ) , I felt good about our chances this fall .
Well , things look even better .
Field Poll ( PDF ) .
5/17 - 26 .
Registered voters .
MoE 3.2 %
Do you approve or disapprove of California allowing homosexuals to marry members of their own sex and have regular marriage laws apply to them ?
( Same question asked every survey throughout the years ) Approve Disapprove
5/2008 51 42
2006 44 50
2004 44 50
2003 42 50
1997 38 56
1985 30 62
1977 28 59
That 's what progress looks like .
And the younger the respondent , the more support for marriage equality .
Approve Disapprove 18-29 68 25
30-39 58 34
40 -49 51 42
50 -64 47 46
65 + 36 55
Opponents of marriage equality are desperate because they are indeed running out of time .
The younger generations are more tolerant , and the older ones are fading away .
That means that every year , support for tolerance and equality grows , and this is obviously anathema to conservatives .
( And it is conservatives -- Democrats support gay marriage 65 - 29 , Republicans oppose it 25 - 69 .
Independents are a tolerant bunch as well , supporting gay marriage 61 - 27 . )
And to think that in 2003 , civil unions was considered radical !
Marry Civil Unions No recognition May 2008 45 32 19
Feb 2006 36 33 27
But what about the constitutional amendment in this fall 's ballot ?
Here 's the best news in this poll :
" Do you favor or oppose changing the California State Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman , thus barring marriage between gay and lesbian couples ? "
Favor 40
Oppose 54 " There may be a vote on this issue in the November election .
Would you favor or oppose having the state constitution prohibit same - sex marriage , by defining marriage as only between a man and a woman ?
Favor 43
Oppose 51
Those are numbers we can work with , and much better than what we could 've hoped for in the early going .
Meanwhile , Gov. Schwarzenegger 's ratings are at a two - year low -- 37 approve , 60 disapprove .
Just another reminder that despite what the national media tells you , Californians do n't love their idiot governor .
At least he outpaces Bush .
Barely .
For the first time in decades , and probably ever , workers retiring from the US labor force will be better - educated on average ( according to one measure anyway ) than their much younger counterparts .
Some 12 per cent of 60 - 64 year olds have a master 's degree or better ; less than 10 per cent of 30 - 34 year olds do .
More generally , the decades - long rise in the educational quality of the labor force is coming to an end .
This is important , because that rise has been one of the principal forces driving American economic growth .
These findings are from a new study by Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics : " The Accelerating Decline in America 's High - Skilled Workforce : Implications for Immigration Policy " .
If you are interested in the prospects for American competitiveness and continued economic leadership , Jacob 's study is mandatory reading .
Consider this particularly striking chart ( from chapter 1 of the study [ pdf ] , page 12 ) , which shows the proportion of the labor force with at least a college degree , by age group , for OECD countries .
Look first at the squares in the diagram , which represent 55 - 64 year olds .
For this age group , the US lags only Russia ( whose competitiveness , Jacob points out , was not a problem thanks to communism ) .
But the US is exceptional in the diagram ( Germany is the only other instance ) in that its younger cohorts , on this measure , are no better educated .
In most other countries , the proportion of 25 - 34 year olds with at least a college degree has soared .
( More than half of South Koreans , Japanese and Canadians in this age group have a college degree or better . )
As a result , in that cohort , the US is not 2nd , but 11th .
At first sight , anyway , it is hard to see how US leadership in per capita incomes can be sustained in the face of this trend .
Jacob cites this and other data as urgent grounds for liberalizing immigration of highly educated workers ( a cause to which I would be very sympathetic , I admit , even if it were not for the good of the country , since I am one such immigrant ) .
The point is , the US devotes a lot of effort to keeping such workers out , while other countries try just as hard to attract them .
I 'll come back shortly in another post to what I think of Jacob 's specific recommendations , but for the moment I just wanted to draw your attention to the study -- and to that disconcerting chart .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Apple Inc. saw its share of the Windows browser market triple immediately after it began encouraging users of the Microsoft operating system to download and install its Safari web browser through the widely deployed Apple Software Update mechanism , according to a new report .
Net Applications , a firm which tracks browser share and operating system usage , noted in a release Thursday that Safari 3.0 on Windows never gained much traction , with its share peaking at just 0.07 percent .
However , Safari 3.1 on Windows has rapidly muscled gains over the past six weeks , already tripling Safari 3.0 's peak at 0.21 percent .
The surge follows a move by the Cupertino - based company back on March 18th in which it began pre-selecting Safari 3.1 installs as part of its Software Update service installed on millions of PCs that run the company 's iTunes software .
" Normally , Apple 's Software Update service is not used for delivery of new products .
Â
Clearly , this is a calculated risk by Apple that has annoyed and / or alienated some users , " Net Applications said .
" However , the question is , did it work ?
Â Did Apple gain browser market share on Windows based on this move ? Â
The answer is yes . "
Indeed , Apple became the subject of much criticism following the move , as industry watchers and rival browser developers charged the company with using its Software Update mechanism as as a trojan horse to gain an unfair advantage in the battle for share of the web browser market .
Fledgling physicist Ching - Yu Kuang has discovered a Rosetta Stone for all of physics , a treasure trove of advanced scientific breakthroughs beyond all imagination .
Exotic energy , teleportation , FTL , parallel universes and near - infinitely more wonders are just within reach ; a promise of paradise .
But every attempt to exploit this new science results in sabotage , chaos and destruction .
And the laws of science themselves are changing with each experiment , locking out the new discoveries , directly altering the universe to make what should be possible impossible .
While Ching watches , humanity 's future is being stolen .
Because there 's something wrong with his world .
There 's a fundamental flaw , a defect in its structure ...
Help at last for suicidal young men ,
That message came across loud and clear in an article by Anthony Browne that got published in The Observer , Sunday , March 4 , 2001 .
More males in their twenties die by their own hand than in car crashes .
MPs are demanding action to stem the tide Somebody wrote to me and suggested that one of the sentences in the article would make for a good quote that should be used frequently :
The suicide rate for young men has doubled since the early Eighties , while for women it has almost halved .
No doubt , it is a good quote but it does n't tell the whole story .
A picture is worth a thousand words and tells the story even better .
The quote will make people remember what the circumstances are that prompted Anthony Browne to write his article .
The table from which the preceding graphs were constructed is located at the end of my comments I do n't want to run down the article too much , because it is good , but neither the good quote nor the article that contains it will do much to bring the picture out into the open .
Still , the article is a very good start .
Let 's hope that the most serious and most deadly problem symptom of all that affect men , and thereby all of society , will receive enough concern to make the article the first one in a long series .
However , even that is not enough to make a dent in the fundamental issue ; showing trend lines for suicide rates will .
If anyone wants to do anything about it , keep those trend lines in view at all times .
Bring them up in TV programs , in every article that is being written , on the Internet , on every single men's web site , put them on bill boards , on posters , on T - shirts , on cigarette packages , and in newspaper - and magazine articles .
Who the heck cares how many people smoke themselves to death .
Add an extra line to the warning messages about smoking and show that , although smoking kills people , it does n't by far kill as many as suicide does .
Suicide kills hundreds of times more men than the number of people who get killed from smoking .
( Now , that is a damned good slogan . )
All we need to do is determine the exact figures for each country .
That is not hard to do .
The only thing is that it is a lot more work than one man can do by himself .
However , to drive the message home into the minds of the journalists who should be writing about it and do n't , make sure that the trend lines unmistakably show what the trends are for women and for men .
Without that the whole effort would be in vain .
... The All Party Group on Men's Health is so alarmed that in its inaugural meeting it will press for measures to ensure that suicidal young men can find help .
The launch is being supported by Public Health Minister Yvette Cooper ....
Where were all of these people during the last fifty years ?
On the Moon ?
The suicide rates for men have been increasing steadily since the mid-fifties .
It took these people fifty years to become concerned .
If they do n't change the way in which they are going about " helping men , " it will be at least another fifty years before the suicide rates for men will begin to fall once more  and perhaps another 150 years before they are back to where they were fifty years ago .
Sure , suicidal men need help , but that is only addressing problem symptoms , not the roots of the problem .
The case of Mike Whitaker , which Anthony Browne wrote about , illustrates beautifully what I mean .
If he had not left a suicide note , and if he had crashed his car , his death would have been written off as another traffic death .
How many traffic deaths are suicides ?
How many job accidents are suicides ?
How many accidental deaths of men are not accidental at all ?
Do any of the people who propose that suicidal men need help and counseling also propose how such men will be detected ?
No .
They do n't , they wo n't and they can't .
They can't because that is not possible .
What needs to be done is something that will make men proud of themselves once more , to give them a purpose in life , so that they will never even dream of committing suicide .
Start by removing the funding that presently , at the rate of hundreds of billions of dollars per year , goes into manufacturing and promoting the most massive hate - propaganda campaign against a visible minority in the history of mankind .
Without any doubt , men have become second - class citizens to the same extent that the Jews were in Nazi -Germany .
Identical tactics but far more efficient ones are being used now to bring that about for men .
Let 's talk about the fact that the life expectancy of the world 's men is on average five years less than that of women , that the gap between the life expectancies of the sexes in the developed nations has widened from one year in 1920 to six years now .
Does anyone in his right mind believe that is due to the biological inferiority of men ?
How do they explain that men's biology changed that much in merely 80 years ?
Let 's talk about the fact that in the whole world there are now 280 million men and boys that are not amongst the living but should be if men were to experience the same risks to their lives that women experience .
What about a little gender equality in that area ? ... Howard Stoate , chairman of the men's health group , said : ' It 's the commonest cause of death among young men .
It 's an important issue and is under - recognised - most people have no idea it is so high - but the statistics are shocking .'...
Of course they are shocking .
We can only be shocked by something that surprises us .
Why did all of these people learn about the issue only now ?
That they did n't care before this , and that they still have n't got a clue what to do about it , is not shocking at all .
It is a travesty .
It is a travesty because they and many others like them vilified and demonized men for so long now and are then surprised at the consequences .
Can people become more bigoted than that ?
For fifty years they have done their best to increasingly drive men to the brink of suicide , have left them with nothing to like about life and the society that men live in and then are shocked that more and more men kill themselves .
Dr Ian Banks , chairman of the Men's Health Forum ... : ' If this rate of death among young men was an infection , there would have been a lot more attention paid to it . '
Dr. Ian Banks is blind to the fact that if women 's suicide rate instead had climbed as fast in the 1950's as men's began to climb , it would never have been permitted to reach even a fraction of the magnitude men's suicide rate reached .
Simon Armson , chief executive of the Samaritans , said that this refusal to talk about problems is a key reason why men are more likely to kill themselves than women .
' They are more likely to internalise feelings until it gets too big a burden to bear , and then it leads to self - destruction .
The British culture of stiff upper lip still reigns supreme , ' he said .
The Samaritans ha[d ] tried to target men by advertisements on beer mats and in changing rooms .
Sure , that 's going to do a lot of good .
How much did it bring the suicide rate down ?
Ha !
First of all , it will get the attention only of those men who see the beer mats .
That would be primarily men who drink beer .
Is it only beer drinkers who commit suicide ?
However , Simon Armson is quite mistaken if he thinks that it is the British culture of " the stiff upper lip " that 's behind it all .
He should take a look at suicide rates in other countries and learn that the British culture is by far not the worst with respect to men 's suicide rates .
The UK ranks 55th out of 97 countries the World Health Organization reported on .
The suicides rates for men in the top - ranking three countries are six to seven times higher than those in the UK .
( See International Suicide Rates )
He should also take a look at those cultures in which the suicide rates of men are the lowest .
Furthermore , he should look at those cultures in which they are even lower than those of women .
Maybe he can learn something from those cultures , namely that the Brits are not the only ones with a culture of " the stiff upper lip " and that a far more important factor contributing to men's suicides is the extent to which a given culture respects and appreciates its men instead of considering them heartless and unfeeling rapists , brutes and batterers , which virtually no men in any society are .
... There is a huge range in suicide rates among different groups of men .
It is far higher - and rising - among unskilled men than among professional men .
No guesses at all why that is ?
Could it be possible that these unskilled men who killed themselves where destitute because they could n't earn enough money for themselves and their families on account of the job market being flooded with women who like to have a career ?
Men these days are the last to be hired and the first to be fired .
It does n't matter to anyone whether they have to provide for a family or not .
If they are paying child support , it 'll be quite a while - if at all - before their being laid off will be taken into account and their payments adjusted accordingly .
What about the huge differences in suicide rates between groups of men who are happily married and those who are not , those who have work and those who have not , those who are being driven into bankruptcy and those who are not , those whose children are being taken from them , those who lost their jobs because of various reasons connected with their divorces and their persecution by the legal system , and those who are being jailed for being in abject poverty and can't possibly meet the demands for outrageous child support amounts ?
Would it not have been a good idea to look at a random sample of suicide cases of " unskilled " men to find out what attributes all of their cases had in common ?
Men are more likely to kill themselves if they are from ethnic minorities , unmarried or gay .
Right there the theory of the " British stiff upper lip " gets blown out of the water .
However , right there is another avenue of exploration .
How about checking to what extent those suicide rates compare to those of the men in the countries those men came from .
If they are not identical and if all or most of them are higher in the UK than they are in those men's home countries , then that would be direct proof that the problem is not with the men who kill themselves but with the society that forces them to commit suicide .
What are the plans of the Men's Health Group in that regard , or have they not progressed yet past the voicing of good but mistaken intentions ?
Psychol [ o ] gists say that the rise in suicide among men is a result of their loss of a role in society .
It takes neither a rocket scientist nor a psychologist to figure that one out , but it still only discusses a problem symptom .
What is the cause of men's loss of their role ?
Determine what that is , address it , fix it , and there 'll be virtually no more suicides .
... his father , John Peters , who teaches psychology and works for the self - help group Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide .
' Many men have expectations they should be providers , and for a small percentage they do n't live up to it . '
See what I mean ?
Even the father of a suicide victim , a psychologist specializing in counseling the surviving friends and relatives of suicide victims , can't figure it out , although he 'll no doubt be able to make the survivors feel good about themselves .
He is incapable of seeing the forest for the trees .
He can't see the contradiction between what he's is saying and the circumstances of his son's death .
His son should have been happy not to have to support his excessively demanding ex any longer .
Does n't anyone wonder why the man became so disturbed about the loss of a role ( which his wife thought he was lousy at ) that he up and killed himself ?
I 'm afraid that is one psychologist who has n't got any answers .
He is far more likely to be part of the problem .

' There are many practical things we can do .
Changing men's attitudes to themselves is a long - term job , but it 's not impossible . '
Boy oh boy , what an attitude !
That 's insane and ludicrous .
Here is a dose of reality :
The attempts to change men resulted in them losing their role .
We still expect men to make further changes to themselves , to have them adapt , now that we have taken men's role away from them , and to have men accept the hard reality of being useless .
Let me ask Dr. Banks and anyone else who thinks that men need to change more than they already have what they do when they feel cold in their homes .
Do they lower their body temperature to change their bodies ' attitudes with respect to the uncomfortable room temperature so that they may feel relatively comfortable ?
Of course not , they put another log on the fire , crank up the thermostat , put on another sweater or jacket ...
If we can accept the absolute reality of our bodies ' biochemistry and the standard body temperature that comes along with it , and if we adjust the environment in which the body exists , so that the body is comfortable , why can't we do the same for men ?
Ca n't we accept that men are men and adjust the social environment for men to become at least as comfortable as it is for women ?
Can we not go one extra step and have men and women agree that they are both entitled to the same level of social comfort ?
Can we then go one more step and have men and women agree that if they live in harmony that that will make it much easier for them to work something out which will permit both men and women to live equally in comfort in the same society ?
However , that requires mutual respect  and perhaps then a little love can grow as well .
Unfortunately , there is no respect anymore for men , not by society , not by many women , not by most feminists , and not even by many men themselves .
Most of all , it requires that all of society admits that it severely and lethally discriminates against men .
Still , without having any respect for men , very few people can even see that much .
Therefore the suicide rates for men will keep rising inexorably , despite any and all well - intentioned programs to make better men out of men or even to create nebbish men who wo n't , it is hoped , kill themselves any longer .
Men are men , and no extent of re-engineering human nature will change that .
Fool around with nature and you 'll be courting disaster .
Fool around with human nature , and one of the many disasters you 'll get will be a rising epidemic of suicides .

Men behaving sadly 
Information about and advice on depression , by the Royal College of Psychiatrist ( U.K. ) Men [ in the U.K. ] are around three times more likely than women are to kill themselves .
Suicide is commonest amongst men who are separated , widowed or divorced and is more likely if someone is a heavy drinker .
Mind you , the article advises that anyone should not get upset if he ca n’t sleep - " Do something restful that you enjoy , like listening to the radio or watching television . "
Especially for men , that does not seem to be the best cure for depression .
Television and its never - ceasing male - bashing programs and commercials are more likely to bring depression on or to aggravate it than to cure it .
However , here , for the first time in many years , in almost a decade in fact , is an article that identifies male suicide in the U.K. as a problem that is being ignored and needs to be solved :
The silent epidemic of male suicide , By Dan Bell , Feb. 4 , 2008 , BBC News .
Incongruously , the article was published at the BBC website , while the BBC is one of the major promoters of " news " and other male - bashing items that contributed over the years to the escalating epidemic of male suicides .
Suicide rates 1 : by gender and sex ( sic  I guess they meant ' by age and sex ' ) United Kingdom Rate per 100,000 population 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1997 Males 15 - 24 6.9 9.6 10.6 12.7 15.9 16.4 25-44 13.5 15.0 19.5 20.1 24.3 21.8 45-64 19.8 21.0 23.1 22.6 20.4 17.5 65 and over 25.4 23.8 23.7 26.4 18.4 15.4 Females 15 -24 3.3 4.6 3.4 3.4 4.0 4.0 25-44 7.7 8.9 7.7 6.6 5.9 6.2 46-64 15.9 14.3 15.0 12.0 8.2 6.9 65 and over 16.5 15.0 15.5 13.6 8.6 6.3 1
Includes deaths undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted .
Age - standardised to the European population .
Source : Office for National Statistics ; General Register Office for Scotland ; Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency The UK Office for National Statistics continues : Deaths from suicide have fluctuated widely over time .
The highest rates occurred around 1931 when rates for the older age groups were considerably higher than those of the youngest .
There has been a marked increase in suicide death rates in people aged 15 to 24 since the end of the 1950s .
Between 1971 and 1997 the suicide death rate for men aged 15 to 24 rose from 6.9 per 100,000 population to 16.4 per 100,000 population .
For women in this age group there was a fall from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s , and the rate was 4.0 per 100,000 population in 1997 .
Suicide among men aged 25 to 44 has risen since the 1950s to a level higher than among any other group .
Rates among those over the age of 44 have declined .
Suicide rates are associated with mental health problems , such as depression .
The preceding text is all of the information that the Office for National Statistics provides with the table .
The table served to construct the graphs that are shown at the beginning of this page .
What is remarkable is what is not said in the text and what could have been shown in the table , or , better yet , what could all have been shown in a graph that could have contained all of the data that they had on hand to produce the table and the comment following it .
They would even have saved some space , and people would not have to play any guessing games as to what it is that the government of the United Kingdom did n't want them to know .
Why not just show people all of the data for the last century ?
It could have been done .
I 'm sure that the people would have loved to see those trends .
I 'm also sure that they would have been perfectly capable of drawing their own conclusions without the Office for National Statistics telling them in writing in the notes following the table what it is that the table contains and what they wish people to read into the data .
Surely , anyone who can read well enough to comprehend those inane comments is smart enough to read a few numbers in the table and to comprehend them as well .
Maybe the staff of the Office of Statistics are n't smart enough to understand that .
People interested in the suicide statistics would love to see all of them , to understand to what extent their lives improved during the past century .
Most importantly , they must love to see to what extent life in the UK improved during the latter part of the century , when feminism came into power and gradually made all of the promises contained in the Communist Manifesto a reality .
They must surely want to see whether the wide disparity between the suicide rates of the sexes held true during all of the past century , even during the time when women where so terribly oppressed .
Maybe there is something about those numbers that the government of the United Kingdom does n't want its citizens to know .
That could n't possibly be true in the land that gave democracy to the world , or could it ?
What in the world is it that makes life in the United Kingdom so depressing that people prefer to kill themselves in record numbers and at unprecedented rates , rather than to enjoy all of the blessings that half a century of ever more powerful Marxist feminist rule brought about ?
What were things like during the first seventy years of the last century ?
Why are the citizens of the UK not permitted to see that ?
Would it bother them if they did ?
Could it be that they would begin to understand that feminism is deadly ?

More males in their twenties die by their own hand than in car crashes .
MPs are demanding action to stem the tide Anthony Browne Sunday March 4 , 2001 The Observer
The soaring suicide rate among young men , which means they are now more likely to die by their own hand than be killed in a car crash , will this week be confronted by a new parliamentary committee set up to investigate the scale of the tragedy .
The suicide rate for young men has doubled since the early Eighties , while for women it has almost halved .
Suicide is now the biggest single cause of death of men aged 25 to 34 , who are more than five times likely to take their lives as women of the same age , according to figures from the Office for National Statistics .
The All Party Group on Men's Health is so alarmed that in its inaugural meeting it will press for measures to ensure that suicidal young men can find help .
The launch is being supported by Public Health Minister Yvette Cooper .
Howard Stoate , chairman of the men's health group , said : ' It 's the commonest cause of death among young men .
It 's an important issue and is under - recognised - most people have no idea it is so high - but the statistics are shocking . '
Overall , suicide has overtaken car accidents as a cause of death among men .
Each year about 3,600 men take their lives , compared to 1,200 women .
Dr Ian Banks , chairman of the Men's Health Forum , which advises the Government , said : ' If this rate of death among young men was an infection , there would have been a lot more attention paid to it . '
The new measures will come too late to help Mike Whitaker , who seemed to have everything to live for .
He was in his last year of a chemistry degree at Bath University and was expected to get a first .
He had a job lined up , a girlfriend and was captain of the clay pigeon shooting team .
' He was very successful at whatever he did . ' said his mother , Jenny Whitaker .
But one morning at the end of the Christmas break , Jenny awoke to find the car gone , while her husband found the back door open .
Then they saw a one - line handwritten note against the bedroom door of Mark 's younger brother : ' Sorry bro - look after Mum and Dad . '
Half an hour later the police found him in the car with a pipe from the exhaust to the window .
' We were astounded .
We knew he was upset about a university project , but we had no idea he was that ill . ' said his mother .
' He was a perfectionist and did keep things to himself .
He had n't spoken to anyone about being desperately distressed . '
Simon Armson , chief executive of the Samaritans , said that this refusal to talk about problems is a key reason why men are more likely to kill themselves than women .
' They are more likely to internalise feelings until it gets too big a burden to bear , and then it leads to self - destruction .
The British culture of stiff upper lip still reigns supreme , ' he said .
The Samaritans has tried to target men by advertisements on beer mats and in changing rooms .
Declan Curran , 13 , hanged himself from a door with a guitar strap .
He had been sexually abused and had no one he could talk to .
' As a lad you have to be tough , and if you 're not you 're a bit of an outcast , ' said his brother Liam .
There is a huge range in suicide rates among different groups of men .
It is far higher - and rising - among unskilled men than among professional men .
Men are more likely to kill themselves if they are from ethnic minorities , unmarried or gay .
Psycholgists say that the rise in suicide among men is a result of their loss of a role in society .
Dale Peters , a market trader selling plants and flowers , hanged himself at 25 after splitting up with his girlfriend .
' He found it difficult to see where he was going .
He was ticking over with a small business , but he was n't doing particularly well - he did n't see a future for himself , ' said his father , John Peters , who teaches psychology and works for the self - help group Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide .
' Many men have expectations they should be providers , and for a small percentage they do n't live up to it . '
Males are falling behind females at school and university .
The loss of unskilled jobs has hit men with few educational qualifications particularly hard .
' Young men can not see what their role is , and often their parents cannot see what their role is , ' said Peters .
' The men can be perfectly sane in coming to that decision .
For so many it is a very determined act . '
More women than men attempt suicide each year , but are less likely to succeed .
They usually choose methods such as an overdose of pills which can often be tackled in casualty wards , and are often seen as pleas for help .
Men tend to choose violent , decisive methods , such as hanging , jumping off buildings , crashing a car or shooting themselves .
' There 's fatalism about the whole thing .
People say they 're going to do it anyway , but that 's just not true , ' said Banks .
' There are many practical things we can do .
Changing men's attitudes to themselves is a long - term job , but it 's not impossible . '
anthony.browne@observer.co.uk
Right , it appears that we must re-educate men to accept second - class - citizen status and that women rank higher than they do .
It seems that the powers feel that once we get men to accept the inevitable , they will then stop killing themselves and blissfully engage in their duty to become indentured servants to the superior class of citizens , without even receiving the slightest bit of the honour and veneration they once - upon - a- time received for doing the dirty , dangerous , unhealthy and sweaty jobs as providers and protectors of the families from which they are being now increasingly often expunged .

Fewer passengers are expected to fly this summer , traditionally the peak season for air travel  partly because of the soft economy , of course , but the difficulty of traveling may also be a factor .
The Air Transport Association , an industry trade group , predicts 211.5 million people will fly between June 1 and Aug. 31 , down more than 2 million passengers from last year ’s record of 213.5 million .
Flights seem to be disappearing by the day .
Last week , Mesa Air Lines , a regional carrier based in Phoenix , said it would shut down Air Midwest , a regional subsidiary , on June 30 .
The move will eliminate service to 16 small cities in the 10 remaining states where Air Midwest , which had already cut flights , still operated .
Eliminating flights is the latest move by the airlines in a cost - cutting drive that also has led to ticket prices climbing 10 times this year and new fees , from charges for checking extra bags to changing itineraries .
Almost every major carrier , from American Airlines to Delta Air Lines and US Airways , is crossing cities off its list , leaving passengers with fewer choices than a year ago .
Some travelers have no choices , but it is not for lack of trying by city and state officials .
After Hagerstown briefly lost its eligibility for a government program called the Essential Air Service last year , Maryland ’s Congressional delegation helped win an extension that allowed Hagerstown , as well as Lancaster , Pa. , and Brookings , S.D. , to remain in the program until Sept. 30 .
The Essential Air Service program was created in 1978 , when the airline industry was deregulated , to ensure that communities in rural and remote areas would be linked to the nation ’s air system .

ALMOST without exception , scientists and policy makers agree that hybrid vehicles are good for the planet .
To a small but insistent group of skeptics , however , there is another , more immediate question :
Are hybrids healthy for drivers ?
There is a legitimate scientific reason for raising the issue .
The flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle at low speeds ( and assists the gasoline engine on the highway ) produces magnetic fields , which some studies have associated with serious health matters , including a possible risk of leukemia among children .
With the batteries and power cables in hybrids often placed close to the driver and passengers , some exposure to electromagnetic fields is unavoidable .
Moreover , the exposure will be prolonged  unlike , say , using a hair dryer or electric shaver  for drivers who spend hours each day at the wheel .
Some hybrid owners have actually tested their cars for electromagnetic fields using hand - held meters , and a few say they are alarmed by the results .
The growing number of Alzheimer ’s sufferers , which is expected to more than triple from the current four million by 2050 , may also spur wider adoption of technologies like motion sensors to alert others to deviations in routine , trackers to assure medications are taken and emergency response buttons .
Technology systems to underpin living independently , or what some call “ aging in place , ” are still years from being rolled out in a big way , awaiting adequate financing for research and other incentives , like coverage by insurance companies , according to Mr. Nobel ’s study , which was released in March by the Center for Aging Services Technologies , a program of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging .
But projects are under way around the country to test high - tech gadgets for home use , including wireless sensors and devices to regulate temperature , lights and appliances , and sophisticated medical monitors .
And some care providers have begun to equip clients with devices that fit their needs .
NewCourtland Elder Services , a care provider for some 2,000 people in Philadelphia , started a yearlong pilot in 2006 that equipped 33 patients living on their own with remote sensors that tracked changes in their health or living patterns that required early medical intervention , said Kim Brooks , the vice president for housing and services at NewCourtland .
One of the patients is Cleora Coley , 77 , a retired pharmacy technician , who is in a wheelchair after losing a leg to diabetes .
Two years ago , Ms. Coley moved to a living complex for the elderly because she could not maneuver the stairs in her family home .
In her apartment , she checks her blood pressure with a cuff that automatically sends the reading to a monitoring center , which notifies her and her doctor of any change .
Sensors placed in each room keep track of her movements , and she has a button to summon assistance , which she used in April when she fell .
“ I ’m alone but I know I ’m not all by myself , ” Mrs. Coley said , adding , “ And I really like my independence . ”
M. Night Shyamalan has finished his script for The Last Airbender , the live action movie based on Nickelodeon 's epic cartoon , Avatar — and he 's told Paramount and Nickelodeon that he thought they had a new Star Wars on their hands .
Shyamalan screened a rough teaser trailer at the New York Licensing Expo Night , and we were there .
Details after the jump .
Advertisement
Night claims Airbender and Star Wars will be similar based on the religion they create .
I could see why he would want that to be true , but just because you make three of something that has an ancient code and a deep fictional history , that does n't automatically make it the next Star Wars .
Still Night shared a production update with an excited room and briefly talked about casting , filming plans and why he wanted to make this movie .
The Last Airbender will tell the first book of the three - part Avatar series .
It will follow Aang the reluctant hero , who is an Avatar and a protector of the world .
He 's the people 's only hope to restore balance between it 's four nations of Earth , Wind , Fire and Water .
It all started when the Fire nation attacked , and Aang has to use his martial arts , and his abilities to bend nature 's elements , to fight .
Advertisement
The very rough Airbender teaser trailer took old movie footage of martial arts fighting and then spelled out , " The nations lived together in peace until Fire Nation Attacked . "
Pan out to a shot of the Avatar planet with a blue arrow imposed over the top , referencing Aang , the savior of a world .
The teaser also showed lovely sweeping landscape illustrations of each nation on the planet that looked pretty similar to the cartoon 's representation — but alas , no illustrations of Aang , Azula or Katara .
All of the concept art for the movie is done , and every single frame has already been story - boarded .
Like the cartoon , there will be multiple martial - arts fighting scenes , almost 20 of them , but they will be done his way .
That means the fighting will extend the story and enhance the character , and Shyamalan has applied the same rule to his CGI use .
The elements react to some of the characters emotions , so that among the mountain homes and alien characters will all have to be CGI .
Sets are going to be built in August this year and some of the exotic locations picked for filming are Greenland and Vietnam .
Casting has started and Shyamalan hints that he thinks he 's found the next big star .
So perhaps Aang will be played by a fresh face .

Shyamalan wants to create , as he called it , religion around this movie similar to the religion that inspired him from other films .
" Star Wars had religion and I mean that , " explained Night .
" Something that connects us with these stories which is what they had in the Star Wars and the first Matrix .
Those movies caused religions to happen . "
Methinks he 's confusing religion with just heavily layered story - telling , yet in his defense there are many Jedi orders throughout the country .
Do you think he wants more costumey fans running around Tai Chi bending the elements ?
It would be good marketing , I guess .
Shyamalan admits that Star Wars was a movie that made him want to make movies and he had been searching for a story like this .
So it 's cute that it was his youngest daughter that introduced him to the cartoon series .
Shyamalan hopes that after watching this movie , " Every kid at every breakfast table should be trying to bend the milk out of their cup . "
Airbender is set to release over the 4th of July weekend in 2010 .
The popular Internet television network Revision3 suffered from a severe DDoS attack , launched by the infamous anti-piracy organization MediaDefender .
After targeting The Pirate Bay 's trackers , MediaDefender apparently thought it was a good idea to spread their fake torrents through Revision3 .
The CEO of Revision3 – Jim Louderback – was quite surprised when he found out that MediaDefender was the source of the attack that took down their entire network this weekend .
He found out that MediaDefender used the Revision3 BitTorrent tracker for the fake torrents they upload to various BitTorrent sites .
In a lengthy blog post Louderback explains what happened , as he writes : “ Media Defender was abusing one of Revision3 ’s servers for their own purposes , quite without our approval .
When we closed off their backdoor access , MediaDefender ’s servers freaked out , and went into attack mode , much like how a petulant toddler will throw an epic tantrum if you take away an ill - gotten Oreo . ”
MediaDefender ’s attack effectively took down the Revision3 BitTorrent tracker this weekend , and people were unable to grab the latest episodes .
That was not all , the flood of SYN packets also took out their webserver and their email .
These kind of attacks are illegal according to US law , and if Revision3 decides to pursue this case in court , it would not be the first time MediaDefender gets caught .
Only a few months ago , The Pirate Bay sued several media companies that hired MediaDefender , for exactly the same behavior .
Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde said at the time : “ They are going around accusing the pirate community for doing immoral stuff , when they do illegal stuff .
We need to make a statement that just because something might be hard to fight it does n’t mean that laws do not imply in the case . ”
Louderback has no idea whether the attack on their network was intentional or not , but said he involved the FBI .
“ Was it malicious ?
Intentional ?
Negligent ?
Spoofed ?
I ca n’t say .
But what I do know is that the FBI is looking into the matter , and it ’s far more serious than toddlers squabbling over broken toys and lost cookies . ”
This is yet another epic fail in MediaDefender ’s history , and this might very well be the final punch to knock the company out .
Most of you probably remember the leaked emails and confidential information , which cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars , and brought them on the verge of bankruptcy .
To quote MediaDefender ’s CEO Randy Saaf : “ This is really fucked . ”
Update : Ironically Revision3 seems to be down again because of all the traffic the news generated .
" Our agricultural research organisation just last week was able to map the genome ... that causes methane in ruminant animals and we believe we can vaccinate against " flatulent emissions , Mr Goff said .
“ For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon , ” she said .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel , on the other hand , put all options on the table .
“ The Iranian threat must be stopped by all possible means , ” he said Tuesday evening , speaking to the same group .
“ The international community has a duty and responsibility to clarify to Iran , through drastic measures , that the repercussions of their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will be devastating . ”
Mr. Olmert also called for international sanctions against Iran to be toughened .
He did not specifically mention military strikes , but did say that “ Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran , and neither should any country in the free world . ”
Mr. Olmert is scheduled to meet with President Bush at the White House on Wednesday .
The issue of opening high - level diplomatic talks with Iran has come under the spotlight this political season , and that has played out at Aipac ’s 2008 policy conference here .
On Monday , Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president , allied himself firmly with the Bush administration and charged that Mr. Obama ’s calls for diplomacy with Iran were misguided and insufficient .
And on Tuesday , Howard Friedman , Aipac ’s president , used his introduction of Ms. Rice to implore her “ to use your remaining time in office to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon . ”
Mr. Obama , who is seeking the Democratic nomination , will have the opportunity to defend his position on Wednesday when he , along with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , his opponent , is scheduled to address the group .

Barack Obama has a wide range of Democrats to choose his running mate from .
In recent years the Democratic Party has been able to elect 28 of the nation ’s 50 governors .
These state executives represent some of the party ’s best talent .
If Obama decides to add a governor to his ticket , here are five excellent choices .
1 ) . Gov. Bill Richardson ( D - NM ) – Bill Richardson is the governor of New Mexico and a former candidate for the 2008 Democratic nomination .
He is a nationally known figure due to his time as UN Ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton administration .
He has been nominated for five Nobel Prizes for his diplomatic work .
His foreign policy is completely opposite from the current administration .
He would help Obama with Hispanic voters , but he also struggles with white voters in his own state .
2 ) . Gov. Brian Schweitzer ( D - MT ) – Obama seems to be concentrating the early part of his general election campaign in the West , and the addition of the folksy rural Schweitzer would be the perfect complement to this strategy .
Schweitzer became Montana ’s first Democratic governor in 20 years .
Before being elected he had held no other office .
In the private sector , he was a farmer and a rancher who also visited 37 different countries while working on agriculture projects .
He has been a job creator and a tax cutter in his state , and would have great appeal to the rural voters who have thus far tuned Obama out .
Advertisements
3 ) .Gov. Tim Kaine ( D - VA ) –
If the Obama campaign is worried about their standing in the swing states , and wants to be certain that they Virginia into the Democratic column , then they should look no further than the popular Kaine .
He was one of the first elected officials outside of Illinois to endorse Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination .
The 50 year old has not been afraid to cut agency spending in his state , and is also a pro-life Democrat .
He could provide Obama a bridge to the conservative white Southern Democrats who supported Hillary Clinton .
4 ) . Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ( D - KS ) – If Obama decides that he would like a woman with executive experience , who is n’t Hillary Clinton , to balance out his ticket , then Sebelius would be his best option .
She is wildly popular in her state .
( She has not had an approval rating under 60 % in the last two plus years ) .
She was chosen to give the Democratic response to President Bush ’s 2008 State of the Union Address .
This has led many to speculate that she is being groomed for bigger things .
Sebelius has been clearly pro-choice , anti capital punishment , and opposed to laws that would allow citizens to carry concealed weapons or own machine guns .
Her political positions are a compliment to Obama ’s , and she would likely have broad appeal with women .
5 ) . Ted Strickland ( D - OH ) – Strickland continues the pattern of this feature .
All of these governors are from swing or red states .
His selection makes sense if the campaign decides that they need to add a Clinton supporter to the ticket .
One of his priorities has been to bring jobs back to Ohio ’s coal and energy industries .
This is a message that would play well in places like West Virginia and Western PA .
He made expanding educational opportunities and healthcare priorities on his agenda .
If the race looks close , a Clinton supporter from a critical swing state could be very helpful .
Please , feel free to comment and add your own choices to the list .
TEN GOOD REASONS FOR AN OBAMA / EDWARDS TICKET … .
If you ’re a progressive Democrat , you should want John Edwards to be Barack Obama ’s vice president .
I ’ve made some of these points before , but now I ’ve set up the slideshow !
So enjoy :
10 .
Because he ’s the most Vice - Presidential candidate we have .
For VP , you want a powerful campaigner who can use the media spotlight associated with the position to promote progressive ends and support the presidential candidate ’s major initiatives .
Edwards is a good campaigner and speaker who knows how to focus media attention into places where it needs to be ( see : poverty and health care ) .
I ’d contrast him with someone like Bob Graham , recently spotlighted in this space , who ’s much more the kind of guy you want in the Cabinet — a quietly effective smart old guy with few campaigning skills and non-camera - friendly tendencies .
9 . Because economic issues are huge this year .
Matthew Yglesias presents this chart in a post titled “ Annals of GOP doom ” :
This is n’t 2002 , 2004 , or 2006 .
Economic worries are bigger this year than they ’ve been for the last 30 years .
In better times , I ’d be more sympathetic to Matt Stoller ’s case for Wes Clark , but this is time to capitalize completely on the issue that voters think is the most important by substantial margins — the economy .
Obama ’s Iraq foresight will serve us well on foreign policy , and we need somebody who can make working - class voters in the economically depressed Midwest see McCain ’s anti-worker record and vote Democratic .
Nobody in our Two Americas does it better than John Edwards .
8 . Because conciliating Clinton supporters with a Clintonite is a fool ’s errand .
By historical standards , this actually has n’t been a particularly divisive primary — only 1/4 of Clinton supporters said they would n’t vote for Obama .
By contrast , a full 51 % of McCain supporters said they would n’t vote for Bush in March 2000 .
They still voted for him enough to give him the election .
Nobody means what they say when you ask them that question at the most emotional point in the process .
It ’s one of the reasons why I do n’t get angry at Hillary supporters who say they ’ll sit this one out — most of them will rethink that in cooler moments and make the right decision .
So do n’t do outlandish things for party unity .
You ’ll get it anyway .
And unless my reading of the psychology is totally confused , Hillary ’s core supporters are attached to Hillary herself , who is in many ways an inspiring and sympathetic figure .
Ed Rendell , Evan Bayh , and even Wes Clark are n’t what their dreams are made of .
So even if you think we wo n’t get party unity for some reason , please do n’t think you can get them to act like Hillary ’s on the ticket just by picking some dude who endorsed her .
( As for picking Hillary herself , I lay out a bunch of reasons not to do that here . )
7 . Because running with someone who repents his pro-war vote throws Obama ’s skills into full relief , and keeps the focus on 2002 .
There ’s no way Obama should pick an unrepentant Iraq War supporter like Clinton — he needs a fellow war opponent to make broad and effective criticisms of the neocons who started the war .
As long as Obama has someone who wholeheartedly supports his early antiwar position and is eager to praise his foresight , he ’ll be in good shape .
Republicans have a superfically plausible case to make about the surge , even if it in fact neglects the entire purpose of the surge ( to make room for political reconciliation ) .
By contrast , the 2002 Iraq vote is nearly impossible to defend , and disapproval of the original invasion is around 70 % in most polls .
As Justin Tiehen suggests , media coverage of the relationship between Obama , who foresaw all the dangers at the beginning , and Edwards , who now hopes to redeem his acknowledged error by going all - out in favor of his prescient ticketmate helps to keep focus in the place where the Republican position is obviously indefensible .
( There ’s also a really nice regional / racial redemption story in here , if you ’re looking for it . )
6. Because Pennsylvania tells us that Edwards helps Obama more than a locally popular Democrat .
Take a look at the polling data :
How much does the Governor of Pennsylvania help us in his home state ?
Not as much as John Edwards does .
Edwards is 3 - 5 % better than Rendell in the state where Rendell is supposed to help us win .
You do n’t pick John Edwards to help in the South or the Carolinas — you pick him to help everywhere , because that ’s what he does .
If you want more numbers , please go see OpenLeft ’s Paul Rosenberg , who concludes : “ Edwards is superior to all other VP candidates by margins that persist in virtually every category in almost every state . ”
5 . Because he did well in his last VP run .
No major gaffes , and if only the Kerry campaign had followed his advice and hit back against the Swift Boaters , who knows where we ’d be today ?
as early as Aug. 5 , when the Swifties were just getting traction , Edwards wanted to push back , hard .
McCain had just told the Associated Press that the Swift Boat ads were “ dishonest and dishonorable … the same kind of deal that was pulled on me . ”
Edwards wanted to begin a speech , “ I join with Senator McCain in calling on the president to condemn this dishonest and dishonorable ad . ”
But Kerry headquarters said no .
Stephanie Cutter , the boss of the Kerry communications shop , explained that the campaign did n’t need to give the Swift Boat vets any more attention than they were already getting .
Dude knew how to play ball .
As for his debate performance , a CBS poll of uncommitted voters — the people you ’re trying to win over in a debate — called it for Edwards 41 - 28 .
A before and after poll of the same voters also had him moving 1 percent of the vote from Bush to Kerry .
And he ’s only gotten better with practice .
Some people complain that he did n’t help Kerry in NC .
But as the PA results above and the amazing MN results below suggest , it may just be that he helped Kerry everywhere to the point that North Carolina did n’t stand out .
4. Elizabeth .
The story of Elizabeth Edwards facing down cancer to keep fighting for everything she believes in is positively awe - inspiring .
The more we hear about her in the coming months , the better .
3 . Because you want a better health care plan .
That ’s a link to Ezra Klein ’s classic article about Obama ’s not - quite - universal plan , which ends :
All the ingredients are in place for this to be a great plan — a public insurance component , a commitment to universality , an understanding that coherence is better than fractiousness , a willingness to regulate the insurance industry — but , in each case , at the last second , the policy is hedged before the fulfillment of its purpose .
In this , Obama ’s plan is not dissimilar from Obama himself — filled with obvious talent and undeniable appeal , sold with stunning rhetoric and grand hopes , but never quite delivering on the promises and potential .
And so he remains the candidate of almosts .
But as he told Morgan Miller back in March , there is time yet .
And he is so very close .
If you want Obama to upgrade to a better plan , ask him to team up with the guy who had one .
John Edwards introduced a plan for universal coverage very early in the campaign , pushed for it hard , and made the wonks cheer about how the goalposts had moved to the left .
Unlike Obama ’s , it ’s a plan with a backdoor to single - payer .
If you care about universal coverage , you want him in Obama ’s inner circle for designing the health care plan , and you want someone with his rhetorical talents on domestic issues to go around selling the plan to America .
2. Because Minnesota says that Obama / Edwards is well - nigh invincible .
Here are the numbers :
Tim Pawlenty is the governor of Minnesota , and he ’s popular enough to add 10 - 13 points to McCain ’s score if he becomes the faux - maverick ’s VP .
Against anybody except John Edwards , that is , who overwhelms Pawlenty .
Even in Pawlenty ’s home state , where people know and like him best , they like Edwards better .
This is the acid test of VP electability advantage , and Edwards passes it like platinum .
A Republican with huge local popularity does less for McCain than Edwards does for Obama , even thousands of miles from his sea-swelled Carolina home .
If you want to win , you want John Edwards on the ticket .
1. Because you want him to be president in 2016 .
As Senator , he racked up a 100 % NARAL rating while representing a solid red state ( where he also defied fate by voting against the Flag Burning Amendment ) .
Early on in this campaign , he introduced the health care and global warming plans that bid up the price of progressive support and made our activists cheer .
He broke new ground on the left by rejecting the War on Terror framework when other major candidates would n’t .
His plans to reduce poverty in America , simplify taxes for 50 million Americans , and help poor people around the world were only a few of the great ideas coming out of his recent effort .
I once hoped that he ’d set us on the road to single - payer ( an outcome artfully built into his health care plan ) .
Now I hope that he ’ll talk Obama into adopting that plan , help him pass it , and bring it to its happy conclusion ten or twelve years from now .
Given the high chance of a non-old VP pick becoming president later , it ’s a serious possibility .
We ’re early in the process , and there ’s no telling who Obama ’s options are .
And for all I know , Edwards might not want the job .
( I do n’t read too much into people ’s denials of VP interest — even if you want the VP slot , it ’s considered gauche to advertise your availability . )
But it ’s a job that every progressive Democrat should want John Edwards to have — not only because the data shows him to be hugely effective in helping us win the next election , but because there ’s no one better to set up as Obama ’s right - hand man and potential heir .
A new study analyzing several types of rice finds that grains grown in the United States may be safer than varieties grown in other countries .

Rice grown in the United States may be safer than varieties from Asia and Europe , according to a new global study of the grain that feeds over half of humanity .
The study evaluated levels of arsenic , which can be toxic at high levels , in rice worldwide .
The two - part report is scheduled for the May 15 issue of ACS ’ Environmental Science & Technology .
Yamily J. Zavala and colleagues point out that rice is a potentially important source of human exposure to arsenic , especially in populations with rice - based diets .
Arsenic in rice is of special concern because it accumulates in much higher concentrations in rice than other staple grain crops .
The researchers discovered that arsenic contamination of irrigation water was more important than soil contamination in increasing arsenic levels in rice .
Using global arsenic data , the researchers classified rice into two types , where the predominant arsenic forms were either organic or the more toxic inorganic forms .
They found that rice from the United States largely contains organic arsenic , which is less easily absorbed into the body and excreted more rapidly than inorganic arsenic .
Rice contaminated with inorganic arsenic prevails in Asia and Europe .
The study suggests that breeding new rice varieties that convert inorganic arsenic to organic arsenic would be an “ important risk reduction strategy , especially for countries like Bangladesh and India with arsenic contaminated environments and high rice consumption rates . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. Air Force general on Tuesday urged Boeing Co to aggressively market its C - 17 cargo plane to foreign countries as one strategy for keeping the production line running .
Gen. Norton Schwartz , who heads the U.S. Transportation Command , said the Department of Defense ( DOD ) needed 205 C - 17s -- 15 more than are currently planned -- to meet its own military requirements .
Boeing has delivered 171 planes to the U.S. military , out of a total of 190 on order , he said .
But foreign sales could keep the Boeing production line in Long Beach , California running even longer , he told a House Armed Services subcommittee , noting that Canada , Australia and Britain had already ordered the popular transport plane .
In addition , some Gulf countries had expressed interest in more than four additional planes and a NATO consortium was looking at buying three more , he said .
“ It is absolutely clear to me that there is an appetite for these machines outside the DOD procurement profile and it requires aggressive marketing on behalf of the manufacturer to see that those opportunities are realized , ” he said .
“ It ’s a strategy for extending the production line and it ’s something that should be aggressively pursued , ” he added .
Pentagon acquisition chief John Young last month said the U.S. military did not need additional C - 17 transport planes beyond those it has already ordered , despite an Air Force “ dream list ” asking Congress to fund 15 more .
He acknowledged Schwartz ’s requirement of 205 , but said that was not a “ codified ” or documented Pentagon requirement .
Congress has added 18 C - 17s to the defense budget over the past two years to keep the Boeing C - 17 production line rolling and safeguard jobs , despite a Pentagon decision to cap production of the popular transport plane .
The Pentagon did not include any funding for the plane in the Air Force part of its budget request for fiscal 2009 , but Rep. John Murtha , a Pennsylvania Democrat and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee defense subcommittee , has already vowed to add more C - 17s to the war budget for 2008 .
The Air Force also included 15 C - 17s at a price of $ 3.9 billion on an “ unfunded priorities list ” of weapons it says it needs but could not include in its regular budget request .
Schwartz said he did not share the view of some officials who believed future requirements , such as the need to transport vehicles being designed as part of the Army ’s Future Combat Systems , would raise the number of C - 17s needed beyond 205 .
If money were not an issue , Schwartz said he would prefer to get more C - 17s instead of putting new engines on some larger C - 5 transport planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp .
But he said that option would cost “ substantially ” more .
Gen . Arthur Lichte , commander of Air Mobility Command , told the committee that he would like to keep the C - 17 production line open and await the results of some studies underway to examine mobility and transportation requirements .
Schwartz said one study on mobility needs would be completed in January 2009 , with a separate report being done by the Institute for Defense Analyses to be done in May 2009 .
Both would include the Army requirement as well .
Nicole Richie Still in Driving School ( Photos )
Hasturned her court ordered driving school into a vocation ?
It seems like she has been attending drivers education classes forever .
We 've got photos of the Hollywood celebrity heading to class yesterday .
Actually when we checked back on her original sentence ( who can forget her 84 minutes of jail time ) , she is enrolled in the SB38 Alcohol Program .
The judge has mandated that Richie attend the program 's anti drinking driver course which spans 18 months .
She must also attend 52 hours of group counseling , bi-weekly face to face interviews and 12 hours of alcohol counseling .
The state of California does n't mess around with their repeat DUI offenders .
Check out more photos of Nicole heading to driving school and some of her attending the Cartier launch party earlier this week .

I truly do n't think the man is capable of a single honest thought or statement .
But this is so transparently dishonest that it 's laughable .
Who does this guy think he 's fooling ... other than Charlie Rose ?
Think Progress :
( O ) n The Charlie Rose Show , former Bush political adviser Karl Rove claimed that he was " opposed " to holding the pre-war Iraq vote just ahead of the 2002 elections .
" The administration was opposed to voting on it in the fall of 2002 , " Rove said .
He stated that his upcoming book will argue that the administration did not want to schedule an Iraq war vote prior to the 2002 elections .
You know , I do n't blame Rove for floating the lie .
After all , like the old proverb goes , you do n't get mad at the snake for biting you because you knew what he was before you picked him up .
But Jumping Jiminy , why in the hell does n't Charlie Rose at least scoff a little bit at Rove 's statement ?
How can any person with more than a two digit IQ and a semblance of a moral compass let the man behind the most politicized White House administration in decades get away with such a flaming pile of lies ?
PERRspectives looks at another revisionist version of history involving Rove .
( A U.S.A. specific rant . )
When I was a little kid , growing up in the suburbs so far from Chicago they should n't be called suburbs , I had not a personality .
None that mattered , anyway .
The only thing I 've retained from that time of my life is the fact that I find Dinosaurs interesting .
And how interesting is that ?
Every little boy in this country finds them old bones interesting .
Now , of course , my interest has a little more behind it
I digress .
My family moved to Wisconsin when I was 10 .
The social structure of our little household was already coming apart at the seams .
My brother hated me , so I had no one to talk to there .
My parents , at that point , had only slightly more personality than I did , and therefore were no help .
I was shunned at school , a tubby little outcast from another state .
They 'd formed their cliques before I 'd arrived , of course , so there was no place for me on the playground , or in the classroom .
I 'm not telling you this because I want sniffles .
Sometimes at night I revel in the fact that between the ages of 10 and 14 I was , literally , all alone .
Sometimes I wish I could be as disconnected from humanity as I was then .
My purpose in telling you these things are so as to set the stage for this node , which was created to tell you how books made me into a person .
A 10 year old who is essentially alone in the world , but is not entirely stupid , needs something to turn to , obviously .
If it had happened later in the 90's , I undoubtedly would have been able to turn to the internet , but this was 1990 .
I logged onto a BBS two years later , but there was n't a whole lot for a kid my age at that point in time .
So I started reading .
I 'd always been a reader , but just for fun .
Now , books became what I was , rather than merely a diversion looked down upon by the rest of society .
What books ?
Any books I could get my hands on .
Now , obviously , I was 10 .
I did n't understand everything in those novels , historical accounts , and pamphlets at that point , but it exposed me to humanity in a way I 'd never been privy to before then .
Since none of the other children wanted anything to do with my fat ass , I took to reading on the playground .
When I could hide it from the teachers , that is .
Those wrong headed monkeys actually took books away from me .
They said I needed to " run around and play with the other children " .
These people were clueless , and in some cases actively disliked me .
6th Grade was fun .
What 's the point to this rant again ?
Oh yeah :
Even if you do n't have time to be a good parent or teacher , let the kids around you read .
Expose them to humanity early through reading , so their societal immune system is developed as quickly as possible .
Apparently , kids are growing up faster and faster nowadays , and the sooner they 're given the tools to think like individuals , the more prepared they 'll be for that growth process .
This has been a public service message from the disaffected result of an uncaring society .
Do n't let our kids turn out like us .
Artist 's conception of region near supermassive black hole where twisted magnetic fields propel and shape jet of particles .

At the cores of many galaxies , supermassive black holes expel powerful jets of particles at nearly the speed of light .
Just how they perform this feat has long been one of the mysteries of astrophysics .
The leading theory says the particles are accelerated by tightly - twisted magnetic fields close to the black hole , but confirming that idea required an elusive close - up view of the jet 's inner throat .
Now , using the unrivaled resolution of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) , astronomers have watched material winding a corkscrew outward path and behaving exactly as predicted by the theory .
The astronomers reported their findings in the April 24 issue of the journal Nature .
" We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the particles actually are accelerated , and everything we see supports the idea that twisted , coiled magnetic fields are propelling the material outward , " said Alan Marscher , of Boston University , leader of an international research team .
" This is a major advance in our understanding of a remarkable process that occurs throughout the Universe , " he added .
Marscher 's team studied a galaxy called BL Lacertae ( BL Lac ) , some 950 million light - years from Earth .
BL Lac is a blazar , the most energetic type of black - hole - powered galactic core .
A black hole is a concentration of mass so dense that not even light can escape its gravitational pull .
Supermassive black holes in galaxies ' cores power jets of particles and intense radiation in similar objects including quasars and Seyfert galaxies .
Material pulled inward toward the black hole forms a flattened , rotating disk , called an accretion disk .
As the material moves from the outer edge of the disk inward , magnetic field lines perpendicular to the disk are twisted , forming a tightly - coiled bundle that , astronomers believe , propels and confines the ejected particles .
Closer to the black hole , space itself , including the magnetic fields , is twisted by the strong gravitational pull and rotation of the black hole .
Theorists predicted that material moving outward in this close - in acceleration region would follow a corkscrew - shaped path inside the bundle of twisted magnetic fields .
They also predicted that light and other radiation emitted by the moving material would brighten when its rotating path was aimed most directly toward Earth .
Marscher and his colleagues predicted there would also be a flare later when the material hits a stationary shock wave called the " core " some time after it has emerged from the acceleration region .
" That behavior is exactly what we saw , " Marscher said , when his team followed an outburst from BL Lac .
In late 2005 and early 2006 , the astronomers watched BL Lac with an international collection of telescopes as a knot of material was ejected outward through the jet .
As the material sped out from the neighborhood of the black hole , the VLBA could pinpoint its location , while other telescopes measured the properties of the radiation emitted from the knot .
Bright bursts of light , X - rays , and gamma rays came when the knot was precisely at locations where the theories said such bursts would be seen .
In addition , the alignment of the radio and light waves -- a property called polarization -- rotated as the knot wound its corkscrew path inside the tight throat of twisted magnetic fields .
" We got an unprecedented view of the inner portion of one of these jets and gained information that 's very important to understanding how these tremendous particle accelerators work , " Marscher said .

The older generation , the congregants said , had drifted away from Jesus ’s example .
“ What the church has done wrong is that it has created these ‘ holy huddles ’ of Christian magazines , music and schools that have set them apart from the world because the world is bad , ” said Mr. Beckemeier , who grew up in an evangelical family .
“ Instead of doing what Christ did , and bring light to the world , they retreat from it . ”

Younger evangelicals focus more on “ the ethic of Jesus ” than on political issues , said Adam Smith , editor of the religion and culture magazine Relevant .
They gravitate toward practical social action , Mr. Smith and others said , like working with poor , academically troubled inner-city schools , a priority at the Journey , or against human trafficking .
While older evangelicals are also involved in such issues , younger people shy away from their emphasis on political organizing .
“ They are very much turned off by the suit - and - tie power brokers of the evangelical right , ” said David P. Gushee , professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University in Georgia .
Within American evangelicalism more broadly , there has been some rethinking of its image and priorities .
Younger evangelicals feed that new drive and are beginning to lead it .
Their efforts have resonated with some older leaders , but they have also created a backlash .
Jonathan Merritt , 25 , is a graduate of Liberty University , the son of a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and himself a former Republican precinct chairman in Georgia .
A seminarian , he now calls himself an independent conservative .
In March , he introduced an environmental initiative urging Southern Baptists to do more to combat climate change , saying their current position was “ too timid . ”
After beginning with 44 signers , the initiative now has about 250 , including pastors , university professors and the current and past presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention .
But Richard Land , president of the convention ’s powerful advocacy arm , the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , did not sign the initiative .
He said his group had concerns about it that they had made known to some signers , who then rescinded their support .
On May 15 , Mr. Land ’s group introduced its own online petition called “ We Get It ! ” that questions the science around global warming and warns that “ millions of people around the world are threatened by extreme environmental policies . ”
A new transportation bill signed by Bush on Friday would free up $ 45 million to build the U.S. 's first maglev train .
The train will travel between Disneyland and Las Vegas at up to 300 mph and is meant to help ease traffic on the 250 + mile ride on Interstate 15 .
While I 'm all for high - speed trains and efficient public transportation , is n't the Bush administration forgetting something ?

Maglev trains are hella expensive .
Sure , the $ 45 million is only supposed to pay for " environmental studies " in the first phase of the project , but the government can probably expect to spend a hundred times that amount before this thing is over .
Japan 's Linimo maglev train , located near Nagoya , cost a cool $ 380 million to build and it's only 5.5 miles long .
China 's Shanghai Maglev Train , finished in 2004 in a country where labor 's cheap and private land ownership is a pretty new concept , cost $ 1.3 billion for 19 miles of track - roughly $ 68.4 million per mile .
What will $ 45 million buy in the States ? 10 feet ?

I love the concept of mass transit and one of my biggest gripes with the U.S. is how they let their train infrastructure shrivel and rot , but the paltry amount dedicated to such a pricey technology makes me wonder if this is n't just another attempt for Bush to greenwash his last few months in office .

P.S. The picture is of the Shanghai Maglev Train , which has been criticized by locals for being showy , wasteful and impractical .

CASMII Press Release
10 May 2008
" US confession : Weapons were not made in Iran after all "
In a sharp reversal of its longstanding accusations against Iran arming militants in Iraq , the US military has made an unprecedented albeit quiet confession : the weapons they had recently found in Iraq were not made in Iran at all .
According to a report by the LA Times correspondent Tina Susman in Baghdad : “ A plan to show some alleged Iranian - supplied explosives to journalists last week in Karbala and then destroy them was canceled after the United States realized none of them was from Iran .
A U.S. military spokesman attributed the confusion to a misunderstanding that emerged after an Iraqi Army general in Karbala erroneously reported the items were of Iranian origin .
When U.S. explosives experts went to investigate , they discovered they were not Iranian after all . ”
The US , which until two weeks ago had never provided any proof for its allegations , finally handed over its “ evidence ” of the Iranian origin of these weapons to the Iraqi government .
Last week , an Iraqi delegation to Iran presented the US “ evidence ” to Iranian officials .
According to Al - Abadi , a parliament member from the ruling United Iraqi Alliance who was on the delegation , the Iranian officials totally refuted “ training , financing and arming ” militant groups in Iraq .
Consequently the Iraqi government announced that there is no hard evidence against Iran .
In another extraordinary event this week , the US spokesman in Iraq , Maj . Gen. Kevin Bergner , for the first time did not blame Iran for the violence in Iraq and in fact did not make any reference to Iran at all in his introductory remarks to the world media on Wednesday when he described the large arsenal of weapons found by Iraqi forces in Karbala .
In contrast , the Pentagon in August 2007 admitted that it had lost track of a third of the weapons distributed to the Iraqi security forces in 2004 / 2005 .
The 190,000 assault rifles and pistols roam free in Iraqi streets today .
In the past year , the US leaders have been relentless in propagating their charges of Iranian meddling and fomenting violence in Iraq and since the release of the key judgments of the US National Intelligence Estimate in December that Iran does not have a nuclear weaponisation programme , these accusations have sharply intensified .
The US charges of Iranian interference in Iraq too have now collapsed .
Any threat of military strike against Iran is in violation of the UN charter and the IAEA 's continued supervision on Iran 's uranium enrichment facilities means there is no justification for sanctions .
CASMII calls on the US to change course and enter into comprehensive and unconditional negotiations with Iran .

" If you 're mining on the coast , sooner or later you 'll find a wreck , " archaeologist Dieter Noli , who is researching the ship 's origins , said in an interview today , describing De Beers geologists stumbling on the wreck on April 1 as they prospected for diamonds off Namibia 's south - west coast .
Namdeb Diamond Corp , a joint venture of the government of Namibia and De Beers , first reported the find in a statement yesterday , and planned a news conference in the Namibian capital on the discovery next week .
Namdeb had cleared and drained a stretch of seabed , building an earthen wall to keep the water out so geologists could work .
Noli said one of the geologists first saw a few ingots , but had no idea what they were .
Then they found what looked like cannon barrels , but were n't sure .
The geologists stopped the brutal earth moving work of searching for diamonds and sent photos to Noli , who had done research in the Namibian desert since his university days in Cape Town in the mid-1980s and since 1996 has advised De Beers on the archaeological impact of its operations in Namibia .
The find " was what I 'd been waiting for for 20 years , " Noli said .
" Understandably , I was pretty excited .
I still am . "
Noli 's original specialty was the desert , but because of Namdeb 's offshore explorations , he had been preparing for the possibility of a wreck , even learning to dive .
He had also studied maritime artifacts with Bruno Werz , a recognised expert in the field who was one of his instructors at the University of Cape Town .
Noli brought in Werz to help research the Namdeb wreck .
Judging from the notables depicted on the hoard of Spanish and Portuguese coins and the type of cannons and crude navigational equipment , the ship went down in the late 1400s or early 1500s , around the time Vasco de Gama and Columbus were plying the waters of the New World , " a period when Africa was just being opened up , when the whole world was being opened up , " Noli said .
Noli compared the remnants found - the ingots , ivory , coins , coffin - sized timber fragments - to evidence at a crime scene .
" The surf would have pounded that wreck to smithereens , " he said .
" It 's not like ' Pirates of the Caribbean , ' with a ship more or less intact . "
He and Werz are trying to fit the pieces into a story .
They divide their time between inventorying the find in Namibia and researching in museums and libraries in Cape Town in neighbouring South Africa , from where Noli spoke by phone today .
Eventually , they will go to Portugal , whose ships were particularly active in the area 500 years ago , or Spain to search for records of a vessel with similar cargo that went missing .
" You do n't turn a skipper loose with a cargo of that value and have no record of it , " Noli said .
The wealth aboard is intriguing .
Noli said the large amount of copper could mean the ship had been sent by a government looking for material to build cannons .
Trade in ivory was usually controlled by royal families , another indication the ship was on official business .
On the other hand , why was the captain still holding so many coins ?
Should n't they have been traded for the ivory and copper ?
" Either he did a very , very good deal .
Or he was a pirate , " Noli said .
" I 'm convinced we 'll find out what the ship was and who the captain was . "
What sent her down may remain a mystery .
But Noli has theories , noting the stretch of coast where it met its fate was notorious for fierce storms and disorienting fogs .
In later years , sailors with sophisticated navigational tools avoided it .
The only tools found aboard Noli 's wrecks were astrolabes , which can be used to determine only how far north or south you have sailed .

I woke up early , flushed my contacts and fake business cards down the toilet , sat on my bed and waited for the Special Branch .
They and the Burmese military intelligence had been after me for almost a week .
I had become , briefly , the most wanted man in Burma .
Burma 's leaders refused to let foreign aid workers enter the country
My photo had apparently been circulated to every military checkpoint .
My name was being scoured for among all the records of foreigners travelling around the country .
My crime , as they saw it , was to report on the cyclone that devastated the Irrawaddy Delta claiming thousands of lives .
There were a handful of other journalists who had also sneaked into Burma as tourists but they were all working anonymously .
I had done something foreign correspondents do not normally do in Burma .
I had put my name and face on the TV while I was still in the country .
The government was obviously furious .
And so I had seemed to become state enemy number one .
They suspected I was hiding in the hotel because a few hours earlier they had deported the other two members of my team - producer , Annie Phrommayon , and cameraman , Arito Go. Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

The first question they asked my colleagues when they began their interrogation was " where is Paul Allan Danahar ? "
They had traced us because we had all three checked into the same hotel together on our first night , before I broke cover .
Since then I had been sneaking into places , staying in different people 's rooms without registering .
So the authorities started looking for Annie and Arito in the hope of catching me .
Despite several hours of questioning they stuck to their story about only having met me by accident .
The authorities could not prove otherwise but were not taking any chances so they kicked them out .
Losing hope
While all this effort was being spent tracking down one lone journalist , one million people were stranded in the delta , cut off from the outside world by blocked roads and broken bridges .
The cyclone had brought in its wake a huge tidal surge that demolished entire communities living along the rivers and inlets .
The UN says 1.5 m people are in need of urgent help Husbands and wives , mothers and children swept apart in an instant .
Those that survived were living among tens of thousands of rotting corpses .
They had no food , no clean water , no shelter and must have been losing hope .
Disease had already got a grip .
Dysentery was attacking the young and the sick .
But despite this , the military regime was blocking access to the region to international aid groups , people with the skills not only to deliver the aid but also to build an infrastructure to keep people alive .
The tragedy of this disaster may be that people died even though the means to save them was there .
The generals who run this country have shunned the outside world for years .
Their choice was stark - open up the country to Western influence and save lives , or try to go it alone and risk people dying .
I had been warned by a diplomat that I could expect a ' hard time ' from the authorities before they deported me
They chose option B - aid was welcome but not the experts who could deliver it .
As we drove through the delta , evidence of a relief effort of sorts was visible but so was the scale of the problem .
And they were not up to it .
In the former capital Rangoon , itself badly damaged by the cyclone , one man summed up the frustrations of a nation .
" When we had demonstrations last year the soldiers were everywhere , " he said .
" Where are they now ? "
Driving through the devastated communities , which five days after the disaster had still received no help , the generals ' actions seemed morally bankrupt .
By the time Annie and Arito had been caught we had realised they were probably physically bankrupt .
The military intelligence , or MI , made them pay the taxi fare for their own deportation .
Just before they dumped them on the plane one of the intelligence officers began complaining to Arito about his workload .
It is hard to feel sorry for a man who works for one of the most repressive regimes on the planet when he tells you he has to do long hours .
Escape
The phone rang in my room .
I knew it was one of the MI guys in the hotel telling me to come down .
I grabbed my bag and headed for the back stairwell .
All the time I kept running my cover story through my head so I did not implicate a second BBC team that had just snuck in to back us up .
UN calls for Burma aid corridor Another MI official blocked the rear entrance .
I skipped back up five flights of stairs and looked out over the hotel balcony .
I was in luck - the MI man covering the front had gone to bum a cigarette from a taxi driver and was standing to the left next to the long driveway that led to the exit .
I ran down the main stairs into the lobby .
It was empty .
Catching my breath I calmly strolled out the front door , turned right and waited for the intelligence officer to finish his smoke and go back inside .
After 15 minutes I walked back across the car park and headed for the exit .
You know how when you walk around foreign country you always get plagued by taxi drivers everywhere you go ?
Well it does not happen when the police are after you .
My aim was the airport .
I did not want to get caught and taken to a downtown police station .
I had been warned by a diplomat that I could expect a " hard time " from the authorities before they deported me .
I thought that if I made it to the airport early , giving them a whole day to question me , I had a better chance of not being kept overnight in a cell .
In fact , I got all the way to my seat on the plane before I saw a large man with a walkie - talkie stuck to his ear coming down the aisle .
I was led off the plane as six breathless military types came stomping down the walkway .
One man snatched my passport , the other began taking my picture .
But no - one tried to drag me away .
The British ambassador told my foreign editor , Jon Williams , that if I were lucky , the Burmese would be so sick of me they would just want me out of the country .
And so it proved .
The man who took my passport simply stamped it with the legend " deportee " , shoved it back in my hand and growled , " go " .

What are these ?
By JONATHAN KARL and LUIS MARTINEZ

The top U.S. Navy official in the Persian Gulf warned in an interview with ABC News that war with Iran would be “ pretty disastrous , ” with “ echoes and aftershocks ” reverberating throughout the region .
“ Nobody I ’ve spoken to suggests that going to war with Iran is a good thing , ” Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff told ABC
News .
“ The preferred path by far is the diplomatic path , keep working with the international community to bring the right sort of pressure to bear on the Islamic Republic of Iran . ”
For years , there has been a swirl of speculation about the prospects of war , as the United States has accused Iran of arming militias in Iraq , trying to develop nuclear weapons and supporting terrorism .
President Bush and other top U.S. officials have repeatedly stressed diplomacy when it comes to Iran , but say “ all options are on the table , ” including the military option .
If it did come to waging war with Iran , Adm .
Cosgriff ’s forces would likely play a central role .
As the head of the Fifth Fleet , he is the commander of U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf .
“ As I look at the landscape , we should just sort of keep the pressure on , the big pressure , diplomatic , economic , ” he said .
“ Part of that [ pressure ] is for military forces , in this case the United States Fifth Fleet , to say we intend to be able to conduct operations in that part of the world in support of our friends and U.S. interests without being harassed or threatened by you , because we are not threatening you , ” Cosgriff said .
“ We have been there for decades ; we are going to be there for decades . ”
Cosgriff believes “ we have years ” to deal with Iran ’s nuclear program because “ It ’s going to take them a while to do all it will take to finish all the work that needs to go into developing a weapon , ” but he fears that a miscalculation or misunderstanding could lead to military conflict with the United States .
One worrying development being carefully watched by the Navy , he said , is that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard says it is training a cadre of suicide bombers capable of attacking U.S. ships .
In January , a group of small Iranian speedboats aggressively approached U.S. war ships in the Persian Gulf .
After repeated warnings , the boats eventually backed off , but at least one of them , operated by four members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , came close to being fired on by the Navy ships .
“ The four Iranian Revolutionary Guard people came within 10 seconds of being dead , ” Cosgriff said .
Such an incident could spiral into a larger conflict , which is why Cosgriff says the overarching direction he gives his sailors is “ disciplined restraint :
Do n’t allow yourself to be provoked by some local yokel .
ln the same breath , I say do n’t allow yourself to be successfully attacked . ”
The US has removed its nuclear weapons from Britain , ending a contentious presence spanning more than half a century , a report will say today .
According to the study by the Federation of American Scientists , the last 110 American nuclear weapons on UK soil were withdrawn from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk on the orders of President George Bush .
The report 's author , Hans Kristensen , one of the leading experts on Washington 's nuclear arsenal , said the move had happened in the past few years , but had only come to light yesterday .
He described the withdrawal of the B - 61 " freefall " , or " gravity " , bombs as part of a general strategic shift since the end of the cold war .
" The northern front is not very relevant any more for these deployments .
The US nuclear posture is almost entirely focused on the southern region , in Incirlik [ in Turkey ] and Aviano [ in Italy ] . "
Movements of the US arsenal are shrouded in secrecy .
Kristensen said the first signs the bombs had left Lakenheath emerged in a US airforce document dated January 2007 on nuclear inspections .
The document lists inspections of US nuclear sites , but above an annexe listing emergency drills carried out at the sites , it notes " not applicable to Lakenheath " .
Kristensen 's report is posted today at fas.org / blog/ssp .
He says the removal of bombs from Lakenheath follows the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Greece in 2001 , and that removal of such weapons from two Nato countries in less than a decade undercuts the argument for continuing deployment in other European countries .
The removal from Britain would reduce the US arsenal in Europe to about 250 .
Once officially declared , it could defuse current tensions with Moscow and possibly trigger matching cuts in the Russian stockpile .
Kristensen said last night : " It 's so puzzling why Nato goes about the reduction in total secrecy .
Keeping this secret completely undercuts our foreign policy interests . "
The FAS was founded in 1945 by former scientists on the Manhattan Project , which produced the first atomic bomb , as a means of spreading information about the dangers posed by the new weapons .
Paul Ingram , the executive director of the British American Security Information Council , said last night : " This is a win -win situation for Nato and disarmament , and for rapprochement with Russia .
Nato 's future and the transatlantic alliance is tied up with operations in Afghanistan far more than with ageing freefall bombs that have no military relevance . "
Greg Mello , the head of a nuclear watchdog the Los Alamos Study Group said : " The nuclear weapons themselves do n't serve any military purpose .
They are mostly about cementing a political bond that ties Europe interests to US interests . "
The FAS study is being published a few days after Kristensen published a leaked US air force internal report saying that most European bases where US nuclear weapons were stored had inadequate security .
The report , which was ordered after the US air force lost track of six nuclear cruise missiles last August , found that " support buildings , fencing , lighting and security systems " were in need of repair .
In some cases , conscripts with less than nine months ' experience were being used to guard the nuclear weapons .
Elsewhere private security guards were used .
The report recommends that the US nuclear arsenal in Europe be consolidated to " reduce vulnerabilities " .
That would involve the withdrawal of significant numbers of US nuclear weapons .
LAS VEGAS - Nearly 40,000 people learned this week that a trip to the doctor may have made them sick .
In a type of scandal more often associated with Third World countries , a Las Vegas clinic was found to be reusing syringes and vials of medication for nearly four years .
The shoddy practices may have led to an outbreak of the potentially fatal hepatitis C virus and exposed patients to HIV , too .
The discovery led to the biggest public health notification operation in U.S. history , brought demands for investigations and caused scores of lawyers to seek out patients at risk for infections .
Thousands of patients are being urged to be tested for the viruses .
Six acute cases of hepatitis C have been confirmed .
The surgical center and five affiliated clinics have been closed .
" I find it baffling , frankly , that in this day and age anyone would think it was safe to reuse a syringe , " said Michael Bell , associate director for infection control at the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
One of the infected patients is retired airplane mechanic Michael Washington , 67 , who was the first to report his infection .
On the advice of his doctor , he received a routine colon exam in July at the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada .
In September , he started to get sick .
He was losing weight fast .
His urine turned dark .
His stomach hurt .
By January , it was clear what had happened .
Washington describes his virus as a " creeping death sentence " and worries that others will hear his story and think twice before getting preventive care they need .
In letters that began arriving this week , patients who received injected anesthesia at the endoscopy center from March 2004 to mid- January were urged to get tested for hepatitis B and C , and HIV .
Because all three viruses are transmitted by blood , they could have been passed from one patient to the next by the unsafe practices at the clinic .
The mass notification is the result of a health district investigation that began in January when officials linked an uptick of unusual hepatitis C cases to the clinic .
Health officials say they are most worried about the spread of hepatitis C , which targets the liver but shows no symptoms in as many as 80 percent of infections .
Hepatitis C results in the swelling of the liver and can cause stomach pain , fatigue and jaundice .
It may eventually result in liver failure .
Even when no symptoms occur , the virus can slowly cause damage to the liver .
Officials estimate that 4 percent of the patients already had the virus when they entered the clinic , compared with 0.5 percent for hepatitis B and less than 0.5 percent for HIV .
Hepatitis C also is easier to transmit than HIV , they said .
" You put the two together and hepatitis C is really our big concern , " said Brian Labus , senior epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District .
Health inspectors say they observed clinic staff using the same syringe twice to extract anesthesia from a single vial , which was then inappropriately used to treat more than one patient .
The practice allows contaminated blood in a used syringe to taint the vial and infect the next patient .
Of the six patients so far diagnosed with acute hepatitis C , five received treatment at the clinic on the same day in late September .
Since 1999 , the CDC counts 14 hepatitis outbreaks in the U.S. linked to bad injection practices .
The largest outbreak occurred in Fremont , Neb. , where 99 cancer patients were infected at an oncology center from 2001 to 2002 .
At least one died .
The doctor involved in the case acknowledged reusing syringes and settled scores of lawsuit .
But he never explained why the syringes were reused .
Bell said such improper procedures appear to be more common in outpatient surgical centers like the endoscopy center .
Unlike hospitals , such centers often do not have employees whose sole responsibility is to monitor and educate staff on best practices .
In Las Vegas , clinic staff told inspectors they had been ordered by management to reuse the vials and syringes .
Labus described the practice as an unwritten , but long - practiced policy .
Investigators were told the practice was an attempt to cut costs , according to a letter of complaint from the city , which revoked the facility 's business license Friday .
Five other facilities affiliated with the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada also had their licenses revoked .
The clinic 's majority owner , Dipak Desai , a political contributor and member of the governor 's commission on health care , has refused to comment on the allegations .
He released a statement expressing concern for the patients and assuring the public the problems had been corrected .
He later took out a full - page ad in Sunday 's edition of the Las Vegas Review - Journal insisting that needles had not been reused and that the chances of contracting an infection at the center in most of the last four years were " extremely low . "
Of the thousands of people who have rushed to be tested , many will get positive results , Labus said .
More than 15,000 people already have called the health district for information .
But it takes a more sophisticated test , a complete evaluation of risk factors and a clear pattern of infection to determine whether the virus was caught at the facility .
Plenty of lawyers are wading into the mess .
Television ads called " health alerts " are soliciting clients .
At least a handful of class - action lawsuits have been filed .
On Tuesday , the office of Las Vegas attorney Ed Bernstein was buzzing with phone calls — nearly 1,000 a day , he said .
Bernstein said he represents about 1,200 patients at the facility , eight who have tested positive for hepatitis C .
Washington , the infected airplane mechanic , is one of Bernstein 's clients .
His wife , Josephine , a registered nurse , wonders how any health care professional could be so reckless : " To maximize profit ?
For what ?
What are you going to save ? "

To anyone puzzled by Hillary Clinton 's tardiness in conceding defeat , distinguished US journalist James Fallows provided this explanation : ' The Clinton team does n't worry about hurting Barack Obama 's prospects of winning in the fall , ' he wrote in the online edition of the Atlantic , ' because they assess those prospects at zero .
Always have .
Obama might not win if he leads a bitterly divided party , but ( in this view ) he was never going to win .
Not a chance .
He would be smashed like an armadillo in the road by the Republican campaign machine , and would be just about as ready as the armadillo for what was coming . '
Right on cue , a reporter from the respected McClatchy newspaper group travelling on the Obama campaign plane asked him about rumours on the internet of a video of his wife using a derogatory term for white people .
' We 've seen this before , ' Obama fumed .
' There is dirt and lies circulated in emails and they pump them out long enough until you , a mainstream reporter , ask me about it .
That gives legs to the story .
If somebody has evidence that myself or Michelle or anybody has said something inappropriate , let them do it . '
Welcome to the media ecosystem , in which ' mainstream ' media have discovered that their new symbiotic relationship with the blogosphere sucks them into a downward spiral and an underworld of innuendo , lies and propaganda .
' Frankly , my hope is people do n't play this game , ' Obama told the McClatchy reporter .
' It is a destructive aspect of our politics .
Simply because something appears in an email , that should lend it no more credence than if you heard it on the corner .
Presumably the job of the press is to not to go around and spread scurrilous rumours like this until there is actually anything , an iota , of substance or evidence that would substantiate it . '
He 's right , but the thicket of ethical questions raised by the new ecosystem engulfs us all .
For example , should a responsible newspaper - or blog - provide a link to a dubious online source ?
The case for not doing so is that providing a link implicitly raises the status of the offending site .
But in a world where Google will find virtually anything in an instant , such high - minded abstinence becomes an empty gesture .
As it happens , there is a way out of the morass , but it requires the application of old - fashioned journalistic skills and values .
Or , more prosaically , sceptical , investigative reporting .
The fact that something is circulating on the net is not , in itself , news - any more than is the fact that microbes circulate in drinking water .
You can find anything you want on the net , and I mean anything .
So what ?
The rot that so offends Obama set in when ' mainstream ' reporters began to relay what they found on the net in their own publications .
And that happened a long time ago with the Drudge Report and the vicious right - wing campaign to bring down Bill Clinton .
A good example of how to deal with internet rumours was provided last week by David Weigel of Reason magazine .
He went to work on Larry Johnson , the blogger who first started pushing the rumour about Michelle Obama .
' I know for a fact , ' Johnson blogged on 26 May , ' that Barack and Michelle Obama would like the tape of her blasting " whitey " during a rant at Jeremiah Wright 's church to never see the light of day . '
How does he know ?
He 'learnt from someone in touch with a senior Republican over this holiday weekend that a major McCain backer has a copy of the tape ' .
Wow !
Someone ' in touch with a senior Republican ' .
Weigel tracks what happens next .
On the night of 31 May , Johnson promises an update by 9 am on 2 June .
' Now I know why people who have seen the videotape say it is stunning , ' he burbles .
On 1 June , Roger Stone appears on Fox News and says he 's heard rumours about a Michelle Obama tape .
At 8 am on 2 June , Johnson reveals what he learnt from ' five separate sources who have spoken directly with people who have seen the tape .
It features Michelle Obama and Louis Farrakhan .
They are on a panel at Jeremiah Wright 's church when Michelle makes her intemperate remarks .
Whoops !!'
So the story whirls around the echo - chamber of the paranoid , right - wing blogosphere , with the odd whisk from Fox News reporters , until it reaches hysteria .
But it all dissolves under Weigel 's sceptical scrutiny , which is worth reading in full ( see tinyurl.com/66k6ty ) .
And no tape surfaces .
The moral ?
If confronted with online rumours , investigate first , report later .
April 16 , 2008  --
The Supreme Court has upheld the three - drug lethal injection method used by the state of Kentucky in a 7 - 2 decision , clearing the way for an unofficial moratorium on executions to be lifted .
" Some risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution no matter how humane -- if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure , " Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion .
" It is clear , then , that the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions . "
" Simply because an execution method may result in pain , either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death , does not establish the sort of ' objectively intolerable risk of harm ' that qualifies as cruel and unusual , " his opinion continued .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter dissented .
The two convicted murderers at the center of the case , Ralph Baze and Thomas C. Bowling , had unwittingly caused an unofficial moratorium on executions across the country .
Since the court announced in September that it would hear the Kentucky case , states had postponed the execution of 25 death row inmates ; some states had stopped scheduling them altogether while the justices mulled the case .
The last execution in the United States occurred the same day the court picked up the case , when Texas put Michael Richard to death on Sept. 25 , 2007 .
Baze and Bowling had argued that death by lethal injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment , an argument the Court rejected .
The drugs included in the protocol are sodium thiopental , which anesthetizes ; pancuronium bromide , which paralyzes ; and potassium chloride , which causes cardiac arrest .
Of the 36 states with a death penalty law on the books , all but one has designated lethal injection as the primary method of execution .
As for what 's next , Richard Dieter , who runs the Death Penalty Information Center , a group opposed to the capital punishment , said he believes that " quite a few [ execution ] dates will be set -- testing whether their states meets the same standard that the court found acceptable in Kentucky . "
Dieter said methods of capital punishment are not likely to go unchallenged in the future , despite the court 's ruling in the Kentucky case .
" Lower courts could say that based on today 's decision that the execution in certain states cannot go forward because they do n't even meet the Kentucky procedures , " Dieter continued .
" This is not a blanket pass for all states to carry out lethal injections . "
Associate Justice John Paul Stevens noted in his concurring opinion that the decision is not the final word on the lethal injection issue because other states have their own challenges .
Dieter noted that " Roberts indicated that they have never overturned a method of execution , and that 's true , but I do n't think this decision removes objections that will continue . "
" The fact that there were only two justices in dissent , they may be thinking of the real problems of executions in Ohio and Florida etc ....
This must be lingering in the thoughts of the dissenters , " he added .
Lawyers for Baze and Bowling had argued that the drugs are administered by untrained officials who can botch the execution and cause extreme pain .
They also argued that other drug combinations could be more effective in carrying out the death penalty .
Donald Verrilli , an attorney for the Kentucky inmates , has said , " It really is not about fine - tuning the system to create an incrementally less amount of pain .
This is about avoiding torture . "
But in court , the justices seemed skeptical of the argument .
Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia said , " Where does this come from that you must find the method of execution that causes the least pain ?
We have approved electrocution .
We have approved death by firing squad .
I expect both of those have more possibilities of painful death than the protocol here . "
There have been instances across the country of fumbled executions .
In Florida , convicted murderer Angel Diaz was executed in 2006 .
But a medical examiner 's postmortem examination revealed that due to the improper injection of the anesthetic in his case , he had chemical burns on both arms .
Experts believe he would have felt extreme pain for 20 to 30 minutes .
In Ohio , Joseph Clark was sentenced to death for killing a gas station attendant .
But his 2006 execution was botched .
It took him 86 minutes to die while he screamed in pain .
Even his victim 's brother , Michael Manning , watched in horror .
" He started to shake his head from side to side , " said Manning .
It took a technician 19 tries to insert the deadly intravenous needle .
Manning said what he saw in that execution chamber should not have happened .
" I believe in the death penalty , but I side on the constitutionality side of it .
The Eighth Amendment says no cruel and unusual punishment , and that 's what I think it was . "
In Missouri , the doctor who devised and supervised that state 's lethal injection procedure has admitted in court that he is dyslexic , " so it 's not unusual for me to make mistakes . "
An investigation by the St. Louis Post - Dispatch revealed that the doctor , Alan R. Doerhoff , had been sued for malpractice more than 20 times .
The paper also reported that one nurse who worked on Missouri executions is himself a convicted stalker .
But victims ' rights advocates , as well as victims ' family members , often have little sympathy for the arguments of the death row inmates .
Dennis Briscoe was 14 years old when Baze opened fire with an assault weapon and murdered his father and uncle -- both Kentucky law enforcement officers .
" What they should really consider is the pain my father and uncle went through when that happened , " he said .
" We should all be so lucky as to just fall asleep when we die . "
The problem with triumphallists is that they can't see defeat when it 's staring them in the face .
Unlike true defeatists -- us Mexican mask - wearing bloggers ( in case you have n't noticed ) -- they suffer from denial .
I recently read The “ We - Win - Even - When - We - Lose ” Syndrome : U.S. Press Coverage of the Twenty - Fifth Anniversary of the “ Fall of Saigon ” by Yen Le Espiritu and this paragraph speaks to their situation :
While most scholars have separated Vietnam veterans and Vietnamese refugees into different fields of study , I show how they are necessarily joined : as the purported rescuers and rescued respectively , they together reposition the United States and its ( white male ) citizens as savior of Vietnam ’s " runaways , " and thus as the ultimate victor of the Vietnam War .
I contend that it is this seeming victory — the " we- win - even - when - we - lose " certainty — that undergirds U.S. remembrance of Vietnam 's " collateral damage " as historically " necessary " for the progress of freedom and democracy .
Equally important , this ability to conjure triumph from defeat constitutes an organized and strategic forgetting of a war that " went wrong , " enabling " patriotic " Americans to push military intervention as key in America ’s self - appointed role as liberators .
In other words , it is the " we - win - even - when - we- lose " syndrome that has energized and emboldened the perpetuation of U.S. militarism .
The beauty of U.S. imperialism is that no matter how badly we fuck up we can return home with ball in hand as the naive , innocent boy we 've always been .
That said , Henry Kissinger better get cracking on that peace with honor / victory let 's get the hell out of Dodge strategy thingy .

On a chaotic street in this sweltering jungle town , Emergildo Criollo spent several days near the entrance to a courthouse that looks more like a run-down mall .
He was , he says , " vigilando " – watching .
" We waited to know the moment he arrived , " says the middle - aged indigenous man who was raised in this oil - rich Amazonian rain forest near Ecuador 's northern border with Colombia .
The man Mr. Criollo and his friends were waiting for is Richard Cabrera , a court - appointed expert who last week poured fuel on an epic environmental lawsuit filed by Ecuadorean indigenous groups against US - based Chevron - Texaco .
Mr. Cabrera , an Ecuadorean geological engineer , recommended to an Ecuadorean judge last Tuesday that Chevron pay $ 8 billion to $ 16 billion for environmental damages if the company loses a bitterly contested case that started in 1993 with a lawsuit in New York courts , which ruled that the case should be tried in Ecuador .
The Ecuadorean case , which Chevron has repeatedly rejected as flawed , is one of the largest environmental suits against an oil company and could raise the political risks for multinationals extracting resources from similar remote and pristine regions .
" The litigation is terribly important , " says Professor Robert Benson , law professor emeritus at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
" If Chevron loses the case there , certainly a historic precedent will be set putting oil companies on notice . "
Plaintiffs call report a milestone
Texaco , bought by Chevron in 2001 , operated as a minority partner in an oil venture with Ecuador 's state - owned oil company , Petroecuador , from the 1970s to 1992 , when Petroecuador took full control of operations .
Chevron has long claimed that Petroecuador is responsible for the environmental damages .
Still , lawyers for the plaintiffs – who say Texaco dumped 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into unlined pits , rivers , and streams here – hailed Cabrera 's report as a milestone .
" We consider the report to be very positive , " says Pablo Fajardo , the plaintiff 's lead attorney .
" After three years of hugely expensive 'he said , she said ' environmental reports , this is a huge validation of the scope of contamination presented by the plaintiffs , " said Aaron Marr Page , a lawyer who has worked with the plaintiffs .
But Chevron , which has long maintained that the lawsuit lacks credible scientific evidence and that Texaco was released from liability by Ecuador 's government years ago after a $ 40 million remediation campaign , attacked the report and its author .
" We consider the report null and void because it is the result of irregular processes that do not conform with court orders , " Ricardo Reis Veiga , managing counsel for Chevron Latin America , said in a telephone interview .
Mr. Veiga said Chevron attorneys had been denied the chance to inspect the qualifications of the technical experts who helped Cabrera write the report .
He also said Cabrera overstepped his judicial mandate to simply confirm any petroleum - related environmental damage by assessing culpability and assigning monetary values – a job Chevron says rests with the judge .
In a statement last week , Chevron said it will ask the Supreme Court of Lago Agrio to dismiss the report .
Veiga also accused Cabrera of improperly collaborating with the plaintiffs , saying that the company has evidence , including videotapes , that his technical team received logistical support from a group called Amazon Defense Front , a civic group that backs the plaintiffs and that would receive and disburse a portion of any payments .
The lawsuit 's political tone
The lawsuit has taken on a political tone in both the US and Ecuador .
Ecuador 's leftist president Rafael Correa , who came to office in 2006 on a platform involving promises to renegotiate oil contracts in Ecuador 's favor , has said that the oil damage allegedly caused by Texaco is much greater than the 11 - million gallon Exxon Valdez spill off the Alaskan coast in 1989 .
In February , Sens. Barack Obama ( D ) of Illinois and Patrick Leahy ( D ) of Vermont sent a letter to US Trade Representative Rob Portman urging him to ignore an apparent campaign by Chevron to exclude Ecuador from trade negotiations until the Ecuadorean government shuts down the lawsuit .
" While we are not prejudging the outcome of the case , we do believe the 30,000 indigenous residents of Ecuador deserve their day in court , " the senators wrote .
It 's unclear what will happen in this increasingly bitter lawsuit .
What 's beyond dispute , however , is that the rain forest bears indelible ecological stains .
Streams in the area are topped with shimmering layers and pastures are covered with sludgy soil smelling of diesel .
Impoverished locals interviewed for this story are suffering illnesses that they blame on oil contamination .
Chevron has denied causal links between illnesses and Texaco 's operations .
Lawyers are increasingly going after US - based oil companies for alleged crimes committed overseas .
In 2005 , in Doe v. Unocal , the California - based oil company agreed to a settlement after being sued for collaborating with Burmese military personnel in the torture and murder of Burmese villagers .
A pending case , Bowoto v. Chevron , accuses Chevron of collaborating with Nigerian forces alleged to have killed indigenous oil opponents .
And the Peruvian Achuar people are suing Occidental Petroleum for alleged environmental and health damages left in Peru 's oil - rich northern Amazon .
That case , filed last year in California court , is also pending .
" The sheer scale of this damages assessment sends out a powerful message to the oil industry and to other extractive industries ; times have changed , " says Simeon Tegel , a spokesman for California - based group Amazon Watch , which is backing plaintiffs in the case .
" You can no longer expect to get away with using negligent environmental practices in the Amazon or anywhere else in the developing world and get away with it . "

Young relatives of newborn baby Amira Abu ‘ Aser mourn during her funeral in Gaza City , 5 March 2008 .
( Wissam Nassar / MaanImages )
“ I have just spoken with [ Israeli ] Prime Minister [ Ehud ]
Olmert to extend my deepest condolences to the victims , their families , and to the people of Israel , ” US President George W. Bush said .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon added his “ condemnation ” and “ condolences , ” as did EU High Representative Javier Solana .
The day before the Jerusalem attack , Amira Abu ‘ Aser was buried in Gaza .
She had lived just 20 days on this earth before being shot in the head by Israeli occupation forces who attacked the house of friends she and her family were visiting .
Needless to say , she had not been firing rockets at Sderot when she was killed .
One of the house ’s inhabitants was found the next day , shot dead and his head crushed by an army jeep , an apparent victim of an extrajudicial murder by Israeli forces .
But confirming their status in the eyes of the “ international community ” as less than complete human beings , neither Amira ’s killing , nor any of the dozens of Palestinian civilian victims of Israel ’s onslaught in Gaza have merited condemnation or condolences .
The fallacy that lies behind the differential concern for the lives of innocent Israelis and Palestinians is that the massacre in Jerusalem and the massacres in Gaza can be separated .
Israeli deaths are “ terrorism , ” while Palestinian deaths are merely an unfortunate consequence of the fight against “ terrorism . ”
But the two are intricately linked , and what happened in Jerusalem is a direct consequence of what Israel has been doing to the Palestinians for decades .
Let me be clear that the killing of civilians , Israeli or Palestinian , is wrong , repugnant , and cannot bring this one - hundred - year war caused by the Zionist colonization of Palestine to an end .
There will be an Israeli propaganda effort — as always — to present Palestinian violence as being simply motivated by hatred , and divorced from the context of brutal occupation that Palestinians live under .
What greater proof could you need than an attack on religious students , devoting their life to the study of the Torah ?
We cannot expect much analysis in the media of why the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva might have been chosen as a target .
Was it mere coincidence that the school , named for Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook , and led after his death by his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook , is the ideological cradle of the militant , Jewish supremacist settler movement Gush Emunim ?
Unlike other sects in Israel which sought exemption of their students from military service , Gush Emunim encouraged its followers to join the army and become the armed wing of religious nationalist Zionism .
Gush Emunim settlers , many of them , like Moshe Levinger , graduates of Mercaz HaRav , founded the most extreme and racist settlements in the Occupied West Bank , including the notorious colonies in and near Hebron whose inhabitants have made life miserable for Palestinians in the city and forced many of them out of their homes .
It is the militant settlers of Gush Emunim who still honor Baruch Goldstein who murdered 29 Palestinians in Hebron in February 1994 .
It is in Hebron that the Gush Emunim settlers spray “ Arabs to the gas chambers ” on Palestinian houses .
It is possible that the Mercaz HaRav gunman did not know or care about any of this , that any target he could identify as Israeli would have satisfied his desire to exact revenge .
In 2002 , Israeli army chief Moshe Yaalon declared that “ the Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people . ”
This would be achieved by the massive and constant application of force until they got the message .
The same philosophy was elaborated in 2004 by Professor Arnon Soffer , one of the architects , with former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon , of the 2005 Gaza “ disengagement . ”
Soffer , an avid supporter of turning Gaza into a hermetically - sealed pen for unwanted Palestinians , explained that if Palestinians fire a single rocket over the fence into Israel , “ we will fire 10 in response .
And women and children will be killed , and houses will be destroyed .
After the fifth such incident , Palestinian mothers wo n’t allow their husbands to shoot Qassams [ rockets ] , because they will know what ’s waiting for them . ”
Soffer predicted that in a few years ’ time , “ when 2.5 million people live in a closed - off Gaza , it ’s going to be a human catastrophe .
Those people will become even bigger animals than they are today , with the aid of an insane fundamentalist Islam . ”
With Palestinians closed in , “ The pressure at the border will be awful , ” Soffer predicted .
“ It ’s going to be a terrible war .
So , if we want to remain alive , we will have to kill and kill and kill .
All day , every day . ”
To be fair , Soffer did display a human side : “ The only thing that concerns me is how to ensure that the boys and men who are going to have to do the killing will be able to return home to their families and be normal human beings ” ( “ It ’s the demography , stupid , ” The Jerusalem Post , 21 May 2004 ) .
For decades Israel has been exercizing with ever - escalating brutality this deliberate strategy to crush through force and starvation a civilian population in rebellion against colonial rule .
To Israel ’s vexation , the Palestinians are not playing their part .
After sixty years of expulsions , massacres , assassinations of their leaders , colonization , torture , and mass imprisonment , the Palestinians have utterly failed to understand that they are a “ defeated people . ”
The vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank endure unprecedented oppression by the Israeli army and settlers without resorting to violence in response , but they maintain an inextinguishable determination to endure until they regain their rights .
If the methods the Palestinian resistance has sometimes used are reprehensible , they have also been typical for anti-colonial resistance movements throughout time , as William Polk shows in his book Violent Politics : A History of Insurgency , Terrorism and Guerilla War from the American Revolution to Iraq , and Robert Pape demonstrated through his study of suicide bombing in Dying to Win .
Is it not time for the rest of the world to step in and force Israel at last to understand the same thing , so that the senseless bloodshed can finally stop and all the people of the country — Israelis and Palestinians — can begin to imagine a future other than an endless parade of funerals ?

The prospect of slipping into a robotic exoskeleton that could enhance strength , keep the body active while recovering from an injury or even serve as a prosthetic limb has great appeal .
Unlike the svelt body armor donned by Iron Man , however , most exoskeletons to date have looked more like clunky spare parts cobbled together .
Japan's CYBERDYNE , Inc. is hoping to change that with a sleek , white exoskeleton now in the works that it says can augment the body 's own strength or do the work of ailing ( or missing ) limbs .
The company is confident enough in its new technology to have started construction on a new lab expected to mass - produce up to 500 robotic power suits ( think Star Wars storm trooper without the helmet ) annually , beginning in October , according to Japan 's Kyodo News Web site .
CYBERDYNE was launched in June 2004 to commercialize the cybernetic work of a group of researchers headed by Yoshiyuki Sankai a professor of system and information engineering at Japan 's University of Tsukuba .
Its newest product : the Robot Suit Hybrid Assistive Limb ( HAL ) exoskeleton , which the company created to help train doctors and physical therapists , assist disabled people , allow laborers to carry heavier loads , and aid in emergency rescues .
A prototype of the exoskeleton suit is designed for the small in stature , standing five feet , three inches ( 1.6 meters ) tall .
The suit weighs 50.7 pounds ( 23 kilograms ) and is powered by a 100 - volt AC battery ( that lasts up to five hours , depending upon how much energy the suit exerts ) .
By way of comparison , a lower - body exoskeleton developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab's Biomechatronics Group is powered by a 48 - volt battery pack and weighs about 26 pounds ( 11.8 kilograms ) .
CYBERDYNE ( which film buffs will recognize as the name of the company that built the ill - fated " Skynet " in the Terminator movies ) designed the HAL exoskeleton primarily to enhance the wearer 's existing physical capabilities 10 - fold .
The exoskeleton detects — via a sensor attached to the wearer 's skin — brain signals sent to muscles to get them moving .
The exoskeleton 's computer analyzes these signals to determine how it must move ( and with how much force ) to assist the wearer .
The company claims on its
Web site that the device can also operate autonomously ( based on data stored in its computer ) , which is key when used by people suffering spinal cord injuries or physical disabilities resulting from strokes or other disorders .
The HAL exoskeleton is currently only available in Japan , but the company says it has plans to eventually offer it in the European Union as well .
The company will rent ( no option to buy at this time ) the suits for about $ 1,300 per month ( including maintenance and upgrades ) , according to the company 's site , which also says that rental fees will vary :
Health care facilities and other businesses renting the suits will pay about three times as much as individuals .
The site does not explain why , and the company could not be reached for comment .
CYBERDYNE is not the only company developing exoskeleton technology .
The U.S. Army is in the very early stages of testing an aluminum exoskeleton created by Sarcos , a Salt Lake City robotics and medical device manufacturer ( and a division of defense contractor Raytheon ) , to improve soldiers ' strength and endurance .
The exoskeleton is made of a combination of sensors , actuators and controllers , and can help the wearer lift 200 pounds several hundred times without tiring , the company said Wednesday in a press release .
The company also claims the suit is agile enough to play soccer and climb stairs and ramps .
But there are still many kinks that must be worked out before HAL or any other exoskeleton become part of everyday life .
Exoskeletons work in parallel with human muscles , serving as an artificial system that helps the body overcome inertia and gravity , says Hugh Herr , principal investigator for M.I.T.'s Biomechatronics Group , which is developing a light , low - power exoskeleton that straps to a person 's waist , legs and feet .
Wearers ' feet go into boots attached to a series of metal tubes that run up a leg to a backpack .
The device transfers the backpack 's payload from the back of the wearer to the ground .
One of the difficulties in developing exoskeletons for health care is the diversity of medical needs they must meet .
" One might have knee and ankle problems , others might have elbow problems , " Herr says .
" How in the world do you build a wearable robot that accommodates a lot of people ? "
There are also concerns about the exoskeleton discouraging rehabilitation by doing all of the work of damaged limbs that might benefit from even limited use .
" If the orthotic does everything , " Herr says , " the muscle degrades , so you want the orthotic to do just the right amount of work . "
Power efficiency could also become an issue , given that the HAL moves thanks to a number of electric motors placed throughout the exoskeleton .
The problem with electrical power is that you have to recharge , says Ray Baughman , professor of chemistry and director of the University of Texas at Dallas 's NanoTech Institute .
Baughman and his colleagues have been developing substances that serve as artificial muscles ( by converting chemical energy into electrical energy ) that may someday be able to move prosthetic limbs and robot parts .
Their goal is to avoid the downtime inherent in motor - powered prosthetics that must be recharged .
Makes you appreciate Iron Man 's strength and agility all the more .

Its Significance
Fifty years ago , an exuberant American people knew little and cared less about economics .
They understood , however , the virtues of economic freedom , and this understanding was shared by the economists , who supplemented common sense with sharper tools of analysis .
At present , economics seems to be the number one American and world problem .
The newspapers are filled with complex discussions of the budget , wages and prices , foreign loans , and production .
Present - day economists greatly add to the confusion of the public .
The eminent Professor X says that his plan is the only cure for world economic evils ; the equally eminent Professor Y claims that this is nonsense — so whirls the merry - go - round .
However , one school of thought — the Keynesian — has succeeded in capturing the great majority of economists .
Keynesian economics — proudly proclaiming itself as " modern , " though with its roots deep in medieval and mercantilist thought — offers itself to the world as the panacea for our economic troubles .
Keynesians claim , with supreme confidence , that they have " discovered " what determines the volume of employment at any given time .
They assert that unemployment can be readily cured through governmental deficit spending , and that inflation can be checked by means of government tax surpluses .
With great intellectual arrogance , Keynesians brush aside all opposition as being " reactionary , " " old - fashioned , " etc .
They are extremely boastful of having gained the allegiance of all the young economists — a claim that has , unfortunately , a good deal of truth .
Keynesian thinking has flourished in the New Deal , in the statements of President Truman , his Council of Economic Advisers , Henry Wallace , labor unions , most of the press , all foreign governments and United Nations committees , and , to a surprising extent , among " enlightened businessmen " of the Committee for Economic Development variety .
Against this onslaught , many sincere liberal - minded citizens have been swayed by the Keynesians — particularly by their argument that the wide governmental intervention they advocate will " solve the problem of unemployment . "
The most dismaying aspect of the situation is that the Keynesian arguments have not been countered effectively by the liberal economists , who have generally been helpless in the tidal wave .
Liberal economists have confined their attacks to the political program of the Keynesians — they have not dealt adequately with the economic theory on which this program is based .
As a result , the Keynesians ' claim that their program will insure full employment has largely gone unchallenged .
The reason for this weakness on the part of liberal economists is understandable .
They were brought up on " neoclassical economics , " which is grounded on careful analysis of economic realities and based on the actions of individual units in the economic system .
The Keynesian theory is based on a model of the economic system — a model that drastically oversimplifies reality and yet is extremely complex because of its abstract and mathematical nature .
For this reason , liberal economists found themselves confused and bewildered by this " new " economics .
Since Keynesians were the only economists equipped to discuss their system , they were easily able to convince the younger economists and students of its superiority .
To launch a successful counterattack against the Keynesian invasion , therefore , requires more than righteous indignation toward the proposals for government action in the Keynesian program .
It requires a well - informed citizenry who thoroughly understand the Keynesian theory itself , with its numerous fallacies , unrealistic assumptions , and faulty concepts .
For this reason it will be necessary to tread a difficult path through a complex maze of technical jargon in order to examine the Keynesian model in some detail .
Another difficulty in the task of examining Keynesianism is the sharp difference of opinion between various branches of the movement .
All shades of Keynesians , however , agree in sharing a common attitude towards the function of the State , and all accept the Keynesian model as a basis for analyzing the economic situation .
All Keynesians conceive of the State as a great potential reservoir of benefits , ready to be tapped .
The prime concern for the Keynesian is to decide on economic policy — what should be the economic ends of the State and what means should the State adopt to achieve them ?
The State is , of course , always synonymous with " we " :
What should " we " do to insure full employment ?
is a favorite query .
( Whether the " we " refers to the " people " or to the Keynesians themselves is never quite made clear . )
In medieval and early modern times , the ancestors of the Keynesians who advocated similar policies also proclaimed that the State could do no wrong .
At that time , the king and his nobles were the rulers of the State .
Now we have the dubious privilege of periodically choosing our rulers from two sets of power - thirsty aspirants .
That makes it a " democracy . "
So , the rulers of the State , being " democratically elected " and therefore representing the " people , " are allegedly entitled to control the economic system and coerce , cajole , " influence , " and redistribute the wealth of their reluctant subjects .
A recent important illustration of Keynesian political thinking was the Truman message vetoing income tax reduction .
The main reason for the veto was that high taxes are necessary to " check inflation , " since a " boom " period calls for a budget surplus to " drain off excess purchasing power . "
Superficially , this argument seems convincing , and it is supported by almost all economists , including many non-Keynesian conservatives .
They are all very proud of the fact that they are opposing the " politically easy " route of reducing taxes in the interests of scientific truth , national welfare , and the " fight against inflation . "
It is necessary , however , to analyze the problem more closely .
What is the essence of inflation ?
It consists of rising prices — some prices rising more rapidly than others .
What is a price ?
It is a sum of money ( general purchasing power ) paid voluntarily by one individual to another in exchange for a definite service rendered by the second individual to the first .
This service may be in the form of a tangible commodity or an intangible benefit .
On the other hand , what is a tax ?
A tax is the coercive expropriation of the property of an individual by the rulers of the State .
The rulers use this property for whatever purposes they desire — usually the rulers will distribute it in such a manner as to insure their continuance in office , i.e. , by subsidizing favored groups .
In addition , the rulers decide which individuals will pay the taxes — the decision consisting of expropriating the property of groups disliked by the rulers .
A price , therefore , is a free act of voluntary exchange between two individuals , both of whom benefit by the exchange ( else the exchange would not be made ! ) .
A tax is a compulsory act of expropriation , with no benefit accruing to the individual ( unless he happens to be on the receiving end of property expropriated by the State from someone else ) .
In the light of this distinction , advocating high taxes to prevent high prices is similar to a highway robber assuring the victim that his robbery is checking inflation , since the robber does n't intend on spending the money for quite some time or that the robber might use it to repay his own debts .
When will the American people wake up to the realization that robbery only benefits the robber , and that the edict " thou shalt not steal " applies to rulers ( and Keynesians ) as well as to anybody else ?
The Model Explained
The Keynesian theory ( or model ) highly oversimplifies the real world by dealing with a few large aggregates , lumping together the activity of all individuals in a nation .
The basic concept used is aggregate national income , which is defined as equal to the money value of the national output of goods and services during a given time period .
It is also equal to the aggregate of income received by individuals during the period ( including undistributed corporate profits ) .
Now , the fundamental equation of the Keynesian system is aggregate income = aggregate expenditures .
The only way any individual can receive any money income is for some other individual to spend an equal sum .
Conversely , every act of expenditure by an individual results in an equivalent money income for someone else .
This is obviously , and always , true .
Mr. Smith spends one dollar in Mr. Jones 's grocery — this act results in one dollar of income for Mr. Jones .
Mr. Smith receives his annual income as a result of an act of expenditure by the XYZ Company ; the XYZ Company receives its annual income as a result of expenditures made by all its customers , etc .
In every case , expenditures , and only expenditures , can create money income .
Aggregate expenditures are classified into two basic types : ( 1 ) final expenditure for goods and services that have been produced during the period equals consumption , and ( 2 ) expenditure on the means of production of these goods equals investment .
Thus , money income is created by decisions to spend , consisting of consumption decisions and investment decisions .
Now , an individual , upon receiving his income , divides it between consumption and saving .
Saving , in the Keynesian system , is defined simply as not spending on consumption .
A fundamental Keynesian tenet is that , for any particular level of aggregate income , there is a certain definite , predictable amount that will be consumed and a definite amount that will be saved .
This relationship between aggregate income and consumption is considered to be stable , fixed by the habits of consumers .
In the mathematical Keynesian jargon , aggregate consumption ( and therefore aggregate savings ) is a stable , passive function of income ( the famous consumption function ) .
For example , we shall use the consumption function : consumption = 90 percent of income .
( This is a highly simplified function , but it serves to illustrate the basic principles of the Keynesian model . )
In this case , the savings function would be savings = 10 percent of income .
Consumption expenditures are , therefore , passively determined by the level of national income .
Investment expenditures , however , are , according to the Keynesians , effected independently of the national income .
At this stage , what determines investment is not important — the crucial point is that it is determined independently of the income level .
We have left out two factors that also determine the level of expenditures .
If exports are greater than imports , the total amount of expenditures in a country is increased , hence national income increases .
Also , a government budget deficit increases aggregate expenditures and income ( provided that other types of expenditure can be assumed to be constant ) .
Setting aside the foreign trade problem , it is obvious that government deficits or surpluses are , like investment , decided independently of the level of national income .
Thus , income = independent expenditures ( private investment + government deficit ) + passive consumption expenditures .
Using our illustrative consumption function , income = independent expenditures + 90 percent of income .
Now , by simple arithmetic , income equals ten times independent expenditures .
For every increase in independent expenditures , there will be a ten - fold increase in income .
Similarly , a decrease in independent expenditures will lead to a ten - fold drop in income .
This " multiplier " effect on income will be achieved by any type of independent expenditure — whether private investment or government deficit .
Thus , in the Keynesian model , government deficits and private investment have the same economic effect .
Let us now examine in detail the process whereby an equilibrium income is determined in the Keynesian model .
The equilibrium level is the level at which national income tends to settle .
Let us assume that aggregate income = 100 , consumption = 90 , savings = 10 , and investment = 10 .
Also assume that there is no government deficit or surplus .
For the Keynesians , this situation is a position of equilibrium — income tends to remain at 100 .
A position of equilibrium is reached because both main groups in the economy — business firms and consumers — are satisfied .
Business firms , in the aggregate , pay out 100 .
Of this 100 , 10 is invested in capital and 90 is paid out while producing consumers ' goods .
Aggregate business firms expect this 90 to be returned to them through the sale of consumers ' goods .
The consumers fulfill the expectations of business firms by dividing the income of 100 into consuming 90 and saving 10 .
Thus , aggregate business firms are just satisfied with the situation , and aggregate consumers are satisfied because they are consuming 90 percent of their income and saving 10 percent .
Now , let independent expenditures increase to 20 , either because of an increase in private investment or because of a government deficit .
Now , income payments to consumers is 90 + 20 = 110 .
Consumers , receiving 110 , will wish to consume 90 percent of it , or 99 , and save 11 .
Now , business firms , who had expected a consumption of 90 , are pleasantly surprised to see consumers bidding up prices and reducing merchants ' stocks in an effort to consume 99 .
As a result , business firms expand their output of consumer goods to 99 and pay out 99 + 20 = 119 , expecting a return of 99 in consumption sales .
But again they are pleasantly surprised , since consumers will wish to spend 90 percent of 119 , or 107 .
This process of expansion continues until income is again equal to ten times investment — when consumption is again equal to 90 percent of income .
The point will be reached when income = 200 , investment = 20 , consumption = 180 , and saving = 20 .
It is important to notice that equilibrium was reached in both cases when aggregate investment = aggregate saving .
The above equilibrium process can be described in terms of saving and investment :
When investment is greater than saving , the economy expands and national income rises until aggregate saving equals aggregate investment .
Similarly , the economy contracts if investment is less than saving , until they are again equal .
Note that two very important things must remain constant in order that equilibrium be reached .
The consumption function ( and therefore the savings function ) is assumed to be constant throughout while the level of investment is constant at least until equilibrium is reached .
The question now arises : what is so important about aggregate money income that it should be the continual focus of attention ?
Before this question can be answered , it is necessary to make certain assumptions .
Assume that the following things be considered as given ( or constant ) : the existing state of all techniques , the existing efficiency , quantity , and distribution of all labor , the existing quantity and quality of all equipment , the existing distribution of national income , the existing structure of relative prices , the existing money wage rates (! ) , and the existing structure of consumer tastes , natural resources , and economic and political institutions .
Then , given these assumptions , for every level of national money income , there corresponds a unique , definite volume of employment .
The higher the national income , the greater will be the volume of employment , until a state of " full employment " is reached .
( We can define full employment as simply a very low level of unemployment . )
After the full - employment level is reached , a higher money income will represent only a rise in prices , with no rise in physical output ( real income ) and employment .
Summing up the above model , known as the Keynesian theory of underemployment equilibrium :
To each level of national income there corresponds a unique level of employment .
There is , therefore , a certain level of income to which corresponds a state of full employment , without a great rise in prices .
An income below this " full - employment " income will signify large - scale unemployment ; an income above will mean large price inflation .
The level of income , in a private enterprise system , is determined by the level of independent investment expenditures and consumption expenditures that are a passive function of the income level .
The resulting level of income will tend to settle at the point where aggregate investment equals aggregate saving .
Now ( and here is the grand Keynesian climax ) , there is no reason whatsoever to assume that this equilibrium level of income determined in the free market will coincide with the " full - employment " income level — it may be more or less .
This is the model of the private economy accepted by all Keynesians .
The State , assert the Keynesians , has the responsibility of keeping the economic system at the " full - employment " income level , since " we " cannot depend on the private economy to do so .
The Keynesian model furnishes the means by which the State can fulfill this task .
Since government deficits have the same effects on income as does private investment , all that the State must do is to estimate the expected equilibrium income level of the private economy .
If it is below the " full - employment " level , the State can engage in deficit spending until the desired income level is reached .
Similarly , if it is above the desired level , the State can engage in budget surpluses through high taxes .
The State , if it so desires , can also stimulate or discourage private investment or consumption via taxes and subsidies , or impose tariffs if it desires to create an export surplus .
The favorite Keynesian prescription for stimulating consumption is progressive income taxation , since the " rich " do most of the saving .
The favorite method of " encouraging private investment " is to subsidize " progressive " and " enlightened " industrialists as against " Tory big business . "
The Model Criticized
We remember that for the Keynesian model to be valid , the two basic determinants of income , namely , the consumption function and independent investment , must remain constant long enough for the equilibrium of income to be reached and maintained .
At the very least , it must be possible for these two variables to remain constant , even if they are not generally constant in actuality .
The core of the basic fallacy of the Keynesian system is , however , that it is impossible for these variables to remain constant for the required length of time .
We recall that when income = 100 , consumption = 90 , savings = 10 , and investment = 10 , the system is supposed to be in equilibrium , because the aggregate expectations of business firms and the public are fulfilled .
In the aggregate , both groups are just satisfied with the situation , so that there is allegedly no tendency for the income level to change .
But aggregates are meaningful only in the world of arithmetic , not in the real world .
Business firms may receive in the aggregate just what they had expected ; but this does not mean that any single firm is necessarily in an equilibrium position .
Business firms do not make earnings in the aggregate .
Some firms may be making windfall profits , while others may be making unexpected losses .
Regardless of the fact that , in the aggregate , these profits and losses may cancel each other , and each firm will have to make its own adjustments to its own particular experience .
This adjustment will vary widely from firm to firm and industry to industry .
In this situation , the level of investment cannot remain at 10 , and the consumption function will not remain fixed , so that the level of income must change .
Nothing in the Keynesian system , however , can tell us how far or in what direction any of these variables will move .
Similarly , in the Keynesian theory of the adjustment process toward the level of equilibrium , if aggregate investment is greater than aggregate saving , the economy is supposed to expand toward the level of income where aggregate saving equals aggregate investment .
In the very process of expansion , however , the consumption ( and savings ) function cannot remain constant .
Windfall profits will be distributed unevenly ( and in an unknown fashion ) among the numerous business firms , thus leading to varying types of adjustments .
These adjustments may lead to an unknown increase in the volume of investment .
Also , under the impetus of expansion , new firms will enter the economic system , thus changing the level of investment .
In addition , as income expands , the distribution of income among individuals in the economic system necessarily changes .
It is an important fact , usually overlooked , that the Keynesian assumption of a rigid consumption function assumes a given distribution of income .
Therefore , the change in the distribution of income will cause change of unknown direction and magnitude in the consumption function .
Furthermore , the undoubted emergence of capital gains will change the consumption function .
Thus , since the basic Keynesian determinants of income — the consumption function and the level of investment — cannot remain constant , they cannot determine any equilibrium level of income , even approximately .
There is no point toward which income will move or at which it will tend to remain .
All we can say is that there will be a complex movement in the variables of an unknown direction and degree .
This failure of the Keynesian model is a direct result of misleading aggregative concepts .
Consumption is not just a function of income ; it depends , in a complex fashion , on the level of past income , expected future income , the phase of the business cycle , the length of the time period under discussion , on prices of commodities , on capital gains or losses , and on the cash balances of consumers .
Furthermore , the breakdown of the economic system into a few aggregates assumes that these aggregates are independent of each other , that they are determined independently and can change independently .
This overlooks the great amount of interdependence and interaction among the aggregates .
Thus , saving is not independent of investment ; most of it , particularly business saving , is made in anticipation of future investment .
Therefore , a change in the prospects for profitable investment will have a great influence on the savings function , and hence on the consumption function .
Similarly , investment is influenced by the level of income , by the expected course of future income , by anticipated consumption , and by the flow of savings .
For example , a fall in savings will mean a cut in the funds available for investment , thus restricting investment .
A further illustration of the fallacy of aggregates is the Keynesian assumption that the State can simply add or subtract its expenditures from that of the private economy .
This assumes that private investment decisions remain constant , unaffected by government deficits or surpluses .
There is no basis whatsoever for this assumption .
In addition , progressive income taxation , which is designed to encourage consumption , is assumed to have no effect on private investment .
This cannot be true , since , as we have already noted , a restriction of savings will reduce investment .
Thus , aggregative economics is a drastic misrepresentation of reality .
The aggregates are merely an arithmetic cloak over the real world , where multitudes of firms and individuals react and interact in a highly complex manner .
The alleged " basic determinants " of the Keynesian system are themselves determined by complex interactions within and between these aggregates .
Our analysis is confirmed by the fact that the Keynesians have been completely unsuccessful in their attempts to establish an actual , stable consumption function .
Statistics bear out the fact that the consumption function shifts considerably with the month of the year , the phase of the business cycle , and over the long run .
Consumer habits have definitely changed over the years .
In the short run , a change in family income will only lead to a change in consumption after a lag of a certain period of time .
In other cases , changes in consumption may be induced by expected changes in income ( e.g. , consumer credit ) .
This instability of the consumption function eliminates the possibility of any validity of the Keynesian model .
Still another fundamental fallacy in the Keynesian system is the assumed unique relation between income and employment .
This relation depends , as we have noted above , upon the assumption that techniques , the quantity and quality of equipment , and the efficiency and wage rate of labor are fixed .
This assumption leaves out factors of basic importance in economic life and can only be true over an extremely short period .
Keynesians , however , attempt to use this relation over long periods as a basis for predicting the volume of employment .
One direct result was the Keynesian fiasco of predicting eight million unemployed after the end of the war .
The most important device that insures the unique relation between income and employment is the assumption of constant money wage rates .
This means that in the Keynesian model , an increase in expenditures can only increase employment if money wage rates do not rise .
In other words , employment can only increase if real wage rates fall ( wage rates relative to prices and to profits ) .
Also , there cannot be an equilibrium level of large - scale unemployment in the Keynesian model unless money wage rates are rigid and are not free to fall .
This result is extremely interesting , since classical economists have always maintained that employment will only increase if real wage rates fall , and that large - scale unemployment can only persist if wage rates are prevented from falling by monopolistic interference in the labor market .
Both Keynesians and liberal economists recognize that money wage rates , particularly since the advent of the New Deal , are no longer free to fall due to monopolistic governmental and trade - union control of the labor market .
Keynesians would remedy this situation by deceiving unions into accepting lower real wage rates , while prices and profits rise via government deficit spending .
They propose to accomplish this feat by relying on trade - union ignorance , coupled with frequent appeals to a " sense of responsibility by the labor leadership . "
In these days when unions emit cries of anguish and threaten to strike at every sign of higher prices or larger profits , such an attitude is incredibly naive .
Far from having a sense of responsibility , the aim of most unions seems to be wage rates that increase rapidly and continuously , lower prices , and nonexistent profits .
It is evident that the liberal solution of reestablishing a freely competitive labor market through the elimination of union monopolies and governmental interference is an essential requisite for the rapid disappearance of unemployment as it arises in the economic system .
Keynesians , particularly those who are rabid partisans of the " liberal - labor movement " , attempt to refute this solution by contending that cuts in money wage rates would not 1ead to a reduction of unemployment .
They claim that wage - incomes would be reduced , thereby reducing consumer demand , and lowering prices , leaving real wage rates at their previous level .
This argument rests on a confusion between wage rates and wage incomes .
A reduction in money wage rates , particularly in industries where wage rates have been most rigid , will lead immediately to an increase in hours worked and the number of men employed .
( Of course , the amount of the increase will vary from industry to industry . )
In this way , the total payroll is increased , thus increasing wage incomes and consumer demand .
A fall in money wage rates will have an especially favorable employment effect in the construction and capital - goods industries .
It is just these industries that now have the strongest unions .
Furthermore , if wage incomes are reduced , then the incomes of entrepreneurs and others will be increased and total " purchasing power " in the community will not decline .
The " Mature Economy "
It is important to recall that Keynesianism was born and was able to capture its widespread following under the impetus of the Great Depression of the thirties , a depression unique in its length and severity , and , especially , in the persistence of large - scale unemployment .
It was its attempt to furnish an explanation for the events of the thirties that gained Keynesianism its popular following .
Using a model with assumptions that restrict its application to a very short period of time , and completely fallacious in its dependence on simple aggregates , all Keynesians confidently ordered government deficits as the cure .
In interpreting the significance of the Depression , however , Keynesians part company .
" Moderates " maintain that it was simply a severe depression in the familiar round of business cycles .
" Radical " Keynesians , headed by Professor Hansen of Harvard , assert that the thirties ushered in an era in the United States of " secular ( long - run ) stagnation . "
They claim that the American economy is now mature , that opportunities for investment and expansion are largely ended , so that the level of investment expenditures can be expected to remain at a permanently low level , at a level too low to ever provide full employment .
The cure for this situation , according to the Keynes - Hansenites , is a permanent government program of deficit expenditures on long - range projects , and heavy progressive income taxation to permanently increase consumption and discourage savings .
Where the Hansen stagnation thesis goes beyond the Keynesian model is in its attempt to explain the determinants of the level of investment .
Investment is supposed to be determined by the " extent of investment opportunities " that are , in turn , determined by ( 1 ) technological improvement , ( 2 ) the rate of population growth , and ( 3 ) the opening of new territory .
The Hansenites go on to draw a gloomy picture of private investment opportunities in the modern world .
The decade of the thirties was the first in American history with a decline in population growth , and there is no new territory to develop — the " frontier " is closed .
Consequently , we can rely only on technological progress to provide investment opportunities , opportunities that have to be much greater than in the past to " make up " for the unfavorable changes in the other two factors .
As for technological progress , that too is slowing down .
After all , the railroads have already been built and the automobile industry has reached maturity .
Whatever minor improvements there might be will probably be withheld by " reactionary monopolists , " etc .
Let us examine each of Hansen 's alleged determinants of investment .
The gloom concerning the lack of new lands to develop — the vanishing of the " frontier " — can be dispelled quickly .
The frontier disappeared in 1890 without appreciably affecting the rapid progress and prosperity of America ; obviously it can be no source of trouble now .
This is borne out by the fact that , since 1890 , investment per head in the older sections of America has been greater than in the recent frontier sections .
It is difficult to see how a decline in population growth can adversely affect investment .
Population growth does not provide an independent source of investment opportunity .
A fall in the rate of population growth can only affect investment adversely if
All the wants of existing consumers are completely satisfied .
In that case , population growth would be the only additional source of consumer demand .
This situation clearly does not exist ; there are an infinite number of unsatisfied wants .
The decline would lead to reduced consumer demand .
There is no reason why this should be the case .
Will not families use the money that they otherwise would have spent on their children for other types of expenditures ?
In particular , Hansen claims that the catastrophic drop in construction in the thirties was caused by the decline in population growth , which reduced the demand for new housing .
The relevant factor in this connection , however , is the rate of growth in the number of families ; this did not decline in the thirties .
Furthermore , Manhattan has had a declining total population ( not merely the rate of growth ) since 1911 , yet in the 1920s Manhattan had the biggest residential building boom in its history .
Finally , if our malady is underpopulation , why has no one suggested subsidizing immigration to cure unemployment ?
This would have the same effect as a rise in the rate of growth of population .
The fact that not even Hansen has suggested this solution is a final demonstration of the absurdity of the " population growth " argument .
The third factor , technological progress , is certainly an important one ; it is one of the main dynamic features of a free economy .
Technological progress , however , is a decidedly favorable factor .
It is proceeding now at a faster rate than ever before , with industries spending unprecedented sums on research and development of new techniques .
New industries loom on the horizon .
Certainly there is every reason to be exuberant rather than gloomy about the possibilities of technological progress .
So much for the threat of the mature economy .
We have seen that of the three alleged determinants of investment , only one is relevant , and its prospects are very favorable .
The Hansen mature - economy thesis is at least as worthless an explanation of economic reality as the rest of the Keynesian apparatus .
So ends our lengthy analysis of the most successful and pernicious hoax in the history of economic thought — Keynesianism .
All of Keynesian thinking is a tissue of distortions , fallacies , and drastically unrealistic assumptions .
The vicious political effects of the Keynesian program have only been briefly considered .
They are only too obvious : the rulers of the State engaging in direct robbery through " progressive " taxation , creating and spending new money in competition with individuals , directing investment , " influencing " consumption — the State all - powerful , the individual helpless and throttled under the yoke .
All this is in the name of " saving free enterprise " .
( Rare is the Keynesian who admits to being a socialist . )
This is the price we are asked to pay in order to put a completely fallacious theory into effect !
The problem of the explanation of the Great Depression , however , still remains .
It is a problem that needs thorough and careful investigation ; in this context , we can only indicate briefly what appear to be promising lines of inquiry .
Here are some of the facts : during the decade of the thirties , new investment fell sharply ( particularly in construction ) ; consumer expenditures rose ; tariffs were at a record high ; unemployment remained at an abnormally high level throughout the decade ; commodity prices fell ; wage rates rose ( particularly in construction ) ; income taxes rose greatly and became much more sharply progressive ; strikes and trade - union membership increased greatly , especially in the capital - goods industries .
There was also a huge growth of federal bureaucracy , burdensome " social legislation , " and the extremely hostile antibusiness attitude of the New Deal government .
These facts indicate that the Depression was not the result of an economy that had suddenly become " mature , " but of the policies of the New Deal .
A free economy cannot successfully function under the constant attacks of a coercive police power .
Investment is not decided according to some mystical " opportunity . "
It is determined by the prospects for profit and the prospects of keeping that profit .
Prospects for profit depend on costs being low in relation to expected prices , and the prospects for retaining the profit depend on the lowest possible level of taxation .
The effect of the New Deal was to drastically increase costs through building up a monopoly union movement , which led directly to increasing wage rates ( even when prices were low and falling ) and to lowered efficiency via " make - work , " slowdowns , strikes , seniority rules , etc .
Security of property was jeopardized by the continual onslaughts of the New Deal government , especially by the confiscatory taxation that dried up the needed flow of savings and left no incentive to invest productively the savings that remained .
These savings , instead , found their way into purchasing government bonds to finance all types of boondoggling projects .
Economic well - being , therefore , as well as the basic principles of morality and justice , lead to the same necessary political goal : the reestablishment of the security of private property from all forms of coercion , without which there can be no individual freedom and no lasting economic prosperity and progress .

Jim Johnson , the manager of Barack Obama ’s VP search committee resigned today amid controversy over the details of his personal mortgage loans from Countrywide .
In a statement Obama said , Jim did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice presidential nominee , so he has made a decision to step aside that I accept . ”
The Republicans have been hammering the Obama campaign hard for the past few days over Johnson , and although this story had not developed into the kind of mainstream scandal that they would have liked , I think the Obama campaign is n’t taking any chances with Johnson .
Obama talked about his selection process , and thanked Johnson , “ We have a very good selection process under way , and I am confident that it will produce a number of highly qualified candidates for me to choose from in the weeks ahead .
I remain grateful to Jim for his service and his efforts in this process . ”
Johnson was the former chairman of mortgage lender Fannie Mae , and he received help with loans from the CEO of Countrywide , which is currently under federal investigation for their role in the subprime mortgage crisis .

The Obama campaign had at first defended Johnson ’s loans as completely legal , but I think that they decided that it was n’t worth the controversy so Johnson stepped down .
What remains to be seen is how this will impact Obama ’s search for a running mate .
Neither of the other two committee members , Eric Holder and Caroline Kennedy , has any experience conducting this type of search .
Johnson brought all the experience as he previously vetted running mates for Walter Mondale and John Kerry .
Obama had originally said that Johnson ’s loans should n’t be an issue , because he was an unpaid volunteer , who was not assigned a role in a future administration , but I think that the campaign did not want to give McCain ammunition , and risk this blowing up into a major scandal .
It can be argued that they learned their lesson from Rev. Wright , and are n’t going to react slowly to potential trouble .
The Johnson problem was n’t big , but it could have grown , so why take the risk ?
Plus , the picture of insider deals while people are losing their homes , does not embody the change message that Obama is campaigning on .
Obama has taken the moral high ground in this campaign , so he must hold himself and his campaign to a stronger standard .
Johnson ’s loans might be legal , but those kinds of deals do not reflect the politics of change .
Determined to be an athlete while growing up in Herndon , Va. , George developed his upper body to the point where today his shoulders ripple out of his shirts , he can bench - press 220 pounds , and he can do dips ( forms of pull - ups on parallel bars ) with 100 pounds strapped to his back .
That sheer strength , as well as the pushing motion that is so ingrained in his joints  many competitors were n’t hurt until their teens or later  leaves George with an off - the - charts power - to - weight ratio that is crucial to acceleration .
Add to that the dexterity to hit his wheel rims at maximum power up to 140 times a minute during sprints , lungs strong enough to handle marathons on consecutive weekends and an eat - my - dust competitive verve , and George could soon dominate wheelchair racing .
“ He ’s doing everything right at the moment , ” said David Weir , 28 , one of George ’s top rivals from Britain and the winner of last month ’s London Marathon .
“ He ’s a very talented young athlete that ’s going to go far in his sport .
If it all comes together at once , he ’s going to be outstanding . ”
Image Georges strength  he can bench - press 220 pounds although he weighs 98 pounds  helps him power his wheelchair to 23 miles per hour .

George ’s stroke is honed with the help of sophisticated analysis .
At a recent training camp , slow - motion software mapped every split - second of the cycloid technique : the impact of gloved hand to rubber rim at about 2 o’clock on the wheel face ; the .083 seconds of contact during which hundreds of pounds of force push down ; the release of the hand at approximately 5:30 , just as the arms are almost stretched to maximum length ; the rising up to ready - to - push position with actions and breaths similar to a butterfly swimmer ’s ; and then impact all over again .
At full speed , powering the chair up to 23 miles per hour , it ’s the frenzied flutter only a hummingbird could appreciate .
Yet delicate it is not .
As George pointed at some of the statistics on a projector screen , he unwittingly advertised his sport ’s battle scars  his fingers were bruised purple , and the undersides of his elbows were streaked with burns .
“ If a doctor said a magic pill could probably let me walk again , I would n’t take it , ” said George , who has won three Chicago Marathons .
“ I ’ve worked very hard to be who I am . ”
George has held world records in the 100- , 400 - and 800 - meter distances , and swept the 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 races at the 2006 world championships .
He will compete in all four of those events in Beijing , as well as the 1,500 meters and the marathon , the sport ’s most prestigious races .
George also could have played guard for the United States wheelchair basketball team , but declined so he could concentrate on racing .

The W32 . Evol virus was discovered around July 2000 .
Its name is derived from a string found in the virus , but much more can be implied from the name .
Up until then , most of the viruses were using Polymorphic engines in order to hide themselves from Anti-Virus scanners .
The engine would encrypt the virus with a different key on every generation , and would generate a small , variant decryptor that would consist of different operations but remain functionally equivalent .
This technique was beginning to wear out as AV scanners would trace virus - decryption until it was decrypted in memory , visible and clear .
This article explores the features and functionality of the metamorphic engine of the Evol virus , the first virus to utilize a ' true ' metamorphic engine according to Symantec .

A U.S. government - funded medical information site that bills itself as the world 's largest database on reproductive health has quietly begun to block searches on the word " abortion , " concealing nearly 25,000 search results .
Called Popline , the search site is run by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland .
It 's funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development , or USAID , the federal office in charge of providing foreign aid , including health care funding , to developing nations .
The massive database indexes a broad range of reproductive health literature , including titles like " Previous abortion and the risk of low birth weight and preterm births , " and " Abortion in the United States : Incidence and access to services , 2005 . "
But on Thursday , a search on " abortion " was producing only the message " No records found by latest query . "
Stephen Goldstein , a spokesman for Johns Hopkins , said he was n't aware of the censorship , and could n't immediately comment .
Under a Reagan - era policy revived by President Bush in 2001 , USAID denies funding to non-governmental organizations that perform abortions , or that " actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations . "
A librarian at the University of California at San Francisco noticed the new censorship on Monday , while carrying out a routine research request on behalf of academics and researchers at the university .
The search term had functioned properly as of January .
Puzzled , she contacted the manager of the database , Johns Hopkins ' Debbie Dickson , who replied in an April 1st e-mail that the university had recently begun blocking the search term because the database received federal funding .
" We recently made all abortion terms stop words , " Dickson wrote in a note to Gloria Won , the UCSF medical center librarian making the inquiry .
" As a federally funded project , we decided this was best for now . "
There was no notice of the change on the site .
Dickson suggested other kinds of more obscure search strategies and alternative words to get around the keyword blocking .
" In addition to the terms you 're already using , you could try using
' Fertility Control , Postconception ' .
This is the broader term to our
' abortion ' terms and most records have both in the keyword fields , "
she wrote .
She also suggested using a euphemistic search strategy of " unwanted w/
2
pregnancy . "
But the workarounds do n't satisfy critics of the censorship .
" The main function of their site is keyword search , and if you use a phrase that contains the word ' abortion , ' it ignores it , " notes Melissa
Just , the library director at the cancer research institute and hospital named City of Hope in Duarte , California .
Just followed the conversation on a listserv and said she was outraged when she found out about the censorship incident .
" Even if you were trying to make an argument to someone that abortion is a bad idea for them – whether it's a health risk , or you 're concerned about their mental well being , you would n't be able to find articles about your claim , " she notes .
" It 's shutting off both the pro and the con access . "

I 'm not sure where I first heard that you could do a recursive lamdba in Ruby , but it 's been simmering on the back burner of my brain for a while .
I 've just never had a reason to use one , until now ...
I wanted to process the Rails request params , which is a hash of strings and hashes of strings and hashes of strings and hashes ... you get the idea .
The need was to strip all the accent marks from user input throughout the application .
Here 's what I came up with :
class ApplicationController < ActionController :: Base before_filter : strip_accents protected def strip_accents thunk = lambda do |key , value| case value when String then value .
remove_accents !
when Hash then value.each ( & thunk ) end end params.each ( & thunk ) end end
That 's all completely clear , right ?
The filter enumerates the top - level hash using the & / to_proc operator to coerce the lambda to a block for the #each method .
#each passes the key and value to the lambda , which either removes the accents from a string , or recursively enumerates the contents of a nested hash .
I think it 's totally cool that you can do this in Ruby .
Everyone thinks that Ruby is just an object - oriented language , but I like to think of it as the love - child of Smalltalk and LISP ( with Miss Perl as the nanny ) .
Interrogation Experts Call for Senate to Require Adherence to Army Field Manual
State of the Art
By Joe Navarro and David Irvine
John McCain , a former POW and a victim of torture himself , recently said that how we interrogate prisoners is a " defining issue " for America .
He 's right .
Congress will soon have the opportunity to resolve this vital issue by making the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation the single standard for all United States interrogations .
The Manual is , as McCain also noted , " humane yet effective . "
But the CIA and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell have reportedly been telling members of Congress that the Field Manual is essentially " Interrogation for Dummies . "
It may be fine for unsophisticated military recruits doing battlefield interviews , but it supposedly lacks the " advanced " techniques wielded by the wizards of the CIA .
The argument has variations – we cannot trust young soldiers with these sophisticated techniques , al Qaeda suspects are uniquely resistant supermen – but the message is basically the same : " We at the CIA are better at this -- more sophisticated , more experienced , more knowledgeable . "
Nonsense .
The fantasy of the super spies who can take clever shortcuts to obtaining vital information is just that – a fantasy .
As John McCain also said , " I would hope that we would understand , my friends , that life is not ' 24 ' and Jack Bauer . "
Each of us has decades of professional experience with interrogation and intelligence .
Between us we have interrogated enemy prisoners , written books on hunting terrorists for the FBI , and taught interrogation techniques for nearly two decades .
Let us set aside for a moment the issues of morality , the Constitution , the Geneva Conventions and even the propaganda bonanza our antagonists reap from stories about waterboarding and KGB techniques like sleep deprivation .
Speaking solely from the point of view of effectiveness , we agree with the U.S. general who told Senator McCain in Iraq that U.S. interrogators do n't need any techniques that go beyond the Field Manual .
The myth that brutal techniques are either necessary or effective is resilient .
But inhumane interrogation methods hurt rather than assist effective interrogations .
If a skilled interrogator approaches a detainee who has been abused , it is very hard to repair the damage .
The methods of the Field Manual are sometimes mocked as simplistic " rapport building . "
But they are in fact a battery of tried and true , refined techniques which use a variety of psychological ploys to obtain truthful , actionable information .
As intelligence professionals we do not want – or need – any other tools .
But these techniques do require skill and experience .
Slapping prisoners , waterboarding them , keeping them awake for days , making them crouch in awkward positions or stand for days without movement – none of these techniques requires much skill .
That is perhaps the ultimate irony of the CIA argument – it advances crude and brutal techniques as the state of the interrogation art when , in fact , the Field Manual techniques are both more effective and require more sophistication and skill .
What did John Kirakou , the CIA agent who appeared on 60 Minutes last month to extol the virtues of waterboarding , say to the CIA when they offered to train him in these techniques : no thanks .
And for that matter , if the CIA has a cadre of skilled , experienced interrogators , why did it want to start from scratch with Kirakou ?
Indeed , there is considerable evidence that the CIA had to scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and turned to individuals with no professional experience in the field .
The widely reported CIA process of " reverse engineering " the military training program designed to help U.S. personnel resist torture makes this painfully clear .
There is every indication that this was much more a case of " amateur hour " than " master spies " at work .
Given the crisis atmosphere of the day , it is all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence insider who said of the secret program to detain and interrogate al Qaeda suspects that " quality control went out the window . "
Will a prisoner sometimes surrender useful information under torture ?
Of course .
But this hardly ends the inquiry .
How much false information was provided as well ?
How much more information might have been gained by other , less brutal and more sophisticated techniques ?
Regrettably , there is much truth in the comment of a CIA officer who was quoted in the Washington Post recently : " [ T ] his kind of stuff just makes people feel better , even if it does n't work . "
The Field Manual is humane and effective – and both are important reasons for Congress to require the CIA to follow it .

Kwicks for jQuery ( v2.2.1 )
Welcome to the Kwicks for jQuery home page .
Kwicks is a plugin providing sexy sliding panels with an emphasis on navigational interaction .
Kwicks was originally a port of a MooTools effect ( of the same name ) , but has since evolved into a highly configurable and versatile UI component .
Please check out the examples to see it in action .
New in v2.2.1
This is a patch release with no API changes , and is aimed at fixing a rare and sporadic bug that causes styles to not initialize properly .
New in v2.2.0
Kwicks v2.2.0 is a substantial update that addresses several feature requests ( keep them coming ) !
Here are the main updates since the last release :
New events and a refactor of the existing events .
Important : the new events are awesome , but not compatible with earlier versions - be sure to read the new docs before updating !

The menu behavior has new options : delayMouseIn , delayMouseOut , selectOnClick , and deselectOnClick .
Getting Started
Dependencies
Source
Kwicks is available on GitHub .
You can download Kwicks 2.2.1 ( with examples ) here [ zip ] , or browse the source here .
Markup
Kwicks has pretty relaxed markup requirements :
A container element with two classes : kwicks and kwicks - horizontal|vertical ( depending on the orientation of this instance ) .
A single level of nested " panel " elements .
Unordered lists are a good semantic fit for most Kwicks use cases :
< ul class= ' kwicks kwicks - horizontal ' >
< li></li> < li></li> < li></li> < li></li> </ul >
However , as noted above , Kwicks does n't require that unordered lists be used .
For example , see the Anchor Markup example .
If you want one of the panels to be selected on initialization , simply add a kwicks - selected class to it .
The Code
Kwicks follows the usual jQuery plugin conventions :
// instantiate kwicks $ ( element ) .kwicks ( opts ) ; // invoke a method $ ( element ) .kwicks (' method - name ' [ , param ] ) ; // handle events $ ( element ) .on( ' event-name.kwicks ' , handler ) ;
Options
The following options may be specified when instantiating a new Kwicks instance : maxSize|minSize : ( Type : number|string )
The width or height of a fully expanded |collapsed panel .
If the value is a number , then the unit will be px .
If the value is a string , then the units must be specified ( px or % ) .
Examples : 400 , ' 250 px ' , ' 20 % '
Please note that % dimensions are calculated based on the remainder after spacing has been removed ( see the spacing option ) .
If isVertical is true , then minSize and maxSize refer to the height of the panel , otherwise they refer to the width .
Note that you may specify maxSize OR minSize , but not both .
Default : realistically , you 're going to want to set this , but if you do n't Kwicks will attempt to identify some reasonable behavior .
spacing : ( Type : number|string )
The distance separating each panel .
This option follows the same pattern as minSize and maxSize : if the value is a number , then the unit will be px .
If the value is a string , then the units must be specified ( px or % ) .
If the specified unit is % , then the spacing is a percentage of the container 's size .
Examples : 5 , ' 4px ' , ' 2 % '
Default : 5 duration : ( Type : number )
The number of milliseconds for the animation to run .
Default : 500 isVertical : ( Type : bool ) Indicates whether or not the panels should be arranged vertically .
Default : false easing : ( Type : string )
The name of the easing function to use for the animation .
Default : none autoResize : ( Type : bool ) Indicates whether or not Kwicks should automatically resize itself based on window resizes .
If this is disabled ( or a container resize occurs due to something other than a window resize ) , you may use the $ ( container ) . kwicks ( ' resize ' ) method to trigger the resize logic manually .
Default : true behavior : ( Type : string ) Indicates if / what out - of - the - box behavior should be enabled .
These are provided purely as a convenience for common interactions , so if one of these does n't satisfy your needs , please continue reading below on how to control Kwicks programmatically .
Default : none Possible values : ' menu '
By default , the menu behavior expands panels on mouseenter , selects panels on click , and reverts all panels to a default state when the mouse leaves the container .
This behavior exposes some additional menu - only options to customize these interactions : delayMouseIn : ( Type : number ) The number of milliseconds to wait before expanding a panel on mouseenter .
Default : 0 delayMouseOut : ( Type : number )
The number of milliseconds to wait before reverting panels to a default state when the mouse leaves the container .
Default : 0 selectOnClick : ( Type : bool )
Indicates whether or not panels should be selected on click .
Default : true deselectOnClick : ( Type : bool ) Indicates whether or not currently selected panels should be deselected on click .
Default : false
' slideshow '
By default , the slideshow behavior configures successively panels to automatically expand at a regular interval .
Additionally , mouseenter causes the progression to " pause " and the hovered panel to expand .
Once the mouse leaves , the slideshow behavior resumes .
This behavior exposes some additional slideshow - only options to customize these interactions : interval : ( Type : number )
The number of milliseconds to wait before expanding the next panel .
Default : 2500 interactive : ( Type : bool ) Indicates whether or not the mouse interactions described above should be enabled .
Default : true
Methods
Kwicks provides several API methods that may be used for programmatic control and inspection of the plugin .
expand Expands the panel with the specified index ( use - 1 to expand none ) .
$ ( container ) . kwicks ( ' expand ' , index ) ; Alternatively , the expand method may also be invoked directly on a panel ( rather than the container ) .
For example , $ ( container ) .children ( ) .eq ( 2) .kwicks ( ' expand ' ) ; ... performs the same action as ... $ ( container ) .kwicks ( ' expand ' , 2 ) ; Sometimes it 's useful to provide a slight delay before expanding a panel .
To support this , the expand method may be given a delay option ( specified in milliseconds ) : $ ( container ) . kwicks ( ' expand ' , 3 , { delay : 500 } ) ; expanded Returns the index of the currently expanded panel ( or - 1 if no panels are expanded ) .
var index = $ ( container ) . kwicks ( ' expanded ' ) ; select Selects the panel with the specified index ( use - 1 to select none ) .
Please note that most use cases will not require the use of select .
Calling select has the same effect as calling expand , except that select is stateful .
That is , once a panel has been selected , it will maintain that state even after other panels have been expanded .
When $ ( element ) . kwicks ( ' expand ' , - 1 ) ; is invoked , the currently selected panel will be expanded , if it exists .
$ ( container ) .kwicks ( ' select ' , index ) ; Just like expand , select may also be invoked directly on a panel : $ ( panel ) .kwicks ( ' select ' ) ;
Note : if you want a panel to be automatically selected on initialization , simply add a kwicks - selected class to its markup .
selected Returns the index of the currently selected panel ( or - 1 if no panels are selected ) .
var index = $ ( container ) . kwicks ( ' selected ' ) ; resize Forces panel dimensions to be recalculated in response to a potential change in the container dimensions .
This can be useful if the autoResize option has been disabled , or if a container resize occurs due to something other than a window resize .
$ ( container ) .kwicks ( ' resize ' ) ; destroy Removes the kwicks functionality completely .
All classes , style attributes , and event handlers added by the kwicks plugin are reverted .
$ ( container ) .kwicks ( ' destroy ' ) ;
Class Names
Kwicks adds several different classes to the DOM elements that may be useful for styling purposes .
kwicks
If not already present , Kwicks will add this class to the container element .
kwicks-horizontal|kwicks-vertical
If not already present , Kwicks will add the appropriate orientation class to the container element .
kwicks - processed
This is intended purely for internal use , and is added to the container element once the plugin has been initialized .
kwicks - expanded
The currently expanded panel ( if there is one ) will be given this class .
kwicks - collapsed
Whenever a panel is expanded , all other panels are given this class .
kwicks - selected
The currently selected panel ( if there is one ) will be given this class .
Note that if you 'd like a panel to be selected on initialization , you may add this class to your markup .
Events
Certain Kwicks interactions trigger events that can be used to react to ( or cancel ) behavior .
expand.kwicks
Fired before a panel is expanded .
$ ( container ).on( ' expand.kwicks ' , function( e , data ) { // panel index ( or - 1 if we 're expanding none ) console.log(data.index ) ; // panel reference ( or null if we 're expanding none ) console.log(data.expanded ) ; // an array of all collapsed panels // ( will be empty if we 're expanding none ) console.log(data.collapsed ) ; // index of previously expanded panel ( - 1 if there was n't one ) console.log(data.oldIndex ) ; // reference to previously expanded panel // ( or null if there was n't one ) console.log(data.oldExpanded ) ; // boolean indicating whether or not a previous animation // is still running console.log(data.isAnimated ) ; // prevent the panel from expanding e.preventDefault ( ) ; } ) ; expand - complete.kwicks
Fired after a panel has been fully expanded ( but not if another expand has been triggered prior to the animation completing ) .
$ ( container ) .on(' expand-complete.kwicks ' , function( e , data ) { // data contains same properties as the `expand .
kwicks` event } ) ; select.
kwicks
Fired before a panel is selected .
$ ( container ).on(' select.kwicks ' , function( e , data ) { // panel index ( or - 1 if we 're selecting none ) console.log(data.index ) ; // panel reference ( or null if we 're selecting none ) console.log(data.selected ) ; // an array of all unselected panels // ( will be all panels if we 're selecting none ) console.log(data.unselected ) ; // index of previously selected panel ( - 1 if there was n't one ) console.log(data.oldIndex ) ; // reference to previously selected panel // ( or null if there was n't one ) console.log(data.oldSelected ) ; // prevent the panel from being selected e.preventDefault ( ) ; } ) ;
Browser Support
Kwicks is supported in the following browsers :
Chrome 12 +
FF 3.6 +
IE7 +
Opera 11 +
Safari 5 +
Special Considerations
Important styling information :
Please note that in order to provide the smoothest possible animations , the following style changes are made by the script :
The Kwicks container is converted to relative positioning .
All panels are converted to absolute positioning .
To keep things as " jitter free " as possible , panel styles are set by overriding the whole style attribute , which currently causes any previously specified inline styles to be lost .
Make sure any styles you want to keep are set externally with a selector , rather than inline .
attribute , which currently causes any previously specified inline styles to be lost .
Make sure any styles you want to keep are set externally with a selector , rather than inline .
Margins on the panels are stripped , but the spacing option is respected through the absolute positioning .
Even though the panels ' margins are stripped , in order for them to look correct in non-JS enabled browsers , they should still be given margins that correspond to the spacing option ( if any ) .
I strongly recommend that you look at the CSS in the examples .
Bugs , feature requests , etc :
Anything pertaining to bugs and / or the development of Kwicks can be dicussed on the GitHub issue queue .

File this under : " we now know why McCain is ignoring Michelle Malkin . "
A new Dunkin Donuts ad featuring Rachel Ray sporting a tattered white scarf has the wingnuts in a tizzy , with Michelle Malkin leading the charge .
You have to be deranged to see this ad and come to the conclusion that Rachel Ray is a secret Yasser Arafat - loving , terrorist - sympathizing threat who must be stopped for the sake of civilization .
Take a glimpse with me into the warped mind of a lunatic fringer :
Michelle Malkin -
Of donuts and dumb celebrities :
Is Ray ’s blunder worth boycotting DD over ?
I ’ll be interested to hear the company ’s take .
At this point , I ’m going to give the management the benefit of the doubt .
They have braved boycott threats and attacks over their lonely , principled stance against illegal immigration .
Given their pro-rule of law , America first position , I highly doubt the executive offices are filled with moonbats who endorse Ray ’s keffiyeh chic .
Charles Johnson @ Little Green Footballs - Mainstreaming Terrorism to Sell Donuts :
I did n’t believe this story when people first started emailing about it ; but sure enough , its true .
Dunkin Donuts , the venerable old fried dough seller , is the latest American firm to casually promote the symbol of Palestinian terrorism and the intifada , the kaffiyeh , via Rachael Ray : Dunkin ’ Breakfast Choices .
Pam Geller , when shes not demanding Obama be drug tested ( seriously ) - Rachel Ray , Dunkin Donuts Jihad Tool :
Have you seen Rachel Ray wearing the icon of Yasser Arfatbastard and the bloody Islamic jihad .
This is part of the cultural jihad .
John McCain may have terrible judgment when it comes to war and lobbyists , but he 's got Malkin figured out just right .
Update : Atrios :
I was a dirty f*&king hippie after all , booted out of the party by Peter Beinart ( excuse link to freeperville , only place I could find it ) , called a crazed , ignorant ideological cannibal by Jon Chait , and witnessed how our mainstream media though it cute and funny that French Fries were renamed " Freedom Fries " in the House cafeteria and giggled as people destroyed their Dixie Chicks CDs .
So , yes , I can imagine that I was a bit sensitive about such things at times .
But , you see , their side ran the f*&king world then .
And , mostly , they still do .
It 's why I gaze with fascination at their continuing attempts to maintain cultural purity .
How about taking responsibility for the mess you created , instead ?

Kevin Federline Works on New Song ' Daddy's Home '
partied the night away at a mansion on South Beach in Miami on Friday .
Although Kevin only drank water he reportedly danced the night away .
He is the father of young sons Sean Preston and Jayden James .
Kevin arrived with a party of ten and stayed until 4 a.m.
Sources at the party said K - Fed was in great spirits and talked about a new song that he has been working very hard on called Daddy 's Home .
It sounds like he is taking his time to get it just right before releasing it to the world .
Federline has been on the straight and narrow while in the middle of a custody battle with ex-wife Britney Spears .
Word has it he was n't hot for any specific female at the party and was good natured about being photographed with anyone who asked .
Way to keep it real K - Fed .

Riots in Haiti over explosive rises in food costs have claimed the lives of six people .
There have also been food riots world - wide in Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Cote d'Ivorie , Egypt , Guinea , Mauritania , Mexico , Morocco , Senegal , Uzbekistan and Yemen .
The Economist , which calls the current crisis the silent tsunami , reports that last year wheat prices rose 77 % and rice 16 % , but since January rice prices have risen 141 % .
The reasons include rising fuel costs , weather problems , increased demand in China and India , as well as the push to create biofuels from cereal crops .
Hermite Joseph , a mother working in the markets of Port au Prince , told journalist Nick Whalen that her two kids are " like toothpicks " they ' re not getting enough nourishment .
Before , if you had a dollar twenty - five cents , you could buy vegetables , some rice , 10 cents of charcoal and a little cooking oil .
Right now , a little can of rice alone costs 65 cents , and is not good rice at all .
Oil is 25 cents .
Charcoal is 25 cents .
With a dollar twenty - five , you can't even make a plate of rice for one child . "
The St. Claire 's Church Food program , in the Tiplas Kazo neighborhood of Port au Prince , serves 1000 free meals a day , almost all to hungry children -- five times a week in partnership with the What If Foundation .
Children from Cite Soleil have been known to walk the five miles to the church for a meal .
The cost of rice , beans , vegetables , a little meat , spices , cooking oil , propane for the stoves , have gone up dramatically .
Because of the rise in the cost of food , the portions are now smaller .
But hunger is on the rise and more and more children come for the free meal .
Hungry adults used to be allowed to eat the leftovers once all the children were fed , but now there are few leftovers .
The New York Times lectured Haiti on April 18 that " Haiti , its agriculture industry in shambles , needs to better feed itself . "
Unfortunately , the article did not talk at all about one of the main causes of the shortages -- the fact that the U.S. and other international financial bodies destroyed Haitian rice farmers to create a major market for the heavily subsidized rice from U.S. farmers .
This is not the only cause of hunger in Haiti and other poor countries , but it is a major force .
Thirty years ago , Haiti raised nearly all the rice it needed .
What happened ?
In 1986 , after the expulsion of Haitian dictator Jean Claude " Baby Doc " Duvalier the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loaned Haiti $ 24.6 million in desperately needed funds ( Baby Doc had raided the treasury on the way out ) .
But , in order to get the IMF loan , Haiti was required to reduce tariff protections for their Haitian rice and other agricultural products and some industries to open up the country 's markets to competition from outside countries .
The U.S. has by far the largest voice in decisions of the IMF .
Doctor Paul Farmer was in Haiti then and saw what happened .
" Within less than two years , it became impossible for Haitian farmers to compete with what they called ' Miami rice . '
The whole local rice market in Haiti fell apart as cheap , U.S. subsidized rice , some of it in the form of ' food aid , ' flooded the market .
There was violence , ' rice wars , ' and lives were lost . "
" American rice invaded the country , " recalled Charles Suffrard , a leading rice grower in Haiti in an interview with the Washington Post in 2000 .
By 1987 and 1988 , there was so much rice coming into the country that many stopped working the land .
Fr. Gerard Jean - Juste , a Haitian priest who has been the pastor at St. Claire and an outspoken human rights advocate , agrees .
" In the 1980s , imported rice poured into Haiti , below the cost of what our farmers could produce it .
Farmers lost their businesses .
People from the countryside started losing their jobs and moving to the cities .
After a few years of cheap imported rice , local production went way down . "
Still the international business community was not satisfied .
In 1994 , as a condition for U.S. assistance in returning to Haiti to resume his elected Presidency , Jean - Bertrand Aristide was forced by the U.S. , the IMF , and the World Bank to open up the markets in Haiti even more .
But , Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , what reason could the U.S. have in destroying the rice market of this tiny country ?
Haiti is definitely poor .
The U.S. Agency for International Development reports the annual per capita income is less than $ 400 .
The United Nations reports life expectancy in Haiti is 59 , while in the US it is 78 .
Over 78 % of Haitians live on less than $ 2 a day , more than half live on less than $ 1 a day .
Yet Haiti has become one of the very top importers of rice from the U.S. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 2008 numbers show Haiti is the third largest importer of US rice - at over 240,000 metric tons of rice .
( One metric ton is 2200 pounds ) .
Rice is a heavily subsidized business in the U.S. Rice subsidies in the U.S. totaled $ 11 billion from 1995 to 2006 .
One producer alone , Riceland Foods Inc of Stuttgart Arkansas , received over $ 500 million dollars in rice subsidies between 1995 and 2006 .
The Cato Institute recently reported that rice is one of the most heavily supported commodities in the U.S. -- with three different subsidies together averaging over $ 1 billion a year since 1998 and projected to average over $ 700 million a year through 2015 .
The result ?
" Tens of millions of rice farmers in poor countries find it hard to lift their families out of poverty because of the lower , more volatile prices caused by the interventionist policies of other countries . "
In addition to three different subsidies for rice farmers in the U.S. , there are also direct tariff barriers of 3 to 24 percent , reports Daniel Griswold of the Cato Institute -- the exact same type of protections , though much higher , that the U.S. and the IMF required Haiti to eliminate in the 1980s and 1990s .
U.S. protection for rice farmers goes even further .
A 2006 story in the Washington Post found that the federal government has paid at least $ 1.3 billion in subsidies for rice and other crops since 2000 to individuals who do no farming at all ; including $ 490,000 to a Houston surgeon who owned land near Houston that once grew rice .
And it is not only the Haitian rice farmers who have been hurt .
Paul Farmer saw it happen to the sugar growers as well .
" Haiti , once the world 's largest exporter of sugar and other tropical produce to Europe , began importing even sugar -- from U.S. controlled sugar production in the Dominican Republic and Florida .
It was terrible to see Haitian farmers put out of work .
All this sped up the downward spiral that led to this month 's food riots . "
After the riots and protests , President Rene Preval of Haiti agreed to reduce the price of rice , which was selling for $ 51 for a 110 pound bag , to $ 43 dollars for the next month .
No one thinks a one month fix will do anything but delay the severe hunger pains a few weeks .
Haiti is far from alone in this crisis .
The Economist reports a billion people worldwide live on $ 1 a day .
The US - backed Voice of America reports about 850 million people were suffering from hunger worldwide before the latest round of price increases .
Thirty three countries are at risk of social upheaval because of rising food prices , World Bank President Robert Zoellick told the Wall Street Journal .
When countries have many people who spend half to three - quarters of their daily income on food , " there is no margin of survival . "
In the U.S. , people are feeling the world - wide problems at the gas pump and in the grocery .
Middle class people may cut back on extra trips or on high price cuts of meat .
The number of people on food stamps in the US is at an all - time high .
But in poor countries , where malnutrition and hunger were widespread before the rise in prices , there is nothing to cut back on except eating .
That leads to hunger riots .
In the short term , the world community is sending bags of rice to Haiti .
Venezuela sent 350 tons of food .
The US just pledged $ 200 million extra for worldwide hunger relief .
The UN is committed to distributing more food .
What can be done in the medium term ?
The US provides much of the world 's food aid , but does it in such a way that only half of the dollars spent actually reach hungry people .
US law requires that food aid be purchased from US farmers , processed and bagged in the US and shipped on US vessels -- which cost 50 % of the money allocated .
A simple change in US law to allow some local purchase of commodities would feed many more people and support local farm markets .
In the long run , what is to be done ?
The President of Brazil , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who visited Haiti last week , said " Rich countries need to reduce farms subsidies and trade barriers to allow poor countries to generate income with food exports .
Either the world solves the unfair trade system , or every time there 's unrest like in Haiti , we adopt emergency measures and send a little bit of food to temporarily ease hunger . "
Citizens of the USA know very little about the role of their government in helping create the hunger problems in Haiti or other countries .
But there is much that individuals can do .
People can donate to help feed individual hungry people and participate with advocacy organizations like Bread for the World or Oxfam to help change the U.S. and global rules which favor the rich countries .
This advocacy can help countries have a better chance to feed themselves .
Meanwhile , Merisma Jean - Claudel , a young high school graduate in Port - au - Prince told journalist Wadner Pierre " ... people can't buy food .
Gasoline prices are going up .
It is very hard for us over here .
The cost of living is the biggest worry for us , no peace in stomach means no peace in the mind .
I wonder if others will be able to survive the days ahead because things are very , very hard . "
" On the ground , people are very hungry , " reported Fr. Jean - Juste .
" Our country must immediately open emergency canteens to feed the hungry until we can get them jobs .
For the long run , we need to invest in irrigation , transportation , and other assistance for our farmers and workers . "
In Port au Prince , some rice arrived in the last few days .
A school in Fr. Jean - Juste 's parish received several bags of rice .
They had raw rice for 1000 children , but the principal still had to come to Father Jean - Juste asking for help .
There was no money for charcoal , or oil .
Jervais Rodman , an unemployed carpenter with three children , stood in a long line Saturday in Port au Prince to get UN donated rice and beans .
When Rodman got the small bags , he told Ben Fox of the Associated Press , " The beans might last four days .
The rice will be gone as soon as I get home . "

Go directly to the latest news additions or to the chronological timeline of major credit crunch events
The list below is the largest collection of links related to the present credit crisis on the web .
I have been amending this list since May 2008 .
But , as the list is pretty large now , I have taken care to break it up into different sections .
Please use the Index to move around this post and find just what you are looking for .
I have also recently updated this list by backing it up to a database .
That has allowed me to provide all of the banking crisis events in a list in reverse chronological order at the new Banking Crisis Timeline .
I hope these lists are helpful .
If you need some quick background information on particular events or firms in the credit crisis , you ’ve come to the right place .
However , if you want a quick and dirty guide to the credit crisis , this list is not it — it is too all - encompassing .
But , I have just posted a shorter version of the credit crisis that should be more accessible and a quicker read .
It ’s called “ The Dummy ’s Guide to the US Banking Crisis ” .
In view of recent market turmoil , I have decided to provide a framework of the types of articles you should see here .
I need to note that this list does n’t include rumor , speculation or negotiations .
The list only includes actual events in the financial services sector after they have occurred and includes the following categories .
Writedowns of assets Capital raising Job cuts Bankruptcies Ratings changes Managerial changes Earnings reports Lawsuits Some significant stock price changes
Return to Index
There have been tremendous economic dislocations during the present banking crisis .
Initially written off as a sub - prime crisis , leading policy makers said the crisis was contained .
It has since spilled over into Jumbo mortgage rates , Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) , all asset backed securities , High Yield bonds , SIVs , the inter - bank market , commercial paper , money market funds , the auction rate market , hedge fund losses , and a massive housing bust and the real economy .
Banks and financial institutions from around the world are writing down billions of dollars of losses .
Housing markets are falling in the US , the UK , Spain and Ireland .
This crisis is truly global .
I decided to take a look to get a comprehensive view of what this is doing to our financial system .
Below is my list of major announcements of asset writedowns , bank failures , CEO dismissals , trading losses , capital raising and job losses at major global lending institutions as a direct result of the credit crisis of 2007 - 2008 .
In addition , I have included a number of pre-crisis merger announcements that served as prelude to an increased risk taking after the deals closed and leading up to the crisis .
This is not just a chronological listing of events and news in the housing bubble and credit crisis but also
a timeline of major crisis events and writedowns by financial institution .
I believe it to be the most comprehensive data set on writedown statistics on the web .
a running tally of credit writedowns by global banks ( now over $ 500 billion )
a look back at the increasing amounts of capital raised by global financial institutions
The list reaches far and wide and should give one pause as to the ability of the global financial system to recover from this calamity without significant recessionary effects in the real economy in the US and elsewhere .
The losses and needed capital continually rise , with investors willing to infuse these institutions with capital time and again .
This crisis has been consistently underestimated as it gathers steam .
It is far from a subprime crisis , but rather a debt or credit crisis because of the debt and deleveraging threatening global financial stability .
I update this list on a continuous basis .
Check back for additions or look for writedown news under the label ‘ writedowns . ’
I have also added a list of Bankrupt Global Financial Institutions .
I do expect this list to grow over time .

Elite universities are failing to recruit working - class students because IQ is , on average , determined by social class , according to an academic .
Bruce Charlton , a reader in evolutionary psychiatry at Newcastle University , claims that the greater proportion of students from higher social classes at highly selective universities is not a sign of admissions prejudice but rather the result of simple meritocracy .
Student union leaders responded angrily to his claim , which was also dismissed by a minister .
Charlton 's paper , reported today in Times Higher Education , says : " The UK government has spent a great deal of time and effort in asserting that universities , especially Oxford and Cambridge , are unfairly excluding people from low social - class backgrounds and privileging those from higher social classes .
" Evidence to support the allegation of systematic unfairness has never been presented .
Nevertheless , the accusation has been used to fuel a populist ' class war ' agenda .
Yet in all this debate a simple and vital fact has been missed : higher social classes have a significantly higher average IQ than lower social classes . "
He argues : " The highly unequal class distributions seen in elite universities compared with the general population are unlikely to be due to prejudice or corruption in the admissions process .
On the contrary , the observed pattern is a natural outcome of meritocracy .
Indeed , anything other than very unequal outcomes would need to be a consequence of non-merit - based selection methods . "
The National Union of Students described the paper as " wrong - headed , irresponsible and insulting " .
Gemma Tumelty , NUS president , said : " Of course , social inequality shapes people 's lives long before they leave school , but the higher education sector cannot be absolved of its responsibility to ensure that students from all social backgrounds are given the opportunity to fulfil their potential ... many talented individuals from poor backgrounds are currently not given the same opportunities as those from more privileged backgrounds .
This problem will not be addressed as long as academics such as Bruce Charlton are content to accept the status quo and do nothing to challenge the inherent class bias in education . "
Sally Hunt , of the University and College Union for acedemic staff , said : " It should come as little surprise that people who enjoy a more privileged upbringing have a better start in life .
However , research has shown that students from state schools outperform their independent contemporaries when they reach university . "
Bill Rammell , the higher education minister , told the Times Higher Education that Charlton 's arguments had a definite tone of " people should know their place " .
At least once a week in Vancouver , bug exterminator Mark Amery enters a private home , lifts a mattress and watches the box spring move with blood - sucking vermin .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
It 's an optical illusion caused by up to a thousand twitching bedbugs , each no larger than a lentil , which are infesting more houses , rental apartments and hotel rooms in Vancouver today than at any point in the city 's modern history .
" Four years ago we would get two calls a day for bedbugs in Vancouver , now we get 40 calls a day , " says Amery , whose growing company Vancouver Bed Bug Control Inc. has five exterminators working full time in the downtown core .
Infestations can vary from a few bugs to thousands , and they do not discriminate between the rich and poor ( " all they care about is blood , " says Amery ) .
He typically finds his customers sleep deprived , stressed to the point of tears , and peppered with itchy red bites and welts courtesy of Cimex lectularius , or the common bedbug .
Bedbugs survive for months on end without blood , they are prolific breeders , and can conceal themselves in the smallest and darkest crevices of a bedroom .
If a single apartment or condo unit is treated with pesticides , they will migrate through the walls and floors into the adjacent unit to feed on the blood of a new host , like tiny monsters in a low - budget horror movie .
They have been very successful in making southwestern B.C. home .
The provincial Ministry of Health reported a 600 per cent increase in cases between 2003 and 2005 alone .
And if the experience in Sydney , Australia is any guide , the 2010 Winter Games will cause the plague to expand even more dramatically .
" The presence of bedbugs continues to increase , " says Richard Taki , director of health protection at Vancouver Coastal Health .
" Everyone knows that [ eradication ] is not going to work with bedbugs .
All you can do now is try to control it . "
A world - wide pest boom
Bedbugs have tormented humans from the time our distant ancestors took to dwelling in caves ; they quickly learned it was far easier to feed on the blood of relatively hairless animals .
They 've been staking out human bedrooms ever since .
In the mid-20th century , the widespread use of DDT and various broad spectrum pesticides and insecticides caused the dramatic decline of the common bedbug -- at least in the more affluent countries of the world .
But since the ' 70s , the available toxic tools to control pests like bedbugs have dwindled , to the point that modern pest control companies often try to bait and selectively target different insect pests by species .
Some treat with steam , and a local B.C. pest control company even offers the services of two bedbug - sniffing dogs .
The result has been less nasty toxins sprayed in customer homes , but also more pests .
The last decade has seen a dramatic resurgence of bedbugs throughout the world , a phenomenon attributed largely to the increased mobility of global tourists .
Most bedbugs simply hitch a ride in suitcases or even on clothing .
In January of 2007 , British bedbug exterminator David Cane told the BBC that the 2000 Sydney Olympics was the single event most responsible for the global bedbug blight currently plaguing urban centres across Europe and North America .
" The explosion of the [ global bedbug ] population began around the time of the Sydney Games ... by the end of the games , about 98 per cent of the hotels in Sydney had at least one infected room , and because it was n't detected early enough , it spread to other rooms in the hotels , and people transmitted them from location to location . "
Closer to home , Amery predicts the coming Winter Olympics will continue in the unsavoury tradition of Sydney , helping expand the bedbug problem which finds its epicentre today in the downtown core of the city .
" Vancouver is a highly visited area , the turnover in hotels is huge , and with the Olympics coming , this problem is only going to get worse . "
As one might expect , most hotels in Vancouver , most of which rely on the loyalty of returning customers , are hesitant to even acknowledge the issue , and for good reason .
" Customers do n't take it kindly when they find themselves covered in bite marks and they 've got blood all over the sheets , " Mark Jarvis of extermination company Steritech told the Victoria Times Colonist last January .
His company , which offers " brand protection " services in addition to guaranteed bedbug treatment , was in Vancouver at the time to host a private seminar on bedbugs for Vancouver hotel executives .
Bedbugs infest Vancouver 's Downtown Eastside
Unlike other pests like cockroaches , bedbugs do not play favourites between the rich and poor : they can be found in the cheapest single room occupancy ( SRO ) hotel or the most lavish hotel room ( see traveller review ) or private estate .
This said , there are certain factors that have conspired to make the situation in the Downtown Eastside ( DTES ) especially dire .
Ann Livingston , co-executive program director of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users , a group that spearheaded a 2007 pilot project to treat three of the neighbourhood 's worst infested hotels , says the prevalence is easy to see .
" Hotel [ managers ] will often say ' we do n't have them , ' but the easiest way to see if a place has bedbugs is to stand outside on a hot summer day when people wear shorts and you can see all the bites .
The infestations in some of these places are just so severe , and the people so ill and unable to do anything .
Nobody knows what to do . "
Bedbugs are very difficult to control in SROs .
Because they are so adept at hiding , bedrooms must be completely dismantled , and a trained expert is needed to know where to look .
Even when a landlord is willing to get serious about treating blocks of rooms at a time , units can be difficult to access and properly treat , as many residents of the worst hotels suffer from mental illness and varying levels of addiction .
B.C. Housing , which oversees over 5,000 units of social housing in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland alone , has acknowledged the futility of trying to completely eradicate bedbugs from such environments , despite their ongoing efforts to treat rooms where the bugs are found .
The non-profit Lookout Emergency Aid Society , which is funded in part by B.C. Housing , states the following :
" ... Warmer weather has led to an infestation of bedbugs through the Lower Mainland , and particularly within the Downtown Eastside , " reads a March 2006 Lookout policy document found on the B.C. Housing website .
" Bedbugs are particularly difficult to prevent , thus management as well as prevention are key . "
Because government agencies across Vancouver and B.C. -- including B.C. Housing -- view the bedbug problem as strictly a pest - control issue ( there is no evidence that the bugs can carry disease like a mosquito carries West Nile ) , this means the residual health impacts of bedbugs are overlooked .
" The major challenge with bedbugs in the DTES is with immune - compromised people , " says lawyer David Eby of the Pivot Legal Society .
" For some people , the bites get inflamed and opened from itching , causing infection .
It 's indirect , but this becomes a health issue . "
From the core to elsewhere
Some of the bedbugs infesting the Lower Mainland are believed to have originated in the DTES , although confirming this fact is touchy at best .
" People occasionally go to the Downtown Eastside and do naughty things , " Vancouver 's then - chief medical health officer Dr. John Blatherwick told CBC News in June of 2007 .
" People take them back to their spouses and their spouses wonder where they got their bedbugs from . "
One particularly hard - hit neighbourhood has been the West End -- home to many hotels and densely - populated residential housing , supporting a revolving door of local renters and transient international students .
Exterminator Mark Amery , who is a regular visitor to the neighbourhood , explains why the problem is so bad there , and the psychological toll it can take .
" Let 's say three separate people in a same rental place find they have bedbugs , " he says .
" They panic and move immediately , moving all their beds , clothes , furniture into three separate new places in the same neighbourhood .
The bugs are in all their stuff , they spread to the new buildings , and they have to live through it all over again . "
The Bedbug Registry is a North American website where alleged bedbug victims can share horror stories and report outbreaks .
A report to the site in March of 2008 purported to explain what one Vancouver West Ender had to do to be rid of the bugs :
" Several months of ineffective bug - spraying .
Landlord does n't inform new tenants .
Bugs have spread to several apartments .
I managed to move out after one month stay ( and horror - filled sleepless nights ) .
Packed all my property in garbage bags and washed one by one in hot water for several times . "
The final word goes to another exhausted and bitter West End resident who provided the following warning :
" Bedbugs in building ....
For anyone thinking of coming to Vancouver for the Olympics , my advice is , ' STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL CITY !!!!' "

NEW YORK –
In last night ’s debate , presidential candidate Mitt Romney pointedly advocated the captivity of suspected terrorists at the infamous Guantánamo Bay detention center .
While disparaging the concept of providing counsel to accused suspects in U.S. custody – a core principle of our constitutional democracy - Romney suggested , in jest , that he “ presume[d ] ” the American Civil Liberties Union represented Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks .
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU :
“ Although the ACLU does not represent Mohammed , we are grateful to Governor Romney for recognizing our persistent fight on many fronts to restore the rule of law and combat the erosion of civil liberties that has plagued this country in the name of national security since September 11 .
Guantánamo is a shameful stain on our nation ’s values and reputation throughout the world , and we – along with respected leaders of all political persuasions and millions of Americans – will continue to call for it to be shut down once and for all . ”
DURHAM , North Carolina ( CNN ) --
An operation to remove a malignant tumor from Sen. Edward Kennedy 's brain was successful , and the Democrat should suffer no permanent damage from the procedure , his surgeon reported Monday .
Sen . Edward Kennedy , right , leaves a Boston hospital with his son Patrick on May 21 .

The patient himself expressed satisfaction .
" I feel like a million bucks , " Kennedy said after the surgery , according to a family spokesperson .
" I think I 'll do that again tomorrow . "
Kennedy 's doctor 's statement focused on the 3½ - hour operation , which was performed at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina .
" I am pleased to report that Sen . Kennedy 's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals , " Dr. Allan Friedman said in a written statement issued after the procedure .
" Sen . Kennedy was awake during the resection , and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery . "
Friedman called the resection " just the first step " in Kennedy 's treatment plan , which is to include radiation and chemotherapy , to be carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
Paging Dr. Gupta Blog : Mapping Ted Kennedy 's brain
The 76 - year - old Massachusetts senator , patriarch of one of the leading families of American politics , said in a written statement earlier that he expected to remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery .
He is also expected to undergo radiation and chemotherapy .
During such surgery , doctors locate the areas of the brain responsible for key attributes such as movement and speech , and map them to ensure they avoid cutting in those areas .
They then attempt to resect as much of the tumor as they believe they can safely remove .
Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta explain possible treatment »
During such operations -- which Friedman and the Duke hospital are known for -- surgeons typically ask a patient to identify objects in pictures or make a certain movement , such as squeezing a hand to make sure areas of the brain involving speech and movement are not being impaired .
Kennedy , a senator since 1962 , suffered a seizure May 17 while walking his dogs at his home in Hyannisport , Massachusetts .
Three days later , Kennedy 's doctors at Massachusetts General said preliminary results from a brain biopsy showed a tumor in the left parietal lobe was responsible for the seizure .
Friedman is chief of the division of neurosurgery and co-director of Duke 's Neuro - Oncology Program , according to the hospital 's Web site .
He is responsible for more than 90 percent of all tumor removals and biopsies conducted at Duke , the Web site says .
A tumor in the left parietal lobe could affect the senator 's ability to speak and understand speech as well as the strength on the right side of his body , said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta .

Gupta said such tumors do n't usually metastasize or spread to other parts of the body .
" What they do do -- and I think that 's a concern to people -- is that they grow , and sometimes they invade other normal parts of the brain .
That is the big concern here , " he said .
Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor , accounting for more than half of the 18,000 primary malignant brain tumors diagnosed each year in the United States , according to the National Cancer Institute .
An expert explains potential complications »
Kennedy is the brother of President John F. Kennedy , who was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 , and New York Sen.
Robert Kennedy , who was assassinated while seeking the White House in 1968 .
Though his own attempt to seek the presidency failed , Edward Kennedy has built a reputation as one of the most effective lawmakers in the Senate .
Kennedy 's Monday statement focused on the current presidential race as well his surgery .
" After completing treatment , I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect Barack Obama as our next president , " he said .
Obama , the front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , described Kennedy as a " giant " of the Senate when the tumor was diagnosed .
" I think you can argue that I would not be sitting here as a presidential candidate had it not been for some of the battles that Ted Kennedy has fought , " Obama said .
" He is somebody who battled for voting rights and civil rights when I was a child .
I stand on his shoulders . "
Obama 's rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , said Kennedy 's courage and resolve made him one of the greatest legislators in Senate history .
" He 's a fighter .
There is n't anybody like him who gets up and goes out and does battle on behalf of all of us every single day , " Clinton said .
" I know he 's a fighter when it comes to the challenges he 's facing right now . "
Sen .
John McCain , the presumed GOP presidential nominee , also offered his thoughts and prayers for Kennedy 's family .
" I have described Ted Kennedy as the last lion in the Senate .
And I have held that view because he remains the single most effective member of the Senate , " McCain said .
President Bush said in a statement he would keep the senator in his prayers .
" Laura and I are concerned to learn of our friend Sen. Kennedy 's diagnosis .
Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage , remarkable strength and powerful spirit .
Our thoughts are with Sen.
Kennedy and his family during this difficult period , " he said .
Kennedy had surgery in October to clear his carotid artery in hopes of preventing a stroke .
Until the seizure , the powerful Democrat appeared in fine health .
He suffers chronic back pain from injuries suffered in a 1964 plane crash .
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and correspondent Dan Lothian contributed to this report .

Security researchers have developed a new type of malicious rootkit software that hides itself in an obscure part of a computer 's microprocessor , hidden from current antivirus products .
Called a System Management Mode ( SMM ) rootkit , the software runs in a protected part of a computer 's memory that can be locked and rendered invisible to the operating system , but which can give attackers a picture of what 's happening in a computer 's memory .
The SMM rootkit comes with keylogging and communications software and could be used to steal sensitive information from a victim 's computer .
It was built by Shawn Embleton and Sherri Sparks , who run an Oviedo , Florida , security company called Clear Hat Consulting .
The proof - of - concept software will be demonstrated publicly for the first time at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas this August .
The rootkits used by cyber crooks today are sneaky programs designed to cover up their tracks while they run in order to avoid detection .
Rootkits hit the mainstream in late 2005 when Sony BMG Music used rootkit techniques to hide its copy protection software .
The music company was ultimately forced to recall millions of CDs amid the ensuing scandal .
In recent years , however , researchers have been looking at ways to run rootkits outside of the operating system , where they are much harder to detect .
For example , two years ago researcher Joanna Rutkowska introduced a rootkit called Blue Pill , which used AMD 's chip - level virtualization technology to hide itself .
She said the technology could eventually be used to create " 100 percent undetectable malware . "
" Rootkits are going more and more toward the hardware , " said Sparks , who wrote another rootkit three years ago called Shadow Walker .
" The deeper into the system you go , the more power you have and the harder it is to detect you . "
Blue Pill took advantage of new virtualization technologies that are now being added to microprocessors , but the SMM rootkit uses a feature that has been around for much longer and can be found in many more machines .
SMM dates back to Intel 's 386 processors , where it was added as a way to help hardware vendors fix bugs in their products using software .
The technology is also used to help manage the computer 's power management , taking it into sleep mode , for example .
In many ways , an SMM rootkit , running in a locked part of memory , would be more difficult to detect than Blue Pill , said John Heasman , director of research with NGS Software , a security consulting firm .
" An SMM rootkit has major ramifications for things like [ antivirus software products ] , " he said .
" They will be blind to it . "
Researchers have suspected for several years that malicious software could be written to run in SMM .
In 2006 , researcher Loic Duflot demonstrated how SMM malware would work .
" Duflot wrote a small SMM handler that compromised the security model of the OS , " Embleton said .
" We took the idea further by writing a more complex SMM handler that incorporated rootkit - like techniques . "
In addition to a debugger , Sparks and Embleton had to write driver code in hard - to - use assembly language to make their rootkit work .
" Debugging it was the hardest thing , " Sparks said .
Being divorced from the operating system makes the SMM rootkit stealthy , but it also means that hackers have to write this driver code expressly for the system they are attacking .
" I do n't see it as a widespread threat , because it 's very hardware - dependent , " Sparks said .
" You would see this in a targeted attack . "
But will it be 100 percent undetectable ?
Sparks says no .
" I 'm not saying it 's undetectable , but I do think it would be difficult to detect . "
She and Embleton will talk more about detection techniques during their Black Hat session , she said .
Brand new rootkits do n't come along every day , Heasman said .
" It will be one of the most interesting , if not the most interesting , at Black Hat this year , " he said .
ROME - First - century burial grounds near Rome 's main airport are yielding a rare look into how ancient longshoremen and other manual workers did backbreaking jobs , archeologists said yesterday .
The necropolis near the town of Ponte Galeria came to light last year when customs police noticed a clandestine dig by grave robbers seeking valuable ancient artifacts , Rome 's archeology office said .
The burial grounds spanned the late first century into the second century .
Most of the 300 skeletons unearthed were male , and many of them showed signs of years of heavy work : joint and tendon inflammation , compressed vertebrae , hernias , and spinal problems , archeologists said .
Sandy sediment helped preserve the remains well .
Judging by the condition of the skeletons , archeologists concluded that the men probably carried loads on their backs at a nearby port during the early years of Imperial Rome , said Gabriella Gatto , a spokeswoman for the archeology office .
Many ailments " seem to hark back to work as laborers , in transport and carrying of heavy loads , in an especially humid environment , circumstances that makes one think of the burial of individuals who worked in port areas of the city , " the office said in a statement .
Finding a necropolis near ancient Rome is not rare , but most have been the burial grounds of the privileged classes .
So the Ponte Galeria find is showing experts how the ancient lower class lived .
Also excavated was a skeleton of a man whose lower jaw was fused to his upper jaw .
Study indicated " how for all of his life this individual was fed , likely through the care of his family " with liquids or semisolids " introduced through a hole made through his teeth , " the archeology statement said .
The man lived into his 30s , a decent age at the time .
Specialists took that as evidence that the lower classes cared for the disabled .
Artifacts found in the necropolis were simple ones , including lanterns to guide the dead to their next life , Gatto said .
One ceramic - and - glass lantern was decorated with a grape harvest scene .
The dig yielded a glimpse into a working - class community that was " humble and marked by strong ties and solidarity among its members , " the statement said .
The construction materials they found reinforced the archeologists ' conclusion that the necropolis was used by the lower class .
The tombs consisted of graves covered with such everyday materials as wooden boards and roof - type tiling , the archeologists said .

This is the first in a series of posts in which I plan to examine one of the fundamental concepts in ecology - the species - area relationship
Species conservation has always been intimately linked with the idea of habitat conservation .
While habitat quality determines the amount of habitat required to protect a viable population of a given species , it ’s only a modifier - the determining factor is area .
Habitat quality can determine whether you need more or less area , but area is still the critical factor .
While protected areas can be set aside for specific species , more commonly protected areas seek to protect as many species as possible .
More land is likely to protect more species , but there are other factors that influence conservation decisions like the cost of land acquisition and the competing interests such as agriculture , mining or housing development .
One way to maximise the number of species in a protected area is to include as many habitat types as possible .
If you include a forest , a meadow , a marsh and a lake in your protected area , you are likely to get a lot more species than you would if you only had forest habitat .
The heterogeneity of the area increases the number of species .
( After all , you do n’t find a lot of fish in a pine forest , or field mice in a lake . )
But again , this overlays a simple factor of area .
A larger tract of forest will probably have more species than a smaller tract of forest .
A larger section of a marsh will probably have more species than a smaller section of marsh .
This fact , known as the species - area relationship is fundamental in both ecology and conservation biology .
The existence of a relationship between species richness and area is obvious to anyone who has taken the time to think about it , but it is still interesting enough that it has attracted the attention of generations of ecologists .
The fact that species richness increases with area is apparently to anyone who has taken a walk through a park .
If I step outside my door and count the number of bird species I see , the number of species will increase as my sample increase .
If my sample unit is “ number of birds ” ( i.e. , I sit on the front step and count birds ) I will be compiling a species - individual curve .
If my sample unit is area , I will be compiling a species - area curve .
Since individuals exist in space , these two relationships are closely related ( especially for things like plants , which are nice enough to stay put and wait for you to come and count them ) .
So lets say I start out from my door .
The first thing I will see are sparrow - lots of sparrows .
If I go north I am almost certain to see a robin on the lawn .
Go a little further and I will see starlings and cowbirds , maybe some grackles .
If I ’m lucky , I will see some scissortail flycatchers .
As my sample area increase , my species list can either stay the same , or increase .
The smallest sample area - within a few feet of my front door - will have one species of bird .
Increase that area to include the nearest patch of lawn , and I have two bird species .
Keep going and I will add a third and a fourth .
As long as I include everything I ’ve seen already ( what is called a nested species - area curve ) there ’s no way for my species list to decrease .
So we have deduced the existence of a species - area relationship .
Seems a bit too trivial to be science , does n’t it ?
Well , you ’re right .
There ’s much more to it than that , but it all builds on some extremely basic ideas .
But like any good idea in science , there ’s plenty of predictable behaviour , and then there are the things that are a bit more difficult to figure out .
In future posts I will look at some of these expected - and unexpected - behaviours , and how they helped make conservation biology into a scientific discipline .
Malawi ’s leaders have long favored fertilizer subsidies , but they reluctantly acceded to donor prescriptions , often shaped by foreign - aid fashions in Washington , that featured a faith in private markets and an antipathy to government intervention .
In the 1980s and again in the 1990s , the World Bank pushed Malawi to eliminate fertilizer subsidies entirely .
Its theory both times was that Malawi ’s farmers should shift to growing cash crops for export and use the foreign exchange earnings to import food , according to Jane Harrigan , an economist at the University of London .
In a withering evaluation of the World Bank ’s record on African agriculture , the bank ’s own internal watchdog concluded in October not only that the removal of subsidies had led to exorbitant fertilizer prices in African countries , but that the bank itself had often failed to recognize that improving Africa ’s declining soil quality was essential to lifting food production .
“ The donors took away the role of the government and the disasters mounted , ” said Jeffrey Sachs , a Columbia University economist who lobbied Britain and the World Bank on behalf of Malawi ’s fertilizer program and who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa ’s farmers .
Here in Malawi , deep fertilizer subsidies and lesser ones for seed , abetted by good rains , helped farmers produce record - breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 , according to government crop estimates .
Corn production leapt to 2.7 million metric tons in 2006 and 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005 , the government reported .
“ The rest of the world is fed because of the use of good seed and inorganic fertilizer , full stop , ” said Stephen Carr , who has lived in Malawi since 1989 , when he retired as the World Bank ’s principal agriculturalist in sub-Saharan Africa .
“ This technology has not been used in most of Africa .
The only way you can help farmers gain access to it is to give it away free or subsidize it heavily . ”
“ The government has taken the bull by the horns and done what farmers wanted , ” he said .
Some economists have questioned whether Malawi ’s 2007 bumper harvest should be credited to good rains or subsidies , but an independent evaluation , financed by the United States and Britain , found that the subsidy program accounted for a large share of this year ’s increase in corn production .
The Apologists ’ Arguments
Even though there is no contemporary extra-biblical documentation for the existence of Jesus , Christian apologists are far from ready to concede the battle .
Though there may not be eyewitness records , they claim , nevertheless the historical record does provide more than sufficient support for Christianity ’s picture of its own origins .
In analyzing the evidence , though , such claims do not stand up to scrutiny .
Though there are some later extra-biblical references to Jesus , the lack of first - hand evidence alone makes them all into hearsay .
In other words , historians who lived after the time of Jesus cannot provide any direct witness to his existence – they can only repeat what others have told them , without being able to verify it themselves .
Nevertheless , it will be instructive to consider the ancient historians most commonly cited in support of the historicity of Jesus .
While examining each of their following testimonies , there are three important criteria to keep in mind :
Who is this person ?
The first question to ask is , who is writing this – what is their background , their perspective , their religious affiliation ?
For obvious reasons , the testimony of some random person on the street who might just have been repeating popular rumors is worth less than the testimony of a known and respected historian whom we know was in the habit of carefully checking his sources .
Additionally , we must ask – was this person a church father , or otherwise a Christian ?
If so , their testimony must be considered less reliable , since it would likely be influenced by theological biases .
Some early Christians even believed that it was acceptable to conceal or fabricate evidence if it would further their religious aims , a doctrine sometimes known as “ pious fraud ” .
For example , Eusebius , a third - century bishop , openly stated that lying for the cause of Christianity was occasionally necessary .
See http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/NTcanon.html#6.
What did they write ?
The second question we must ask is , does this person actually testify to the existence of a historical Jesus , or are they just describing the things a new sect believed ?
( I could say , “ Mormons believe that the angel Moroni gave Joseph Smith the Book of Mormon engraved on golden tablets , ” but that does not mean I vouch for the occurrence of such an event . )
Do they mention Jesus by name , or do they merely attest to the fact that Christianity existed ?
Apologists sometimes produce historians who fall into the latter category , but no one doubts that Christianity was in existence during the second century .
To be of any value , the historian must not just say that Christians believe in the divinity of someone called Jesus ; they must bear their own witness to the fact that there actually was such a person who actually did the things he was claimed to have done .
When did they write it ?
The later a particular historian lived , the less weight their testimony must be given .
( Concurrent first - hand testimony would carry the most weight by far , but again , none exists . )
A historian who lived in the second century CE , one hundred years or more after the time Jesus was claimed to have lived , is in a poor position to verify any stories that may have developed about him , yet such people ’s writings make up the majority of evidence the apologists have to offer .
Since these historians cannot bear their own witness to the truth of the things they write , they must instead be relying on earlier sources , and it is those sources which should be cited whenever possible .
The Historians
Flavius Josephus
Of all the ancient historians claimed to bear witness to the existence of Jesus , Josephus is without a doubt the one cited most frequently by Christians .
He was a respected Jewish historian who worked for the Romans under the patronage of Emperor Vespasian ; born around 37 CE , he is also the closest to the time of Jesus of all the historians cited by apologists .
His two major surviving works are titled The Antiquities of the Jews , a detailed history of the Jewish people based largely on biblical records , and The Jewish War , a history of the disastrous Jewish revolt against the Roman occupation of Jerusalem around 70 CE .
Antiquities , book 18 , chapter 3 , contains the most infamous reference to Jesus to be found in the work of any historian .
Few passages have ignited as much debate as this one , the so - called Testimonium Flavianum , whose full text appears below :
“ Now there was about this time , Jesus , a wise man , if it be lawful to call him a man , for he was a doer of wonderful works – a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure .
He drew over to him both many of the Jews , and many of the Gentiles .
He was the Christ ; and when Pilate , at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us , had condemned him to the cross , those that loved him at first did not forsake him , for he appeared to them alive again the third day , as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him ; and the tribe of Christians , so named after him , are not extinct at this day . ”
To anyone unfamiliar with the debates swirling around this passage , it might appear to provide startling corroboration of the Gospel stories in virtually every detail .
In fact , it seems too fantastic to be true .
And indeed , this is the consensus of the overwhelming majority of critical scholars today .
No one argues other than that the Testimonium Flavianum is , at least in part , a forgery , a later interpolation into Josephus ’ work .
We can be certain of this for several reasons .
One is that the enthusiastic endorsement of Jesus ’ miracles could only have been written by a Christian , and Josephus was not a Christian .
He was an orthodox Jew and remained so his entire life .
The church father Origen , who quoted freely from Josephus , wrote that he was “ not believing in Jesus as the Christ ” .
Furthermore , in The Jewish War , Josephus specifically states his belief that the Roman emperor Vespasian was the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies – which is what got him his job in the first place .
So , imagine we remove the obvious Christian interpolations – phrases such as “ if it be lawful to call him a man ” , “ he was the Christ ” , and “ he appeared to them alive again the third day , as the divine prophets had foretold ” .
Could we let the rest remain , preserving a “ reduced ” Testimonium in which Josephus testifies to the simple existence of Jesus as a teacher and wise man without touting him as a messiah or a miracle - worker ?
This is the position taken by most Christian scholars today , but it too is flawed .
For one thing , even the “ reduced ” Testimonium still praises Jesus highly .
This is very unlikely .
Elsewhere Josephus does mention other self - proclaimed messiahs of the time , such as Judas of Galilee and Theudas the magician , but he has nothing but evil to say about them .
He scorns them as deceivers and deluders , labels them “ false prophets ” , “ impostors ” and “ cheats ” , blames them for wars and famines that afflicted the Jews , and more .
This is entirely understandable , since Josephus was writing under Roman patronage , and the Romans did not look highly on the self - proclaimed messiahs of the time since many of them preached about overturning the established order , i.e. , Roman rule .
( “ The meek shall inherit the earth ” would have fallen squarely into this category , as would “ I came not to send peace , but a sword . ” )
Some messiah claimants went even further by actively confronting the established authority and sowing dissent ( Jesus ’ expulsion of the money - changers from the temple comes to mind ) .
The Romans were prone to express their displeasure at these types of activities by executing the messiah claimants , several other examples of which Josephus does tell us about .
Had Josephus genuinely written about Jesus he would have been compelled to denounce him , not only because of his orthodox Jewish beliefs but because he had to stay in accord with Roman views or risk being imprisoned or worse .
It is all but impossible that he could have written even the “ reduced ” Testimonium .
There are other good reasons to believe this entire passage is a forgery ; namely , it does not fit with the context .
Book 18 , chapter 3 of Antiquities begins with an account of a massacre of Jews by Pilate in retaliation for their protests against his use of sacred money ; then comes the Testimonium , and then the next paragraph begins , “ And about the same time , another terrible misfortune confounded the Jews … ”
It is inconceivable that Josephus , an orthodox Jew , would have considered the death of Jesus to be a Jewish misfortune .
( Of course , it could be argued that the misfortune he was referring to was not the death of Jesus , but rather the founding of Christianity .
In that case , however , the question must again be asked , how can this be squared with the enthusiastic praise for Jesus found in even the “ reduced ” Testimonium ? )
On the other hand , if the passage is removed entirely , the preceding and succeeding paragraphs naturally fit together .
One final argument can be made against the authenticity of the Testimonium – it does not appear anywhere until the fourth century CE .
In the second century , the church father Origen defended Christianity against the attacks of the pagan Celsus ; he freely quotes from Josephus to support his points , but never once mentions the Testimonium , though it would seem to be the ultimate ace in the hole .
Modern apologists rationalize this by claiming that Origen was unaware of the existence of this passage , but this seems weak in light of the fact that he did demonstrate familiarity with Josephus ’ works , and even weaker when one understands they are asking us to believe that not a single apologist before the 300s happened to notice this paragraph or thought it worthy of mention .
The first Christian who quoted the Testimonium was Eusebius , in the fourth century ; some scholars believe that he was the one who forged it .
There is another brief passage in Josephus that mentions Jesus .
Antiquities , book 20 , chapter 9 , contains the following :
“ Festus was now dead , and Albinus was put upon the road ; so he [ Ananus , the Jewish high priest ] assembled the sanhedrin of judges , and brought before them the brother of Jesus , him called Christ , whose name was James , and some others .
And when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law , he delivered them to be stoned … . ”
This passage is not as obviously a forgery as the Testimonium Flavianum .
However , a more oblique line of attack is possible , which runs as follows :
Josephus was a Jewish historian , but he worked under the sponsorship of the Roman emperor Vespasian ; he was writing for a Roman audience .
A Roman audience would not have been familiar with the concepts of Jewish messianic expectation , and would not have known what the word “ Christ ” meant .
It would only have confused them if that idea had been thrown in without explanation – and yet , if we reject the Testimonium as the obvious forgery it is , this brief snippet is the only use of the term anywhere in any of Josephus ’ writings , provided without further elaboration .
Since it is highly unlikely that Josephus would have used this term without explaining what it meant , it is therefore probable that this phrase is an interpolation as well .
When we conclude this , several things fall into place .
One is the puzzling word order of this paragraph – why would Josephus have thought to mention Jesus first , when the passage is actually about someone else entirely ?
But it makes perfect sense that a Christian interpolator , consciously or unconsciously , would have given pride of place to his savior ’s name .
Another is the phrasing of the passage .
Some have translated the crucial phrase as “ the brother of Jesus , the so - called Christ . ”
However , this translation is not supported by the original Greek – in fact , the original Greek words used are identical ( except for being in a slightly different case ) to the wording of Matthew 1:16 .
It is true that these things might be coincidences .
However , there is yet another anomaly .
Reading the rest of chapter 9 , we learn that the Jews were so angered by the stoning of James that they wrote to the king , Agrippa , demanding that Ananus be fired .
Why would Jews be so upset over the killing of an apostate , a Christian leader , that they would attempt to depose their own high priest ?
None of these four points are conclusive by themselves .
However , when we add them all up , the weight of the evidence points strongly to the conclusion that this , too , is a later Christian interpolation .
There are other people named Jesus mentioned in Josephus ’ writing : in fact , that very same chapter mentions a man named “ Jesus , the son of Damneus ” who was made high priest after Ananus .
If this person had a brother named James , that might have been whom the passage was originally about , and a later Christian copyist who mistakenly assumed the passage was referring to “ his ” Jesus and James could have made that connection himself by inserting the “ brother of Jesus , him called Christ ” phrase .
( Thanks to EvanT for making this suggestion . )
This conclusion makes good sense and makes the passage less jarring , more easily fit within context .
After all , if Josephus really had written the “ him called Christ ” phrase , it is difficult to believe he would have left it at that without further elaboration .
After all , to call someone “ Christ ” is a claim that is presumptuous in the extreme – it makes that person out to be the God - sent messiah , the long - awaited savior the Jews had been promised who would establish God ’s kingdom on earth for all time .
It seems very likely that Josephus would include at least a brief discussion of the actions of the person who would dare to take such a lofty mantle on himself , even if he did not believe that person ’s messianic claims .
But no such discussion is to be found anywhere in Josephus , and thus we can confidently conclude that this is because he never wrote this phrase in the first place .
Suetonius
Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus was a Roman biographer and historian whose most famous work is titled The Lives of the Twelve Caesars , a biography of twelve Roman emperors livened up with gossip and stories of scandal .
Written about 120 CE , the book contains one passage apologists frequently cite :
“ Because the Jews of Rome caused continous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus , [ Claudius ] expelled them from the city . ”
As historical evidence for the existence of Jesus , this verse is very weak .
A number of anomalies immediately crop up upon reading it .
One is that Jesus ’ name is seemingly misspelled .
But on further examination , this may not be a misspelling at all .
“ Chrestus ” does not mean “ Christ ” ( that would have been “ Christus ” ) – rather , “ Chrestus ” was a perfectly valid Latin name in its own right , and a very common one as well .
It may well be that this passage is referring to some unknown Jewish agitator , perhaps another messianic pretender such as the ones Josephus describes .
Furthermore , Claudius was the Roman emperor from 41 to 54 CE .
There is no indication historically that Christianity had spread to Rome by this time , or that it was powerful enough to have caused a revolt .
Note , too , that the passage says it was not Christians who were causing disturbances , but Jews – and Suetonius does write about Christians elsewhere in his works , so he plainly knew the difference .
Also , Claudius ’ decree is mentioned in the Bible , in Acts ( 18:1 - 2 ) .
Backing up Suetonius ’ account ,
Acts describes it as an expulsion of Jews only .
If the emperor had also expelled Christians from Rome , it seems likely that this passage would have mentioned it , since Acts never misses a chance to record persecutions of Christians .
But nothing of the kind is described , which makes it even more likely that Claudius ’ expulsion was a Roman - Jewish dispute with no connection to Christianity .
( Thanks to EvanT for pointing this out . )
Finally , it is worth noting when this passage was written .
After Josephus , the chronologically nearest witness to Jesus ’ life the apologists have to offer , we now leap to 120 CE .
An ambiguous reference to a person who might have been Christianity ’s founder , written over seventy years after his supposed death , is hardly compelling evidence for the existence of Jesus .
There is another brief verse in Suetonius that apologists occasionally cite :
“ After the great fire at Rome [ during Nero ’s reign ] … .
Punishments were also inflicted on the Christians , a sect professing a new and mischievous religious belief . ”
Note the second question at the beginning of this essay – what did the historian write ?
This brief passage mentions nothing about the existence of Jesus , and thus is worthless as evidence of his existence .
It merely proves that there were Christians in 120 CE , which no one disputes .
Pliny the Younger
For two years the proconsul of Bythinia , a Roman - held province in Asia Minor , Pliny the Younger is best known for several letters he wrote to the Emperor Trajan around 112 CE that provide information on life at the time .
One of them says this :
“ [ The Christians ] were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light , when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ , as to a god… . ”
Again , note the second criterion .
This passage mentions nothing about a historical Jesus , nor does it vouch for the existence of any such person .
It merely states that the Christians worshipped Christ , but this proves nothing , just as a verse about the Romans worshipping Zeus would not demonstrate that such a being existed .
( Note too that “ Christ ” is a title , not a name . )
This verse does not state that this Christ was ever on Earth – it does not even state that the Christians believed he was .
Thus , it is entirely compatible with an early Christianity worshipping a spiritual Christ whose death and resurrection took place in Heaven ; but even if not , one hundred years is more than enough time for legends about a historical man to take root .
Tacitus
Another Roman historian , Cornelius Tacitus ’ surviving works consist of the Germania , the Histories , and the Annals , written around 115 CE .
One passage late in the Annals , book 15 , chapter 44 , has another mention of Jesus :
“ Consequently , to get rid of the report [ that he was responsible for the great fire ] , Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations , called Christians by the populace .
Christus , from whom the name had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , Pontius Pilatus , and a most mischievous superstition , thus checked for the moment , again broke out not only in Judaea , the first source of the evil , but even in Rome , where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular .
Accordingly , an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty ; then , upon their information , an immense multitude was convicted , not so much of the crime of firing the city , as of hatred against mankind . ”
This passage is very likely authentic to Tacitus ; a Christian interpolator would not have written such uncomplimentary things about his own religion .
( Compare this to the glowing tone of even the “ reduced ” Testimonium Flavianum . )
But again , as with the other historians , it is important to note that Tacitus did not write this until almost one hundred years after Jesus supposedly lived .
Thus , he cannot provide first - hand evidence for the existence of Jesus , and it therefore makes sense to ask where he did get his information from – what his sources were .
The idea that Tacitus got his information from official Roman records seems highly unlikely .
There is no evidence that the Romans kept meticulous records extending back almost a century of every single crucifixion carried out in every corner of the empire , and that possibility is further reduced by the fact that Rome had essentially burned to the ground in the interim ( which is what Tacitus was writing about in the quoted paragraph ) .
The most likely scenario is that Tacitus was getting his facts from contemporary Christian sources ; he would have had no reason to doubt them .
This passage , therefore , is probably based on later Christian hearsay and is weak as evidence for a historical Jesus .
Mara Bar -Serapion
Mara Bar -Serapion was a Syrian , but other than that nothing is known of his life .
All we possess today are fragments of a letter he was writing to his son from prison , one of which says the following :
“ What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death ?
Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime .
What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burying Pythagoras ?
In a moment their land was covered with sand .
What advantage did the Jews gain from executing their wise king ?
It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished .
God justly avenged these three wise men : the Athenians died of hunger ; the Samians were overwhelmed by the sea ; the Jews , ruined and driven from their land , live in complete dispersion .
But Socrates did not die for good ; he lived on in the teaching of Plato .
Pythagoras did not die for good ; he lived on in the statue of Hera .
Nor did the wise king die for good ; he lived on in the teaching which he had given . ”
The second and third criteria both come into play here .
First , it should be noted that the dating of this letter is very uncertain .
Even the earliest estimates place it around 70 CE , over 40 years after Jesus ’ death , while some historians have dated it well into the third century .
Secondly , and far more importantly , the letter does not even mention Jesus by name – it only refers to a “ wise king ” , and does not mention any specific deeds or sayings of this individual .
It could be referring to any of the messianic pretenders of the first century , or someone else entirely unknown to us .
There is no way to tell .
In fact , it seems less likely that Bar - Serapion meant Jesus than any other would - be messiah , since Jesus was killed by the Romans , not by the Jews .
The fact that he does not even name this “ wise king ” , whereas he does name Socrates and Pythagoras , suggests that Bar - Serapion knew almost nothing about him .
Therefore , as confirmation of the historicity of Jesus , his testimony is without merit .
It further supports this argument to note that Bar - Serapion is sloppy and careless with other historical details in this passage .
Pythagoras , for example , apparently died in southern Italy , not Samos ; the exact location and manner of his death vary depending on the telling ( in Croton by political adversaries or in Metapontium by hunger strike ) , but no historical account puts his death in Samos , nor is there any record of a significant natural disaster there that might correspond to what Bar - Serapion mentions .
Also , Socrates was executed several decades after the Great Plague of Athens , which seems to be what this passage is alluding to , obviously making it impossible that the plague could somehow have been divine retribution .
Bar - Serapion ’s inability to get known historical details right makes him far less trustworthy when it comes to disputed ones .
( Thanks to EvanT for pointing this out . )
Lucian of Samosata
Born around 125 CE , Lucian of Samosata was not a historian , but a satirist who wrote dialogues ridiculing Greek philosophy and mythology .
Some apologists cite a brief passage of his :
“ The Christians , you know , worship a man to this day – the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites , and was crucified on that account … .
You see , these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time , which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self - devotion which are so common among them ; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers , from the moment that they are converted , and deny the gods of Greece , and worship the crucified sage , and live after his laws .
All this they take quite on faith , with the result that they despise all worldly goods alike , regarding them merely as common property . ”
Taken at face value , Lucian ’s testimony would seem to support the idea that such a person as Jesus Christ actually existed .
However , the third question comes into play here – when did he write ?
Given that this passage was not written until the mid-second century at the earliest , it cannot possibly provide any direct evidence for the historicity of Jesus – Lucian must be getting his facts second - hand , from other sources .
But what sources did he use ?
Since he does not say , we cannot know for certain , but the most likely scenario is that he is simply repeating stories he heard from contemporary Christians .
Without any citation of his source for this knowledge , all we can say is that Lucian ’s writing provides no independent confirmation for Jesus ’ existence .
The Jewish Talmud
A compendium of Jewish oral law and rabbinical commentary still used by Orthodox Jews today to complement the Torah , the Talmud was entirely oral until it was codified and written down somewhere around 200 CE .
It contains a few scattered references to Jesus , one of which is reproduced below :
“ On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged .
For forty days before the execution took place , a herald went forth and cried , ‘ He is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy .
Anyone who can say anything in his favor , let him come forward and plead on his behalf . ’
But since nothing was brought forward in his favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover . ”
The problem with the Talmud is this – it is not an objective history , but a polemic .
It is obvious that the above verse is not a description of something that actually happened ; rather , it is a Jewish retort to the New Testament accusation that the trial and execution of Jesus took place secretly and in haste .
Theological biases render historical accounts unreliable , and this is just as true for the Jews who were answering Christian accusations as for the Christians who were making them .
By the time the Talmud was compiled , centuries after Jesus ’ alleged death and after the Jewish War which caused vast destruction in Jerusalem and scattered the Jewish people to the winds , third - century rabbis would have been in no position to be able to refute the very existence of Jesus ( not to mention that they also lacked the exegetical techniques that would have allowed them to even suspect such a possibility ) .
It would have been much easier to grant his existence and then slant the stories about him to favor their side of the argument rather than the Christians ’ , and this is exactly what happened .
Furthermore , the Talmud is without value as a historical account because it dramatically contradicts the Christian version of events , and even contradicts itself in numerous places , when speaking about Jesus .
Note that the above verse says he was hanged , not crucified .
The same chapter says Jesus had just five disciples , and gives them completely different names than the Bible does : Matthai , Nakai , Nezer , Buni and Todah ( source – thanks to EvanT for pointing this out ) .
There are other Talmudic accounts that say Jesus died by stoning , not at Calvary , but at Lydda , and not by the Romans , but by the Jews .
Some verses say he was the son of a Roman soldier , others say he was a magician .
One mention of Jesus places his life at the time of the Maccabean kings , around 100 BCE , while another says his parents were contemporaries of a second - century rabbi .
Such fragmented and inconsistent accounts show that the Talmud cannot possibly be accurate history ; if it were describing true events , it would be impossible for it to contradict itself .
This , combined with its late writing date , makes it even weaker than the other accounts as evidence of Jesus ’ existence .
Thallus
The true name of the historian we now call Thallus is in fact not known .
Nothing written by Thallus has survived to this day ; the only reason we know anything about him is that he is mentioned in the writings of others .
In the ninth century CE , a Christian named George Syncellus quoted an early third - century Christian named Julius Africanus , who in turn referenced the work of another man who wrote a history of the Eastern Mediterranean sometime between 50 and 100 CE .
The true name of this man is unclear , as the manuscript is damaged and a letter is missing , but “ Thallus ” seems to be the most likely spelling .
Neither any of his original works nor any of the original works of Africanus survive , and a fragment of third - hand hearsay stretching across eight centuries is about as weak and uncompelling as any evidence could possibly be .
Nevertheless , if Syncellus and in turn Africanus are to be believed , Thallus ’ history mentioned the three - hour darkness at the time of Jesus ’ crucifixion .
( No direct quotes from Thallus are known . )
As previously stated , this evidence is so ridiculously weak and circumstantial that it could be justifiably dismissed without going any farther .
Third - hand hearsay is not compelling proof of a worldwide darkness that everyone should have noticed .
Furthermore , Thallus himself did not even necessarily say it was anything out of the ordinary .
Syncellus quotes Africanus as saying this :
“ Thallus , in the third book of his histories , explains away the darkness as an eclipse of the sun – unreasonably , as it seems to me . ”
Passover is around a full moon , and it is physically impossible for a solar eclipse to occur during a full moon , much less to last for three hours , so Africanus would be right if that was what Thallus said – but we do not know what Thallus said ; he is not quoted directly .
Astronomers have calculated that a solar eclipse did occur in November of 29 CE .
Is it not possible that Thallus was recording this , nothing more , and that the link to the gospel story was made by Africanus who mistakenly thought it was an attempt to explain away a mysterious three - hour darkness ?
And of course , this is assuming that Africanus accurately referenced Thallus , and that Syncellus accurately referenced both of them .
None of the links in this long chain of assumptions can be substantiated , and thus there is no good reason to accept Thallus as any corroboration of the gospel account .
Phlegon
As we approach the end of the list , we encounter Phlegon of Tralles , a writer who lived sometime around 140 CE .
Like Thallus , he is typically cited as a witness to the miraculous darkness around the time of the crucifixion ; also like Thallus , his major works , the Chronicles and the Olympiads , have been lost , and the only way we know anything they said is through references made to them by later Christian commentators , such as Origen , Eusebius and Julius Africanus ( who is himself lost and only preserved through quotes by another writer , George Syncellus , as previously mentioned ) .
All of them reference Phlegon in support of the darkness .
For example , Julius Africanus ( as quoted by Syncellus ) says the following :
“ In fact , let it be so .
Let the idea that this happened seize and carry away the multitude , and let the cosmic prodigy be counted as an eclipse of the sun according to its appearance .
Phlegon reports that in the time of Tiberius Caesar , during the full moon , a full eclipse of the sun happened , from the sixth hour until the ninth .
Clearly this is our eclipse ! ”
And Eusebius , the only one to quote Phlegon verbatim , has this to say :
“ In fact , Phlegon , too , a distinguished reckoner of Olympiads , wrote more on these events in his 13th book , saying this : ‘ Now , in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [ 32 CE ] , a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it , turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars could be seen in heaven , and the earth moved in Bithynia , toppling many buildings in the city of Nicaea . ' ”
Of course , considerations of the third criterion intervene – Phlegon was , by all accounts , far too late to have witnessed any of these things personally .
He cannot provide independent attestation of the darkness .
However , there is a far more serious consideration of the first criterion , one that bears directly on Phlegon ’s credibility as a historian .
He was not a Christian as far as we know , so there are no grounds to accuse him of inventing the story to support his own beliefs .
However , it seems that Phlegon was particularly fond of fantastic and miraculous stories , regardless of their origin , and endorsed as fact many things that are impossible .
His book On Marvels contains stories about things such as living centaurs , ghosts , men giving birth , a thousand - year - old Greek prophetess , oracles spoken by a corpse on a battlefield , and the animated , decapitated head of the Roman general Publius , which continued to speak even after his body was devoured by a great red wolf .
By the time Phlegon wrote , in the mid- to late second century , Christian mythology about the crucifixion would have become widely spread .
It is highly likely that Phlegon , never averse to fantastic stories , picked up on these tales and uncritically repeated them .
A writer so plainly unreliable , and in any case known to us only through hearsay by Christians who might well have put their own spin on what he wrote , cannot be regarded as useful historical testimony .
Others
Beyond the writers and historians listed here , some apologists will cite second - century or later church fathers and apologists such as Clement , Ignatius , Justin Martyr , Polycarp , Origen or Eusebius .
The testimony of a Christian who lived centuries after Jesus ’ death can hardly be considered a valuable or reliable source – where can they possibly be getting their information from , other than the gospels ?
By any reasonable standard , none of these contribute one shred of independent evidence to the historical existence of Jesus .
There are good grounds to dispute either the authenticity or reliability , or both , of every historical source cited as support for the existence of Jesus .
But even if it were otherwise – even if there was no reason to contest any of the passages listed above – this still would not constitute a very impressive witness to the most important man who ever lived .
Put all of them together and they would hardly fill a page .
Is it reasonable to believe that Jesus ’ life would have been noticed by so few ?
Is it reasonable to believe in a worldwide darkness noted only by two obscure writers , both now lost , whose testimony comes to us only through third - hand hearsay ?
Or a mass resurrection of deceased saints noted by no one at all ?
Or an incarnated Son of God whose numerous miracles , huge crowds of followers and triumphant return from the dead are mentioned only in a few brief passages written by historians who lived decades after he died ?
Clearly , there is something very wrong here .
But what is the solution ?
Part 3 will answer that question , analyzing the New Testament epistles and the writings of the early apologists to argue to a very different conclusion about what it was that the first Christians actually believed .

ALL right , everyone under the age of 40 , go run around the block or something .
This column is not for you .
It is for people like me , inching toward 50 , who are , let us say , not technology - averse , but do not embrace it with the unquestioning love that our children do .
For them , no gadget is unnecessary , no add - on excessive , no upgrade superfluous .
Now , I know this is not just a generational divide .
Some people of any age  we all know a few  buy every new gizmo , the more bells and whistles and buttons , the better .
And some people in their 20s and 30s are not enamored with the high - tech side of life .
But for those of us who remember getting off the couch to change the channel , technology is not necessarily as innate a part of our lives as it is for those chronologically behind us .
Asus shook up the industry with its $ 300 -- $ 600 mini notebook last year .
Asus continues to dominate the market for super small , super cheap mini-notebooks .
It may sell as many as 5 million Eee PCs by the end of the year  far more than all other competitors combined .
It was n't supposed to happen this way .
Microsoft and OEM partners Fujitsu , General Dynamics Itronix , HTC , OQO , Samsung and even Asus have been planning , designing and building Ultra Mobile PCs that were supposed to be so good people would pay $ 600 to $ 2,000 for them .
Many of these devices attempted to re-invent the sub - notebook wheel with funky form factors , goofy keyboards and exotic feature combinations .
Worse , some took Microsoft 's advice and made the gadgets dependent on Vista , which is a lousy OS for a full - size , full - powered desktop PC and a disaster for an ultra-portable .
It turns out that people just wanted a regular laptop , but much smaller and cheaper .
When Asus came out with its mostly solid state , plain vanilla PC running Linux ( and now XP ) , the masses flocked .
And now , Acer , Dell , HP and possibly Sony , as well as a smattering of smaller companies , are rushing their own cheap - and - tiny offerings .
Soon , the market will be overwhelmed by what I like to call " mini me too " laptops -- commodity Asus clones that will drive margins for all players toward zero .
There will be no real money to be made in direct sales of cheap mini-notebooks to consumers .
I 'm predicting that the successful pricing model for " mini me too " laptops will look nothing like the notebook pricing model ( where you always pay full price for the hardware ) , and a lot like the cell phone pricing model where you buy a service , and the hardware is heavily subsidized or given away free .
This will happen because improvements in solid - state design , economies of scale through mass production , aggressive competition and other factors will drive the cost of producing tiny laptops down even further .
Manufacturers will make their money by selling large quantities to companies who have more profitable products and services to sell .
They 'll use the lure of free PCs to steal customers from competitors and upgrade existing customers .
Do n't believe me ?
It 's already happening in Britain and Canada .
In the UK , PowerupMobile.com will give you a free Asus Eee PC if you sign up for a two - year contract for a specific T - Mobile mobile broadband service called Web ' n ' Walk Max , which costs about $ 68 per month .
Years ago , banks used to give away toasters ( and other things ) to encourage people to sign up for new checking accounts .
Fast forward to 2008 , and the Royal Bank of Canada is giving people Asus Eee PCs if they open one of two accounts .
My prediction is that by the middle of next year , " mini me too " laptops will be given away in the United States , and by so many companies that they 'll become hard to sell at any price .
Here 's what you 'll have to buy in order to get your free mini laptop :
 Mobile broadband services .
Phone carriers will use " mini me too " laptops to lure existing customers into faster and more expensive pricing plans .
They 'll give you a good reason to upgrade to 3G , for example , by giving you a free 3G Eee PC if you upgrade .
They 'll also use them to attract new customers .
[ cob : In_Focus ]
This makes a lot of sense because a two - year contract at , say , $ 30 per month ( or $ 30 extra on top of your existing wireless cell phone plan ) , means $ 720 for the carrier .
But with dropping prices and buying in bulk , they might pay less than $ 100 for the laptop .
 Online storage and synchronization services .
Asus announced recently that customers in Taiwan would get free online storage for one year with the purchase of an Eee PC .
After the year is up , presumably , they can stop using the service or pay a monthly fee .
I think this is bass - ackwards .
A new breed of online storage and synchronization services , including SugarSync , Syncplicity , DropBox , FolderShare , Carbonite , Mozy , Upline and others are all trying to make money in their own over - crowded niche .
The two were made for each other , because mini-notebooks are almost always secondary systems .
Almost anyone with a mini -notebook needs to synchronize files with their PC , or at least needs online storage .
One of these companies is going to figure out that giving away a laptop along with a two - year commitment is a compelling way to beat the competition .
 Software .
Hundreds of companies make vertical applications or applications suites for specific types of professions , and sell these software titles for hundreds or thousands of dollars .
It 's only a matter of time before they start selling their software already installed on a mini-notebook .
Imagine , for example , a suite of Real Estate applications pre-installed on an Asus Eee PC , where agents could check listings and do all their work from anywhere .
Or insurance .
Or sales .
 Non-technology related products and services .
Vacation packages , new cars , bank accounts ( like in Canada ) -- you name it .
Mini -notebooks will become the new toaster , and will become popular giveaways for raffles , radio programs , universities trying to lure freshmen , and others .
I 'm not saying all " mini me too " laptops will be free .
I 'm saying they 'll be priced like cell phones .
That means the low end of the market will be free , the mid-range will be heavily subsidized ( $ 50 to $ 100 , plus you have to agree to buy some service or product ) and the yet - unannounced Apple product will be over - priced and totally unsubsidized .
It 's a wonderful time to be a nerdy cheapskate .

Another peril can be added to the hazards of the innocent - looking computer keyboard .
Not content with encouraging repetitive strain injury , the type - pads sometimes harbour more filth than the average loo seat and house millions of bacteria which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting , a study has shown .
A microbiologist carrying out research published today for Which ?
Computing magazine examined samples from 33 keyboards and found a variety of bugs including E coli and S aureus , which can cause skin infections and make people ill .
The scientist swabbed a loo seat and a toilet door handle in a typical London office for comparison .
One of the keyboards in the experiment had to be removed from the office because it was five times dirtier than the lavatory seat and home to 150 times the acceptable limit of bacteria .
" [ It ] was increasing the risk of its user becoming ill , " said the microbiologist , James Francis .
" I have n't seen a reading like that in a very long time - it was off the scale . "
Two more of the keyboards had " warning levels " of bacteria , while a further two showed high levels of coliform bacteria , which are associated with fecal matter .
The research showed that the chief culprit for contamination was people eating at their desks and dropping crumbs which lodge between keys and encourage the growth of millions of bacteria .
Other causes included poor personal hygiene , particularly people failing to wash their hands after using the toilet .
Dust , which traps moisture , also provides ideal conditions for the growth of bacteria .
" These results are generally typical of offices up and down the country , " said Francis .
Sarah Kidner , the editor of Which ?
Computing , said : " Most people do n't give much thought to the grime that builds up on their PC , but if you do n't clean your computer , you might as well eat your lunch off the toilet .
" Why not give your PC a spring clean ?
It 's quite simple to do and could prevent your computer from becoming a health hazard . "
The survey , in which more 4,000 people were questioned , found that 22 % cleaned their keyboard and 27 % their monitor on a monthly basis .
Just over one in 10 said they never cleaned their keyboard , while 20 % said they never cleaned their mouse .
The magazine also warned that headphones can ferry germs between people and transfer headlice .

Computing recommends that computers be shut down and unplugged before being gently dusted with a soft , lint - free cloth and wiped with an approved computer cleaning fluid .
A vacuum cleaner can be used to clean vents , but contrary to internet myth , keyboards should not be put in the dishwasher , the magazine said .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- London 's subway system was engulfed by thousands of revelers Saturday night , marking the introduction of an alcohol ban on the mass transit network .
Revelers hit London 's subway system Saturday night to mark the introduction of an alcohol ban .
Eyewitnesses have described how some drunken partygoers , often dressed in fancy dress , fought , damaged subway trains and vomited .
Authorities were forced to close six stations on the network , including major transportation hubs at Liverpool Street , Baker Street and Euston .
A spokesman for British Transport Police , which patrols the network , said that police had been told of a large " large amount " of disorder and " multiple instances of trains being damaged " , causing them to be pulled from service , the UK's Press Association reported , adding : " This was an unfortunate end to what should have been a fun event . "
There were reports of at least 17 arrests .
Much of the disorder concentrated on the Circle Line , which encircles the center of the city .
Many reports say that the night had begun good - naturedly .
Web programmer , David Mudkips , 25 , from east London , told PA that the event was " Like rush hour but fun .
There were people 's sweaty armpits in my face but I did n't care because I was drinking . "
Student Frankie Abbott , 21 , also from east London , said earlier in the evening : " It might be fun to do the whole night but I think it 's going to get a bit messy .
There are guys drinking from funnels already . "
Sailor Peter Moore , 35 , from Brighton on the southern English coast , told the agency his night was " Drunken , I just downed a can of beer in 10 seconds .
It 's sweaty on there but I 'm going round and round until I vomit . "
As the evening progressed the situation deteriorated .
Photographer Desmond Fitzgerald , 48 , from south London , told PA that by 11 pm at Gloucester Road subway station he was afraid someone might slip onto the tracks due to the amount of spilt alcohol on the platform .
" At first the atmosphere was happy but anarchic , defiant , " he said , with people wearing hats and having a good time .
As the journey progressed , more heavily drunk people joined the train , he added .
" Then a fight broke out between about five people , but because we were so tightly packed in it soon spread throughout the carriage and I had to struggle to escape to the next one , " he told PA .
" The atmosphere had really changed by this point .
People were ripping off adverts and maps and being sick all over the place .
" When it pulled in to Embankment people fell out and carried on fighting on the platform .
Thankfully police were there , and they handled it very well . "
Many of those gathered had learnt of the party on social networking Web sites , through groups with names such as " Circle Line Party - Last day of drinking on the tube " , which had 850 - plus members listed by Saturday lunchtime , and " Party / Flashmob on the Underground " , with 1,300 - plus names listed .
The anti-drinking strategy was introduced by newly elected London mayor Boris Johnson .
He said before the party occurred : " I 'm determined to improve the safety and security of public transport in London and create a better environment for the millions of Londoners who rely on it .
The ban has the full support of the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police .
" I firmly believe that banning the drinking of alcohol on London 's public transport will create a better traveling environment for all Londoners and that if we drive out antisocial behavior and so called minor crime then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime . "
But Bob Crow , General Secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union of which many subway staff are members , countered that the ban put workers at greater risk of of attack , reported PA , saying it was " half - baked . "
Pacific Continental Securities was possibly the UK 's most notorious firm of stockbrokers .
Its team of young salesmen used high - pressure tactics to lure clients into buying shares that for most investors were almost a guaranteed route to financial ruin .
After a wave of complaints , the Financial Services Authority finally banned the firm from taking on new business last year .
Pacific Continental went bust shortly afterwards .
But as hapless investors lost their savings , the brokers raked it in .
Today a former broker at Pacific Continental reveals how he was encouraged to make false and misleading claims to sell shares - and warns that many of his former bosses and colleagues have now moved to other City firms .
Innocent individuals , he claims , are still being plagued by the same high - pressure sales tactics used to sell ultra-risky stocks .
Let 's call our whistle - blower John Hunter , although that 's not his real name .
He has asked us to change it because he has now made a fresh start in life outside of stockbroking .
He hopes his story will warn investors to stand well clear of what he describes as " just - about - legal boiler rooms " .
John 's story
" I am not proud of my career at Pacific Continental .
I caused innocent and trusting people to lose money .
But , and I know some will be sceptical about this , I feel conned myself .
When I left a temporary job in 2005 , I wanted to work in the City .
I knew I was not an automatic prospect .
I had left school at 17 , skipped university and my only work experience was in a shop .
But I was determined to succeed .
I sent off 60 letters to City firms and recruitment agencies .
All ignored me , except Pacific Continental and one other .
I opted for PacCon because the other company was so over - the - top , promising that I 'd soon be driving a Ferrari .
That was ridiculous .
Before I started at PacCon , I had to pass FSA papers in regulation and securities .
They were easy to answer .
At PacCon 's Cannon Street offices , I was surrounded by young people - almost all male .
Many were effectively barrow boys .
We all thought we had made it as City stockbrokers .
There was no formal training .
The way it worked was that four or five juniors would report to a desk head .
I later learned my desk head had previously worked for a Barcelona boiler room .
I was paid £ 18,000 a year plus commission .
But desk heads earned a lot more .
My job was to phone " leads " .
We got some from a " marketing company " .
If anyone asked , we would refer to some form they had filled in or some sort of market research they had helped with .
Under FSA rules , we were told to ask " know your customer " questions .
These were designed , in theory , to weed out those for whom the small company stocks we sold were unsuitable .
We often asked questions in such a way the customers would give the answer we needed .
We would encourage people to exaggerate their earnings and portfolio .
Few wanted to be thought of as " scared " of small company shares .
My desk head gave me a script which , he said , was " what you need to say under FSA regulations " .
We were aggressive with our sales pitch and did n't give risk warnings if we could avoid it .
I was encouraged to browbeat customers into a sale - in fact , it worked that anything was fine if it resulted in the punter buying .
I was new to this and thought PacCon methods were normal .
With commission , I earned £ 2,000 a month .
One stock I sold shares in was New Millennium Resources .
It was listed on AIM and involved in mining in Angola .
We were told to tell clients about the press releases this company put out , detailing its new diamond finds .
It was a good story to sell - and I got rid of about £ 40,000 in this one - including £ 5,000 to an elderly lady .
Whenever any of us made a big sale , we 'd shout , clap and cheer - even laugh if the customer had caved in for a big amount without a fight .
Then we'd be praised in the office and taken out by the desk head - champagne and , for some , strip joints .
And we 'd move up a place on the sales board which recorded our success .
The real money was made by desk heads .
They could earn up to £ 750,000 a year by " re-dealing " - selling more to the clients you had softened up .
This might be another stock which was promised to replace the losses clients made in the original shares we pitched .
They were the real power - the ostensible heads the FSA talked to used to just sit in their offices playing solitaire .
Calls were apparently recorded but there was no oversight and no one ever listened to them .
If you were really outrageous , you 'd get a verbal warning but it was seen as a joke .
In spring 2006 , New Millennium was delisted from AIM and the shares I sold for up to 10 p became effectively worthless - they were never sellable at a profit .
I then started asking questions which did not make me popular - they told me to shut up and sell .
So how did we get the price up so high ?
It was through " stock supporters " - someone with an interest in the shares who would put out press releases and buy a few thousand shares .
By spending perhaps £ 300 , they would double the share price - if one person bought and no one sold , the value soared .
Clients were never encouraged to sell ; after all , we wanted to flog shares we'd bought from the promoters at a big discount to our asking price .
When the penny dropped after six months , I realised what we told clients was , charitably , very optimistic .
More honestly , it was totally imaginary .
I felt like total crap .
I knew I had stolen from clients just like a mugger , but I was grabbing more than a mobile .
I felt like a coward - I had never met my victims .
I 'm not specially moral but I was really shocked this was all legal .
Other than FSA approval and a City base , the firm was just like a boiler room .
It was outrageous , but what is even more outrageous is how some ex-colleagues have set up lookalike firms .
They know they are in the wrong - one even has a bodyguard in case angry punters pay to have him eliminated .
All I can now say is sorry . "

The U.S. President George W. Bush today admitted that it was his tough tone that provided the world with a misleading impression that he was a " guy really anxious for war " .
He mentioned that it would have been better for him to use another tone on the global stage .
In his interview given to the London - based newspaper The Times , the U.S. President mentioned that his main goal in the next seven months before the end of his presidency was to provide his successor a diplomatic support for handling Iranian problem .
" I think that in retrospect I could have used a different tone , a different rhetoric , " said President Bush .

A new report from Arthur D. Little , Sustainable Performance shatters my perception that companies are whole heartedly going green .
An analysis of the report at Greenbiz.com notes this conclusion .
“ Sustainable Performance ” from Arthur D. Little argues that regulatory and consumer pressures have not pushed corporations toward sustainability beyond superficial measures .
It ’s not surprising that the report concluded that , in general , companies only take steps toward going green when it impacts the bottom line .
Driven by shareholder concerns companies frequently implement those green solutions that maximize short terms gain .
Forced to “ report to stock markets ” on a quarterly basis , it can be difficult for companies to proceed with longer term green objectives .
Sustainability – and how we are to achieve it – is one of the most debated topics of the moment .
Stakeholders , including customers , want to see companies taking action on environmental issues and , in many countries , legislation now demands that companies publish details of their performance on sustainability as part of CSR reporting requirements .
As a result , upbeat stories on environmental achievements are easy to find in any number of glossy , corporate publications .
However , a closer look at the reporting of sustainability performance and the corporate strategies supporting it reveals that , in many companies , the response to the challenge of sustainability is only skin - deep .
While many , more progressive companies are making strides where reducing carbon emissions and increasing sustainability improves profits and promotes efficiency , in many cases the opportunity to create a competitive advantage is overlooked .
That may be about to change as investment groups start to target green companies .
More and more specialized , as well as established investment groups are seeing the future and asking potential partners about their plans for sustainability .
In fact , between 2005 and 2006 , the amount of assets managed by SRI ( Socially Responsible Investments ) funds domiciled in Europe grew by more than 40 %
It ’s about time .

In late January , the Air Force banned TogetherWeServed.com , a military - themed social networking site , for being a security " nightmare . "
Now , Air Force officials are admitting " to unfairly singling out " the site , which " does not pose any extra risk than most chat rooms or other online communities , " * Stars & Stripes ' * Leo Shane reports .
" Site owners said the retraction may have come too late to help their online business . "
As the military continues to struggle with social media , a familiar pattern has emerged : Sites are initially labeled as sieves for secrets ; then , after further inspection , those early assessments are often turned on their heads .
In 2006 , for example , the Army assembled a unit to monitor official sites and soldiers ' blogs for OPSEC , or operational security , transgressions .
After a year , they discovered that the official pages were 65 times more likely to violate security rules .
TogetherWeServed.com ... launched its Air Force site last December .
President Brian Foster said at that time the California company had been operating its popular Marines and Navy sites for years without complaints .
But after signing up more than 50,000 [ Air Force ] members in the first few weeks , participation in the site suddenly slowed as a PowerPoint presentation from Air Force Maj .
Mark D. Hedden began circulating online , Foster said .
The briefing , for the 1st Special Operations Wing , incorrectly identified the company as based in Germany and questioned the security of allowing active - duty troops to post some personal information there .
It also recommended blocking the site from official Air Force computers .
What lead Maj .
Hedden to proclaim that the site was an " OPSEC Nightmare " ?
The network supposed sins appeared to consist of the " 6 pictures " posted online – and because a few members described how they received medals , with " dates/actions . "
Not exactly state secrets , in other words .
But even these seemingly - innocuous items could be considered violations of Air Force regulations , as written .
As Maj .
Hedden 's presentation notes , Air Force Instruction 35 - 101 says that " each Air Force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance , starting with Public
Affairs , before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
This includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted Web site . "
As Maj .
Hedden 's presentation spread , others inthe Air Force began to use it as an example of the hazzards of social media .
***
*" Posting information on these sites that are viewed by millions every day can have dangerous , even deadly , consequences , " one news release from Robbins Air Force Base warned .
* The well - known social networking sites are n't the only ones that servicemembers should be wary of .
One
" military - only " site devoted to Air Force personnel has been blocked at
Randolph and other bases because of the information it conveys about
Airmen , Ms. Kidd said . *
It 's called " Air Force Together We Served , " or AFTWS , and it offers a large amount of information about Airmen , including service photos , service details , personal details , assignments and combat and operations histories ...
" It 's highly recommended that personnel not post information on that
Web site , " she said .
" Someone could piece the information together like a puzzle .
It is like an OPSEC nightmare because of the information that 's just out there . "
Blogs can also yield information that threatens national or operational security .
Ms. Kidd said one servicemember actually produced a deployment blog .
" If you have a diary you 're giving people information about daily activities on a base , " she said .
" People do n't realize they 're being watched .
Everybody is a target . "
" The site is located , owned and maintained by someone in Germany , " one Air Force Office of Special Investigations officer added , " If you do n't believe m[ e ] - Google them . "
** The site 's operators , based in California , strongly disagreed .
They asked the Air Force Inspector General for help .
And this week , the Air Force announced that “ after subsequent research , some of the information in the briefing , created by an Air Force officer , was found to be inaccurate , ” according to a statement by Lt .
Col. Melinda Morgan , with the Air
Force Office of Public Affairs .
“ The author of the brief sent out a subsequent e-mail to retract the inaccurate information , ” Morgan added .
“ Additionally , the Air Force has since requested the briefing cease to be propagated and will continue to take action to remove the briefing if instances of its use are discovered . ”
Wes Prater , co-founder of the site , tells Military Times that the damage done to his business may not be reversible .
“ Air
Force Commands have already sent briefs containing erroneous information warning their personnel to avoid
AirForce .TogetherWeServed.com at all costs since the first week of
February , ” he said .
“ The Air Force has blocked , without reservation , all access to [ the site ] from all bases , and to the best of our knowledge no command has sent any briefs to their personnel retracting the original brief , nor have any discriminatory blocks against [ the site ] been lifted . ”
While most of the 50,000 Air
Force members who joined the site before the erroneous information began circulating have remained members , most have not returned , he said .
“ The result is clear — the site ’s reputation throughout the
Air Force has been destroyed , ” Prater said .
“ We ’re going to try our best to keep the site going .
It ’s part of our military community , and the other sites are doing well .
We appreciate what the Air Force is doing now , but unfortunately , they let this go on for too long . ”

Obama camp accuses Clinton of signaling ' anything goes ' campaign Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday March 11 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton is signaling to her supporters that " anything goes " by not forcefully repudiating racially tinged comments from a prominent surrogate , Democratic rival Barack Obama 's campaign strategist charged Tuesday .
The Obama campaign arranged a conference call to repudiate comments from Geraldine Ferraro , who told a California newspaper , " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position . "
" When you wink and nod at offensive statements , you 're sending a signal to your supporters that anything goes , " Obama chief strategist David Axelrod said , referring to the Clinton campaign 's tepid response .
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson , who just last week forcefully called for Obama to fire an adviser who called Clinton a " monster , " said only that the campaign " disagree[d ] " with Ferraro , who had not apologized for the remark as of Tuesday afternoon .
Aside from Wolfson 's brief statement , Clinton 's campaign remained mostly mum on the Ferraro comments .
Clinton herself did address the dust - up during a brief interview with the Associated Press .
Clinton said , " I do not agree with that , " and later added , " It 's regrettable that any of our supporters  on both sides , because we both have this experience  say things that kind of veer off into the personal . "
" We ought to keep this on the issues .
there are differences between us " on approaches to health care , energy , experience .
Clinton 's campaign manager , Maggie Williams , eventually weighed in on the issue as well , sending reporters a sharply worded statement around 5:30 p.m..
Williams rehashed a comment from Obama during a debate calling for the campaign to focus on the issues .
" Senator Obamas campaign staff seems to have forgotten his pledge .
We have not , " Williams said .
" And , we reject these false , personal and politically calculated attacks on the eve of a primary .
This campaign should be about the leadership we need for a better future and these attacks serve only to divide the Democratic Party and the American people . "
Williams response came four hours after the Obama campaigns conference call , and she did n't indicate any intention for the campaign to distance itself from Ferraro .
" It 's disappointing that Clinton supporters have sought to somehow diminish Senator Obama 's candidacy and his support by suggesting he's in some way being given preferential treatment because of his race , " said Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , an Obama supporter who spoke during the call .
" Any and all remarks that diminish Sen .
Obama 's candidacy because of his race are completely out of line . "
Noting that Ferraro was a member of Clinton 's campaign finance committee and had raised money for her presidential campaign , Axelrod said she " ought to be removed from those positions . "
Axelrod said Ferraro 's comments were part of a " pattern " of negative attacks aimed at Obama .
He pointed to Clinton 's former New Hampshire co-chairman Bill Shaheen , who questioned whether Obama ever sold drugs ; supporter Rober Johnsen , the founder of Black Entertainment Television , who raised the specter of Obama 's past drug use ; and Clinton 's own " unwillingness " to " definitively " shoot down rumors that Obama was Muslim in an interview this month .
Drawing a distinction with how Obama 's campaign handled the dust - up after foreign policy adviser Samantha Power slipped up with her " monster " comment ( she resigned the next day ) , Axelrod said Clinton is all - but encouraging these negative attacks , which he called part of an " insidious pattern . "
Ferraro was the first woman to be nominated on a major party ticket when she was Walter Mondale 's vice presidential nominee in 1984 .
Although she is not a paid campaign adviser , Ferraro is a vocal supporter and has raised more than $ 100,000 for Clinton 's campaign .
The Clinton campaign established near - radio silence Tuesday as the controversy over Ferraro 's comments intensified .
For the first time in more than a week , the Clinton campaign did not schedule a daily press call , and the campaign had released nothing addressing Ferraro 's comments .
As of 3 p.m. Tuesday , Team Clinton apparently had spoken only four words on the matter : " We disagree with her , " spokesman Howard Wolfson told Politico 's Ben Smith .
The press office did not respond to RAW STORY 's or the Hotline 's requests for further comment .
The Clinton campaign 's response to its own dip in some surrogate - boiled hot water stands in marked contrast to its quick and forceful condemnation of Power 's comments .
By 10:30 a.m. last Friday , the day Power 's comment appeared in the Scottsman , Clinton 's campaign alerted convened several supportive lawmakers to discuss " the state of the race , " which translated to slamming Power , an by proxy Obama , for saying , " She [ Clinton ] is a monster , too  that is off the record  she is stooping to anything . "
Wolfson at the time decried that kind of " ad hominem personal attack " and said anyone on the Clinton campaign made a similar statement " we would not be on this campaign this morning . "
Ferraro 's comments first appeared in the Daily Breeze , a small southern California newspaper , last Friday , but they went largely unnoticed until late Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning .
When the subject turned to Obama , Clinton 's rival for the Democratic Party nomination , Ferraro 's comments took on a decidedly bitter edge .
" I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama 's campaign - to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against , " she said .
" For one thing , you have the press , which has been uniquely hard on her .
It 's been a very sexist media .
Some just do n't like her .
The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign .
" If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position , " she continued .
" And if he was a woman ( of any color ) he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept . "
Ferraro does not buy the notion of Obama as the great reconciler .
" I was reading an article that said young Republicans are out there campaigning for Obama because they believe he 's going to be able to put an end to partisanship , " Ferraro said , clearly annoyed .
" Dear God !
Anyone that has worked in the Congress knows that for over 200 years this country has had partisanship - that 's the way our country is . "
Appearing on MSNBC Tuesday morning , Obama adviser Susan Rice said Ferraro 's comments were " far worse " than those from Power .
" I think if Senator Clinton is serious about putting an end to statements that have racial implications , that diminish Barack Obama because he's an African - American man , " Rice said , " then she ought to really repudiate this comment and make it clear that there 's no place in her campaign for people who will say this kind of thing . "

Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad ’s regime is a threat to all of us .
His words contain a chilling echo of some of the world ’s most tragic history .
~ Senator Barack Obama
Everywhere one turns these days , we find a politician screaming about Iran and the dire threat it supposedly represents to America .
President Bush has been spinning dark tales about this for years , his claims dutifully echoed by most of the presidential candidates ( with the musical score provided by Senator McCain ) .
Even Barack Obama , ostensibly the " antiwar " Democratic nominee , has taken to rattling sabers at the behest of his new neocon handlers .
But if we brush away the rhetorical fog , does a tangible threat really exist ?
Is Iran actually a danger to our way of life ?
And if so , what does this threat look like ?
Let us suppose for a moment that Iranian President Ahmadinejad decided that the time had come to launch a glorious mission to conquer the United States of America .
Suppose , furthermore , that he proceeded to order the massive Iranian Army ( actually , Ahmadinejad is not the commander of the Iranian military … but let ’s put that aside for a moment ) to board transport ships of the mighty Iranian Navy ( although Iran does n’t really have a navy , but let ’s put that aside for a moment too ) and set sail .
In concrete terms , how would this scenario unfold ?
If the neocon warnings are accurate , this armada would have to sail out of the Persian Gulf , up the Red Sea , and through the Suez Canal ( though why the Egyptians — Sunni rivals of Shiite Iran — would allow a massive Iranian military force to pass through the canal is another mystery ) .
Picking up speed , the armada would then sail across the Mediterranean Sea and through the Straits of Gibraltar .
Once in the open Atlantic ( though still without air cover or any logistical supply - chain whatsoever ) , the Iranian armada would then race across the ocean , presumably making landfall somewhere in New Jersey ( where they could no doubt link up with their many secret agents posing as convenience store cashiers up and down the Garden State Parkway ) .
Once reassembled on the ground — but still without air cover or re-supply — this force would , according to our warmongering politicos , fight its way across the continental United States , thus completing Ahmadinejad ’s mad plan of global domination .
This is , without embellishment , the actual threat that Iran poses to the United States .
Now some folks might raise an objection to this scenario , noting that Iran ’s threat is n’t conventional , but nuclear .
Iran is , they claim , working on an atomic bomb that could be used against us .
That , too , is sheer nonsense .
First , America ’s 2008 National Intelligence Estimate concluded that Iran had ceased working on a nuclear bomb several years ago .
Second , Iran does not have a delivery system capable of reaching the United States .
Third , Iran knows that its hypothetical nuclear weapon could easily be traced back to Iran , meaning that its use against America would result in Iran ’s immediate and total annihilation .
And fourth , let us once again remember that Ahmadinejad — while he may be crazy — is not , in fact , the commander of the Iranian military and would have no control over this hypothetical nuclear weapon anyway .
The hard , cold truth of the matter is that Iran represents exactly zero threat to the American people or our constitutional form of government .
Its army is small , its navy even smaller , and its air force nonexistent .
Iran ’s economy is in a shambles and its people are increasingly disillusioned with their government .
Even if the Iranians somehow succeeded in developing a nuclear weapon , they have no delivery system , and they would have every reason not to use it against America .
Yet the war drums continue their ominous beat .
President Bush persists with his bellicose rhetoric .
John McCain continues to sing his deranged war songs , and even the saintly ( toady ? )
Barack Obama has jumped on the war wagon .
The only civilized and proper response to this war hysteria is a healthy dose of disparaging humor .
Those who , with a straight face , claim that Iran represents some sort of actual danger to America deserve only derisive laughter .
They are ignoramuses ( or…even worse … they know the truth and are trying to play us for ignoramuses ) .
Either way , we ’ll be seeing those Iranian nukes about the same time that Saddam unleashes his legendary fleet of flying , chemical - spraying drones .
Until then , America should mind its own business and stay out of the Middle East .
As our experience in Iraq has shown , nothing good awaits us there .

You have a large collection of documents , each of which accurately describes a single person ’s properties .
One document , one person .
To keep this light , perhaps you are looking for a compatible bridge partner .
The documents are online player profiles , and you are interested in finding a suitable partner .
The properties for people are multi-valued , there is a large set of properties , and for each property in each document , there is either no value or a selection from a set of values .
One value might be number of years of experience , another might be whether they overcall in third position with a weak hand ( where “ no value ” means the other person did not answer that question and “ no ” means they do not overcall ) .
This is an iterative problem , you have to perform the separation on a regular basis , perhaps once each month .
And each month , there is a new set of documents and persons to classify .
Having performed the classification , you can check the game results at your local bridge club and see how everybody did , both the people you selected as potential partners and the people you rejected .
Describe a strategy for picking the best partners based on their profiles .
A very senior Microsoft developer who moved to Google told me that Google works and thinks at a higher level of abstraction than Microsoft .
“ Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the if statement , ” he said .
Programming Collective Intelligence breaks out of “ thinking in if statements ” and provides practical examples for building systems that reason based on learning from data and behaviour , such as the Naïve Bayesian Filters discussed in this essay and collaborative filters such as recommendation engines .
The bottom line in my interviewing technique is that smart people can generally tell if they ’re talking to other smart people by having a conversation with them on a difficult or highly technical subject , and the interview question is really just a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer ’s judgment can form an opinion on whether this is a smart person or not .
Did you ever take that test yourself ?
Deckard ?
There are a lot of classification algorithms , and this essay is not a claim that Naïve Bayes is ideal for any or all hiring purposes .
But I use it as an example because most people understand spam filters and roughly how they work .
[ back ]
Although this is n’t the subject of the essay , please feel free to use this question in the following manner :
If you find yourself in an interview where the interviewer bombards you with puzzle after puzzle in an effort to impress you with how smart he is , when he folds his arms and asks you if you have any questions for him , pull this one out .
Let me know how it goes :-) [ back ]
Reverse - engineering classifiers can be futile , but one can imagine a question that reveals the person answering it is highly overqualified for a basic clerking job .
Or something .

Every once in a while I read ( or write ! ) something about hiring programmers .
What to look for in a résumé .
What to put in your résumé .
Why _____ is my favourite interview question .
Why _____ sucks as an interview question .
Whether we need to filter the absolute dreck out I ’ve even written one of those _____ sucks posts on my blog , and I ’m here to tell you , I was wrong .
And I ’m going to tell you why I was wrong .
But first , here is an interesting programming problem - style interview question .
I ’m not suggesting it is good or bad , for reasons that will become obvious .
Before we discuss whether it is a useful problem , let me tell you who I ’m interviewing with this hypothetical question : Technical Hiring Managers , specifically people who are technical themselves and are also responsible for hiring other technical people .
Part of their job is looking through piles of résumés , picking out the good ones to phone screen .
What I ’m looking for in a “ correct ” answer is a basic understanding of Document Classification .
Given that we are talking about programming and programmers , a really good answer will discuss things like Naïve Bayes Classifiers .
Like programs that can distinguish Ham from Spam
The point is that someone with at least a basic understanding of document classification knows how to apply what we know about document classification to the problem of selecting candidates to phone screen based on their résumés .
Someone with an understanding of document classification knows how to apply what we know about document classification to the problem of selecting questions to ask in phone screens and in face - to - face interviews , not to mention what to do with the answers .
( And the emotionally nice thing about this is that it ’s an interview question for interviewers to solve .
I could make a reasonable argument that someone who does n’t think of selecting candidates as a classification problem might miss the fact that the things to look for — years of experience with a specific technology , length of time the most recent position — are merely document features with probabilities attached to them .
I could make the argument that they are “ thinking in if statements ” about hiring programmers .
I could go on about how saying a particular job requires “ Five years of JEE ” is an if statement , and one that is far from universal .
So someone who thinks like that is not a good interviewer , that they really ought to be thinking in terms of the probability that someone with five years of JEE will be Ham and not Spam .
Oh , the irony .
I would be arguing that the interesting question is useful because it identifies people who pose questions like that as being bad interviewers !
There are really two approaches to take in selecting candidates .
The first is the approach of the if statement :
You form a model of what the candidate ought to do , work out what they ought to know in order to do that , and then you work out the questions to ask ( or the features to look for ) that demonstrate the candidate knows those things .
If they know this and this and this and if they do n’t have this bad thing or that bad thing , call them in for an interview ( or , if you are interviewing them and they have demonstrated their strength , hire ) .
The second approach is the classifier approach .
Each feature you look for , each question you ask , is associated with a probability .
You put them all together and you classify them as interview / no interview or hire / no hire with a certain degree of confidence .
So is the classifier the same thing as the if statements , only with percentages instead of boolean logic ?
Perhaps we could simply make up a score card ( 10 points for each year of JEE , 15 points if they use JUnit , & c. ) ?
The most important thing about most classifiers is that they can be remarkably naïve and still work .
In fact , they often work better when they are naïve .
Specifically , they do not attempt to draw a logical connection between the features that best classify candidates and the actual job requirements .
Classifiers work by training themselves to recognize the differences that have the greatest statistical relevance to the correct classification .
That ’s the naïvité at work : they have no idea that experience in functional programming is irrelevant to a job writing Javascript : they just notice that the people with FP experience tend to do well in Javascript jobs , so they start considering it relevant .
Document classification systems are trained , typically using supervised learning : “ These are the résumés of the good people .
These are the résumés of the ones we had to fire .
” Here ’s a thought experiment : Pretend you are trying to write a mechanical document classifier .
Let ’s see if designing a machine to perform the process can identify some opportunities to improve the way humans perform the process .
( As a bonus , we might actually identify ways machines could augment the process , but that is not our objective . ) .
If you were writing a document classifier for résumés , the first thing you would probably write would be a feature that updated the training corpus whenever a programmer completed their initial probation :
If their first formal review was positive , their résumé would be added to the “ Interview ” bin .
Otherwise , it would be added to the “ No Interview ” bin .
This is a big , big difference between approaching hiring people as an exercise in if statements and as an exercise in classification .
If you are working with if statements , you only change the if statements when something radical changes in the job or in the pool of people applying for the job .
But if you are approaching hiring people as an exercise in classification , you are constantly training your classifier .
In fact , the quality of your results is driven by your process for training , for continuous improvement .
It ’s a process problem : how do we do a good job of training our classifier and keeping it trained ?
Consider the training process I mentioned above : you build a document classifier , and you feed it the résumés of people you hire after they complete probation .
If they quit or are fired , they are marked as “ No Interview . ”
If they get a lukewarm review , we mark them as “ No Interview . ”
But if they get a good review , they are marked “ Interview . ”
What do you think ?
Ok , thanks for using the comment link to tell me what you think .
Here ’s what I think : this is dangerously incomplete .
Pretend we ’re sorting emails into Ham and Spam .
Training our résumé classifier based on who we thought was originally worth an interview is like training our email classifier based on which emails ended up in our in box .
It totally ignores the good emails that were classified as junk .
To classify emails properly , you have to go into your junk mail folder every once in a while and find the one or two good emails that were misclassified as junk , then mark them “ not junk .
” Our thought experiment has identified a critical component of classification systems : to train such a system , you have to identify your false negatives , just as junk mail filters let you sort through your junk mail and mark some items not junk .
Where hiring people is concerned , what is the process for checking our junk mail filter ?
How do we find out whether any of the résumés we passed over belonged to people worth hiring ?
I do n’t have an answer to this question , but thinking of résumé selection as an exercise in document classification identifies it as an obvious weakness in the way most companies handle interviewing : as an industry , we do n’t do much to train our selection process .
A company really obsessed with hiring well would keep statistics .
I know , I can feel your discomfort .
More paperwork , more process , more forms to fill out .
But honestly , every process is improved when you start to measure it .
Maybe we measure too many things , or the wrong things .
My ex-colleague Peter Holden is a terrific operational manager .
His metric for metrics is to ask whether a particular measurement is a management report , meaning — in his operations lingo — is that piece of data used to make an active decision in the business ?
For example , if we actually store résumés and also the outcomes — whether we hired them , how they did — and then use that data to constantly improve how we select résumés , then that is a management report and that is data worth collecting .
Likewise , we could ask questions in interviews and actually track who answered correctly and who answered incorrectly and whether the answer had any correlation with a candidate ’s eventual job performance .
Does that sound like too much work ?
Seriously ?
Are you drinking the same kool - aid I ’m drinking about the importance of hiring good people and the critical need to avoid bad hires ?
Or let ’s move up a level .
Many people like the touchy - feely voodoo approach to interviewing .
Joel Spolsky calls certain questions “ a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer ’s judgment can form an opinion on whether this is a smart person or not . ”
So maybe the answer to the question ca n’t be tracked in a neat yes / no , right / wrong way .
But you know what you can track ?
How about tracking whether each interviewer is a reliable filter ?
Do you keep statistics for which interviewers let too much Spam through , for which interviewers are so conservative that they statistically must be turning good people ( Hams ) away ?
No ?
I must be honest with you .
Until now , neither did I .
Although I do not speak for Mobile Commons , I ’ll bet we will be discussing it soon .
We ’re serious about growing , we ’re serious about hiring really good people , and we do n’t want to put on the blinders and demand “ Five years of JEE . ”
Which means we want to talk to a lot of people who are “ Smart and Get Things Done . ”
And which also means we need to get really , really good at bringing good people on board .
Which means we want to ask the questions that actually help us distinguish the best from the not - so - best .
Which brings me back to my interesting question above , and why I wo n’t say whether it ’s good or bad .
Because I have n’t trained my filter by asking it of a representative sample and then determining the correlation between a supposedly correct answer and actual fitness for the job .
And the only way to know if it is useful is to incorporate it into a classifier and see if it collects a high conditional probability .
I am not suggesting that naïve Bayesian filters can outperform human interviewers , or that asking fuzzy questions like “ How would you design a Monopoly game ” have no place in hiring , or that an experienced programmer cannot tell if another person is an experienced programmer by talking to them .
I am especially not suggesting that people do not make false statements : many of the people I have interviewed in my career really believed that working on one Java application for two years made them experienced programmers with strong OO architecture skills .
But as stated clearly above , I am claiming that someone with at least a basic understanding of document classification knows how to apply what we know about document classification to the problem of selecting candidates to phone screen based on their résumés .
I am claiming that what we know about training classification systems can be applied to improving the hiring process .
And mostly I am claiming that when we take a single question or feature , like " Years or experience , " or perhaps , " Ability to write Fizzbuzz in an interview , " the correct way to reason about its applicability to the hiring process is to think of its statistical correlation to our objective , not to try to construct a chain of if statements .
If you find this interesting , Games People Play discusses what to do about the fact that candidates will say or do anything to get a job , including lie about their experience .
Remember I told you I was wrong about thinking something sucked ?
Once upon a time , I was asked an interview question , and I gave a very thorough answer , including all of the usual correct answers plus an unusual nuänce , a corner case that most people probably would have skipped .
It cost me the job , as it turned out , the interviewer told me I was mistaken .
I carried that on my back for years , even though the job probably was n’t all that great a fit .
But now , I realize that worrying about answering the question correctly is thinking in if statements .
If I get it correct , then I must be fit for the job .
Not true at all .
There could be a classifier question where there is a strong reverse correlation between getting the question correct and confidence in classifying you as “ Ham .
” The only thing that matters about that interviewer is whether , on the whole , he does a good job of separating Ham from Spam .
Perhaps he does , in which case I was simply one of those statistical necessities , a false negative .
Or equally valid , the question itself may have been highly valid , as was his interpretation of the answer : the only thing that matters might have been that answering in the manner the interviewer expected was highly correlated with job success , and that answering in the manner I did was negatively correlated with job success .
Naïve classifiers are brutal in that way .
They do n’t work the way you expect them to work .
Spam filters give relevance to all sorts of words you would n’t expect .
Or to phrases you do n’t expect ( thanks to interesting work with Markov Models ) .
It ’s a precise , bloodless process .
It is n’t personal .
And for that reason , we really ought to back away from thinking about hiring in if statements .
It ’s a path that leads right towards taking it personally .
As an interviewee , we take questions or puzzles that we find difficult very personally .
We get angry if we are asked things we consider irrelevant to the job .
Secretly , we want interviewers to validate our worth , not just by saying “ Hire , ” but by valuing the things we value about ourselves , which means we look for interviewer to have if statements that align with our notions of competence .
And as interviewers , it is difficult to take ourselves out of the equation .
If we only hire people just like us , we have no opportunity to learn and improve on our hiring practices .
Hiring people unlike ourselves is hard if we hire with if statements .
It requires valuing our incompetence instead of our competence .
Approaching the problem as a problem in classification is our road out of that emotional swamp .
It ’s a process we can explain and understand without being personal , without judging ourselves as people or our candidates .
With this new understanding , I apologize to that interviewer for my criticism of the interview process .
I will try to improve my approach to discussing interviewing and interview questions in the future .

Sieg Heil , thatâs your Hitler reference , which you still canât whip out without some backlash .
Thatâs impressive staying power .
I mean five , six decades on and heâs still the worldâs number one symbol of evil .
Imagine that .
Heâs like the Mickey Mouse of evil .
Except Goofy is Goebbels and Minnie is on fire in a ditch .
Itâs more than Manson can say , that slacker .
He even tried to ride on Hitlerâs coattails with that swastika on the forehead ; come of it Charlie , we all know you ainât the guy .
So Hitlerâs outâ ¦probably not coming back into vogue any time soon , unless itâs ironically or because brown stirrup pants and red armbands make it big .
Speaking of ironic : baby rape .
Again , not a bad sounding phrase .
Almost sounds like âbaby grape , â  which is actually kind of pleasant .
Even switching the words isnât as bad : ârape , baby.â 
I mean , still inappropriate , but it sure sounds a lot cooler .
But baby rape is usually deployed ironically nowadays .
Really the whole pedophilia domain .
Many people like pulling it out as the âshock cardâ in forums .
Baby eating , puppy killing , theyâre all good .
And of course youâve got rape , which is right up there with AIDS in terms of shit youâre not supposed to joke about .
So every smart aleck online simultaneously thought : â Jesus , you know whatâs hilarious ?
The thought of forcing myself , sexually , on a baby .â 
Of course , that thought has to be translated into a wry joke first .
Just post â Iâd like to force myself , sexually , on a babyâ and youâre going to feel the full force of the Internet shouting you down and may even receive a friendly visit from some men who work for the government and would like to examine your hard drive .
After all , everyone likes fucking with people and feeling good about it at the same time , and thereâs not a lot more satisfying that fucking a baby rapist .
Or maybe there is , but only the baby rapist and the ancient Greeks know for sure .
As for Scientology , theyâre kind of in the Bill Cosby class of words , insofar as just mentioning them isnât a killer , but do it enough andâ ¦theyâll be watching .
And you can even get away with it , as long as you only frequent forums that their lawyers donât bother checking out .
I doubt many Scientologist figureheads are lurking in 4 Chan threads ; the Rickrolls alone would make it a futile effort .
But mention them in less - than - glowing terms on Youtube or any other major site , and youâre in for something that makes Internet flame wars look tame : a cease - and - desist letter .
Oooh .
Post enough passionate diatribes against that particular cult and next thing you know youâve lost your social security number , your last eight tax returns are being audited , and way more people than usual stop you on the street to ask â what your crimes are .â 
Now I know what youâre saying : whatâs wrong with âmeh ?â 
It sounds like the sound made by an adorable imaginary animal .
But no .
The sound of meh is the sound of the person who thinks so little of your input , they canât be bothered to type âgayyyy.â 
The person too lazy to articulate their thoughts beyond a monosyllabic interjection , and yet so confident in their opinion that they will casually cast judgment on your entire being .
Donât bore me , they warn .
And when faced with that kind of ultimatum , thereâs really only one answer :
Well , seven actually .

Jonathan Callahan , a Ph.D. chemist who spent 12 years working for NOAA , has created a very useful databrowser for exploring the supply / demand situation in various countries around the world .
Based on BP 's 2007 Statistical Review , it provides a quick and easy way to see the trends for whether countries are consuming or producing , importing or exporting crude oil and natural gas .
The tool may be found at Energy Export Databrowser .
How useful is this tool ?
It took me about 5 seconds to pull up the following graphic for crude oil trends in the U.S. :
Gloucester High School has seen an alarming rise in pregnancies Officials in the US state of Massachusetts are investigating how 17 teenage girls from the same school have become pregnant .
The number is four times as high as the year before at Gloucester High School .
There are reports that some of the girls - none of whom is older than 16 - entered into a pact to have their babies together .
The girls and their families have so far made no comment .
Officials are also investigating the ages of the fathers .
Some are believed to be in their twenties and could face the possibility of being charged with having sex with minors .
It is illegal to have sex with anyone younger than 16 in Massachusetts .
Disturbing
Some of the school 's own staff believe the sharp increase in the number of pregnancies was no accident .
Do n't try to get pregnant - people say they know what it 's like but they really have no idea
Amanda Ireland
Gloucester teenage mother " Some girls seemed more upset when they were n't pregnant than when they were , " Gloucester High School principal Joseph Sullivan told Time magazine .
Local officials say that nearly half of the girls had entered into a bizarre pact to have their babies together .
Dr Elizabeth Guthrie , a paediatric psychiatrist at New York 's Columbia University , told the BBC that some girls might be viewing pregnancy as a fast - track to adulthood and independence .
" It may give you an opportunity for unconditional love and attention from the baby , " she said .
Local teenager Amanda Ireland , a mother who has just graduated from Gloucester High School , offered a blunt warning to other girls .
" Do n't try to get pregnant .
People say they know what it 's like because they have younger siblings , but they really have no idea , " she told the BBC .
David Landry , a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute , a New York - based non-profit group focusing on reproductive issues , said the declining teenage pregnancy rate of recent years appeared to be reversing .
Birth rates for girls aged 15 to 17 rose by 3 % in 2006 , the first increase since 1991 , according to preliminary data released in December by the National Center for Health Statistics .
This trend was highlighted on Thursday when Britney Spears ' 17 - year - old sister Jamie Lynn , star of a popular television show Zoey 101 , gave birth to a baby girl , according to People magazine .
But Mr Landry cautioned against attributing the pact or the worrying statistics to Hollywood .
Recent hits have included Juno , in which a teenager gets pregnant and decides to have the baby , and Knocked Up , a comedy about a one - night stand .
" The trend emerged before those movies , " he said .

What are these ?
German exports to the United States last year dipped by 5.9 percent to 73.4 billion euros ( $ 115 billion ) , the country 's federal statistics office revealed this week .
The fall has been attributed to a sagging US economy , which experts say is facing a sharp slowdown , and a soaring euro .
" That does hurt a lot , " Andre Schwarz , spokesman of the Federation of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade ( BGA ) told the dpa news agency .
In light of the euro 's growing strength against the dollar , the group predicts a slump in German exports to the US this year , too .
US slowdown affecting German economy
While Germany can count on its export - driven economy to perform well this year , fears are mounting that a slowing US economy and the recent credit crisis will have a negative impact on Germany 's domestic economy although government officials insist " there is no reason to panic . "
" Little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " Gustav Horn , director of the Macroeconomic Policy Institute , said this week .
He predicted that growth would reach 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
Germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year .
Threats to Germany 's economy cannot be attributed to a single cause , according to Juergen Thumann , head of the Federation of German Industries .
" It is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling US economy and the financial crisis that are making the situation difficult for companies , " he told daily Berliner Zeitung .
Exports to Poland surge
Still , Germany saw overall exports jump in 2007 to 969 billion euros , a surge of 8.5 percent .
The BGA expects the rise to continue and increase by another five percent this year to surpass the one trillion euro mark for the first time .
Despite the US slump , German exports to other countries saw robust growth .
Among Germany 's 15 most important export partners , exports to Poland last year registered the highest increase , soaring by 24.3 percent to 36.1 billion euros .
Germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports
Growth was also strong in Russia with Germany exporting goods worth 28.2 billion euros -- an increase of 20.6 percent from the previous year .
The BGA forecasts that German exports to Russia will climb by another 20 percent this year due to Russia 's focus on infrastructure investment .
Russia expected to overtake China
France remained Germany 's most important export partner .
Last year , German exports to its neighbor jumped by 10.4 percent to reach 93.9 billion euros .
France was followed by the US , Britain , Italy and the Netherlands as Germany 's most significant export partners .
China remains an important player on the German economic landscape with exports last year soaring by 8.9 percent to reach 29.9 billion euros .
However , Russia is expected to overtake China in the export field because of the latter 's dependence on the US economy .
Seemingly defiant to the end , a former Los Angeles police officer convicted of participating in a home invasion - style robbery ring declined Monday to address a federal judge moments before sentencing , an opportunity many defendants use to plead for leniency .
William Ferguson , a 35 - year - old father of three , stood silently with his hands chained at his waist as U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess sentenced him to 102 years in federal prison .
Ferguson was the latest in a string of ex-cops to be sentenced in connection with the ring , which conducted bogus drug raids staged to look like legitimate police operations
Before sentencing , Ferguson ’s lawyer , Philip Deitch , argued that the 112 years being recommended by the probation department amounted to “ cruel and unusual punishment ” and was wildly disproportionate to the sentences of co-defendants who had cooperated with prosecutors .

The admitted ringleader , former LAPD Officer Ruben Palomares , received a 13 - year sentence last week .
Feess seemed somewhat sympathetic to Deitch ’s argument .
But the judge noted that he was bound by a federal law that dictated a minimum sentence of 82 years in the case and that Ferguson had done little to help himself .
“ There has been no acceptance -- ever -- of any sort , ” the judge said at one point .
“ There is no way to paint Mr. Ferguson ’s behavior as anything that is honorable . . . or good . ”
Deitch countered that Ferguson had at one point told prosecutors that he would admit to his own crimes , but that a potential plea deal fell apart when he said he would not testify against his brother , Joseph , a Long Beach police officer also implicated in the ring .

His brother was sentenced to eight years in federal prison .
Outside court , Deitch said Ferguson , an ex-Marine who served in Desert Storm , had told him that he refused to talk about his brother out of a sense of familial allegiance .
“ I risked my life for my country , ” the lawyer quoted his client as saying .
“ I would certainly do the same for my family . ”
Ferguson had five felony arrests for burglary - and theft - related offenses before being hired by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1996 .

At one point , while trying to cite mitigating factors that might persuade Feess to impose a lesser sentence , Deitch told the judge that the incidents were not sufficiently serious to prevent him from being hired by the Police Department .
The judge shot back :
“ To which I can only say , ‘ Why ? ’ ”
Feess added that he found it “ stunning to me ” that a prospective officer could be hired with even one criminal conviction .

When Ferguson was a rookie in the LAPD ’s Rampart Division , he occasionally worked with Palomares .
The two later became friends , and Palomares recruited him to join a gang of friends , family and police associates he was assembling to rip off drug dealers .
The crew committed about 40 robberies , attempted robberies and burglaries between 1999 and 2001 , netting about $ 1 million in drugs and cash .
Ferguson and Palomares would wear their LAPD uniforms and badges and brandish weapons .
They even stole police cars from the academy to make them seem more legitimate while conducting their bogus raids .
Victims were often handcuffed and sometimes physically assaulted .

At Ferguson ’s trial in January , Palomares testified that his former partner conducted such thorough searches for drugs and money that he used to call him “ a bloodhound . ”
Assistant U.S. Atty .
Douglas M. Miller , one of the prosecutors on the case , said he hoped that the severity of the sentence would serve as a deterrent .
“ It should send a message to those police officers who would commit a crime like this that they will be punished harshly , ” he said .
“ And , hopefully , at the same time it will restore the public ’s confidence in its police force . ”
Though Ferguson appeared stoic in court , Deitch said his client was not in denial about what the sentence meant .

“ This man has to resign himself to spending the rest of his life in jail , ” he said .

The episode began when Afar Ahmed Zidan thought he heard thieves prowling near his home in the darkness , a cousin , Hussain al - Azawi , said .
Mr. Zidan went outside and fired at them , Mr. Azawi said .
Image A man cried Wednesday for a dead friend at a house destroyed by an airstrike near Tikrit .

But the men in the darkness turned out to be American infantrymen conducting a search , Mr. Azawi said .
They returned fire , wounding Mr. Zidan , who rushed inside and frantically called his cousin to alert him to what had happened , Mr. Azawi said .
Then the Americans called in an airstrike that killed Mr. Zidan , his wife and three children , all under 10 years old , Mr. Azawi said .
“ The Americans shot two rockets into the house , ” he said .
The rocket strike also wounded three of Mr. Zidan ’s neighbors , who were taken to a hospital , he said .
Officials from the local council in Tikrit , about 100 miles north of Baghdad , said Wednesday that they believed five people had been killed in the American airstrike , and that they had sent a representative to attend the funerals .
The American military confirmed an airstrike had taken place , but said an “ Al Qaeda terrorist ” had fired at the service members .
Soldiers surrounded the building where the man was hiding and called for him to come out , the military said , but after perceiving “ hostile intent , ” they called in the airstrike .
American soldiers and Iraqi police determined that the man had been killed but did not find other victims , the military said .
Four women in a neighboring building “ sustained only minor injuries , ” the military said .
The disputed killings followed a bloody day for American troops elsewhere in Iraq .
Three United States soldiers and their interpreter were killed by a roadside bomb in Nineveh Province on Tuesday night , providing more evidence that Sunni Arab guerrillas remain active in Mosul despite recent Iraqi military operations .
THE CIA has asked the City regulators in London to investigate suspicious sales of millions of shares before last Tuesdays attacks in America in the belief that the paper trail will lead to the terrorists .
American authorities are investigating unusually large numbers of shares in airlines , insurance companies and arms manufacturers that were sold off in the days and weeks before the attacks .
They believe that the sales were by people who knew about the impending disaster .
The investigators are looking at so - called  short selling  transactions in several financial centres across the world involving shares that dropped dramatically after the attack .
Short selling involves borrowing shares , selling them to a third party , then buying them back when the price falls .
Large profits can be made if a share price falls significantly after it has been sold to the third party .
The Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , the stock market watchdog , was drawn into the investigation because it has a transaction monitoring department that checks suspicious share movements .
The FSA would not comment on its instructions from the CIA , but said that its team of specialists would do all they could to help the investigation .
A spokesman said :  The financial authorities have great expertise in this field and could have a big part to play .
It is something that is incumbent upon us all to look at to the best of our ability . 
Market regulators in Germany , Japan and the US received information of short selling of insurance company shares , airline stocks and shares in arms companies  all of which have fallen since the attack .
Italian , French and Swiss regulators have also joined the investigation .
Munich Re , Swiss Re and Axa , all insurance companies , are also helping the authorities with the inquiries as large numbers of their shares were short - sold before the attack .
A spokesman for Axa , a French company , said :  We have informed the market regulators in Paris that there are concerns about short selling . 
Richard Crossley , an analyst at Teather & Greenwood , a City broker , said that he had tracked suspicious short selling and share dumping in a swath of stocks badly affected by the terrorist attacks .
He said that on the Friday before the attacks , more than 10 million shares in Merrill Lynch , the US investment bank , were sold compared with 4 million on a normal day .
He added that exceptionally high volumes of retail and leisure stocks had also caught his attention .
 Before the attacks there was no pattern to this phenomenon ,  he said .
 The shares that were sold were doing very well and someone was selling them in very large quantities with no real reason . 
Mr Crossley believes that someone with inside knowledge of the attacks could have been making money on its expected outcome for up to three weeks before the terrorists struck .
Raul Castro has introduced a series of reforms since taking office in February The European Union has lifted sanctions imposed on Cuba in 2003 in protest at the Cuban government 's imprisonment of more than 70 dissidents .
But EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner said the EU would continue to monitor human rights conditions in Cuba .
The sanctions ' removal is largely symbolic but still a success for Raul Castro 's new government , analysts say .
The decision is expected to come into formal effect on Monday .
Ms Ferrero - Waldner said the member states wanted to promote change in Cuba after Raul Castro took over as the head of government from his ailing brother , Fidel .
" There will be very clear language also on what the Cubans still have to do ... releasing prisoners , really working on human rights questions , " she told reporters at an EU summit in Brussels .
" There will be a sort of review to see whether indeed something will have happened , " she said .
' Unwarranted ' Several leading Cuban dissidents have criticised the decision .
In a BBC interview , Miriam Leiva - one of the founding members of the dissident group Ladies in White - said the move was unwarranted as the island 's new president had not made any significant moves towards creating a more open or democratic society .
Her words were echoed by another dissident , Vladimiro Roca , who accused Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of pushing the measure forward against the will of his own people .
But the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says Cuba will see this move as a vindication of its hardball diplomacy .
There will be very clear language also on what the Cubans still have to do
Benita Ferrero- Waldner
EU External Relations Commissioner
EU warned :
No treaty , no growth
The EU sanctions were suspended in 2005 , but not completely removed .
The EU has been trying to re-establish a full political dialogue with Havana ever since Fidel Castro in effect stepped down due to ill health almost two years ago , our correspondent says .
But the communist authorities had insisted there could be no progress until the EU officially removed sanctions .
The decades - old US trade embargo against Cuba remains in place .
Earlier , the US state department said it hoped the EU sanctions would not be lifted because there had not been " any kind of fundamental break " with communism as practised under Fidel Castro .
' Cocktail wars '
The original sanctions imposed by the EU five years ago included a limit on high - level government visits and the participation of EU diplomats in cultural events in Cuba .
Most European embassies also invited prominent Cuban dissidents to receptions as a protest against the country 's human rights record .
This triggered the so - called " cocktail wars " where Cuban officials refused to attend , our correspondent says .
Relations improved in 2005 , but the measures were not completely removed .
Since Raul Castro in effect took over from his brother , Fidel , Spain in particular has pressed hard for a complete removal of the sanctions in the light of what it sees as important reforms in Cuba .
Other countries like Sweden , and in particular the Czech Republic , believe the changes are mainly cosmetic , especially in the area of human rights .
EU benefits
In practice , the EU sanctions are largely symbolic .
Unlike the US embargo which has been in force since 1962 , they do not amount to any restriction on trade or investment .
Moreover , in recent years , and particularly under Raul Castro , who officially became president in February , the Cuban government has diversified its international relations .
Venezuela , which supplies billions of dollars worth of oil in exchange for Cuban doctors , and China , which buys considerable amounts of Cuba 's nickel , are much more important trading partners than Europe .
Cuban government sources told the BBC the decision to lift sanctions would benefit the EU more than Cuba since it showed that Brussels could have a foreign policy independent of the US , our correspondent says .

What are these ?
For those who remember the 1992 race , “ character issues ” was the euphemism to attack Bill Clinton for having a troubled personal life .
Has the phrase been applied to Republican candidates with similar experiences ?
Not so much .
It was interesting , then , to see this report in the UK ’s Daily Mail about Mrs. McCain — the first one — who is “ seldom seen and rarely written about , despite being mother to McCain ’s three eldest children . ”
[ H] ad events turned out differently , it would be she , rather than Cindy , who would be vying to be First Lady .
She is McCain ’s first wife , Carol , who was a famous beauty and a successful swimwear model when they married in 1965 .
She was the woman McCain dreamed of during his long incarceration and torture in Vietnam ’s infamous ‘ Hanoi Hilton ’ prison and the woman who faithfully stayed at home looking after the children and waiting anxiously for news .
But when McCain returned to America in 1973 to a fanfare of publicity and a handshake from Richard Nixon , he discovered his wife had been disfigured in a terrible car crash three years earlier … .
When Carol was discharged from hospital after six months of life - saving surgery , the prognosis was bleak .
In order to save her legs , surgeons had been forced to cut away huge sections of shattered bone , taking with it her tall , willowy figure .
She was confined to a wheelchair and was forced to use a catheter .
Through sheer hard work , Carol learned to walk again .
But when John McCain came home from Vietnam , she had gained a lot of weight and bore little resemblance to her old self .
“ My marriage ended because John McCain did n’t want to be 40 , he wanted to be 25 , ” she said .
“ You know that happens … it just does . ”
It ’s quite a painful story , involving physical difficulties , infidelity , and divorce .
McCain ’s first wife insists she ’s not bitter , but clearly the circumstances surrounding her accident and the break - up of her family are an unpleasant subject .
Ross Perot , who paid for Carol ’s medical care and introduced the McCains to Ronald and Nancy Reagan , said , “ McCain is the classic opportunist .
He ’s always reaching for attention and glory . ”
Perot added , “ After he came home , Carol walked with a limp .
So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona .
And the rest is history . ”
Ouch .
Now , I should clarify that as far as I ’m concerned , McCain ’s marital difficulties and adultery are n’t especially significant in this campaign , especially years later .
I ’m inclined to see a distinction made between public and private worlds .
I defended Bill Clinton , and said his personal controversies had no bearing on his ability to be a good candidate and a good president , so I ca n’t very well turn around and say the opposite about McCain , no matter how badly he treated his first wife .
But therein lies the point : if Clinton ’s personal history was a matter of tremendous national significance as a candidate and as a president , then it ’s not unreasonable to wonder why McCain is n’t subjected to the same scrutiny .
I ’d prefer both issues are off the table , but I ’m hard pressed to imagine why only Democratic presidential candidates ’ personal lives are of interest in the context of a national campaign .
For that matter , if and when the U.S. media gives this any attention at all , it ’ll be worth keeping an eye on the religious right .
From an article I wrote two years ago :
Carrie Gordon Earll , a spokesperson for Dobson ’s Focus on the Family , recently made it clear that the adultery issue has n’t lost any of its toxicity among evangelicals .
“ If you have a politician , an elected official , and they ca n’t be trusted in their own marriage , how can I trust them with the budget ?
How can I trust them with national security ? ” she asked me .
Although Earll was reluctant to discuss specific politicians , she noted that a candidate who “ had an affair and then moved on and restored that marriage ” might find forgiveness with Christian conservatives , but someone “ who had an affair and then left his wife ” would not .
And guess who that applies to ?
CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - Recent huge spikes in oil prices are “ crazy ” and unrelated to supply and demand fundamentals as world markets are adequately supplied with crude , the United Arab Emirates energy minister told Reuters on Tuesday .
Still , the OPEC member would be pleased to join in a meeting with oil - consuming countries to discuss runaway prices because they are hurting economies , Mohammed al - Hamli said .
Saudi Arabia will host such a gathering later this month .
“ There is no shortage of crude oil in the market .
Inventory levels are huge , ” Hamli said after speaking at a conference in Canada .
On Friday , U.S. crude jumped $ 10.75 to a record close of $ 138.54 a barrel , capping a two - day surge of more than $ 16 and stunning analysts who saw little fundamental reason for the spike .
“ If you look at prices moving by $ 10 a day , that does n’t make sense , ” Hamli said .
“ That ’s crazy . ”
The UAE has spare capacity and is “ quite happy ” to supply more oil if called upon , he said .
The Gulf country wants the global economy to keep growing and hopes crude costs do not stand in the way , he said .
“ High prices are really hurting the world economy , ” Hamli said .
Abdullah al - Badri , secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will host a producer - consumer meeting in Jeddah on June 22 .
U.S. crude was off $ 2.24 at $ 132.11 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon .
Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research wrote an amazing report entitled And Now for the News … The Emperor Has No Clothes ” .
If you can get a copy , read it .
Starting with the disappointing but expected news that journalism is no longer a service consumers desire to pay for , he moves on to the problems facing Internet video .
He does a far better job than I ever did explaining the failings of Internet video and the expectation of free content .
This is the report I wish I had blogged .
From the report :
Ironically , we are headed down the same self - destructive road for other kinds of traditional media , as well .
Five years into the video - over - the - Internet revolution , we have learned two things .
First ; consumers wo n’t pay for content on the web , so it will have to be ad supported .
And second ; it wo n’t be ad supported .
In the cable TV network world , half of all revenues come from affiliate ( carriage ) fees paid by the Comcasts and
DirecTVs of the world .
The other half comes from advertising .
But in the TV world , a typical half hour show supports an ad load of about 8 minutes .
On the web , early evidence suggests that consumers will tune out – click away – if they are forced to watch more than 30 seconds or so of advertising up front , and maybe another 90 seconds of advertising over the next thirty minutes .
Hulu.com , for example , which has already been lionized by many as the future of TV , serves two minutes of advertising for every 22 minutes of programming ( i.e. the programming duration of a typical half hour show from television ) .
Assuming identical CPMs for web video and TV , and after accounting for lost affiliate fees , a 30 minute program on the web with two minutes of advertising yields approximately 1/8th as much revenue per viewer .
Are content producers prepared to reduce production costs … by 88 % ?
In fact , the actual economics of web - based video are far , far worse than this .
Our 88 % decline ignores the corrosive impact of à la carte on traditional video economics .
In the public debate in Washington , the phrase à la carte refers to the idea that a few strong networks demand the carriage of a host of weaker ones , effectively subsidizing a much larger family of channels . ( From MC :
This is something HDNet vehemently opposes and is working towards ending )
But there ’s a much more important aspect of web - based àla carte that is rarely mentioned –that is , the “ à la carting ” of the few best shows from the rest of the day ’s schedule .
Or even worse , of the best few moments ( news stories ? ) from the rest of the show .
On the web , watching SportsCenter not only robs ESPN of its ability to pull through carriage fees for ESPN Classic and ESPN U ( and SoapNet and Toon Disney ) , it also , and much more importantly , robs ESPN of its ability to use SportsCenter to support the economics of the rest of the 24 - hour ESPN schedule .
And watching just the best 30 seconds of SportsCenter robs ESPN of its ability to support the economics of … well , you get the idea .
Expecting a few ad supported shortclips on the web to substitute for the affiliate fee revenues lost by multiple networks 24 hours a day is lunacy . “
Great job Craig .
The concept he defines as the “ ala carting ” of the best from the rest is the web video consumers favorite feature , but it ’s also the biggest risk to professional video content producers everywhere .
On the Internet , the producers of the most popular content do n’t have the promotional platforms that traditional media does .
There are no lead ins for Internet shows .
So there is 100 pct uncertainty as to how many people will watch any given video .
For those videos that do become popular , much of the popularity is viral , limiting the producers ability to monetize the escalation in popularity .
The Darwinian response to this problem has been to serialize shows .
The hope is that if a viewer liked a show , they will come back for more .
Which of course means they are copying traditional TV ’s approach to content presentation and absorbing all of the same problems .
The constant need to refresh a show is not only difficult , its expensive .
The constant need to promote the show to stand out in an ala carte universe of an unlimited number of shows is even more difficult than it is expensive .
So where does this leave independent video content on the Internet ?
Right in the hands of Google and Youtube and black and white hat SEOs .
The ala carting of video on the net will benefit those who enable the search for content and can monetize that search .
The economics of supporting content will force independently produced Internet content to be dumbed down to levels that create a perfect match for Youtube .
There will be SEOs that come up with arbitrage solutions that will drive traffic to parked videos .
Content creators will partner with SEOs and create budgets that reflect the CPMs they can earn in and around the video hosted on Youtube against the costs of the SEO driving traffic to the video .
SEO support will be the only even marginally effective way to create baseline traffic to a video / show .
Who could have guessed that creating financially succesful video on the net would require the same marketing skills as driving traffic to parked domains ?
Content created by and for TV networks will have to make some important decisions .
Why would n’t advertisers want to be one of only 2 minutes of ads in a 30 minute TV show rather than one of 8 mins of ads on traditional TV ?
Will they pay correspondingly larger CPMs to be online ?
Are TV networks making a huge mistake by putting their current TV schedules online for free ?
If a streamed TV show only has 2 mins of commercials , will that drive some viewers to prefer watching online ?
Will it force networks to reduce their TV show ad load ?
If so , by how much ?
Particularly if and when over the top video enables Internet video to be presented right on TVs .
Will shows be forced to introduce different versions of shows , say with different ratings as a means of differentiating TV from streamed shows ?
The R rated version of Friday Night Lights online and the PG version on TV ?
Bottom line is that something has got to give .
Business as usual is not going to cut it .
The question is whether the dollars the big TV and media companies are creating online from the streaming of their current TV lineups are sustainable incremental dollars ?
Or is streaming the video a collateralized video obligation ?

SmiteWorks Ltd. issues notice of copyright infringement to Wizards of the Coast SmiteWorks Ltd. , publisher of Fantasy Grounds II virtual tabletop software ( www.fantasygrounds.com), has sent Wizards of the Coast , a subsidiary of Hasbro , Inc. , and publisher of Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game , a notice of copyright infringement and demand to cease and desist .
Wizards of the Coast is promoting a subscription - based service , D&D Insider , featuring D&D Game Table ( to be released ) .
One of the six features promoted is a Die Roller .
The graphics for the dice on the Die Roller marketing screenshot are taken from a Fantasy Grounds product , first published in 2004 .
The fact is illustrated in http://www.fantasygrounds.com/misc/infringement.html.
The technology used for the interactive 3D dice is a unique and distinctive feature of Fantasy Grounds and the look and feel of the dice has gone unchanged since the launch of the first version of Fantasy Grounds .
" We are very surprised that Wizards of the Coast , whose business heavily involves intellectual property management was so ignorant on intellectual property rights that it chose to take distinctive graphics directly out of the most prominent head - on competing product . "
Fantasy Grounds
II is a virtual tabletop for roleplaying and social gaming online ; it features an open platform for game producers to develop an online dimension to their products .
SmiteWorks is a recognized worldwide leader in virtual gaming table software since 2004 , headquartered in Espoo , Finland .

I ’ve just found this fascinating study on language and psychosis that found that multilingual psychotic patients can present with either different or less psychotic symptoms depending on the language they use .
It ’s a 2001 study from The British Journal of Medical Psychology that collected existing case studies from the medical literature and reports on several new examples .
There have been previous accounts of bilingual or ‘ polyglot ’ patients who only hear voices in one of their languages , but this seems to be the first study to assess psychotic symptoms using a standardised measure .
This is from the introduction , which outlines some of the curious effects :
Zulueta‚Äôs ( 1984 ) review article on the implications of bilingualism in the study and treatment of psychiatric disorders showed that certain psychotic fluent bilinguals , who had learnt their second language during or after puberty , could present with different psychotic phenomena depending on which language they used .
Most of these patients tended to present as more disturbed in their primary ‚ Äòmother tongue ‚ Äô and as less disturbed in their second language ( Castillo , 1970 ; Hemphill , 1971 ) .
Some patients were thought disordered in one language and less so or not at all in their other language ; some complained of having delusions in one language and not in their other language , and some experienced auditory hallucinations in one language and not in another .
Moreover , some patients who were fluent bilinguals lost their linguistic competence in their second language during their psychotic illness ( Heinemann & Assion , 1996 ; Hughes , 1981 ) .
The case of Mr Z illustrates the marked change in phenomenology that can be observed in such patients .
He was a 30 - year - old patient diagnosed as hypomanic with a history of bipolar illnesses .
His mother tongue was English , and he had learnt Spanish after puberty .
When he spoke in English , he was markedly thought - disordered and complained of hallucinations .
On one occasion , whilst being interviewed by his psychiatrist , he addressed her spontaneously in Spanish , knowing that she was a Spanish speaker .
To his surprise , and hers , he discovered that when he spoke in Spanish , he no longer appeared to be thought - disordered .
He commented on this difference by observing , in Spanish , that when he spoke in this language , he felt he was ‚ Äòsane ‚ Äô , but when he spoke in English , he went ‚ Äòmad ‚Äô ( Zulueta , 1984 ) .
This bilingual dialogue took place within the space of half an hour .
It would seem that in this case and in others with similar differences in psychotic phenomena across languages , the second language may , in some cases , exert a protective function in terms of psychotic symptoms .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York Daily News owner Mortimer Zuckerman has submitted a $ 580 million bid for Tribune Co ’s Newsday daily newspaper on Long Island , New York , matching a bid by News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch , according to a source familiar with the matter .
The Tribune Tower in Chicago , April 2 , 2007 .

Murdoch ’s New York
Post daily tabloid newspaper is the chief rival to Zuckerman ’s Daily News .
Murdoch ’s bid would leave a small percentage of the paper in the hands of Tribune in order to defer the tax hit that Tribune would take if it sold the paper .
The source said Zuckerman ’s bid is similarly structured , but Zuckerman is betting that the deal would be more attractive to Tribune because it could get done more quickly without heavy U.S. regulatory scrutiny .
A representative for Zuckerman did not return telephone calls seeking comment .
Reuters previously reported that Tribune has reached an agreement in principle to sell Newsday to News Corp in a deal that would let Newsday and the Post combine their back - office operations , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week .
The deal could help the Post mitigate its losses and perhaps turn a profit .
Structuring the deal to leave a small stake in the paper in Tribune ’s hands would allow that company to defer capital gains taxes that it would otherwise incur in a straight sale , three sources familiar with the deal and Tribune have told Reuters .
Tribune ’s chief executive , the billionaire real estate mogul Sam Zell , is looking to sell Newsday as well as other properties in an attempt to pay down billions of dollars of debt that the company assumed when he took it private in an $ 8.2 billion buyout .
Though newspapers are viewed as an industry in a state of severe distress , Newsday enjoys an affluent readership on Long Island and the paper is profitable , several sources have told Reuters in recent weeks .
For Murdoch , a Newsday - Post deal could be a decisive move to triumph over the Daily News , which over the years has mostly enjoyed higher circulation .
Rather than banking on raising the bidding price as a sure - fire way to eclipse Murdoch ’s offer , Zuckerman is using regulation as a key point in trying to win the paper , the source said .
U.S. media ownership rules generally restrict companies from owning a local newspaper and a television station in a single market .
News Corp , however , has waivers from the Federal Communications Commission that let it own the Post , WNYW - TV in New York and WWOR - TV , which is based in northern New Jersey and serves the New York market .
He also owns The Wall Street Journal , which he bought along with Dow Jones & Co Inc for $ 5.6 billion last December .
Zuckerman ’s lack of television stations means that he would be able to seal a deal without regulatory delay , whereas Murdoch ’s bid likely would come under lengthy FCC scrutiny , the source said .
There is no regulatory risk , a News Corp spokesman said on Friday .
The company declined further comment .

I 'm a regular Boing Boing reader .
Here 's something that 's kinda strange , maybe you can help .
Here 's a link to a picture of my tongue .
Perhaps other Boing Boing readers can help me out .
I 've had these things hanging under my tongue all my life .
Only recently have they been bothering me .
I 've been accidentally biting them and / or getting them caught on my lower teeth .
It hurts a lot when this happens .
Nobody else I know has these , except for my 5 - year - old son ; I figure it 's genetic .
As an adoptee though , I have limited access to my genetic history .
My birth mother says that she does n't have these .
Anyone out there have these ?
Anyone have them removed ?
I searched Gray 's Anatomy online , and of course have googled , but have n't found anything on this .
Any tips or information would be appreciated .
Anyway , if you could post this , cool , I 'd like to hear what others have to say about it .
In response to community pressure , Microsoft has removed project Sandcastle from their CodePlex website .
This is a temporary move while they contemplate Sandcastles future .
Sandcastle is Microsoft 's answer to JavaDoc .
Though in active use at Microsoft for several years , it is still a very rough project and appears to be no where near ready for general deployment .
Prior to the release of .
NET 2.0 and the announcement of Sandcastle the standard tool was the much more mature NDoc.
Unfortunately NDoc is no longer being maintained .
The most recent dispute over Sandcastle is its non-open status .
Officially all projects on CodePlex are supposed to adhere to an open source license , preferably approved by the OSI .
In reality it has become a dumping ground for stuff that would have been placed in the now defunct GotDotNet site .
Due to popular outcry against having a non -open source project on the site , Microsoft has pulled Sandcastle from CodePlex .
According to Anand , Microsoft is considering either moving the project to MSDN Code gallery or republishing the project with the source code .

While Microsoft was supposed to release Windows XP Service Pack 3 ( SP3 ) on April 29 , 2008 , the service pack only became unofficially available on the download.windowsupdate.com domain .
Today , XP SP3 has officially hit the Release to Web ( RTW ) milestone .
In other words , SP3 is available both on Windows Update and the Microsoft Download Center ( network installation , ISO CD Image , and Checked build ) .
The final build of SP3 ( 5512 ) reportedly includes 1,073 fixes , including every security update , out - of - band release , and hotfix released since Windows XP SP2 hit Microsoft 's servers back in August 2004 .
The release notes for SP3 have also been updated , as has the MUI pack .
Also , make sure you know what to do with your version of Internet Explorer before installing the service pack .
The delay of SP3 was due to a problem XP SP3 and Vista SP1 has with the Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System ( RMS ) .
There is now a filter to block Windows Update from offering Windows XP SP3 or Windows Vista SP1 to systems with RMS .
Although Microsoft has still to confirm the date , SP3 should be rolled out via Automatic Updates on June 10 , 2008 .
TechNet and MSDN subscribers already have access to SP3 .
In addition to the XP SP3 release , automatic distribution of Windows Vista SP1 has also resumed .
Microsoft is still working on a fix for the RMS problem .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Yahoo continued to reject Microsoft's $ 44.6 billion unsolicited bid for the company Monday .
The Internet company is not opposed to some sort of financial deal , but the current offer is too low , chairman Roy Bostock and chief executive Jerry Yang said in a letter responding to Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer .
Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) sent a letter to Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) on Saturday , threatening to offer the deal directly to stockholders if the company 's board did not respond by April 26 .
When first put forward Feb. 1 , the deal was worth about 62 % above market value .
Bostock and Yang pointed to Yahoo's three - year financial plan , its new AMP advertising management platform and the fact that the company recently reaffirmed its first - quarter and year - end outlook as reasons they believe the Microsoft bid was low .
Ballmer 's letter acknowledged Yahoo's search for third - party bids from other companies such as Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , News Corp. ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) and Time Warner ( TWX , Fortune 500 ) , but questioned why the company refused to negotiate with Microsoft .
Yahoo's response also said that Ballmer 's letter " mischaracterizes the nature of our discussions , " and that the threat to take the offer to shareholders was " counterproductive and inconsistent with your stated objective of a friendly transaction . "
The company said it was open to a transaction from any potential buyer , including Microsoft , but that it would reject anything below what it considers " full value . "
The habitat of cane toads is spreading across Australia and the poisonous amphibians are decimating populations of freshwater crocodiles , according to a leading biologist .
Dr Mike Letnic , of Sydney University , says scores of crocodiles in the tropical , northern region have died after eating toads .
His team visited the Victoria River district of the Northern Territory .
" [ In 2006 ] we counted more than 600 crocodiles and in 2007 we counted less than 400 , " he said .
" There were dead crocs everywhere .
The only thing that had changed between visits was that cane toads had moved through the river system . "
Letnic said examination of the crocodile carcasses showed they had eaten cane toads .
" Crocs do n't ask questions when looking for a meal , " he said .
" We think there were big concentrations of toads . "
Letnic , who presented his research at the Australasian Vertebrate Pest conference , said the small size of freshwater crocodiles made them vulnerable as they feed more often , and on smaller prey than the larger saltwater species .
Cane toads were introduced from South America to combat beetles infesting sugarcane .
They had little effect but bred prolifically and proved an environmental peril , with their toxin killing native animals .

In an interview today , an official from the American Jewish Committee would not criticize Pastor John Hagee for his explication , in a recently resurfaced sermon , of Hitler as a “ hunter ” sent by God to drive European Jews to Palestine .
Rabbi Gary Greenebaum , AJC ’s US Director of Interreligious Affairs , told me that he accepted Hagee ’s “ clarification ” of the sermon , which John McCain condemned as “ crazy and unacceptable ” last week .
“ I guess I feel like I do n’t really know how to understand that sermon .
I guess I understand that he was trying to say that people can be an instrument of God ’s will , but in the throes of the passion of giving the sermon , perhaps he did n’t stop and think what that meant , ” Greenebaum said .
“ But at least now , under reflection and under the current circumstances , he seems to be saying something very different .
His statement of clarification I do n’t have much of a beef with as a free - standing statement . ”
But as the Huffington Post accurately reported last week , Hagee ’s clarification does n’t actually include an apology or a disavowal of the sermon .
Here ’s the tape of the sermon at issue , in which Hagee also says that “ They [ the Jewish people ] are physically alive but they ’re not spiritually alive . ”
Here ’s the question I set out to answer last week : would the most prominent Jewish and “ pro-Israel ” groups in the country finally take Hagee to task for his outrageous comments and for seeing Jews primarily in terms of their role in his eschatology ?
The short answer is no .
I submitted requests for comment about Hagee and his sermon to three organizations : the American Jewish Committee , the Anti-Defamation League , and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
The first two groups closely monitor anti-Semitism and regularly issue statements decrying insensitivity to Jews by prominent figures like Hagee .
As for AIPAC , Hagee had a prominent speaking role at its annual policy conference last year .
And David Brog , executive director of Christians United for Israel , the organization of which Hagee is founder and national chairman , is slated to speak at AIPAC ’s 2008 policy conference next month .
Hagee ’s various anti-Semitic statements have actually been known for several years , as Max Blumenthal has reported .
But given that the pastor ’s “ Hitler was a hunter ” tour de force is making national headlines and drawing criticism from a presumptive presidential nominee ( and even some leaders in the Reform community ) , this seems like a perfect time for the ADL , AJC , and AIPAC to denounce Hagee , or , at the very least , his comments .
The ADL and AIPAC , to my knowledge , have not commented on Hagee ’s sermon and they did n’t respond to my requests .
Asked about Hagee ’s statement that Jews are “ not spiritually alive , ” AJC ’s Greenebaum told me today : “ I do n’t know what that means .
The statements that I ’ve read of his in recent times are actually very respectful of Jews , of the Jewish people , of Jewish religion .
The question is , how do you get from there 10 years ago to where he is now .
Is he that much of an evolving personality ?
Is his theology evolving ?
I do n’t know the answer to that question — I ’d like to know . ”
Asked whether he thought Hagee ’s statement was anti-Semitic , Greenebaum said : “ Well , in 1998 , or whenever he said whatever he said , I was n’t aware of him or his statement .
I can only deal with the man as he is today .
So if he wants to tell me that the refined statement or the clarification is what he believes , which is what he says he believes , how do I judge him otherwise , frankly , as a member of the clergy to a member of the clergy ? ”
The enduring lesson here is that you can say almost whatever you want about Jews or the Holocaust , as long as you ’re perceived as a supporter of Israel .
As the ADL’s Abe Foxman put it last year : “ I think there is a role for [ Pastor John Hagee ] .
He has earned a certain recognition with the community because of his support for Israel . ”

I have many vehicles which I use to travel across the world and to many exotic destinations where most people cannot go , because they are so poor .
They have very little in dollars , but I , myself , I have very many dollars .
Also , I am sexy for a man .
I like to think that if I was a woman , I would be a playboy model .
But since I am a man I am like the opposite of all that , the man version .
In my vehicles I have stored many bottles of rare , delicious wines .
These wines are hundreds of years old and covered in dust and cobwebs , which means that they are the most delicious kind , and that they were grown from grapes which were so succulent and juicy that the poor grape - pickers of France wanted to eat them right then and there .
But they were whipped , by my shift - leader vintner , who makes sure that the best grapes in my vineyard go only into the wine .
That 's right , my great grandfather , who was also rich , owned the vineyard where this wine was made .
And it 's really strong too , it can get you wasted quickly .
I am a big time gamer in the real estate market .
I speculate and consolidate my wins and losses into pure profit , keeping my blue chips in the black , playing the lady stock market , teasing and tempting her , always with my eyes on the wall street journals and calling my broker on my diamond plated iphone , which I have the most expensive plan of .
I call Steve Jobs on it , and when he answers , I 'm like , " Who are you ?
I do n't know who you are because I am so rich and cool , and only nerds know who you are .
" Then I hang up on him and laugh , lighting a big fat stogie with $ 300 dollars cash , which I just happened to have in my pocket because it 's chump change to me .
But I have a tender side .
Sometimes , I see a hobo .
And when I see the hobo , I think to myself , " This man is poor .
His monetary value is low , and my monetary value is high , and it's a shame that he is himself .
What can I do ?
" I ask the hobo if he would rather have booze or money to buy booze .
If he says he wants the money , I do n't give it to him because I know he 'll buy booze with it .
But if he says he wants the booze , I give him the money because I value honesty , even among lying hobos .
You may be asking yourself at this point , why is this rich man posting on a message board when he can have any woman he wants at any time he wants her , just by showing her how much money he has in his shoe ?
The answer is that I want to date someone who does n't know that I am rich .
I want to be anonymous .
Only when we have fallen in love will I reveal to you that I am rich .
That is why we must meet through this message board .
On our first date , I will wear normal clothes like from Wal - mart , that most people wear .
And I will turn on the music on my stereo , when I 'm picking you up , and it will play " Jamie 's Cryin ' " , just like normal people listen to .
I 'll sing along as I drive you to the local Sonic and buy you a cherry limeade , being careful not to tip the carhop so you wo n't think that I have more money than I 'm letting on .
By this time you 'll be thinking that I 'm just like you , poor and smelly .
But then we 'll drive back to a hotel , only you will think we are going to Motel 6 .
But then we will pull up to the Marriott , and I 'll smile knowingly .
You might think that I have won the lottery recently , but I wo n't let on .
Then when we get to the room I 'll order room service , again , not telling you that I 'm richer than a donkey 's ass , just coolly ordering some duck l'orange and some fries .
Finally , you 'll be dying to know how I can afford such luxury .
At that point I 'll be like , " It 's because I am rich . " and then I 'll pull off my flannel and be wearing a tuxedo underneath , and you 'll be like , " Oh my God !
You ARE rich . "
And then a helicopter will pull up to the window , with my butler Jenkins leaning out , holding a bottle of Chablis and a towel on his arm .
" Evening Sir ! " he 'll say in his trademark way , and I 'll say , " Jenkins !
Let 's go to Borneo tonight , eh? Can the GoldenDollarSign , " ( the name of my helicopter ) " get us there in time for cocktails ?
" When we arrive in Borneo we 'll land on top of my tallest skyscraper , and I 'll propose to you , handing you a ring made of pure platinum , with 0 % impurities .
I can't wait to surprise you with that ring .
I 'm looking at it now .
Send me an email if this could be you .
Yours , Rich Bigdollars

Activists planning protests at the forthcoming Democratic National Convention in Denver are wary of a police weapon they refer to as " Crap Cannon . "
Luckily for them , it does n't exist .
Fox News filed this report :
Also called “ Brown Note , ” [ the cannon ] is believed to be an infrasound frequency that debilitates a person by making them defecate involuntarily .
Mark Cohen , co-founder of Re-create 68 , an alliance of local activists working for the protection of first amendment rights , said he believes this could be deployed at the convention in August to subdue crowds ...
Cohen , who described Brown Note as a “ sonic weapon used to disrupt people ’s equilibrium , ” cited eyewitness accounts of its use during free - trade agreement protests in Miami in 2003 ...
His group is preparing against a possible attack by Brown Note and other crowd - control measures by dispatching street medics at the convention trained in treating injuries in demonstration situations .
He should save himself the time .
While the story of a frequency that liquefies bowels has been going around for many years , the facts do n't really back the tale up .
Mythbusters tackled it in 2005 , concluding :
Even after testing a wide range of sub-audible and near - sub - audible noises on him , not once did Adam lose control of his bowels .
Some discomfort was reported however , due to the effects of low - frequency sound on the lungs .
Fox also turns to Mythbusters – specifically Dr. Roger Schwenke , an acoustician who appeared on the show 's " Brown Note " episode – and concludes that " there is no scientific evidence that proves such frequencies cause involuntary defecation . "
You might argue that Mythbusters is not right there on the cutting edge .
For that , you need look no further than Dr. Jürgen Altmann of the Bochum Verification Project , who carried out the definitive review of all available literature on the effects of acoustic weapons :
Evidence for bowel spasms and uncontrolled defecation is even scarcer .
Among all the literature surveyed for this article , the only hint found was one on “ digestive troubles ” observed during experiments with a strong 16 - Hz siren .
These were , however , not specified at all , and the explanation immediately following talked of objects vibrating in clothing pockets .
In the low frequency exposures up to 150 dB no bowel spasms were observed .
The same holds for low - frequency animal experiments .
Here it is noteworthy that also in reviewing vibration experiments no mention was made of bowel spasms or uncontrolled defecation .
Naturally , he gives full references for those wishing to check the facts .
( Altmann debunks a lot more myths about the power of acoustic weapons , many of them dating back to the tall tales of Gavreau 's legendary sonic weapon .
That give us Kate Bush 's fab Experiment IV , at least , but not a lot of science . )
So chalk this up as another example of the awesome power of the urban myth .
But like all myths , this one does have a teeny - tiny kernel of truth .
At 2004 's Republican National Convention , authorities deployed a
Long Range Acoustic Device , a super - loudhailer / nonlethal - weapon .
But they never used the thing , Dr. Altman notes .
" Protesters were at too short distance , so the normal loudspeakers sufficed . "
If you do get hit with an LRAD blast , it 'll make your ears ring , if the machine is turned way up .
But no brown stuff will result .
The authorities might try harder to dispel these myths .
Equally though , they might find that the effects of crowd control weapons can be greatly enhanced by just this sort of fear .

I 'm Don Wirtshafter and I 'm a director of Hemp Oil , Canada .
I 'm known in this market because I was the first person in the natural foods industry promoting hemp products .
I did this 12 years ago , when we had to be importing hemp out of China .
It was a terrible quality and I had some of my old product to explain to people how terrible it was and how much better it could be if we could grow hemp here .
Well , Canada listened and opened up hemp production in 1998 , just when the United States shut down my mill , not allowing me to import seeds any more .
We moved production up to Canada and created a new Canadian company that 's done extremely well .
Steve Diaz :
So that was 1998 ?
Wirtshafter : 1998 .
In 2001 , just after 9/11 , the federal government saw the momentum that hemp was generating in this market and put the kibosh on it by declaring one day that hemp was illegal .
The merchandise in my basement all of a sudden became a controlled substance and a hazardous waste disposal problem , and ( it ) put us out of business .
The industry got together under the Hemp Industries Association , www.thehia.org, and fought the government in a civil law suit .
We won :
We had full , complete , total victory over the Drug Enforcement Administration in the 9th circuit Court of Appeals in California , which has now taken away the jurisdiction of the Drug Enforcement Administration over these hemp foods , which are now properly in the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration .
So , the gates are open , the green light is on and we are doing our sales again in hemp products .
Our company has centered itself on being the supplier of choice to all these other companies , so we have 22 different companies at the show who are buying raw materials from us .
We 're not really offering a retail line of our product .
We are instead trying to talk about hemp in general and trying to find more bakers who want to bake goods with hemp seeds .
This has been the best innovation for us .
The seeds are hard to eat , hard to digest and hard to incorporate into food , but once you take the shells off , they 're like nuts .
It 's like as if you look at pecans with the shells or pecans without the shells .
All of a sudden , I take the shells off ; this makes it easy for any food manufacturer to incorporate hemp into their products .
It 's extremely high in protein and extremely high in essential fatty acids , which is the big buzz of the show .
The protein is special because it 's very self - combining .
It contains all of the essential amino acids in very high proportions and the protein is extremely simple , unlike soy , which is very complex protein .
Soy is very difficult to digest ; hemp is very simple to digest , so it 's recommended for people coming off of starvation , people with autoimmune diseases like arthritis and it's especially recommended for people with tuberculosis .
Steve :
Are there any popular products that are using hemp oil ?
How can I relate this back to the consumer ?
Wirtshafter : French Meadow bread .
Their healthy hemp bread is a huge seller for them .
It 's half their market , I think , right now .
And Nature 's Path cereals .
We 're their exclusive suppliers for both of those .
Dr. Bronner 's is coming out with a whole line of hemp foods and we 're supplying them .
Steve :
So , you 're seeing a lot of momentum ?
Wirtshafter :
Well , yes , we saw an 80 percent jump last year without the court victory .
The court victory came just at the end of our business year , so we would have expected an even bigger jump , except that no one anticipated the victory , so there are n't enough seeds to supply the market .
We 're not even pushing very hard this year for these sales because it 's going to be until October before we really have the new supply of seeds .
This year , we 've tripled our production , or tripled our acreage , and there are a lot of other farmers growing it that are n't contracted yet , so I do n't think we 're going to have supply problems after the fall .
Steve :
You have a supply problem , right now ?
Wirtshafter : Yes , we have a supply problem .
There 's not hemp seed available in the world market ; at least , there 's not organically - grown hemp seed available in the market .
Steve : Organically grown ?
Wirtshafter : About 75 percent of our business is in growing .
This market pretty well demands certified organic when it 's available .
Hemp is extremely easy to grow certified organic .
Hemp is known for being resistant to insects and pests and other diseases .
Steve :
Is that why it 's good taste - wise ?
Wirtshafter : Oh , yes .
It 's very nutty .
It has kind of a wholesome flavor .
It 's great for salad dressings .
This industry is fairly hemp - friendly from its roots .
People come and see this and say , " It 's about time ! "
But people also know us because we 've been at this show for 10 years in a row .
This is the first year we 've got a real business going , you know ?
We 've got profitability .
This is the first year that I feel like I 'm really a business person here .
For years , it was promotional and it was something we had to subsidize .
Now , we 're bankable .
We 're about to build a huge mill to expand our business and to meet the demand .
Steve : I appreciate you taking a few minutes here .
Wirtshafter : Sure .
Neuroscientists trying to untangle the riddle of desire and sexual pleasure in the brain have discovered something that turns conventional wisdom on its head .
Though most people believe that men are less emotional about sex than women are , the neurology of orgasm says otherwise , at least according to an intriguing article in Scientific American .
During orgasm , men experience heightened activity in the emotion - processing centers of the brain .
But women 's brains , say researchers , are shut down in emotion - processing regions during arousal and orgasm .
Scientific American's Martin Portner writes :
[ Looking at the brains of orgasming men using a PET scanner ] scientists also saw heightened activity in brain regions involved in memory - related imagery and in vision itself , perhaps because the volunteers used visual imagery to hasten orgasm .
The anterior part of the cerebellum also switched into high gear .
The cerebellum has long been labeled the coordinator of motor behaviors but has more recently revealed its role in emotional processing .
Thus , the cerebellum could be the seat of the emotional components of orgasm in men , perhaps helping to coordinate those emotions with planned behaviors .
The amygdala , the brain 's center of vigilance and sometimes fear , showed a decline in activity at ejaculation , a probable sign of decreasing vigilance during sexual performance .
To find out whether orgasm looks similar in the female brain , [ neuroscientist Gert ]
Holstege 's team asked the male partners of 12 women to stimulate their partner 's clitoris — the site whose excitation most easily leads to orgasm — until she climaxed , again inside a PET scanner .
Not surprisingly , the team reported in 2006 , clitoral stimulation by itself led to activation in areas of the brain involved in receiving and perceiving sensory signals from that part of the body and in describing a body sensation — for instance , labeling it " sexual . "
But when a woman reached orgasm , something unexpected happened : much of her brain went silent .
Some of the most muted neurons sat in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex , which may govern self - control over basic desires such as sex .
Decreased activity there , the researchers suggest , might correspond to a release of tension and inhibition .
The scientists also saw a dip in excitation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , which has an apparent role in moral reasoning and social judgment — a change that may be tied to a suspension of judgment and reflection .
Brain activity fell in the amygdala , too , suggesting a depression of vigilance similar to that seen in men , who generally showed far less deactivation in their brain during orgasm than their female counterparts did .
" Fear and anxiety need to be avoided at all costs if a woman wishes to have an orgasm ; we knew that , but now we can see it happening in the depths of the brain , " Holstege says .
He went so far as to declare at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development : " At the moment of orgasm , women do not have any emotional feelings . "
Turkish government pledges new attacks on workers
By Sinan Ikinci
15 May 2008
On May 9 , the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) convened and completed the seventh review of its standby arrangement with Turkey , which was given final approval on May 11 , 2005 .
The Letter of Intent for the review dated April 28 reveals that the AKP ( Justice and Development Party ) , which heads the Turkish government , is preparing new attacks on the working class .
The letter notes : “ We have designed and plan to adopt soon a comprehensive reform package to reduce labour market rigidities and the financial burden on employment , which contribute to low employment rates and a large informal sector , ultimately reducing growth .
The package : ( i ) reduces non-financial burdens , including the easing of special hiring and licensing requirements for private companies ; ( ii ) expands active labour market programmes ; ( iii ) eases restrictions on temporary employment ; and ( iv ) reduces employers ’ social security contributions by 5 percentage points , with additional targeted incentives for youth employment .
We have ensured that the cost to this year ’s budget is less than 1/4 percent of GDP . ”
This paragraph speaks for itself .
The new package aims to increase surplus value and profits by allowing capitalists to pay less for hiring , licensing and social security , and by introducing more flexible working — i.e. , increasing the level of exploitation of the working class .
Of course , the loss of income will be funded by the population at large , in the form of either new taxes or new debts .
The letter mentions the recent fierce attack carried out by the government in the field of public health as a concrete example of its determination :
“ We are confident that the budget for health spending in 2008 is sufficient and have adopted safeguards to ensure the spending overruns of the last several years are not repeated .
Specific measures include the following : ( i ) we have adopted tight global caps for state hospitals ’ 2008 budgets on a quarterly basis ; ( ii ) we have used the ‘ discount ’ system to legally settle all 2007 invoices and renewed this authority in March with a view to applying the same system in 2008 ; and ( iii ) we will shortly announce differentiated co-payments for outpatient services with payments increasing with the level of service .
Co-payments will be between 0 and 2 YTL [ New Turkish lira ] for primary care , between 5 and 10 YTL for secondary care , and between 8 and 10 YTL for tertiary care services , with a 100 percent discount for secondary and tertiary care with a physician referral . ”
At first glance , these amounts may not appear significant .
However , Turkey is a country where a 0.20 YTL ( US $ 0.16 ) difference in the price of bread leads to crowds lining up in the early morning to make their purchases .
These attacks on the health service were a part of a comprehensive “ package ” aimed against the vast majority of the Turkish population , and included other measures , such as raising the pensionable age and minimising the employers ’ contribution to national health insurance .
Almost 1 million people in Turkey live below the hunger level , and 12 million live in poverty .
According to a recent survey conducted by the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions , the hunger threshold for a four - member family is 714 YTL ( US$ 571 ) .
The poverty level , which indicates the minimum spending for a four - member family to cover its basic needs including food , rent , transportation , clothing , education and culture , is 2,328 YTL ( US $ 1,860 ) .
The report notes : “ The living conditions of low - income households , consisting of millions of people , have become more difficult .
Food indices display an upward trend in recent months . ”
The IMF letter also proposes even tougher austerity measures for state - owned economic enterprises ( SEE ) , employment and pricing policies : “ To support our fiscal objectives , we will continue to replace no more than 10 percent of employees leaving SEEs and will maintain excise taxes and SEE prices ( including energy prices ) in line with programme assumptions , or promptly take corrective measures . ”
Later on , the letter adds : “ An upfront 16 - 1 / 2 percent increase in average end - user tariffs for electricity was implemented on January 1 , 2008 .
Consistent with our commitment to achieve the 2008 primary surplus target for the SEE sector , we have adopted , effective July 1 , 2008 , an automatic price adjustment mechanism ... and thus create a reliable basis for future private investment in the sector . ”
In addition to continuous price hikes that will hit the workers and other layers of working people , such an employment policy will certainly bring further deterioration in the quality of public services , which are badly in need of fresh investment .
Interestingly , the letter is completely silent about Turkey ’s rapidly increasing unemployment .
According to the latest figures issued by the Turkish Statistics Institute ( TUIK ) , the country ’s unemployment rate rose to 11.3 percent in the three months through February .
This was the sixth consecutive increase as economic growth slows .
At the end of the letter , signatories Mehmet Simsek , minister of state for economic affairs , and Durmus Yilmaz , governor of the Central Bank of Turkey , proudly assert : “ As the current standby arrangement comes to an end , we consider that most of the key objectives set at the outset of the programme have been achieved . ”
Once again , these key objectives for the IMF and the Turkish government do not refer to unemployment .
In 2000 , Turkey ’s official unemployment rate was 6.5 percent , and this ratio jumped to 10.3 percent immediately after the devastating financial crisis of 2001 .
In February , the unemployment rate had already exceeded the level of 2001 , and with the new economic downturn it will be no surprise if it doubles once again in 2008 .
European researchers say they have begun to develop fridges that are powered by a 100 % alloy which will reduce their energy usage by 50 % .
In the last 15 years , fridge technology developers have had to consider what option would be the lesser of two evils .
Environmentalists alerted them to the harmful side effects of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , the refrigerant chemical , but alternative refrigerants require a lot more energy .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
European scientists now claim that they 've found the alternative to both chemicals , a solution that will reduce your fridge 's energy bill by half .
Trick is , they say , to use electromagnetic fields .
No joking .
The scientists work on behalf of BASF , the chemicals company , and a Dutch foundation called Fundamental Research on Matter ( FOM ) .
They are pioneering technology based on magnetocaloric materials ( again , no joking ) .
These materials are a new class of refrigerants and are set to significantly reduce the negative impact of today 's cooling systems on the environment .
Magnetocaloric materials could be highly efficient cooling technology .
Research leader Prof.dr .
Ekkes BrÃ¼ck from Delft University of Technology has reserved five years for developing the materials with the best properties .
He and his team will be working in the BASF laboratories in the Netherlands and Germany to improve the alternative chemicals requiring lower energy levels .
Magnetocaloric materials are solid alloys and earlier research by the scientists has already proven that it 's set to be an attractive alternative for cooling fridges .
" The [ magnetocaloric materials ] warm up in a magnetic field and cool down when the field is removed .
Theoretical considerations show an energy savings potential of up to fifty percent " , the scientists say .
Not only will the technology be applicable to fridges , but because of its compactness it 's likely it can easily be installed in air conditioners , central heating systems and even in computers .
The technology , if it makes the commercial stages , will be staggeringly useful because it 's estimated that 25 % of our total energy consumption today is used for cooling applications , for instance in refrigerators and air conditioners .
A single brain circuit mediates desire and dread according to a new study by the University of Michigan .
Entering a noisy , new environment can instantly flip an emotion switch .
“ We experience desire and fear as psychological opposites .
But from the brain ’s point of view they seem to share a common kernel that can be flexibly used for either one , ” said Kent Berridge , a U - M psychology professor who oversees U - M’s Affective Neuroscience & Biopsychology Lab .
“ This brain limbic circuit can retune its emotional functions from moment to moment , according to situation .
“ In some human disorders , this brain circuit might be more permanently retuned by pathology that unbalances the flexible circuit .
For example , this same circuit might produce persistent desires in addiction , but fearful emotions in schizophrenia or phobias . ”
The study is featured in the April issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience .
The nucleus accumbens is a brain structure mediating pleasure and desire for rewards that also participates in feelings of fear .
U- M psychology researchers found the same group of neurons can flip back and forth , generating either a strong desire for food or an intense fear , depending on the mood of the situation when the neurons are activated .
U -M psychology researchers Sheila Reynolds and Berridge used a painless microinjection technique to put a tiny droplet of a drug ( DNQX ) into about a cubic millimeter of a rat ’s nucleus accumbens ( in the front base of the brain ) that was processing signals from the cortex .
The droplet chemically tapped a key on a limbic keyboard to generate either a positive desire to consume reward or a negative fear , depending on its exact location in nucleus accumbens .
If the tap was placed at the front of the brain structure , a positive desire for food and drink was generated , and the rats ate over eight times their normal amount of food .
In the back of the structure , a negative fearful emotion was generated , and the rats displayed fearful behaviors that they would otherwise show naturally only to a threat such as a predator snake or a scorpion .
Researchers found emotions produced by keys in the middle could be retuned by varying the mood of the situation .
They administered the same droplets of drug in either the comfortable environment of the rat ’s own home or in a more stressful laboratory environment that included bright lights and loud punk rock music performed by one - time U - M student Iggy Pop .
Normally , the rats would rather be at home than in the bright lights and music .
In the new environments , many keys of the nucleus accumbens keyboard flipped the emotions they generated .
When given in the comfortable home situation , the drug droplets generated only positive desires in nearly the entire nucleus accumbens .
But in the stressfully loud and bright situation , most of the structure generated intense fear in response to the same droplet .
The findings indicate that the same brain circuit can flip emotional modes to cause either desire or fear .

Bell , one of the Canadian ISPs known for its BitTorrent throttling practices , launched its very own video download store this week .
So , efficient BitTorrent is throttled for being a bandwidth hog , but customers are still able to download movies at full speed - as long as they use Bell 's service , that is .
In their recently launched video download store Bell offers movies to own for $ 4.99 , and rentals for $ 1.99 .
At the same time however , customers of BitTorrent ’s video store – a direct competitor to Bell ’s store – and BitTorrent users in general see their traffic being throttled .
Why ?
Bell says there is not enough bandwidth available .
The claim that there is not enough bandwidth to go round is suspicious to say the least , and Bell ’s response to this data crisis is even more puzzling .
Instead of investing money in their network capacity , they simply slow down the connections of their subscribers while ignoring the source of the problem .
To top it off , Bell decided to launch a competing video download service .
So while they throttle customers using the efficient BitTorrent protocol because they supposedly generate too much traffic , Bell launches a bandwidth - hogging download store of their own .
Not only does this seem unfair to their own customers , it also negatively affects other video services that base their business model on BitTorrent .
The throttling efforts by Bell and other ISPs actually hurt companies such as BitTorrent Inc and Vuze .
These companies both offer products that depend on BitTorrent and they become pretty much worthless when BitTorrent traffic is throttled .
Since
Bell now has its own video store , the ISP is actively degrading the service their BitTorrent based competitors offer .
That is ,
Bell users will probably not choose a video download service based on BitTorrent because they can get only a few kilobits per second when the network is “ busy ” .
Instead of investing in more Internet gateway capacity and peering agreements , Bell instead chooses to launch a video store .
Perhaps it ’s time for Bell and other ISPs to think ahead – BitTorrent is not going away and there will only be more ‘ bandwidth hogging ’ services in the future .
Or maybe this just an anti-competitive move by Bell ?
BOGOTÁ , Colombia  Files provided by Colombian officials from computers they say were captured in a cross - border raid in Ecuador this month appear to tie Venezuela ’s government to efforts to secure arms for Colombia ’s largest insurgency .
Officials taking part in Colombia ’s investigation of the computers provided The New York Times with copies of more than 20 files , some of which also showed contributions from the rebels to the 2006 campaign of Ecuador ’s leftist president , Rafael Correa .
If verified , the files would offer rare insight into the cloak - and - dagger nature of Latin America ’s longest - running guerrilla conflict , including what appeared to be the killing of a Colombian government spy with microchips implanted in her body , a crime apparently carried out by the rebels in their jungle redoubt .
The files would also potentially link the governments of Venezuela and Ecuador to the leftist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , which the United States says is a terrorist group and has fought to overthrow Colombia ’s government for four decades .
With treatment and continuous assistance , individuals with alcohol addiction can improve .
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol addiction state just 8.4 percent of grownups with an alcohol usage condition gets assisted in a specific treatment center .
The rest get no assistance at all , or they attempt to recuperate with the aid of programs that have not been particularly shown to help with alcohol addiction healing .
If they understood how the treatment worked and what they need to ask themselves and their neighborhoods as they recuperate , maybe more individuals would get assist .
Step 1 : Identify the Seriousness .
National Council on Alcohol Addiction and Substance abuse states individuals with alcohol addiction will address “ yes ” to concerns such as :
Do you attempt to avert friends or relative while you consume alcohol ?
Do battles or dissatisfactions trigger an increase in the desire to consume ?
Do you begin consuming earlier in the day than you when did ?
Do you blackout or forget things that took place while you were consuming ?
Do you remain intoxicated for days at a time ?
Are you experiencing work or household issues due to drinking ?
Have you ever been through a legal problem triggered by drinking ?
Have you attempted to give up previously and discovered that you could not ?
Step 2 : Look Carefully .
An alcohol addiction self - test is infamously simple to cheat on .
As a publication from Twelve - step programs puts it , many people who have alcohol addiction feel that they will one day have the ability to consume “ generally . ”
Many individuals with alcohol addiction might go to terrific lengths to persuade themselves and others that the method which they consume is merely not problematic .
A close evaluation of day - to - day practices might assist .
Here ’s how it is done :
Select a routine drinking day .
Devote a writing pad to the job and keep it with you throughout the day .
Make a note of the time when you take your very first beverage , and just how much remains in that beverage .
Jot down all subsequent beverages , consisting of amounts and times .
Accumulate the overall quantity of alcohol taken in .
You may be amazed to see for how long your drinking day is .
On the next day :
Attempt to begin consuming one hour later on .
Replace one alcohol for water .
Attempt to stop consuming one hour previously .
You may be able to follow this strategy until you have your drinking well in hand if these actions are workable .
More work is required if these actions appear difficult .
You may require aid from a certified specialist .
Step 3 : Resolve an Intervention .
Individuals who cannot carry out a truthful self - evaluation of alcohol addiction , or those who insist they can deal with an issue that others understand is not understandable alone , may gain from an intervention .
It is here that member of the family and buddies come together to make the illness of alcohol addiction palpable to an individual in requirement .
An intervention includes :
Gathering a group of 2 - 5 individuals with a thorough understanding of the problems alcohol has triggered this individual .
Composing letters in which everyone explains the alcohol addiction troubles and a course to healing .
Holding a conference in which everyone checks out that letter to the individual with alcohol addiction .
Step 4 : Get Sober .
Alcohol addiction healing starts with sobriety .
Withdrawal belongs to that procedure , signs can consist of :
Trembling
Sleeping disorders
Stress and anxiety
Anorexia
Headache
Uncommon heartbeat rate
These signs can last for as much as two days , and individuals must n’t stop this procedure by diving back into drinking .
Registering in an official detoxing program can assist , as the guidance offered here makes sure that relapsing is challenging , if not painful .
Some individuals likewise require a medical detox , as withdrawal has been related to seizures in some individuals .
They experience moderate signs that grow even worse with time .
Without medications , this can be lethal .…
ATHENS ( Reuters Life ! ) - A Greek court is considering a request by residents of the Aegean island of Lesbos to ban use of the word lesbian as a term to describe gay women , a court official said on Wednesday .
Shi tou ( not her real name ) , a lesbian , is seen in front of a rainbow flag during a campaign to promote the acceptance of homosexuality in Beijing February 14 , 2008 .

Three Lesbos residents brought the case , arguing that the use of the term “ lesbian ” in reference to gay women insults their identity .
The island of Lesbos , off the Turkish coast , is the birthplace of the ancient Greek poet Sappho , whose love poems inspired the term lesbian .
The island has become a mecca for gay women the world over .
“ The court heard both sides and will deliver a ruling on the case in two months at the latest , ” said a court official who declined to be named .
The plaintiffs , who argue the northern Aegean island ’s residents are the only true Lesbians , told the court the dispute was over identity and not sexuality .
“ Gay women have every right to define themselves as they wish , but they do n’t have the right to appropriate our national identity , ” Lesbos resident Ioannis Achlioptas said .
At the packed courtroom , one of the islanders wore a badge that read “ I am Paul and I am a Lesbian ” and later unfurled a banner which read “ If you are not from Lesbos , you are not a Lesbian ” .
“ I have a hard time explaining to my daughter that we Lesbians are not homosexuals .
My mother , my sister and my daughter are all Lesbians and it ’s incredible the amount of ridicule they suffer because of this , ” Achlioptas told the court .
Evangelia Vlami , representing the Gay and Lesbian Community of Greece , said such fears of ridicule were unfounded .
“ Let ’s stop playing around with words , protests like this are nothing but prejudiced .
The term can be used by both sides without insulting anyone , ” she said .
An attorney for the defense argued not all Lesbos residents were embarrassed and many saw the term as beneficial .
“ The term has been used worldwide for centuries and has even helped the island , boosting tourism , ” said defense witness Themistocles Kefalas .
“ My daughter has no problem being called a Lesbian , even though she ’s not a lesbian . ”
112,000 broadband centres would be set up in rural areas across the country , within a year .
The government Saturday announced a $ 2 - billion public - private partnership to provide broadband and internet connectivity in country ’s rural areas .
Union Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology Jyotiraditya Madhavrao Scindia , speaking at Global Telecom Summit here , said that $ 1.5 billion for the project would be generated from the private sector and the balance would be funded from government sources .
The ministry of communication & IT is also expected to unfold its third generation of mobile phone standards and technology – 3G service – guidelines by June this year .
The 3G services are expected to be rolled out by the end of current year .
The aim of the these policies is to provide wireless telephone and mobile telephone to every household in rural India by 2010 , said the minister .
The popular Google Browser Sync extension for Firefox , which synchronizes browser settings and information across multiple computers , is now an open source project .
Google is distributing the Browser Sync source code under the BSD license and is making it available through a Subversion source control repository on the Google Code website .
This is a major reversal of Google 's position on Browser Sync , and it will very likely save the add - on from extinction .
Shortly before the official launch of Firefox 3 , Google said that Browser Sync development would be discontinued and encouraged users to adopt Mozilla Weave or Foxmarks instead .
The availability of the Browser Sync source code , however , will make it possible for the open source software community to collaboratively bring the add - on to the new version of Firefox .
I discovered that the Browser Sync code had been posted by Google when I was searching for new Firefox - related programs .
Google has n't officially announced the project yet and declined to respond to my request for additional information .
According to the version control system the initial code drop took place on June 13 , a few days before the official Firefox release .
Additional information was published four days ago , including a wiki page that explains how to set up a proper environment for working on Browser Sync .
Unlike the regular version of the Browser Sync extension , which can't easily be modified because it uses heavy JavaScript compression , the version that is distributed through Google Code offers the unmangled JavaScript for third - party modification — 65 separate files with detailed comments and proper formatting .
This is a big win for end users and third - party developers , because it will make it easy to understand the protocol and extend the functionality .
It could even make it possible for developers to integrate Google Browser Sync functionality into other applications .
The scraggly beard , the beret adorned with a star , the intense gaze : it is an instantly recognisable image which has been used to sell everything from booze to T - shirts to mugs to bikinis .
Che Guevara is an icon of the 20th century whose brand has turned into a worldwide marketing phenomenon .
If you want to shift more products or give your corporate image a bit of edge , the Argentine revolutionary 's face and name are there to be used , like commercial gold dust .
The fact that Guevara was a communist guerrilla and Marxist ideologue is an irony of little interest to his capitalist exploiters .
It has , however , become a problem for his children .
Aleida Guevara this week denounced the commercialisation of her father 's image as an affront to his socialist ideals .
" Something that bothers me now is the appropriation of the figure of Che that has been used to make enemies from different classes .
It 's embarrassing . "
A man who fought and died trying to overthrow capitalism and material excess should not be used to sell British vodka , French fizzy drinks and Swiss mobile phones , among other travesties , she said .
" We do n't want money , we demand respect . "
Aleida , 47 , the eldest of Guevara 's four children by his second wife , made the comments during an internet forum sponsored by Cuba 's government ahead of what would have been her father 's 80th birthday on June 14 .
The complaint came amid a surge of renewed interest in Guevara .
The actor Benicio del Toro won best actor at the Cannes Film Festival this month for his portrayal in Steven Soderbergh 's four and a half hour epic Che .
Camilo Guevara , a son , who participated in the forum , said he welcomed the film as long as it was faithful to his father 's memory .
Last month Buenos Aires unveiled a towering bronze statute of the young doctor who left Argentina on a motorbike in 1953 and became radicalised by oppression and poverty in Latin America .
He joined Fidel Castro 's guerrilla campaign against Cuba 's dictator , Fulgencio Batista , and became a key figure in the revolution before unsuccessfully attempting to export insurrection to Congo and Bolivia , where he was captured and executed by CIA - backed government troops in 1967 .
Guevara was a more doctrinaire ideologue than Castro and a fervent critic of " material incentives " but in death he became transformed into an icon of daring and rebellion .
The famous image portrait was based on an image taken by the Cuban photographer Alberto Korda in Havana in 1960 .
It was pinned to his studio wall for seven years until the Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli mass produced it around the time of Guevara 's death .
Korda willingly forfeited royalties but he sued a British advertising agency for using the photo to promote vodka .
Cuba 's government has used the image to promote its revolution and to rake in tourist dollars through state - run stores which sell Che paraphernalia .
Hippocrates said , “ First , do no harm . ”
That time - honored entreaty has implications far ...
Yamaha had exhibited a series of piano design concepts at the Milan Salone 2008 .
Titled ‘ Keys ’ in reference to the defining common element among all these concepts , they explored some alternative configurations or perspectives to the familiar piano – asking “ what would a piano look like if it is used in another context ? ”
At first I did n’t pay too much attention to it amidst the avalanche of visual candies pouring out at that time , thinking that they ’re mainly just Yamaha tossing a few concepts to attract attention and all .
In fact they probably are just that .
But if you look closer at each concept , there are quite interesting and thoughtful details with each of the 7 concepts that deserve more than a fleeting glance – these design details do demonstrate the thoughtfulness , the idea behind the design , and each new design is refreshingly suited for their new calling through various sensitive design touches :
Key Between People
‘ Key between People ’ is ( in your current Internet lingo anyway ) the grand piano brought to the social .
In the traditional grand piano , the lid is lifted high up ( like a bonnet ) forming a formidable visual impact , accentuating the lone genius at the keys .
In this concept , the piano is turned much more into a grand , flat table or bar - counter where people just hang - out , recalling the unifying , social dimension of music that perhaps get forgotten these days .
The players and the listeners are placed on a level plane , giving a more direct and intimate connection between the two parties .
The matte finish also makes the piano look more approachable and down - to - earth , in contrast to the traditional high - gloss piano black treatment .
Key as Gift
Key as Gift looks at the piano that gains connection and intimacy with the owner as it ages gracefully .
The C - shaped band of bent wood juxtaposes well against the friendly and slightly - playful looking design – as seen through the flowery array of speaker openings and the softer , more rounded keys .
As time passes by , the wood will age with a patina and impressions that you ’ve left on it – the special little personal marks that eludes modern plastic gadgets – almost like something you brought out from your childhood .
Key for Living
Key for Living , with its rounded - rectangle silhouette – is more modern looking , having no problems fitting into a typical contemporary apartment or loft .
It seemed to be designed with compactness and versatility in mind .
For instance , it can be stood - up vertically at the corner of your room or something .
Another interesting detail is the speakers which are placed in between the keys and the base – there are a total of 10 speakers and a subwoofer within for sound to emanate in every direction .
I also quite like the row of round metallic button – I think it gives a visual highlight to the top surface .
Key for Journey
Key for Journey is perhaps the iPod of pianos .
Housed like a sketchbook ( with binded paper for the musical genius in you to perhaps jot down the more inspired tunes while on - the - go ) within leather - bound covers , the authentic material finishing and the detailing are very exquisite and sensitive .
Instead of the standard black - and - white , the finishing plays the role in differentiating the keys : high - chrome vs matte metallic .
The juxtaposition gives a harmonious and yet refreshing feel to it .
If you look closer , you ’d also notice the diamond - knuckled metal dial at the side , and also the squarish metallic paper binding that comes in sets of 3s and 2s ( reflecting the arrangement of the piano keys ) .
I think these little design touches go a long way in lending character and demonstrating the designer ’s sensitivity to the product .
Key in Cantilever
Key in Cantilever gives a much more simple and yet sculptural look .
Composed basically of two rectangles – the piano surface cantilevered on the rectangular stand , it delivers a strong visual impact , accentuated by the quality of the extremely geometrical and straight - cut slabs of white marble .
In its simplicity , it is very strong in the visual impact , distilling every element down to the purest of forms .
Key Like Jeans
Key like Jeans again plays with the idea of a well - aged , patina - inducing product .
With a solid dark and smooth walnut body that is oiled to finish , you are reminded of a vintage guitar .
Details like the screwed - in chrome metallic socket where you can plug your cables in , the keys that extend beyond the body ’s footprint , and the heavy and solid feel of the walnut - wood encasement also help to give it the feeling of a classic electric guitar .
Key near Window
Key near Window has a bit of a retro- futuristic look , especially with the dark - tinted glass cover .
Once you lift it up , you get a more soothing - tech feel as the embedded lighting and display shines through the white casing .
The three distinct layers in construction – dark glass , white marble and dark wooden base – also help give the piano very different and distinct appearances .
All in all , as I looked through the design details in each of the concept , I must say I am quite impressed with how the designers modified the little design elements to suit each concept , and the result is a set of widely different designs that appeal in their own ways for their own contexts .
Head on to the official Yamaha Gallery to see these concepts .
I do wish they designed their website as well as they did with the pianos though – the menus seem to be over - eager in popping up in some cases , and I ’d say the short looping background music does n’t show too well for Yamaha ( who are supposed to be good in music ? ) .

The two women have had unhappy experiences with men in the past Pics : Pramod Samantray
A priest belonging to the Kandha tribe led the ceremony between Wetka Polang , 30 , and Melka Nilsa , 22 , in Koraput district recently .
Both the women are day labourers and now live together in Dandabadi village .
Same - sex relationships are outlawed in India .
The 145 - year - old colonial Indian Penal Code clearly describes a same sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
Sociologists say that a community blessing a same - sex ' marriage ' is unheard of in India .
It was not easy for Wetka and Melka to convince their tribe that they wanted to get married and live together - the local community at first fiercely protested at the idea .
The two women then eloped to another village to escape the wrath of their neighbours .
' Unhappy '
After much persuasion by family members , Kandha villagers of Dandabadi finally gave consent to the formal wedding .
We love each other very much .
We are leading a blissful married life
Wetka Polang
" They [ Wetka and Melka ] wanted to prove that they can live without the help of men .
They also love each other very much .
So we decided to forgive them , " said village elder Melka Powla .
But the two tribal women had to pay fines to their community to get it to bless their union - they offered a barrel of country liquor , a pair of oxen , and a sack of rice and hosted a family feast .
Eventually , last month , Wetka applied vermillion on Melka 's forehead in the tradition of Indian marriage ceremonies before a disari or community priest , said village elder Dalimangi Chexa .
Now the couple say they are happy .
" We are leading a blissful married life .
We love each other very much , " Wetka told the BBC .
Both the women have had unhappy experiences with men in the past .
Wetka says she walked out of her marriage to an alcoholic after years of abuse .
Melka 's family had arranged her marriage with another local man much against her wishes - she managed to break the engagement by telling the man 's family that he was mentally " not normal " .
The two women now hope to extend their family by adopting the son of Wetka 's elder brother .
It has been almost three years since the release of OpenOffice.org 2.0 .
During that time we 've seen community fragmentation and frustration resulting from Sun 's heavy involvement with the office suite 's development , and even a third - party online version that provides editing and collaboration features .
Now , the open - source office suite is back with a new 3.0 beta release , ushering in a handful of major enhancements , broader file format support , and a solid batch of evolutionary new features .
Ars Technica takes the new beta for a spin to see if our productivity increases .
Enhancements have been made across the board to OpenOffice.org 's various components .
A new Solver component makes calculating dependent spreadsheet cells much easier ( a bonus for Mac users as Excel 2008 reportedly lost its solving component ) , and vastly improved cropping features in the Draw and Impress apps are indeed more intuitive .
When working in Writer , multiple pages can be displayed at once for a bird 's eye view of a document , and notes ( or comments ) on a document are now displayed in a sidebar , paralleling the same UI found in many other text editors .
Mac users looking for a feature - rich alternative to Microsoft Office can take another look at OpenOffice.org 3 , now that it runs natively on Intel Macs
Speaking of Mac users , a significant enhancement to OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta is that it now runs on Intel Macs without the need for the X11 Unix environment .
Sorry , PowerPC Mac owners — this release is Intel - specific , and not a Universal Binary .
Coming to the Mac in a native form also means that OpenOffice.org has received a bit of a facelift , though it still does n't have the UI of a truly native Mac OS X application .
Still , considering that this has been a long - anticipated release , Mac users interesting in using OpenOffice can't really complain much .
A PowerPoint slide saved in the PowerPoint 2007 format and opened in PowerPoint 2007
Another touted area of improvement for OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta is its support for the ODF 1.2 ISO standard , as well as the ability to open files created in Microsoft Office 2007 for Windows and 2008 for Mac ( .docx , .xlsx , .pptx , etc. ) .
In our brief testing , however , we found this file format support to be a mixed bag .
Most documents saved in the newer Office formats looked fine on both the latest Windows and Mac suites , but formatting quirks appeared in some of them when opened in the OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta .
The same slide in the same file format opened in OpenOffice 3.0 beta
Page breaks sometimes appear in documents where none are specified , and a number of text rendering and formatting issues appeared in PowerPoint documents .
Excel files , however , fared the best in our testing , as we did n't notice any discrepancies between office suites .
We also had trouble with the intriguing new feature of spreadsheet collaboration .
It 's easy to switch on sharing for a document , but we were n't able to get other users on the network to see the document for editing .
Overall , OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta feels like a solid evolutionary update with a handful of new features that will be useful to various niche user groups .
It certainly is still a beta , however , as the suite crashed at least once on both Windows Vista and Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard during testing .
If you want to put a copy of your own through its paces , though , compiled versions for Linux , Solaris , Windows , and Mac OS X ( Intel Macs only ) are available now from OpenOffice.org 's beta download site .
One of the fun little facts that has made Storm , and other botnets like it , so much fun to fence with is the fact that Storm lacks a centralized command and control server .
By diffusing Storm 's C&C capability through the botnet , the worm 's creators made it that much harder to nullify .
Researchers from the University of Mannheim and the Institut Eurecom have been experimenting with P2P botnets that lack centralized control , and have discovered a way to attack such creations from within .
As an added bonus , attacking the worm in this manner allows researchers to measure the number of infected systems much more accurately than they can with other , more conventional , techniques .
The research team reverse - infiltrated Storm by deliberately allowing the botnet to infect a series of honeypots .
Once infected , the honeypots become launch points for the researcher 's own payload .
Along the way , the team was able to estimate the number of infected systems by actively tracking P2P activity rather than passively observing the total amount of spam flowing out of a single botnet .
The research team 's paper ( PDF ) goes into considerable detail and gives specific information on how the team analyzed , monitored , and penetrated Storm 's structure .
Their own counter - attack , however , is elegant in its simplicity .
By publishing their own set of false commands at the appropriate time , the group was able to prevent the " legitimate " commands from being received .
Being able to prevent the Storm botnet from actually carrying out its own updates is impressive , but the real strength of this research lies in its proof that botnets have weaknesses of their own that security firms can potentially exploit .
At the moment , this type of attack strategy is n't a viable solution — it took the team from Mannheim and Eurecom months to fully infiltrate , explore , and develop their counterattack — but practice , as they say , makes perfect .
Future botnet infiltrations could proceed much faster once a framework for launching such counterattacks is properly in place .
Often it seems as though American higher education exists only to provide gag material for the outside world .
The latest spectacle is an Ivy League professor threatening to sue her students because , she claims , their " anti-intellectualism " violated her civil rights .

She is also readying lawsuits against her superiors , who she says papered ...
I do n’t think the following story needs any commentary from me :
Tube Inserted Into Man Who Refused to Give Urine Sample
Kelso , Wa. March 4 – When a man who was suspected of drunken driving in Longview refused to give blood and urine samples he was taken to a hospital .
His lawyer says he was held down kicking and screaming for a blood draw .
And a tube was inserted into his bladder to withdraw the urine .
He sued Cowlitz County .
A settlement was reached Friday in which he was paid $ 15,000 , without authorities admitting they did anything wrong …
A new survey shows that data retention laws influence the actual behavior of citizens in Germany .
11 % had already abstained from single telecommunication acts , 52 % would not use phone or e-mail for confidential contacts .
The problem with surveillance is not primarily that some bored officer might learn about some embarrassing private detail ( although this is a problem as well ) .
The fundamental problem with surveillance is that it changes people .
People under surveillance behave differently than people who are not monitored – differently than free people .
Unfortunately , this fundamental problem has just been proven in Germany .
Since the beginning of this year , communication providers are required to record who communicated with whom and when ( but not the content of the communication ) .
This data is stored for six months and available to law enforcement in cases related to certain forms of crime .
A recent survey ( German ) by the well - known German Forsa institute now showed the social effects of this data retention law : Communication habits are indeed changing .
1.002 individuals have been questioned on May 27th and 28th .
These are the results :
73 % know about the data retention
11 % said that they had already abstained from using phone , cell phone or e-mail in certain occasions
said that they had from using phone , cell phone or e-mail in certain occasions 6 % believe to receive less communication since the beginning of the data retention
52 % said they probably would not use telecommunication for contacts like drug counselors , psychotherapists or marriage counselors because of data retention
And the sad fact : 48 % still think that data retention is a necessary step for crime prevention .
" The deterring effects of this law is life threatening , for example if people do not call a drug counselor or psychotherapist " claims Patrick Breyer of Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung , a network of civil rights and privacy activists .
Thomas Dreesen of the association of German specialized journalists is also worried : “ Against the background of [ the abuse of communication data by Germany ’s largest telephone provide ] it is obvious how easily such data can be abused to spy out journalists and expose whistle blowers .
The law [ … ] therefore threatens the freedom of press in Germany ”
The study was commissioned by Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung [ a network of civil rights and privacy activists ] , , , NULL , eco [ German ISP and Internet Association ] , Deutscher Fachjournalisten - Verband [ German association of specialized journalists ] and JonDos GmbH [ an anonymizer company ] .

Quotable Quotes
Rio's Maracana Stadium hosted the first Pan-American Games in 2007 Chicago , Madrid , Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro are the cities shortlisted by the International Olympic Committee to host the 2016 Olympic Games .
Doha , Prague and Baku were eliminated from the nominal list of potential hosts by the IOC executive board .
IOC president Jacques Rogge said : " All bids were of a high standard .
It 's a tribute to the health of the Olympic Movement that the field was so strong . "
The IOC will select a winning city at a secret ballot on 2 October 2009 .
The strongest contender in terms of infrastructure , support and money is Chicago , which is bidding to host the first summer Olympics in America since Atlanta in 1996 .
The Americans will however have to improve the technical aspect of their bid after an IOC evaluation report ranked Tokyo and Madrid higher than Chicago , with Rio in fourth place .
MIHIR BOSE BLOG
Many will tip Chicago but favourites do n't often win
BBC sports editor Mihir Bose Chicago 's bid chairman Patrick Ryan said there was plenty more work to be done to improve their bid .
" Four cities is better than five , " he said .
" Three would have been better than four .
But we 're very proud to be one of the four .
It 's exhilarating .
" There are a few things we 've learned - do n't assume anything , be humble , and work , work , work .
And we 're going to work right to the end . "
Rio de Janeiro , host of the Pan - American Games in 2007 , would be the first South American city to host the Olympics .
Madrid , meanwhile , is bidding on the back of finishing a close third behind London and Paris in the race for the 2012 Games , and Tokyo hopes to host the event for the first time since 1964 .
" We are very happy with the decision by the IOC , " said Tokyo bid chief Ichiro Kono .
" We are also delighted with the evaluation but we have not seen it yet and we must now analyse it very carefully to strengthen our weak points and make our strong points stronger . "
Doha , the capital of Qatar , successfully staged the 2006 Asian Games and was regarded as a wild card but the city failed to make the cut despite having hired a high - powered team to run the campaign in the hope of making it to the final vote in Copenhagen .
Some of the IOC 's executive board members had argued that a city with a population of around 500,000 was too small , while Doha 's plan to hold the Games in October to avoid the searing summer desert heat proved unpopular .
" The weather was the main reason we were left off the shortlist , " said Doha bid official Aneesa Al Hitimi .
" Qatar are the leaders in the Middle East and we would have staged 2016 perfectly .
God willing , Qatar will make it in the future . "

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- Police in Tibet have arrested 16 Buddhist monks and are seeking three more for their alleged involvement in one bombing and two attempted bombings , authorities in Tibet told state - run media .
Chinese People 's Liberation Army soldiers are shown in the streets of Lhasa , Tibet , on March 14 .
All three cases occurred in Tibet 's Mangkam county during the first half of April , according to the Tibet Autonomous Regional Department of Public Security .
The suspects confessed , police said , saying they had listened to foreign radio and were following separatist propaganda from the Dalai Lama , China 's Xinhua news agency reported .
CNN could not confirm whether the suspects confessed .
The Dalai Lama has said he does not advocate violence or a separate and independent Tibet .
He has said he wants a genuine autonomy that preserves the cultural heritage of Tibet .
Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted March 14 amid anti-Chinese demonstrations in Tibet .
Some protesters advocated independence from China while others demonstrated against the growing influence of ethnic Han Chinese in Tibet and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations .
The Chinese authorities cracked down on the protests , which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising .

Widespread violence broke out across China 's Tibetan region , especially in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa , following a week of protests by hundreds of Buddhist monks .
" Real Buddhists should learn Buddhist scriptures by heart , love their country and their religion , abide by the law , and bring happiness to people , " said Dainzin Chilai , vice - chairman of the China Buddhist Association and vice - chairman of the People 's Political Consultative Conference of Tibet Autonomous Region .
" They should not involve themselves in cruel killing and sabotage . "
Both groups Chilai represents are affiliated with the Chinese government .
The unrest resulted in the deaths of at least 18 civilians and one police officer , according to government figures .
It also injured 382 civilians and 241 police officers and led to the looting of businesses and home and the burning of shops and vehicles .
Tibet 's self - proclaimed government - in - exile put the death toll from the protests at 140 .
At the time of the unrest , roughly 1,000 people hurled rocks and concrete at security forces , demolishing military trucks and pushing back riot police , a witness told CNN , and Tibetans seemed to be targeting shops and vehicles owned by Han Chinese , the predominant ethnic group in China .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O said on Friday a U.S. jury awarded Alcatel - Lucent ALUA .
PA $ 367.4 million in damages after finding that the company had violated two patents related to the user interface in its Windows operating system .
Microsoft , which will seek to have the verdict overturned , said Alcatel - Lucent was seeking $ 1.5 billion in damages related to the four patents named in the case .
Microsoft said the jury found that Microsoft did not infringe on Alcatel ’s video decoding technology patent .
The fourth patent in the lawsuit was asserted only against Dell Inc DELL.O , which was found not to have infringed , according to Microsoft .
Cellular senescence is regarded as a tumor suppressor mechanism : damaged cells permanently leave the cell cycle ( preventing tumor initiation ) , and also secrete factors that trigger both tissue repair and inflammation in the vicinity .
This is probably good at first but bad later on : persistent senescent cells also secrete growth factors and metalloproteases that degrade the tissue microenvironment and encourage nearby preneoplastic cells to progress into full - blown tumors .
Thus , senescence has been implicated in late - life cancer and age - related decline in tissue function .
The “ damage ” in question is usually genotoxic in nature : telomere shortening , indicating that a cell has undergone many rounds of potentially mutagenic cell division , or high levels of DNA damage such as that resulting from ionizing radiation or exposure to chemical clastogens .
Oncogene expression probably also induces senescence via DNA damage , by triggering over - firing of replication origins and generating broken ends and weird chromatin structures that are interpreted as damage .
Now it appears that falling cellular ATP levels may also result in cellular senescence .
Unterluggauer et al. report that inhibition of glutaminolysis ( preventing cells from generating ATP from glutamine , an unglamorous and occasionally overlooked pathway that is nonetheless an important energy source in many cellular lineages ) results in increased senescence in human vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) :
Premature senescence of human endothelial cells induced by inhibition of glutaminase Cellular senescence is now recognized as an important mechanism of tumor suppression , and the accumulation of senescent cells may contribute to the aging of various human tissues .
Alterations of the cellular energy metabolism are considered key events in tumorigenesis and are also known to play an important role for aging processes in lower eukaryotic model systems .
In this study , we addressed senescence - associated changes in the energy metabolism of human endothelial cells , using the HUVEC model of in vitro senescence .
We observed a drastic reduction in cellular ATP levels in senescent endothelial cells .
Although consumption of glucose and production of lactate significantly increased in senescent cells , no correlation was found between both metabolite conversion rates , neither in young endothelial cells nor in the senescent cells , which indicates that glycolysis is not the main energy source in HUVEC .
On the other hand , glutamine consumption was increased in senescent HUVEC and inhibition of glutaminolysis by DON , a specific inhibitor of glutaminase , led to a significant reduction in the proliferative capacity of both early passage and late passage cells .
Moreover , inhibition of glutaminase activity induced a senescent - like phenotype in young HUVEC within two passages .
Together , the data indicate that glutaminolysis is an important energy source in endothelial cells and that alterations in this pathway play a role in endothelial cell senescence .
The authors provide good evidence that endothelial cells rely heavily on glutaminolysis , and that removal of this energy source both drastically reduces cellular ATP levels and results in a “ senescent - like ” growth arrest .
They then show fairly convincingly that this arrest is very similar to the arrest induced by telomere shortening , DNA damage or oncogene expression ( i.e. , cellular senescence ) — in particular , by demonstrating that the arrested HUVECs express a panoply of senescence - associated gene expression and cytological markers .
No word , as far as I could tell , on the reversibility of the arrest upon resumption of glutaminolysis ( irreversibility is a hallmark of senescence ) ; I mention this because growth arrest is a fairly obviously sensible response to an energy deficit , but it ’s not clear why it ought to be permanent .
The reason I ’m interested in this paper is that it might point toward a unifying principle underlying two major subjects within the field of biogerontology — cellular senescence and sirtuins — which both receive a great deal of individual attention but so far have not been demonstrated to have much to do with one another .
Sirtuins such as SIRT1 are regulated by cellular energy state ( in particular , by the NAD + / NADH ratio ) ; if it turns out that perturbations in the cellular energy budget are an important means of senescence induction , it might be interesting to take a closer look and see whether sirtuin signaling might influence the establishment of cellular senescence .
Backups
© 2007 Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
Hello , this is a public service announcement .
I am here to tell you about backups .
It 's very simple .
Option 1 : Learn not to care about your data .
Do n't save any old email , use a film camera , and only listen to physical CDs and not MP3s .
If you have no posessions , you have nothing to lose .
Option 2 goes like this :
You have a computer .
It came with a hard drive in it .
Go buy two more drives of the same size or larger .
If the drive in your computer is SATA2 , get SATA2 .
If it 's a 2.5 " laptop drive , get two of those .
Brand does n't matter , but physical measurements and connectors should match .
Get external enclosures for both of them .
The enclosures are under $ 30 .
Put one of these drives in its enclosure on your desk .
Name it something clever like " Backup " .
If you are using a Mac , the command you use to back up is this : sudo rsync - vax -- delete -- ignore - errors / / Volumes / Backup /
If you 're using Linux , it 's something a lot like that .
If you 're using Windows , go fuck yourself .
If your version of rsync supports the -- xattrs and -- acls options ( it probably does ) , use those too .
and options ( it probably does ) , use those too .
If you have a desktop computer , have this happen every morning at 5 AM by creating a temporary text file containing this line : 0 5 * * * rsync -vax -- delete -- ignore - errors / / Volumes / Backup / and then doing sudo crontab -u root that - file
If you have a laptop , do that before you go to bed .
Really .
Every night when you plug your laptop in to charge .
If you 're on a Mac , that backup drive will be bootable .
That means that when ( WHEN ) your internal drive scorches itself , you can just take your backup drive and put it in your computer and go .
This is nice .
That means that when ( WHEN ) your internal drive scorches itself , you can just take your backup drive and put it in your computer and go .
This is nice .
When ( WHEN ) your backup drive goes bad , which you will notice because your last backup failed , replace it immediately .
This is your number one priority .
Do n't wait until the weekend when you have time , do it now , before you so much as touch your computer again .
Do it before goddamned breakfast .
The universe tends toward maximum irony .
Do n't push it .
your computer again .
Do it before goddamned breakfast .
The universe tends toward maximum irony .
Do n't push it .
That third drive ?
Do a backup onto it the same way , then take that to your office and lock it in a desk .
Every few months , bring it home , do a backup , and immediately take it away again .
This is your " my house burned down " backup .
" OMG , three drives is so expensive !
That sounds like a hassle ! "
Shut up .
I know things .
You will listen to me .
Do it anyway .
Addendum A :
Mac users : for the backup drive to be bootable , you need to do two things :
When you first format the drive , set the partition type to " GUID " , not " Apple Partition Map " ;
Before doing your first backup , Get Info on the drive and un-check " Ignore ownership on this drive " under " Ownership and permissions . "
You can test whether it 's bootable by holding down Option while booting and selecting the external drive .
Addendum B :
RAID is a waste of your goddamned time and money .
Is your personal computer a high - availability server with hot - swappable drives ?
No ?
Then you do n't need RAID .
RAID is not a backup solution .
Even if you use RAID , you still need backups .
Addendum C :
Hi , it 's 12 years later and the above advice is all still valid !
However , in the intervening years two things have changed for Mac users :
Apple has made it damned near impossible for you to replace the hard drive inside your computer , even if you are relatively good at such things ; and Time Machine exists and is pretty good .
It uses rsync underneath .
So if you have a Mac , just use Time Machine on both your dedicated external backup drive , and on your off - site backup drive .
First you must find a place to eat .
Then try Star Fish fried in Shark Oil .
On to Baby Sharks , Deep Fried Star Fish and Sea Urchins .
The appetizers continue with Turkey Vulture Schnitzels , Sea Snakes and Silk Worms .
Ohhh whats the smell ?
Could it be Grilled Snake ?
Yes , yes it could !
Theres more to this feast when we enjoy Dog Liver and veggies .
Ahhhh the feast de la resistance – Goat Lungs and Red Peppers .
With your choice of Cow Stew or Horse Stew !
Or perhaps a bowl or Dog Brain Soup for the canine lovers out there .
For dessert we ’re enjoying Lizard Legs & Scorpion Brochettes .
Be sure to ask the Sous Chef to pack up a doggy bag of Black Scorpions , Silk Worms , Dung Beetles and Cicadas
Oh !
I almost forgot how much grandma loves Grilled Snake .
Two please .
Not too long ago , users on the Neowin.net forums started complaining about not being able to send YouTube links to their contacts on Windows Live Messenger .
I was skeptic at first , but it did n’t take me very long to confirm that is indeed the case .
As you can see , any messages that contain in text or links to “ www.youtube.com” fails to be delivered .
Curious as a cat , I loaded up a network packet sniffer to find out exactly what ’s going on behind the scenes .
Technically , the message packets are in fact sent to the Messenger servers ( so it ’s not being blocked at your client ) , but the server sends back a negative acknowledgment ( NAK ) packet instead of an acknowledgment ( ACK ) packet .
Simply speaking , the server is refusing the message .
As some people may recall , in 2006 there was a report quoting MSN Sweden admitting Microsoft is “ censoring ” messages it deems a security threat .
How it does this is by matching messages with a known list of text strings which are commonly found in phishing and malware sites such as “ download.php ” .
Microsoft does n’t publishes which strings are on this list for obvious reasons , but a comprehensive list of known blocked strings can be found here .
We all love a good conspiracy , but I do n’t think anyone at Microsoft was dumb enough to do this deliberately to undermine Google .
On the other hand , even if it was an accident , how do you ever trust this system ?
Update ( 11/5/08 ) : Not surprisingly YouTube links are working again .
Update 2 : The Windows Live Messenger blog published a post admitting the problem which they claim was entirely controlled by a third party and their process of blocking harmful URLs .
Another good reason to outsource .
Sony Computer Entertainment is pursuing legal action against a retailer for marketing air guns with unlicensed images from Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune .
The company , KingofSwords.com , is advertising an air gun with the title , " PS3 Uncharted Drake 's Fortune Full Metal M92 Airsoft Gun , " at the odd price point of $ 169.88 .
Sony said it had nothing to do with the product , and that it was not officially endorsed .
" The Drake 's Gun is not licensed or in any way sanctioned by SCE and one we certainly do not condone .
We are investigating the source of this product and will proceed with the most appropriate action , " a Sony official said .

If you want to spend your Friday evening contemplating the joys of alien - based paranoia , plus a little wrestling , then there 's nothing better than a nice heaping of They Live .
Released in the late 1980s , this ironic - paranoid classic was John Carpenter 's giant fuck you to the Reagan Administration and social conformity of all types .
Aliens have taken over , and are controlling all of the United States ( and perhaps the whole world ) by beaming a signal into everybody 's mind that masks the true aliens , as well as the " obey " signs they 've planted everywhere .
In this awesome scene , " Rowdy " Roddy Piper puts on some sunglasses that allow him to see the truth .
It 's like the " taking the red pill " moment — suddenly the extent of his manipulation becomes clear .
And of course , it 's hilarious .
Instead of spouting some speech about simulation Wachowski - Bros - style , Piper is basically dumbstruck .
He finally lashes out at an old lady alien by telling her she looks like her face has " been in the cheese dip since 1957 . "
Yup , those were the days , when high tech social control was solved with a nice wrassle and you did n't need any of them fancy computer hackers to do the job .
If it were possible to force every human in the U.S. and Canada to watch this movie , I would do it .

They Live
( CNN ) --
Two Oklahoma schoolgirls were killed with two guns , leading investigators to believe that more than one person was involved in their deaths , authorities said Wednesday .
Taylor Dawn Paschal - Placker , 13 , of Weleetka and Skyla Jade Whitaker , 11 , of Henryetta , were shot multiple times Sunday on a rural road about a quarter - mile from Taylor 's home .
Investigators do n't have any suspects or motives , but a forensic examination of the bodies indicated that two guns had been used , Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations Agent Ben Rosser said Wednesday .
" This leads us to believe that we 're probably looking for two shooters , " Rosser said at a news conference Wednesday , where he also announced that authorities had raised the reward to $ 25,000 .
Watch what officials are doing to solve the case »
With two shooters , Rosser said he was hopeful that one would turn on the other and come forward .
Rosser said investigators were considering a variety of motives as they searched for suspects , including the possibility of a " random thrill kill . "
Because of the girls ' ages , Rosser said investigators were looking at computer evidence and questioning young people in the area to develop possible leads .
Authorities said Tuesday that they believed the shooters were most likely from the area , considering the remote location where the bodies were found .
The two girls had planned a sleepover at Taylor 's house the night they were killed .
They left the house about 5 p.m .
Less than 30 minutes later , Taylor 's grandfather discovered the girls ' bodies in a ditch on the side of a road , near a bridge that is a popular gathering spot in the area .
" It is an isolated area . " Rosser reiterated Wednesday .
" They had to give my agents explicit directions Sunday on how to get there , in broad daylight . "
The killings have rattled the community of Weleetka , a town of about 1,000 residents 75 miles from Tulsa .
Taylor and Skyla were the only girls in their sixth - and fifth - grade classes , according to The Oklahoman newspaper .
Taylor 's uncle , Joe Mosher , described his niece as an intelligent girl who loved animals .
" She rescued turtles on the highway and wrote her name on them and turned them loose in the country , " Mosher said Wednesday .
Mosher said Taylor was at the top of her class in public school after being homeschooled most of her life .
" She was very smart , " said Mosher , who last saw Taylor two weeks ago at a family reunion .
In the wake of the shootings , authorities have urged parents in Weleetka to keep a close eye on their children .
" Two little girls can't go walking down a country lane , " Rosser said .
" I think that 's pretty sad . "
Police are asking members of the public with more information about the case to call ( 800 ) 522-8017 .
To make a donation to a burial fund for the victims ' families , the public can contact the Bank of Commerce in Weleetka , Rosser said .

A federal appeals court Wednesday sharply limited the ability of employers to obtain e-mails and text messages sent by employees on company - financed accounts .
The text message portion of the ruling , issued by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , will affect all employers who contract with an outside provider for messaging , as most do .
Access to e-mail would be barred if the employer contracts out its e-mail service rather than maintaining an internal server to handle it .
A majority of companies keep employee e-mail on their servers , analysts said .
Microsoft Corp.'s
Outlook program , which has a 65 % share of the corporate e-mail market , can be used either on a company ’s internal systems or on systems managed by vendors .
Currently , about 28 % of Outlook users have their e-mail handled by an outside vendor , according to research firm Radicati Group .
The ruling also gives all government workers 4th Amendment protection against searches of text and e-mail communications by their bosses , lawyers said .

“ This ruling is a tremendous victory for your online privacy , helping ensure that the 4th Amendment applies to your communications online just as strongly as it does to your letters and packages , ” the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit group that advocates civil liberties in the digital world , said in an online posting .
The unanimous ruling by a three - judge panel was the first federal appellate decision to provide 4th Amendment protection to electronic messages , which lawyers said would require police to obtain a warrant before they could access someone ’s e-mail or text messages .
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by Ontario Police Sgt. Jeff Quon and three others against the city ’s service provider and the city and Police Department for violating the 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure .
In August 2002 , Quon and another officer exceeded a department limit of 25,000 characters per month for texting .
The police chief ordered a subordinate to obtain transcripts of the officers ’ text messages to determine whether the pagers were being used purely for work purposes .

The provider , Arch Wireless , sent the department transcripts of the messages .
The city determined that many of Quon ’s messages were personal , and several were sexually explicit .
The court found that Arch Wireless violated the federal Stored Communications
Act , which prohibits providers from divulging the contents of any communication that is maintained on the service without a warrant .
“ I think right now service providers are going to be a little leery of providing anything to the subscriber because of this case , ” said John H. Horwitz , who represented Arch Wireless in the case .
The court ruled against the Police Department even though the city had informed employees that it had the right to read e-mails and text messages .
The court said that despite the policy , text messages were not monitored for content and employees had an expectation of privacy .

“ There were a host of simple ways to verify the efficacy of the 25,000 character limit [ if that , indeed , was the intended purpose ] without intruding . . . on 4th Amendment rights , ” Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote for the court .
The department could have warned Quon that for a month he was forbidden from using his pager for personal communications , and that all his messages would be reviewed , the court said .
Dieter C. Dammeier , who represented Quon and three other plaintiffs who communicated with him by text message , said reading one ’s text message “ really is like somebody trying to eavesdrop on your phone conversations . ”
He said some of the sexually explicit messages were between Quon and his wife .
“ Nowadays , people text message , ” Dammeier said .
“ It ’s a new wave of communication , and hopefully this decision is going to be the trend that keeps them more private . ”

He said the case would return to the lower court to determine monetary damages .
The defendants ’ lawyers said they did not know whether their clients would appeal .

The Moral Life of Cubicles
The Utopian Origins of Dilberts Workspace
David Franz
Few arenas can match the business office for its combination of humdrummery and world - shaping influence .
Sociologist C. Wright Mills wrote of office workers , “ Whatever history they have had is a history without events . ”
The history of office technology seems especially uninspiring : the invention of double - entry bookkeeping , calculators , and spreadsheets are unlikely material for a captivating History Channel feature , to be sure .
Yet the importance of the business office and its techniques is undeniable .
Max
Weber saw the office ’s methods of organization , its rationality , and its disciplines as hallmarks of modern capitalism , making possible dramatic gains in efficiency and forever altering the economic and cultural landscape .
Perhaps even more significant in our time , when millions of American workers spend most of their waking day in an office , is the sense that the organizational technologies of office life provide a kind of moral education , that offices shape character , that they create a certain kind of person .
And perhaps no aspect of today ’s office is more symbolic of office life and office lives than the cubicle .
Mills , in his 1951 attack on corporate bureaucracy , White Collar , imagined each office as “ a segment of the enormous file . ”
Honeycombed floors of skyscrapers organized the “ billion slips of paper that gear modern society into its daily shape . ”
Mills ’s book was soon joined by The Organization Man and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit in the decade ’s series of attempts to assess the damage office life inflicted upon the worker .
The composite picture that emerged was of a character driven by petty desires : for a slightly bigger office at work , a slightly bigger yard at home , and modest respectability everywhere .
The man of the office was a middling figure without passion or creativity .
These images of the office and its inhabitants were joined in the 1960s and 1970s with the counterculture ’s critique of the stifling bureaucracies of the state , the corporation , the university .
Standing on the steps of Berkeley ’s Sproul Hall , Free Speech Movement leader Mario Savio echoed Mills ’s condemnation of the great bureaucratic filing machine , now symbolized by IBM punch cards , and suggested to his fellow protesters that they put their “ bodies on the gears and wheels ” to stop it .
For many , this soullessness of office life is now most aptly represented by the cubicle — that open , wall - less , subdivision of office space .
Beginning in the late 1960s , the cubicle spread quickly across the white - collar landscape .
A market research firm estimated that by 1974 cubicles accounted for 20 percent of new office - furniture expenditures .
In 1980 , another study showed that half of new office furniture was placed in cubicled offices .
According to Steelcase , one of the largest cubicle manufacturers , nearly 70 percent of office work now happens in cubicles .
The rise of the cubicle is surely due in part to its economics .
Partitions are simply a very efficient way of organizing office space .
Construction for cubicle offices is standard and cheap , made and assembled in large quantities and with minimal skilled labor .
The building shell , lighting , and air conditioning can be set up with little consideration of interior walls , allowing contractors to build economical big white boxes to be filled in later with “ office furniture systems . ”
Perhaps most importantly , cubicles maximize floor space , granting workers only the necessary square footage — a number that is shrinking all the time .
According to brokerage surveys cited in National Real Estate Investor , the average office space per worker in the United States dropped from 250 square feet in 2000 to 190 square feet in 2005 .
Some observers expect this number to drop another 20 percent by 2010 .
This shrinkage not only saves space , but time as well — time wasted walking to restrooms , the coffee pot , and the marketing department , for example .
Supervision is made more efficient too : with no walls to hide behind , slackers have to work or at least imitate work in a convincing way .
The cubicle is the very essence of efficiency — the kind of office only a spreadsheet could love , one is tempted to say .
But not quite : alongside the economic arguments that brought the cubicle into ascendancy , there were also moral arguments .
Offices in the 1970s and 1980s seemed to their critics burdensome remnants of an older age , symbolic shackles of bureaucracy — a system as inhuman as it was ineffective .
Cubicles , by contrast , seemed to lack the fixity , and the constraints of bureaucracy of the old office .
Moreover , cubicles eliminated the hierarchical distinctions between managers and workers ; every cubicle had an open door , everyone was equally a worker .
Empowering and humane , cubicles seemed to create a workplace with a soul .
The cubicle has its roots in the cybernetic school of thought that arose in the middle of the last century .
The meaning of “ cybernetics ” has largely been swept up in the exuberant imagery of movies and commercials with their glowing rivers of ones and zeros flowing through the air .
However , cybernetics has an older and deeper history , predating both the personal computer and the cubicle .
Fred Turner ’s recent book , From Counterculture to Cyberculture , shows how the cybernetic idea of seeing the world in terms of information flows grew out of government - sponsored World War II military research and into the information technology industry of Silicon Valley .
In the 1960s and 1970s , cybernetic ideas brought groups of military - funded computer researchers together with Deadheads , radical environmentalists , and art communards in the San Francisco Bay area .
This collection of long - haired eccentrics began to think of everything from bee behavior to dance parties to computer programming as information processes .
In doing so , they liberated the images of information and the computer from the clutches of the military - industrial complex , joining them instead to a new cybernetic - counterculture vision of egalitarianism , communal networks , and democratic “ people power . ”
Architecture textbooks and journals in the 1960s and 1970s began to talk about a new “ cybernetic ” idea of the office .
Starting with the assumption that offices were fundamentally places for the exchange of information , advocates of the cybernetic office aimed to eliminate walls that stop the “ free flow of ideas , ” replacing them with cubicle workstations .
If the pictures in cubicle advertisements of the time are any indication , cubicles helped ideas flow quite freely indeed .
Employees in these ads lack computers , to say nothing of e-mail and the Internet , yet they always seem caught in moments of frenzied , often low - tech , information exchange : pointing to each other across the room , handing papers over and around the burnt orange ( “ aesthetically pleasing and humanly satisfying ” ) partitions , all while talking on the phone and jotting down notes .
As California computer companies grew into large businesses , then , cubicles were their natural office form .
It was through these companies that cubicles first entered the public imagination .
In the late 1970s and early 1980s , business sections of newspapers and magazines described the radical work arrangements of Silicon Valley with curiosity and often breathless enthusiasm .
Intel served as the chief example of the creative and egalitarian cubicle workplace .
The company had no time cards , no dress codes , no assigned parking spots , no special cafeterias for executives , and above all , no offices , just a sea of half - wall partitions .
The long , low buildings of Intel were fields of shared labor , like the communal farms that had so recently dotted the hills around Intel ’s campus .
CEO Andrew Grove , hip and casual in an open - necked wide - collar shirt and gold chains , was an unpretentious man of the people .
He moved among the workers of Intel “ empowering ” them to do their jobs , and sat at a cubicle at one side of the vast work floor ready to help .
Most incredible of all ( and unlike the communal farms ) this social experiment was economically viable .
In a time when the great industrial giants were falling to Japanese competition , Intel was making money hand over fist .
For some observers of American business , the Intel office model seemed like a savior .
In The Atlantic , James Fallows asked the question on the minds of so many who dared to hope for the future of American industry , “ Could the tire companies , the machine tool makers , the color TV industry , learn to work this way ? ”
This taste for fluid , egalitarian organization was elevated to a general philosophy by a new group of popular management writers .
In the early 1980s , precisely at the moment of the cubicle ’s introduction to the mainstream of American culture , management consultants , business professors , and CEOs all found a public hungry for management wisdom .
Publishers and bookstores quickly seized upon this new market and suddenly management books , previously relegated to obscurity as business school texts , joined diet manuals and self - help books as best - sellers .
The Art of Japanese Management and Theory Z ( also about the art of Japanese management ) were bestsellers in 1981 , followed closely by In Search of Excellence , which argued that some Americans were still pretty good managers .
These books and those that followed instructed Americans in the subtleties of international business , quality control , and other practical matters .
More than this , however , they declared the beginning of a new era in which bureaucratic hierarchy would be obsolete and equality , creativity , and collaboration would rule the day .
Separate offices , like formal business attire and human resources departments , were suffused with the musty smell of the old bureaucratic order — what one book called “ the barnacle ” of the status quo .
The new office , with its minimal architectural and bureaucratic structure , would allow for new ideas to move more quickly and naturally through the company .
Work would not be guided by policies and procedures , but the “ shared values ” of a “ corporate culture . ”
One popular book even suggested a future of “ boss - less companies ” ruled only by a cultural canopy of shared understanding and inspiration .
Tom Peters was the most prominent voice of this group , calling throughout the 1980s and 1990s for a “ management revolution ” and advocating such “ anti- bureaucratic ” management techniques as “ management by walking around , ” systematically “ defying rules and regulations ” and eliminating the barriers between departments .
Peters suggested breaking down the figurative and literal walls between departments to encourage “ disruptive innovation . ”
This kind of management thinking drew its lessons from the California technology boom and placed expectations of workplace equality in the idiom of the counterculture and political radicalism .
Peters even wrote a book called Liberation Management .
But the moral philosophy of cubicle life was not limited to the sushi- and - Zen crowd of Northern California .
Max De Pree , one of the most important figures of both the cubicle revolution and its theories of management , hails from a place far from California in almost every possible way .
The little community of Zeeland , Michigan is home to the Herman Miller office furniture company , about 5,000 people , and more than a dozen Dutch Reformed churches .
De Pree spent most of his career as an executive at Herman Miller , the company his father founded .
Under the leadership of Max and his brother Hugh , Herman Miller sold the first office cubicle , the Action Office , in 1968 .
De Pree remained active in the cubicle revolution , overseeing various elaborations and improvements on the original design , including snap - in colored panels and new openings for aquariums and ant farms , until he retired from his position as CEO in 1987 .
While most of the company ’s employees worked in factories rather than offices , De Pree wanted to make Herman Miller an example of the kind of fun , egalitarian workplace that cubicle systems were supposed to encourage .
The walls and ceilings of Herman Miller factories were decorated with colorful , life - size papier - mâché sculptures of workers .
Employees were encouraged to find ways to use their “ gifts ” at work .
One supervisor wrote poems for the factory newsletter , which were later printed on signs around the factory .
De Pree dreamed of a time when the joys of work and the company spirit would make supervision itself unnecessary : “ When they go home at night , they do n’t actually need a supervisor to tell them how to be a good parent .
And being a good parent is a lot tougher than making chairs . ”
If the California version of equality and freedom at work took its inspiration from communal farms and the remnants of hippie spirituality , De Pree ’s version was straight Midwestern Protestantism .
A member of the Reformed Church in America , De Pree told a reporter in 1986 , “ Each of us is made in the image of God .
And if that ’s true , then you cannot make the assumption that some of us are uncommon , and some of us are common ....
We are all uncommon . ”
This “ uncommonness ” had two important implications for De Pree .
First , it implied a fundamental equality .
Second , it meant that individuals are different and must be handled with sensitivity and discernment .
Both of these themes would be important in De Pree ’s writings .
De Pree achieved a great deal more fame in his second career of leadership writer , speaker , and consultant than he did as an executive .
His books , Leadership is an Art , Leadership Jazz , and Leading Without Power , have all sold well and made his name synonymous with “ servant leadership ” in business and leadership circles .
While his writings do not suggest eliminating the category of leadership entirely , he does ask leaders to take a rather self - effacing view of their role .
“ Leadership is a posture of debt ; it is a forfeiture of rights . ”
What leaders owe their followers is the opportunity “ to fulfill their potential . ”
Organizational life , for De Pree , is a profoundly personal , even spiritual enterprise of self - improvement .
He takes “ finding voice ” and connecting “ voice and touch ” to be central managerial tasks .
De Pree ’s description of a good leader is a humble , gentle soul who is “ vulnerable , ” “ discerning , ” and “ aware of the human spirit . ”
Those with moral aspirations for the cubicle — from countercultural Californians like Tom Peters to Midwestern Protestants like Max De Pree — sought to defend some idea of “ humanity ” against the inhumanity of bureaucracy .
Yet , to say that bureaucracy is inhuman has not always been an objection to it .
As defined by Max Weber a century ago , bureaucracy makes its great contribution to the world precisely by ignoring the human spirit .
Operating according to fixed rules , policies , and positions , bureaucracy in its purest form functions , as Weber wrote , “ without regard for persons . ”
As bureaucracy “ develops more perfectly , the more the bureaucracy is ‘ dehumanized , ’ the more completely it succeeds in eliminating from official business love , hatred , and all purely personal , irrational , and emotional elements which escape calculation . ”
The central impulse of bureaucracy is to fashion a world in conformity to the impersonal abstraction and precise relationships of an organizational chart .
Peters and the Californians saw bureaucracy imposing arbitrary restrictions on the natural flow of creativity and information .
Separate offices encouraged self - importance and unproductive groveling before the lordly egos of bosses .
They created insular silos of knowledge and turf battles between them .
Paperwork gummed up tasks that would better be handled with a little common sense and informal conversation .
Good ideas were stalled in the system of procedures .
In short , bureaucracy hindered human agency .
For De Pree , the inadequacies of bureaucracy lay in its effort to cordon off into the private sphere both the emotion and the practice of unique “ gifts . ”
Genuine leadership , for De Pree , is inescapably emotional and personal .
Leadership involves nothing less than helping people become who they were meant to be .
Such a task could not rest on impersonal procedures and systems alone .
While these humanistic sentiments remain common in writing about management and leadership , the cubicle has been detached from them entirely .
In Dilbert , The Office , Office Space , and many other popular satires of contemporary work , cubicles are a symbol of all that is uninspiring about office life , and on this point , cubicles seem utterly without defenders .
Fortune recently ran an article called “ Cubicles : The Great Mistake , ” complete with a public apology from one of the first cubicle designers .
Twenty years after his Atlantic article extolling the virtues of the cubicled office , James Fallows wrote another on how he changed his mind .
The promises of a cubicle utopia now seem curious , to say the least .
In fact , the companies that make cubicles increasingly offer up apologies of their own .
Steelcase , in its “ State of the Cubicle ” report , addresses the “ Dilbert - type issues ” that surround them , turning to head of design James Ludwig for a response .
“ Our goal in design would be to unfold the cubicle in ways that might make it unrecognizable . ”
The cubicle , once a cutting edge statement of corporate identity , has become an embarrassment , even for its makers .
What explains this change in meaning ?
Cubicle utopianism was probably a victim of its own success .
The idea that cubicles formed a more exciting , humane workplace became less plausible to those who had the experience of working in one .
As partitions and the space allotted to each worker shrunk , few things seemed to matter to office dwellers more than privacy .
From the very beginning , workers reacted to cubicles by blocking up the openings of the “ open office . ”
Newspaper reports of early cubicle offices tell of employees raiding supply closets for cardboard and extra panels to extend partitions .
Some workers went so far as to push large filing cabinets into the space created by their cubicle ’s missing fourth wall .
While the beige rat -maze aesthetics of partition living attract all the jokes , the basic geometric facts of cubicles — their doorlessness and 360 - degree visibility — are probably more central to the experience of cubicle work .
Private conversations , whether in person or by phone , take on the character of an intrigue , a fact exploited endlessly in office sitcoms where ordinarily private matters of romance , betrayal , and personal failure are made public in the open office to the dismay of those involved .
In an odd twist , privacy often requires venturing out into some more public space , one that is either anonymous ( like a sidewalk ) or relatively soundproof ( like a central conference room ) .
The utopian visions of the cubicle have been crushed by reality .
However , while the cubicled office no longer seems brave or new , an aspect of its original moral impulse remains .
Indeed , the experiential facts of cubicle life are not so much in contradiction with the ambition to humanize the office as the revelation of the dark side of this effort .
The ideals of office equality , fluidity , and collaboration in all their forms — including servant leadership , worker empowerment , and flattened organizations — required a kind of control more diffuse and amorphous , but also more personal than the old hierarchical bureaucracy .
As Tom Peters and the other management theorists of “ corporate culture ” saw ( albeit in a more positive light ) , the real managerial possibility contained in the cubicle was not lower costs or even the ability of managers to watch workers more closely .
It was rather the creation of a culture in which workers would feel obliged to manage themselves .
With everyone visible to everyone else , managerial obligation could spread itself throughout the entire office , becoming more personal and intense at the same time .
Cubicles are not alone in this trend .
The advent of 360 - degree evaluations ( filled out by those above , below , and beside an employee in the organizational hierarchy ) , the creation of company mission statements followed inevitably ( and sometimes preceded ) by facilitator - led meetings designed to get “ buy - in , ” and corporate campuses ( which , by containing everything from grocery stores to fitness clubs eliminate reasons to leave ) , all tend to blur distinctions between personal and professional .
The ideal of the cultural workplace and its embodiment in cubicles also moves against another longstanding distinction of office work — the distinction between managers and workers .
The ideal of a boss - less company has not been realized on anything like the large scale the management writers dreamed of , if it has in fact been realized anywhere .
However , the impulse to equality and management through culture has led to something like the opposite of the boss - less company with bosses everywhere .
As the managerial role is increasingly shorn of “ authoritarian ” tendencies and managers adopt the stance of a servant and facilitator , the scope of demands upon ordinary workers has risen .
Observation , evaluation , encouraging the proper attitude and habits in other employees — these are all managerial tasks that are supposed to be shared .
Such is the nature of being a team member .
Cubicles may not be inspiring , but they have clearly contributed to new obligations .
These obligations go beyond the management of work to the management of self .
The teamwork and collaboration of the open office elevate the importance of relational dexterity and a sunny ( but not too sunny ) disposition at work .
Books promising work success through “ emotional intelligence ” and pharmaceutical advertisements portraying the difficulties faced by office workers with anxiety and attention disorders are both responding to the emotional demands of a work environment that puts a premium on self - presentation .
It would , in a way , be comforting if the rise of cubicles were simply the result of a bad decision to grant spreadsheets and their budgeteer masters imperial dominion over office space , but that ’s just not how it happened .
The cubicle revolution , in fact , was above all ideological .
The clichés hurled at cubicles were woven into their sound - dampening fabric board from the beginning .
Any discerning criticism of office life will have to take this moral history into account .
Indeed , it is precisely the axioms of what makes for a good company and a good person buried within the cubicle that most need to be uncovered and held to critical attention .
The “ end of the credit crisis ” apostates looks to be a small and shrinking group ( and we do n’t mean just the downbeat but nevertheless accurate Nouriel Roubini or Michael Panzner ) .
I ’m amazed our number is as small as it is , given the overwhelming counterevidence in the form of the increase in the Term Auction Facility by $ 50 billion and expanding the types of assets that can be pledged for the TSLF to include asset backed securities consisting of auto loans and credit card receivables .
This may be a direct effort to stand in for the moribund asset backed commercial paper market .
Oh , and in case you somehow missed it , the ECB joined in with a $ 20 billion addition , bringing the size of its program to $ 50 billion and Swiss National Bank increased its facilities by $ 6 billion to a new total of $ 12 billion .
If things are so hunky dory , why is the officialdom throwing large amounts of money at a problem that is over ?
Calculated Risk weighted in with “ Credit Crisis : In the Eye of the Hurricane , ” which gave some cautionary views from Jamie Dimon , Goldman , and even the Wall Street Journal .
The Telegraph questioned the sanguine reading in the latest issue of the Bank of England ’s Financial Stability Report :
“ We ’re at the end of the beginning , not the beginning of the end , ” says Standard Chartered chief economist Gerard Lyons .
“ The next chapter will be a period of financial consolidation and economic challenges .
The Bank clearly hopes that it can restore confidence to the financial markets so they are in better shape to handle future economic problems . ”
Hence , Sir John ’s bold statement that the “ likely path ahead is confidence ” .
For as long as the markets are self - fulfilling , the Bank might as well be upbeat on the credit crunch .
Others are less convinced .
Danny Gabay , a former Bank official now at Fathom Financial Consulting , remains a sceptic : “ I ’m surprised a major central bank is taking this position at this early stage .
The original source of the shock – three - month Libor – remains where it was .
I ’d be a lot more convinced if Libor was at half where it stands today . ”
A particularly persuasive reading comes from Doug Noland at Prudent Bear .
A student of Hyman Minsky , he takes his theory of “ Monday Manager Capitlaism ” one step further into “ Financial Arbitrage Capitalism , ” which means that the inmates are not merely running the asylum , they ’ve learned how to position themselves not as crooks , but as prison facilities managers , expand their operations to other locales , and secure government funding .
In all seriousness , the problem that Noland alludes to is that finance is now driving the real economy .
And given how speculative our financial system has become , this is leading to poor capital allocation and increased volatility , both of which will dampen growth .
Keynes considered reducing volatility to be a major goal of policy , since it would lower the risk premia investors required , and more favorable interest rates would promote greater investment and with it , growth ( note that Keynes did not propose the countercyclical measures that have become associated with his name ) .
But high volatility produces the reverse effect : investors demand higher returns to compensate for heightened risk , which reduces invesment .
But traders find it hard to make money in quiet markets ; a certain level of fluxuation is their friend .
So Wall Street ’s interests can and increasingly do conflict with those of Main Street .
Looking at the world through the Minksy - via - Noland lens exposes the flaw in the credit optimists ’ thinking .
Keeping the game going in its current form requires an increase in leverage .
The private sector had hit the point where credit had expanded beyond the ability of the underlying assets to support it .
but rather than let asset prices fall to a level commensurate with their cash flow ( or try to temper the deleveraging ) , central banks are instead trying to validate inflated asset values via artificially low interest rates and credit support to dodgy debt .
That effort will eventually fail and eventually is likely not all that far off .
The negative real rates will fuel new speculative activity , exacerbating the problem of overly high leverage relative to GDP .
As AutoDogmatic pointed out :
That very complex of unusually high foreign buying of US debt ( that is , lending to us ) is now being choked off by its own consequences : the collapse of all the US credit markets …
The upshot is we are n’t going to be able to increase our borrowing to fix the problems now .
And we ca n’t enter a war to generate the necessary stimulus ( a - la FDR ) because we ’re already completely extended fighting two of them ….virtually all of the capital investment in America in the past three decades went into the military and military - related expenditures overseas , rather than truly productive areas like manufacturing back here at home , so we have nothing we can gear up to generate surplus output .
We are thus faced with the farcical situation where the government has already begun “ bailing ” , but it is having to borrow even more to do so .
Since we ’re past the point of exhaustion ( beyond the “ Minsky moment ” ) already , this borrowing is apt to have increasingly disastrous effects .
Look at the $ 160 billion emergency stimulus bill congress passed a few months ago ( with checks having started going out in the mail a few days ago ) .
The government is immersed in a record - breaking fiscal deficit — so bad the Treasury Borrowing Committee is crying “ uncle ” — so where is it going to get the money to pay these checks ?
More borrowing , of course .
But what happens when you add more borrowing when the supply of lenders is shrinking ?
Interest rates go up .
The Fed currently has a policy of holding interest rates down , to hold together the creaking financial system .
As we discussed , borrowing is already dramatically ramping up because of structural spending needs , the war , and now bailouts .
These two objectives are in conflict .
Something will have to give .
Whether the Fed allows it or not , interest rates will rise .
The Fed may succeed in artifically holding down interbank rates , but this will not help most of us .
Soon we will be faced with the ultimate farce of mortgage rates dramatically rising because of all of our national borrowing , even though much of it has been piled on to help out those harmed by the housing bubble !
And to Noland ’s discussion of the progression , or more accurately , devolution , of financial capitalism :
We apologize for the inconvenience ...
... but your activity and behavior on this site made us think that you are a bot .
Note : A number of things could be going on here .
Undersea divers would still be shivering and facing a high risk for hypothermia if it were n't for Hugh Bradner , inventor of the first wetsuit .
Bradner , a renowned physicist and professor emeritus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography died May 5 , 2008 , in San Diego after a prolonged illness .
He was 92 .
Bradner had a lifelong passion for the ocean .
He enjoyed diving and sailing and was one of the first Americans to make a deep - water SCUBA dive .
In 1951 , while working at University of California , Berkeley , he decided to spend some weekend time improving diving equipment for Navy frogmen , which began his pioneering research on the wetsuit .
Bradner focused on the design of a wetsuit for military underwater swimmers and developed a foam wetsuit using a unicellular material known as neoprene .
" He was an adventurous man who enjoyed traveling , " said Walter Munk , professor emeritus at Scripps , which is part of the University of California , San Diego .
" He built a successful career by combining his geophysical work with his South Pacific adventures . "
Bradner collaborated with scientific divers at Scripps who were experimenting with the new SCUBA regulator ( which supplies divers with breathing gas on demand and at the proper pressure ) invented by Jacques Cousteau and Emile Gagnan .
Scripps divers first tested Bradner 's wetsuit designs at their SCUBA training classes in the pool of the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club .
" Brad ’s neoprene wetsuit was a tremendous contribution to scientific diving , " said James Stewart , professor emeritus at Scripps .
" He was a great guy and a lot of fun to work with . "
Bradner was well regarded for his collaborative approach to science , evident in his reluctance to claim himself as sole inventor of the wetsuit .
He continued to consult for the military throughout his scientific career .
His other research endeavors led to novel diving equipment , including underwater contact lenses , a single - hose regulator and a decompression meter .
Bradner even developed a loop system for quickly extracting U.S. Navy SEALs from bodies of water via inflatable boats .
During his distinguished career as a nuclear physicist , Bradner worked at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at UC Berkeley .
He also worked on the Manhattan Project as one of the founding scientists of the Los Alamos National Laboratory .
It was at Los Alamos that he met Marjorie Hall , his wife of 65 years .
In 1961 , Bradner joined Scripps as a research geophysicist in the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics .
He published extensively in the fields of physics , seismology , geophysics and diving .
Bradner was an avid outdoorsman , hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , swimming in the La Jolla Rough Water Swim and traveling all over the world to enjoy the oceans .
His greatest joy was said to be to watch as he guided students , family and friends to the discovery of something new .
He also was a painter , a photographer and a jeweler .
Bradner graduated from Caltech with a Ph.D. in physics , where he coached the swimming and water polo teams .
He received his undergraduate degree from the Miami University in Ohio and received the Miami University medal in 1960 and an honorary doctorate in 1961 .
He is survived by a daughter , Bari Bradner Cornet of Berkeley , Calif. , three grandchildren and a great granddaughter .
His wife died April 10 .
The nation 's spies already post to their own version of Wikipedia .
They read classified blogs .
And now , the spooks are getting their answer to YouTube : a series of video sharing sites , just for the military and intelligence agencies .
Hundreds of videos have already been posted to the sites , collectively dubbed " iVideo . "
If " someone in Tokyo has video that needs to get back to headquarters , they can upload it to this site and then it would be not only accessible to headquarters , but accessible to the entire network and then people could , using the comments , be able to start a discussion about that video and what the implications of that video are , " Sean Dennehy , the CIA 's " Enterprise 2.0 evangelist " tells Federal Computer Week .
So far , users have mainly " shared training videos . "
But , eventually , Dennehy would move a good - sized portion of the intelligence agencies ' massive amount of video to the Adobe Flash - based iVideo system .
There are still kinks to be worked out , however .
Videos have to be separately posted on three different networks , *FCW * notes : " top secret , which is used by members of the 16 federal intelligence agencies who have the appropriate clearance ; secret , used by many employees of the Defense and State departments ; and sensitive but unclassified , which is open to government employees generally and invited guests . "
I 've been told that posting iVideos to the classified blogs is also a bear , and that integrating iVideo with some of the military 's other footage - sharing sites has been unweildy , at best .
Still , this sounds like one of those indisputably good ideas .
And if the spooks are looking for more clips to fill up their iVideo coffers , we at Danger Room humbly suggest this nutty , genius rant on superheroines from our pal Lore Sjöberg .
Senator Obama made no public effort to pressure Senator Clinton from the race , and in interviews with CNN and NBC News he praised her as a formidable candidate who could not yet be counted out .
On NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams , Senator Obama denied that he is now the presumptive nominee .
" Not yet .
I will be , " he said .
" If Senator Clinton decides not to go on , or if we complete the six contests and we are ahead as we are now .
But nothing is certain .
I do n't want to take it for granted . "
He said he was likely to lock up a majority of the pledged delegates — those awarded by voting in the primary and caucus states — after the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on May 20 , and at that point he could declare victory .
While he was respectful to Senator Clinton , Senator Obama seemed eager to challenge Republican nominee John McCain , saying he was " losing his bearings " in his pursuit of the presidency .
Asked on CNN about Senator McCain 's recent statement that the Palestinian party Hamas , considered by the United States to be a terrorist organisation , would favour Senator Obama 's election , Senator Obama said it was offensive and called it a smear .
" And so for him to toss out comments like that I think is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination , " he said .
Senator Obama continued to gain more support from super - delegates , the elected Democrats and party officials whose votes will be necessary for either candidate to secure the nomination .
His very public arrival in the House chamber underscored the fact that the most important front in the nominating fight was suddenly Washington , where many of the super - delegates were milling around voting on amendments to a housing bill .
It was in marked contrast to Senator Clinton 's private meetings near the Capitol the day before as she sought to convert undecided lawmakers .
Obama aides said they saw his visit as an opportunity to create an image of Senator Obama as the soon - to - be nominee .

Microsoft is still toiling away at the Zune , but there is n't a whole terrible much to show for it so far in regards to market impact .
They just broke the 2 million mark , almost a year after they hit 1 million in May 2007 .
That means growth has hardly accelerated since the second - gen players hit the scene .
Zune 's overall market share has grown from three to four percent , but that 's most likely a steal from Creative ( which sunk from four to two percent ) than a steal from Apple or second - place SanDisk ( with a billionty and 11 percent , respectively ) .
But do n't worry , we 're sure that 2.5 update is going to change everything .
I think Hillary may be hitting the sauce

Hillary ’s been out of this thing for a while now , but they continue forth as if it is neck and neck and she ’s got a shot at this thing .
However , the complete disconnect may be explained by this photo published recently by the New York Times .
Ah , sweet bourbon .
It also explains recent statements by Harold Ickes at the DNC ’s rules committee meeting this past weekend .
During his rant on why all the votes from an unfair election – an election that broke the rules he helped write – should count now that his candidate ’s campaign has stalled , Ickes said he did n’t believe the committee had the “ gall and chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600,000 voters . ”
Of course , for his candidate to win , he has to convince the superdelegates to do exactly that : use their judgement to subvert the will of party voters around the country and choose his candidate as the standard bearer for the establishment .
It would be great to be Ickes ’ kids .
Imagine , being able to break rules and change your story at will with no repercussions .
But Ickes also did a little foreshadowing on the next step in the Clinton ’s campaign , saying – as supporters chanted “ Denver ! Denver ! ” like rowdy pledges at a frat party – the candidate reserved her right to take this to the credentials committee .
I am not sure what the credentials committee is or what they do , but this is their move : keep their flailing campaign alive by taking it from committee to committee , arguing every little point and continuing to kneecap the party candidate while raising the specter of assassination all for her own personal glory .
She must be drunk .
It ’s also the only way they can look at this graph of polling data and think they ’ve run a successful campaign .
Running a successful , winning campaign means continually drawing people into your cause and gaining in popularity .
Candidates that do n’t do that generally drop out .
It can't be easy for a federal judge to admit that he was wrong when giving jury instructions in a high - profile case , but the judge in the Jammie Thomas file - swapping case has stepped up and cast serious doubt on his own actions .
Following other court rulings around the country , Judge Michael Davis indicated that he may grant Thomas a new trial after telling the jury that simply " making available " a copyrighted song on P2P networks counted as infringement .
Now , Davis has asked for public comment on " whether the Court committed a manifest error of law in instructing the jury . "
The first public response to that question offers a resounding " yes " in response .
Nine copyright professors have filed a " friend of the court " brief ( found via Threat Level ) that addresses Davis ' question .
While the " making available " issue can be tedious , technical , and contradictory ( different court rulings have gone different ways ) , the brief actually does a fine job of making the debate accessible .
The main thrust of the argument is a simple one : a close look at the actual words of the relevant copyright statute show that rights holders have the exclusive prerogative to " distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public . "
The key question concerns whether just making available a file in a shared directory counts as a distribution to the public , and the professors argue that it clearly does not .
Dictionaries are trotted out to define the word " distribute , " after which the professors conclude , " Although the act of making copies or phonorecords available may enable the public to acquire possession or ownership of the copies or phonorecords , unless and until members of the public actually obtain such possession or ownership the necessary final step for transforming the ' making available ' into a distribution would be lacking . "
Jammie Thomas
The professors also argue that other cases in which judges have conflated " making available " with " distribution " are " with all due respect , incorrect " and not binding on the court .
( In Atlantic v. Howell , the court indicated that " making available " was not enough to prove " distribution , " while in Elektra v. Barker , another court indicated that it was . )
The brief addresses only a question of law , not the broader question of whether Thomas is guilty of infringement .
In fact , the professors suggest that copyright holders could pursue Thomas and others using a variety of different scenarios .
Although simply making a file available might not count as infringement , the person who makes the file available may have violated the exclusive " reproduction right " held by copyright owners .
This right is violated whenever someone copies in CD to a computer , but those cases are generally considered to be fair use .
If someone copies a CD to a computer in order to do something " unfair " with it ( uploading it to a P2P network ) , that person could be liable for infringement .
Other possible avenues of attack include charges of indirect infringement for helping others to download infringing files and charges of direct infringement for downloaders .
The obvious problem here is that this sort of activity is very difficult for the RIAA to prove .
Instead , the organization 's investigators generally look into shared KaZaA folders or grab the IP addresses of BitTorrent users who host parts of particular files .
It would be much simpler for the RIAA if " making available " were good enough to demonstrate copyright infringement , but if it is n't , investigators can actually download the files in question .
This is n't the preferred alternative because it takes more time , bandwidth , and computing resources , but it does at least have the virtue of showing that an actual transmission of the file took place .
But even this approach is n't without problems , because the Copyright Act specifies that the distribution must be made " to the public . "
There is currently some controversy about whether a rightsholder - sanctioned download counts as a " public distribution . "
Many defendants argue that , since MediaSentry is employed by the RIAA to seek out and download files from P2P networks , the downloads done by the company are not unauthorized .
If neither a MediaSentry download nor a list of files made available on P2P networks are good enough for the courts , then the RIAA could find itself in much more difficult territory .

The US government , along with many investors such as Chevron , Goldman Sachs , and Google , is confident that solar power could become much cheaper than coal within the next 12 years .
Taking into consideration tax incentives , carbon - capping legislation and the rising prices of natural gas , experts think that solar power is going to be more economical than coal by 2020 .
“ Chevron , Goldman Sachs , FPL , PG&E and other companies have filed more than 50 applications with the Bureau of Land Management to lease government - owned desert property for solar power systems .
Google ’s philantropic division put $ 10 million into eSolar , a start - up in Pasadena , California . ” – Greg Chang , Bloomberg .
Along with the good progress of photovoltaic panels towards becoming cheaper and more efficient , investors are getting more excited about the potential of solar thermal technology .
Implementing mirrors to direct sunlight to power turbines in desert areas could cover at least 50 - percent of the local power requirements .
In the Mojave Desert , Sun Microsystems developed a thermal solar plant which contains 550,000 mirrors that tie together the sun ’s energy and convert it into enough power to supply about 112,500 houses in the Los Angeles area .
Though the costs are much higher than coal , this power station certainly shows the effectiveness of solar energy .
Sooner or later , it is going to happen .

That the news is familiar makes it no less alarming : 1.1 billion people , about one - sixth of the world 's population , lack access to safe drinking water .
Aquifers under Beijing , Delhi , Bangkok , and dozens of other rapidly growing urban areas are drying up .
The rivers Ganges , Jordan , Nile , and Yangtze — all dwindle to a trickle for much of the year .
In the former Soviet Union , the Aral Sea has shrunk to a quarter of its former size , leaving behind a salt - crusted waste .
Water has been a serious issue in the developing world for so long that dire reports of shortages in Cairo or Karachi barely register .
But the scarcity of freshwater is no longer a problem restricted to poor countries .
Shortages are reaching crisis proportions in even the most highly developed regions , and they 're quickly becoming commonplace in our own backyard , from the bleached - white bathtub ring around the Southwest 's half - empty Lake Mead to the parched state of Georgia , where the governor prays for rain .
Crops are collapsing , groundwater is disappearing , rivers are failing to reach the sea .
Call it peak water , the point at which the renewable supply is forever outstripped by unquenchable demand .
This is not to say the world is running out of water .
The same amount exists on Earth today as millions of years ago — roughly 360 quintillion gallons .
It evaporates , coalesces in clouds , falls as rain , seeps into the earth , and emerges in springs to feed rivers and lakes , an endless hydrologic cycle ordained by immutable laws of chemistry .
But 97 percent of it is in the oceans , where it 's useless unless the salt can be removed — a process that consumes enormous quantities of energy .
Water fit for drinking , irrigation , husbandry , and other human uses can't always be found where people need it , and it's heavy and expensive to transport .
Like oil , water is not equitably distributed or respectful of political boundaries ; about 50 percent of the world 's freshwater lies in a half - dozen lucky countries .
Freshwater is the ultimate renewable resource , but humanity is extracting and polluting it faster than it can be replenished .
Rampant economic growth — more homes , more businesses , more water - intensive products and processes , a rising standard of living — has simply outstripped the ready supply , especially in historically dry regions .
Compounding the problem , the hydrologic cycle is growing less predictable as climate change alters established temperature patterns around the globe .
One barrier to better management of water resources is simply lack of data — where the water is , where it 's going , how much is being used and for what purposes , how much might be saved by doing things differently .
In this way , the water problem is largely an information problem .
The information we can assemble has a huge bearing on how we cope with a world at peak water .
That data already shows the era of easy water is ending .
Even economically advanced regions face unavoidable pressures — on their industrial output , the quality of life in their cities , their food supply .
Wired visited three such areas : the American Southwest , southeastern England , and southeastern Australia .
The difficulties these places face today are harbingers of the dawning era of peak water , and their struggles to find solutions offer a glimpse of the challenge ahead .
On the descent into Sky Harbor International Airport , Phoenix 's endless grid of streets and tract homes is etched into the desert floor like the imprinted surface of a microchip .
When the sunlight hits at the right angle , the canals that zigzag across the landscape light up like semiconductor traces surging with electricity .
And Phoenix is sprawling at a rate that seems to rival Moore 's law .
In the 1990s , the metro area was growing at the rate of an acre every three hours .
The population is expected to nearly double in the next 20 years .
But cities , unlike microchips , do n't double in efficiency every 18 months .
A 2007 government report stated that staggering growth in the American Southwest " will inevitably result in increasingly costly , controversial , and unavoidable trade - off choices . "
The issue : how to parcel out a dwindling water supply .
The city 's chief water sources are the Salt River Project and the Central Arizona Project , two massive water systems that bookend a century - long effort to hydrate the region .
The Salt River Project began in 1903 with the Roosevelt Dam , which reined in the flood - prone waterway .
Today , the SRP is a vast network of reservoirs , hydroelectric dams , and channels .
As for the Central Arizona Project , it 's one of the largest and most expensive aqueducts in the US , completed in 1993 at a cost of $ 3.6 billion .
The 336 - mile CAP canal diverts 489 billion gallons a year from the Colorado River , irrigating more than 300,000 acres of farmland and slaking the thirst of Phoenix and Tucson .

Seven states and dozens of Indian reservations , as well as Mexico , tap its flow .
Development has sapped the river , a problem exacerbated by a drought called " perhaps the worst in 500 years " by US interior secretary Gale Norton .
Lake Mead , an immense reservoir that dams the Colorado to supply most of Phoenix 's water , has a 50 - 50 chance of running dry by 2021 , according to a study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
Larry Dozier , the CAP 's deputy general manager , calls this finding " absurd , " claiming that studies show the reservoir wo n't disappear entirely , even in the worst case .
However , the Scripps researchers counter that their calculations are conservative and warn that " the water shortage is likely to be more dire in reality . "
Chandler , a city on the southeastern edge of Phoenix , epitomizes the regional dilemma .
Founded in 1912 to accommodate farmers who ventured into the Sonoran Desert , Chandler supports a population that has tripled in the past 20 years to 250,000 .
On the outskirts of town , where the last remaining farms fade into the scrub , stand three colossal Intel semiconductor manufacturing plants : Fab 12 , Fab 22 , and the gleaming new Fab 32 , which produces state - of - the - art chips on a floor area equivalent to 17 football fields .
Intel is a key driver of the local economy .
The company employs 10,000 people and has invested $ 9 billion in Chandler ; its workers , on average , earn four times the Arizona median salary .
Just one problem :
The fabs are also by far the city 's biggest consumer of water .
Chip fabrication is a thirsty process .
The silicon wafers must be rinsed after each of the several dozen semiconductor layers is applied and etched .
Consequently , the Intel campus has been designed to maximize every drop of the 2 million gallons it uses daily .
Intel , wary of spilling its manufacturing secrets , bars journalists from entering the enormous silver and white monolith .
Fortunately , the plant 's circulatory system is visible from the outside .
Len Drago , who is responsible for the facility 's environmental profile , offers to show it to me .
As we walk around the building 's perimeter , he explains how water flows through the plant .
The tiniest imperfection can render a wafer useless , so incoming water cascades through a series of filters until its mineral content is a hundred - thousandth that of Colorado River water .
The briny byproduct goes into a towering tank that looks like a Jules Verne moon rocket , which distills out the remaining water and pumps it back to the beginning of the system .
The salty sludge goes to an evaporation pond .
The purified water , meanwhile , is used to wash chips .
The rinse water is treated and then sent to other parts of the campus : the air scrubbers that filter the plant 's emissions , the massive cooling towers that keep workers from suffocating in the desert heat .
Even the drought - resistant desert landscaping in the plant 's parking lot is irrigated with wastewater .
The Thirst of Nations Modern life runs on water .
But the wells are running dry .

Intel does n't reuse all of its wastewater .
Every day , the company pumps 1.5 million gallons to a $ 19 million reverse - osmosis desalination plant it built for Chandler .
This water , cleaned to drinking standards , is pumped 6 miles away and injected 600 feet down into a sandstone aquifer beneath the city .
To date , Intel has banked more than 3 billion gallons .
The facility recycles or stores 75 percent of the water it brings in , Drago says .
Intel is n't simply trying to be a good corporate citizen .
Nor is it merely out to save money .
Running a sustainable operation greases the regulatory wheels when the company wants to expand .
Because Intel was well within the government 's environmental thresholds for the site , Fab 32 did n't even require a new water - use permit .
It has n't always been this way , Drago admits .
" Back in the early 1980s , we had three Superfund sites in California , " he says .
" It 's a lot easier to do things the right way .
Especially in the long term . "
The long term , however , will be ruled by the twin realities of an exploding population and a hotter , drier climate .
Dave Siegel , Chandler 's water czar , describes how he plans to continue providing for the growing city ( and his biggest customer , Intel ) .
The government has legal rights to all the water it needs , he says , not only from the SRP and the CAP but from 27 wells drilled into the aquifer .
" That 's legal water , mind you , " he says .
" It 's a different thing than physical water . "
Legal water refers to the complex array of agreements , treaties , and laws that govern water use in the American West — and federal and state allocations trump Chandler 's municipal rights .
As for physical water , that 's the stuff coming out of the tap .
All the legal water in the world is n't enough to wash a bandanna if there 's no physical water available .
So Chandler came up with a clever plan .
The city banks as much excess CAP water as it can , pumping it underground along with Intel 's contribution .
Thanks to this so - called recharge , the local aquifer is actually rising a few feet a year .
Siegel maintains that even if the most apocalyptic predictions came true — say , the rivers collapse completely — Chandler would be able to soldier on .
" If we never recharge another drop , " he says , " we have enough water underneath us to last about 100 years . "
His projection includes future growth , including two more Intel fabs now on the drawing board .
John Halsall , director of water services at Thames Water in London .

Gary Woodard , a bearded water resource expert at the Sahra Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson , has made a career of studying the issues facing water - stressed regions around the world .
He admires Intel 's efforts , but he cautions that direct water consumption is only half the story .
To describe the other half , he invokes the " water - energy nexus " : the idea that it takes water to produce energy , and energy to take advantage of water .
That is , supplies of water and power are interdependent .
" Intel is doing everything it can , " Woodard says , " but high - quality recycling , pumping water up and down and recirculating it , uses an incredible amount of energy . "
The Intel campus draws the power equivalent of 54,000 homes every year .
Intel gets a sizable portion of that power from the Palo Verde Nuclear plant outside of Phoenix , and this means that it takes far more water to make a microchip than actually circulates through the company 's recycling system .
" No energy generation system uses more water than a low - desert nuclear plant , " Woodard says .
Palo Verde uses 20 billion gallons annually to cool its turbines .
That water is emitted as water vapor from its cooling towers , to fall as rain somewhere else .
None of this is figured into Intel 's water footprint .
Neither are the additional employees , new homes built in the desert , and cars that will come along with Intel 's next round of fabs .
More parking lots will absorb more solar radiation , contributing to Phoenix 's urban heat island .
More energy and more water will be required for cooling .
Other experts share Woodard 's concern .
Peter Gleick is president of the Pacific Institute in Oakland , California , a leading think tank on water issues .
He is n't surprised that Intel and Chandler are optimistic about the future .
Their cheerful attitude , he believes , reflects their confidence that social and economic priorities are on their side .
" It shows to what lengths we 'll go to ensure water for high - value uses , " Gleick says .
" Truth is , Intel will always be able to pay more than anybody else for water .
They can act as though it 's not scarce , because for them it's a relatively small cost . "
If moneyed special interests determine the going price of water , eventually they will edge out users who can't afford to pay top dollar .
Agriculture will be squeezed out , as will water rights for poorer communities .
And the environment , it goes almost without saying , will twist in the wind : " That 's why the Colorado River no longer reaches its delta , " Gleick says .
Intel will continue to drive Chandler 's economy , lubricate the regulatory process , and burnish its image while small towns elsewhere along the Colorado wither .
If this seems mercilessly Darwinian , it 's also true that Intel has a critical role to play in solving water issues .
Ever -more - capable microprocessors are at the heart of efforts worldwide to keep the water flowing .
Looking out at Kensington Gardens in London , where ornate fountains shimmer in the sunshine , it 's difficult to imagine that this famously damp city has less water per person at its disposal than Dallas , Rome , or Istanbul .
But it 's true , and the problem is getting worse .
I 'm sitting in a restaurant next to the gardens with John Rodda , a hydrologist with Britain 's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology .
White - haired and buttoned - down , Rodda presents his doom - and - gloom outlook with quintessential British stoicism .
He pulls out a map of Britain and points to the country 's southeast , printed an angry shade of red to indicate water scarcity .
" We fall well below the World Bank standard , per capita , of a water - stressed region , " he says .
In the summer of 2006 , London was hit by the worst drought in three decades .
After two consecutive dry winters ( the time of year when rainfall usually replenishes the water supply ) , the city imposed restrictions on watering lawns , filling swimming pools , and other nonessential uses .
Newspaper columnists raised the specter of Londoners lining up at fire hydrants to collect water rations .
Desperate to maintain supplies , water companies considered extreme measures : cloud seeding , bulk transportation by tanker , even towing icebergs down from the Arctic .
Unlike Arizona , where industry and agriculture use the vast majority of the water , London serves mainly the people who live there .
But there are a lot of them : 7.5 million , expected to exceed 8 million by 2016 .
" We 've got a huge number of people living on a small island where it does n't rain as much as people think , " says Jacob Tompkins , director of Waterwise , a London - based nonprofit devoted to water efficiency , " and we 're living in the driest bits . "
The 2006 drought made it clear that anything more severe , like a longer run of dry winters , would push the system toward collapse .
" It would shut down the economy , " Tompkins says .
Then there 's the changing pattern of rainfall .
After the 2006 drought , the summer of 2007 was one of the wettest on record .
But that rain fell in downpours rather than the customary drizzle , causing devastating floods .
" It used to rain the same amount every year , " Tompkins continues .
" We built some reservoirs and it was fine .
But rainfall intensity has doubled , and rain comes in storm events .
In terms of infrastructure , that does n't work very well . "
L. J. Arthur , a farmer in Australia 's desiccated Murray - Darling basin .
Photos : Donald MilneLondon 's infrastructure has a more fundamental problem :
It 's creaking with age .
" Charles Dickens was the best - selling author when most of our pipe work went in , " says John Halsall , director of water services at Thames Water , the private company that provides water to greater London .
Thames
Water maintains more than 300 reservoirs , 99 treatment plants , and more than 20,000 miles of pipe .
The city 's water system was a triumph of 19th - century engineering , but one - third of the mains are more than 150 years old , veterans of such scourges as Hitler 's bombs and corrosively acidic soil .
Thames ' system leaks 180 million gallons a day , 30 percent of overall flow .
To fix a leak , which the company does some 82,000 times a year , it has to shut down traffic and dig up the streets in one of the most congested cities on Earth .
A brief walk around the West End turns up a half - dozen work crews digging up Victorian mains , scooping through layers of history to repair the pipes one segment at a time .
Replacing all the Victorian pipes would cost an estimated $ 3.6 billion .
The conundrum facing Thames Water is how to upgrade the crumbling system without tearing up the city or bankrupting the company .
There are two sets of solutions :
On one hand are small , local , high tech projects .
On the other are traditional large - scale civil engineering initiatives that have been a staple of water management since the Roman Empire .
Tompkins favors the small - scale approach .
In particular , he likes metering .
There 's no way to measure the water flowing through much of the underground infrastructure , which makes it hard to identify leaky sections .
Likewise , not even a quarter of the city 's households are metered , and that makes it difficult to encourage conservation .
If consumers understood exactly how much they were using , Tompkins reasons , perhaps they would change their behavior , like a dieter motivated by the scale readout every morning .
Metering addresses a lack of information about water at the lowest level , right in the pipe .
And now there 's a way to do it more effectively than ever .
In the grand tea room of a posh business club known as the Institute of Directors , overlooked by huge oil portraits of admirals and lords , Michael Tapia shows me a device called iStaq .
Tapia is CEO of Qonnectis , iStaq 's manufacturer .
Barely the size of a hardcover book , the unit can be tucked away under a manhole cover and transmit measurements of water level , pressure , flow , and other variables .
" The system itself is intelligent , " Tapia says .
" It will send you an email or text saying , You have a burst pipe . ' "
Qonnectis has a $ 400,000 contract with Thames Water to help detect leaks .
The Thirst of Nations
Electric , gas , and water utilities all stand to benefit from smart metering .
So far , smart water meters have been deployed mostly in oil - rich Middle Eastern cities like Doha and Abu Dhabi , where water is precious and infrastructure relatively new .
However , simply measuring the flow is a surprisingly powerful motivator .
Research shows that installing a meter in a house so people can see how much water they 're using can reduce consumption by 10 percent .
With the right political carrots and sticks , Tompkins estimates , 70 percent of the city 's homes could be metered in just over a decade .
" People need to get away from the idea that you just turn on the tap and all the water you want is there , " he says .
As promising as smart meters are , giant utilities like to think big , and to them metering is only one drop in an Olympic - size pool .
Thames
Water has grander designs .
The company hopes to dig a 20 - mile drainage tunnel , called the Thames Tideway , underneath the river to its sewage treatment plant .
The structure would be a hedge against climate change , designed to prevent the city 's sewers from flushing into the watercourse as storms intensified .
And to address storage capacity , plans call for a huge new reservoir in Oxfordshire .
But projects of this scale can take 20 years to complete , and the company is under pressure to find new supplies sooner than that .
Thames
Water 's most controversial project is a $ 400 million desalination plant called the Thames Gateway .
The proposed facility could take in seawater , filter out the salt , and deliver 35 million gallons of drinking water a day during drought emergencies .
Desalination would essentially drought - proof the city , the company claims .
It 's an appealing solution .
The ocean is practically limitless , and the plant would run on biodiesel , giving it a green imprimatur .
The project was moving through the approval process in 2006 when London 's tough , left - leaning mayor , Ken Livingstone , blocked it .
Livingstone argued that the plant was too expensive and that desalination is too energy - intensive .
Stripping seawater of its salt is a pricey way to obtain freshwater , cost - effective only for high - end uses like drinking , but not bathing or watering gardens .
And the mayor questioned the proposal 's environmental cred : Biodiesel emits carbon , and desalination 's super - salty byproduct is toxic to marine life .
Thames
Water would do better , he insisted , to repair London 's decrepit labyrinth of pipes .
With the desalination plant deadlocked , London is running out of time .
" The big projects we do are taking longer and longer to get approval , and it does n't take much to throw them off track , " Halsall says .
" While we 're debating , the risk increases to our basic supply . "
Australia has always been dry .
It 's the most arid continent after Antarctica .
Covering an area roughly the size of the lower 48 states , it supports less than one - tenth the US population , and even that is an enormous strain on water supplies .
The country was founded during the second - worst drought in its history , but the worst dry spell is unfolding right now .
Rainfall , which has declined to 25 percent of the long - term average , is projected to plummet another 40 percent by 2050 .
Three factors are working to desiccate the landscape .
One is simple overexploitation of existing resources .
More water is withdrawn to support agriculture , industry , and cities than the system can handle .
Another is El Niño , a weather pattern that periodically alters rainfall , further drying the continent .
The third is climate change .
Australia is growing hotter , which compounds the other two problems by boosting both consumption and evaporation .
The Thirst of Nations
The convergence of these factors could have catastrophic results .
Every major city in Australia is hobbled by mandatory restrictions on water consumption , but most of the country 's water — two - thirds — goes to agriculture .
The economics of food production have always been based on ready access to cheap water .
The price of beer has been rising since a jump in barley prices , a development that many joke could lead to large - scale civil unrest .
But it 's no joke :
The global price of wheat hit its highest level in decades in December , partly due to Australia 's water shortage .
The most fundamental impact of scarcity will be on Australia 's ability to feed itself .
Two hundred miles north of Melbourne , in a dusty farmyard in Moulamein , New South Wales , L. J. Arthur slides open a large steel barn door and steps into the shadows .
A few minutes later , the silver - haired , 53 - year - old rice grower emerges pushing a helicopter on detachable wheels , the tail rotor braced against his shoulder .
We clamber into the bubble cockpit .
" From the air , you 'll get a much better sense of what two years with no water looks like , " he says , checking the gauges .
A cloud of dust billows around us , and the pitch of the rotor 's whine rises as we pull away from the ground .
We climb to 1,000 feet , and Arthur shouts over the engine , " In a normal year , this would be a carpet of every shade of green imaginable , rice fields as far as you can see . "
The landscape is tinder - dry , the fields a shorn patchwork of grays and browns , stretching in mind - boggling flatness toward the ochre wastes of the outback .
" In a normal year , we 'd have 1.2 million tons of rice under production .
This year we have 15,000 , and there 's no telling if that will make it . "
Rice is often dismissed as the wrong crop for the region because it requires flood irrigation .
But producers in the basin can grow 10 tons per hectare , among the highest yields in the world .
We swoop low over a stubble field , scattering a flock of emus .
A huge red kangaroo lies languidly in the shade of a eucalyptus .
The local native animals are doing fine for now , Arthur tells me , helped along by a watering pond he dug for his sheep .
But the future of people in this arid corner of an arid continent is far less certain .
For the second year in a row , the region 's rice farmers have received no water at all from the Murray River , the 1,500 - mile lifeline that flows out of the Snowy Mountains and helps hydrate the cropland for 40 percent of Australia 's food .
Inflows into the Murray River last year were the lowest in 116 years of recorded levels , almost half the previous low .
Reservoirs in the southern basin hold only 20 percent of capacity , and the summer drawdown has n't begun .
No one who tries to eke out a living from this land is untouched .
The 400,000 - square - mile Murray - Darling basin , named for the two main rivers that run through it , receives only 6 percent of the continent 's increasingly scarce rainfall .
In some places , the groundwater is too salty to drink .
Coastal cities are investing in desalination plants , but desalting technology is simply too expensive to use for agriculture .
Without irrigation from the river , agriculture could n't exist here .
The farms would literally dry up and blow away .
We land near downtown Moulamein , where a dozen tractors are parked around a shallow clay pit the size of a shopping mall .
Since no crops are in the ground , the government has hired local growers to dig the giant hole as an emergency reservoir for the town .
Some cash - strapped farmers are now members of road - building crews .
A nearby rice - processing plant laid off 90 workers , and the press has reported on depression and suicide among ruined farmers .
Many small towns in the basin are teetering on the brink of economic collapse .
A few hours away from Arthur 's farm , the managers of the Coleambally Irrigation Cooperative have set out to make Australian agriculture viable .
The co-op is a group of 320 farmers connected by a 300 - mile network of irrigation channels .
Their section of the basin received just 3 percent of its water allocation in December .
That means they 'll have to become vastly more efficient .
Bringing that about is the goal of Murray Smith , Coleambally Irrigation 's CEO .
In Australia , one - third of agricultural water , on average , is lost to leakage , seepage , evaporation , and faulty metering .
Smith thinks the future of farming in Australia is " more crop per drop . "
Toward that end , his company has invested $ 15 million in a host of technologies to minimize waste .
In a back room at Coleambally headquarters , Smith calls up a series of displays on a computer screen showing real - time measurements of flow , temperature , and salinity at remote - controlled irrigation gates spread over thousands of acres .
Software helps determine exactly where water is being wasted ; problems can be addressed by opening or closing gates .
Out where the canals draw water from the river , automated flume gates control the inflow .
This kind of centralized management is revolutionizing irrigation .
It 's the same sort of network that allows engineers at Thames Water to watch over London 's water supply , the same technology that lets Intel managers optimize the flow of millions of gallons through Fab 32 .
There are other datastreams as well .
In much the way an MRI depicts the inner workings of the human body , Smith 's co-op is using electromagnetic imaging to map the hidden hydrography beneath fields , showing where buried streambeds lurk to draw away precious irrigation water .
Sensors dragged through canals can help spot seepage , and sensors embedded in soil can help tailor the irrigation to a particular crop .
Eventually , all of this data will be monitored by the farmers themselves through a single Web site , providing a more precise picture of water use than growers have ever had .
Not every farmer wants to risk being an early adopter .
When Smith took over the company four years ago , some of the new systems were having problems .
Gates did n't work , metering was off , and some crops were lost .
Farmers were angry .
Smith received death threats .
" We 're talking about people 's livelihoods , " he says .
Still , Smith has faith in the co-op 's network .
" Nobody has ever integrated all these technologies into a single irrigation district .
Coleambally is going to be the best in the world . "
But what about the inescapable facts of drought , climate change , overuse , and scarcity ?
Smith acknowledges that pain is inevitable , and he envisions a fierce competition among the basin 's farmers .
Some farmers will be ruined .
Some will cash out , availing themselves of one of Australia 's newest innovations , an open market for water rights , where 1 megaliter ( 264,000 gallons ) goes for $ 360 .
Those who survive will be the ones who use water most efficiently by planting less - thirsty crops and adopting better methods , and they 'll have the market to themselves .
" There are benefits to being the last man standing , " Smith says .
The flow of water through a swath of drought - stricken farmland is complicated .
The hydrology of an entire continent is mind - boggling .
A day 's drive to the east , in the leafy , ironically drizzly capital city of Canberra , I meet Stuart Minchin , a specialist in water information systems who works for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation .
CSIRO 's campus is spread across a lush , eucalyptus - covered hillside above the capital , and Minchin has invited me to see his baby , the Water Resources Observation Network .
The centerpiece of the facility is a new $ 1 million computing and visualization center .
I follow Minchin into a large , windowless space outfitted like a cross between the set of The Situation Room and the deck of a Star Destroyer .
One wall is covered with several theater - size screens .
A bank of computer monitors flashes graphics .
" The problem with both water science and water policy is that there 's a vast amount of data and no easy way to understand it , " Minchin says .
" We 're thinking about how to create spatial understanding of water issues . "
I don a pair of 3 - D glasses , and a huge map of Australia leaps off one of the screens , scattered with dozens of blue bar graphs that seem to reach out toward me .
Information about reservoir levels in Murray - Darling used to be spread among 40 Australian agencies .
So WRON set up a Web robot to screen - scrape the data and display it on a satellite map .
A graphical slider tracks the levels by date .
" It 's a very powerful way to show information , " Minchin says .
He imagines using a Google Street View - type technology to map an entire watershed , down to the last wilting gum tree .
The Thirst of Nations
In an adjoining room , a huge bank of servers whirs :
The Intel processors , whose manufacture is draining the Colorado River half a world away , are being harnessed to solve Australia 's water crisis .
" We 've never known the answers to basic questions like how much water is in the entire basin , " Minchin says .
For more than a year , this supercomputer has been crunching 40 terabytes of remote sensing data .
When it 's finished this year , the analysis will shed light on the way water moves through the region and the consequences of human exploitation .
It could hold the secret to restoring the Murray - Darling basin to health .
Minchin is confident that WRON will make a crucial difference to Australia 's future — but he does n't underestimate the challenge .
" We 'll never have a secure continent , " he says .
" But at least we can know what the limits are and try not to exceed them . "
On the other side of the Snowy Mountains , Hume Dam corrals the Murray River into one of the largest reservoirs in Australia .
When construction was finished in 1936 , Hume was among the world 's greatest public - works projects .
It can store 400 trillion gallons and release them at will , providing a stable source of water to the farms and towns along the Murray River and securing Australia 's economy for the foreseeable future .
In the sweltering heat , I walk across the concrete expanse of the spillway , more than a mile from end to end .
Far below , Lake Hume is not even a quarter full .
In Peter Gleick 's view , we have to move away from the " hard path , " the massive civil - engineering projects and exploitation of untapped sources that defined the 20th century .
Instead , we must turn to a " soft path , " making the most efficient use of what we already have .
Technology can help , and some new infrastructure will be necessary , Gleick believes .
But the larger issue is conceptual :
We must view efficiency itself as a source of water and tap this hidden wellspring .
Americans already use 20 percent less water per capita than they did a generation ago .
Gains in industrial use are even more impressive : A ton of US steel manufactured today requires just 2 percent of the water it did in the 1940s .
Still , we are using more than we have .
Can we change enough , and soon enough ?
" The whole point of peak water , " Gleick says , " is that we have to fundamentally rethink who gets to use water for what . "
It 's the first day of Australia 's summer , the beginning of Lake Hume 's annual drawdown .
Measuring rods poke out of the earth high above the lake 's surface .
Reaching far up the valley , a forest of dead gum trees , drowned decades ago when the lake was filled , is reemerging .
Black spires poke their skeletal branches skyward .
It 's an eerie sight .
In the worst - case scenario , Lake Hume will contract to 1 percent capacity this summer .
The bed of the Murray River will be all that remains .

Police are using thermal imaging cameras to search for cannabis factories
By Julian Joyce
BBC News
By toughening the law on cannabis the government hopes to drive a crackdown on UK " farms " , many of which have sprung up in recent years .
In the cellar beneath Jimmy 's house , cannabis seedlings flourish under bright lights .
Upstairs , taking over half the attic , more mature plants flower in lamp - lit trays , amid the hum of automatic water and nutrient delivery systems .
This is " hydroponic " cannabis - grown without soil in trays .
Jimmy 's indoor " farm " is one of many to have sprung up behind the walls and closed curtains of houses across the UK in recent years .
It is the sort of operation Home Secretary Jacqui Smith hopes to crush with her commitment last month to stiffen the laws on cannabis .
[ I never stay ] in the same house long enough for a pattern to build up
Jimmy , on how he avoids detection
Cannabis laws to be strengthened " In the past few years we have seen a massive growth in the commercial cultivation of cannabis in the UK , " Ms Smith told Parliament .
" This can not be tolerated .
Reclassifying cannabis will help to drive enforcement priorities in shutting those farms down . "
While gangs of " organised criminals " are the chief target , according to Ms Smith , " freelance " growers are unlikely to escape the crackdown .
That means people like Jimmy ( not his real name ) who operates from an unassuming house on the outskirts of a large city in the north of England .
The 25 - year - old says he is not a member of a gang - rather he styles himself a cannabis " fan " , who grows mainly for his own use .
His seeds are bred , he says , to produce plants of high potency .
It 's a trend that been noted more widely in recent years - with stronger strains blamed for causing psychosis in some users .
The air in the attic is damp and warm , but not excessively so .
For Jimmy , the advantage of his system is that once set up , it can be largely left to run itself .
He calls himself a " medium - size " grower - once his flowers ripen in July , he hopes to harvest between 20 and 30 ounces of the drug .
And while much of it , he says , he will smoke himself - during the interview he constantly pulls on powerful cannabis joints - the rest is given to friends .
Police raid
But his casual attitude belies the fact that he would face severe punishment if caught .
Production of cannabis - the legal term for growing - is punishable by 14 years in prison .
Inside Jimmy 's cannabis factory house Jimmy is constantly aware of the dangers his criminal activities pose - a few days before the interview , the house directly opposite was raided by the police .
He thinks they may have been tipped off by the odour of cannabis - plus , possibly , a steep electricity bill .
Power bills are potentially the biggest weakness - he estimates his current crop will set him back over £ 300 on electricity alone .
Other growers , in particular criminal gangs , bypass the problem by wiring directly - and often dangerously - into the electricity mains .
Fire is a serious risk - in London in 2006 , 50 cannabis farms were discovered as a result of house fires .
The real secret to avoid capture , he says , is to " keep moving " .
He never stays " in the same house long enough for a pattern to build up " .
FALL IN CANNABIS USE Cannabis use among young people appears to be falling , despite downgrading in 2004 According to the British crime survey , 20.9 % of 16 - 24 - year - olds used cannabis in 2006 - 7 , compared with 28.2 % in 1998 - 99 Among 16 - 59 - year - olds , use down to 8.2 % or 2.6 m people
But although penalties for cannabis cultivation were toughed in 2004 , the government hopes its move to return the drug to its Class B status will spawn a wider crackdown by police .
It also plans to clamp down on the sort of supplies that Jimmy can currently buy legally for his cannabis cultivation .
After giving a tour of his house , Jimmy needs to stock up on supplies and heads to an anonymous warehouse on the south side of the city .
Garden centre equipment
Here , the shopkeeper - a taciturn individual with heavy tattoos on both arms - watches silently as his customer inspects an extensive array of cannabis paraphernalia : thick black plastic sheeting ( to block out ambient light ) , state - of - the - art irrigation systems , bulbs .
SKUNK
So - called because it has a very strong smell
Three times stronger than other types of cannabis Contains much higher levels of the active ingredient - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) Now accounts for up to 80 % of samples seized by police
Six years ago it accounted for 15 % of sample None of this equipment is illegal .
Indeed , the hydroponics industry argues - and the police reluctantly agree - most of it can be purchased quite legally at ordinary garden centres .
But in a report earlier this year , the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs suggested lawmakers looked at whether cannabis seeds could be covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act .
Unsurprisingly , the ease with which profits can be made from growing cannabis means bigger players than Jimmy are cramming into the business - namely , gangs of organised criminals , many of them Vietnamese in origin .
Cmdr Allan Gibson , of the Metropolitan Police , estimates half the factories raided in London had been set up and run by Vietnamese gangs .
Cmdr Gibson , who also heads up the fight against cannabis cultivation for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) describes how a typical factory comes about .
A gang member normally approaches a landlord and offers to pay six months rent in advance .
He and his cohorts then set to work , blacking out windows and converting as much of the house as possible - sometimes gutting it in the process - into " grow - rooms " , complete with lamps and irrigation systems .
Code of conduct " We would estimate it usually takes just one harvest - usually in three months - for the gang to turn a profit , " he says .
" This is why it is vital to raid the houses as soon as they start up - that hurts the gangs in their pockets . "
" This is not a victimless crime .
Cannabis is a harmful drug - which is why the government wants to raise its classification . "
The Metropolitan Police show off one of their thermal imaging cameras Acpo is in discussion with the Home Office about ways of tackling organised cultivation .
Measures might include an onus on landlords to check out potential tenants more thoroughly .
Those who sold equipment that might be used to produce cannabis could also face regulation , says Cmdr Gibson .
The possibility of tightened rules is now starting to worry those who those who supply growing equipment .
Phil Kilv , who organises an annual trade exhibition where suppliers come to show off their wares , says discussions are being held about a " code of conduct " within the industry .
" We are looking at age restrictions on who we supply to .
We also need to make sure that we are not supplying criminal gangs .
For example , that could mean limits on the amount of fertilisers we supply . "
Back in his attic and surrounded by his plants , cannabis enthusiast Jimmy also muses on the direction the cannabis business seems to be taking .
" It 's a big shame that the organised gangs are taking over , " he says .
" They do n't believe in cannabis - to them it 's just a way to make money . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
I started growing weed as a hobby grower in 1994 , when hydroponics were first emerging as a major force in the UK growing scene .
I used to crop quite enough for personal use - worked out at about 1,500 grams a year , or an eighth ( 3.5 - 4 grams ) a day .
The growing scene is more established now and the quality of some of the equipment involved has improved somewhat but really little has changed in the 14 years since ( incidentally , this " Skunk " people keep writing about was bred in the USA in the 1970s , so nothing new there either ) .
I can understand why the police want to bust people growing huge numbers of plants for commercial purposes - especially if they are stealing electricity ( cheapskates ) - but I do hope they do n't waste their time busting hobby growers .
Safely done , it really is a victimless crime ( unless you consider the user - grower to be the victim of their own vices ) .
Cannabis is harmful , yes , but not particularly so .
w.abc1.male , London
Two things wrong with this article , cannabis use is a victimless crime and it is a lot less harmful than the two best selling taxed drugs in the country , achohol and cigarettes .
With all the crime that goes on in this country could n't the police concentrate on something a bit more important instead of helping MP 's score political points !
Paul McConnell , Carnoustie
At least this way the small home grower for personal use is not targeted and actual DEALERS are in the line of fire
annon , london I 'm not sure how cracking down on small time growers is going to discourage criminal gangs .
Is this not going to only drive up price and also only spur on the big risk takers ( hardened criminals ) ?
I think the government should talk to Arnie in California for some tips and ask him about the tax revenue from cannabis .
Police officers should be employed to tackle real crime .
As for taking it out of the hands of criminal gangs ?
There is only one answer .
All others are lip service or outdated thinking .
bob , I run my own IT business from home , and have at least 5 web servers and other computers running 24 / 7 in my loft .
I can't wait for the police to use their IR camera around here : my house will stand out like a sore thumb .
John , Southampton " Toughening " the law just makes cultivation less attractive to small scale enthusiast farmers like Jimmy , and more lucrative to gangsters .
Organised crime bosses are undoubtedly ecstatic with the Government 's U - turn on cannabis policy , which will do absolutely nothing either to reduce supply , or to improve quality and thereby reduce risk .
Billy , Leeds
We live in a quiet village in Norfolk .
The house next door to ours was being rented out although we never saw anyone there .
The next thing we knew the police had turned up and we found out the house was being used as a cannabis factory .
Hopefully there will be a crackdown on this .
Louise , Norwich , England
How interesting , the police first relax the laws and grow shops appear around the country and then they sit back and wait for people to start so that they can bust them .
What a complete waste of time and police resources .
Are n't we forgetting that tax is paid on the equipment which in turn goes back into society .
Perhaps if this country had a less sensationalist , more informed view of cannabis ( a natural growing weed ) it would be legalised therefore becoming a taxed item like anything else we can buy in a shop .
Perhaps then so called ' criminals ' and ' users ' i.e elderly people with back pain or arthritis to give just one example would n't be imprisoned and the police could find the real criminals selling crack cocaine and heroin .

The Army 's soldier suit of the future , once left for dead , appears to be crawling back to life .
After 15 years and a half - billion dollars in development , the Army officially cancelled the Land Warrior program , and its collection of electronic maps , GPS beacons , digital radios , and next - gen rifle scopes for infantrymen .
All kinds of configurations of the wearable electronics were tried .
But the gear always wound up being too bulky to justify the seemingly - modest help it provided frontline soldiers , the Army decided .
It was a major let - down .
Over the last decade , the military has connected nearly all its command posts and all its vehicles into a kind of internet for battle .
That allowed them to , at the very least , see each other 's locations and better coordinate attacks .
Land Warrior was supposed to bring the individual soldier into the network .
Money had already been spent to equip a single Iraq - bound battalion with the gear , however .
So , despite some pretty horrendous reviews from the troops , the Army let the 4/9th Infantry take Land Warrior with them to war .
And then , something rather odd and unexpected happened .
The 4/9 – known since the early 1900's as the " Manchus , " for their fighting in China – stripped Land Warrior down , made the gear more functional , and discovered the equipment could actually be pretty useful in combat .
By consolidating parts , a
16 - pound ensemble was whittled down to a little more than 10 .
A the digital gun scope was abandoned – too cumbersome and too slow for urban fights .
And not every soldier in the 4/9 was ordered to lug around Land Warrior .
Only team leaders and above were equipped .
The Manchus suggested new features to Land Warrior 's software , too .
Like " digital chem lights , " which let buildings , escape routes , and enemies be marked in green on every soldier 's electronic map .
During air assaults on Baquba , for instance , troops were regularly dropped a quarter or half - kilometer from their original objective ; the chem lights allowed them to converge on the spot where they were supposed to go .
In the middle of one mission , a trail of green lights was used to mark a new objective – and show the easiest way to get to the place .
Not every Manchu had his mind changed .
But enough were impressed that the leaders of the 2nd Infantry Division 's 5th Brigade Combat Team officially asked the Army to give them 1,000 units of an upgraded Land
Warrior system .
And now , * * Inside Defense reports , that request has been approved .
Land Warrior may be back from extinction .
If they can get the $ 102 million needed to field and test the things .
Once a program is officially cancelled , that 's hard to do .
Lt. Col. Brian Cummings , program manager for Land Warrior is optimistic , however .
“ It ’s looking very promising that we ’re going to get that funding and move forward , ” he tells Inside Defense .
Last year , the Senate Armed Services Committee asked for $ 80 million to revive Land Warrior – going over the Army 's head , in effect .
This time , the lawmakers wo n't have to .

( CNN ) --
Three men accused last year of a plot to bomb New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport were headed to the United States late Tuesday after their fight against extradition from Trinidad and Tobago was rejected by an appeals court there , Trinidad and U.S. officials said .
Kareem Ibrahim , Abdul Kadir and Abdel Nur are accused of a plot to blow up fuel lines and tanks at the airport .
They were jailed in Trinidad and Tobago while a fourth defendant , Russel DeFreitas , already has pleaded innocent in New York .
A Trinidad and Tobago judge ordered the three to be extradited in February , but it was delayed until this week when the appeals judge rejected their appeal on a technicality , said David West , an attorney in the office of the Trinidad and Tobago Attorney General .
The appeals judge ruled the defendants filed their arguments " out of time , " and their lawyers had not filed papers to explain why so " the judge had no choice but to strike out their appeal , " West said .
West said the men were placed on an FBI plane at 7 p.m. Tuesday .
The FBI 's spokesman in Miami confirmed that the three defendants were put on a flight to the United States on Tuesday evening .
Their lawyers had earlier argued that Trinidad and Tobago law does not allow for extradition on terrorism conspiracy charges .
U.S. prosecutors say the men not only plotted but carried out actual actions toward bombing the airport .
Some of their conversations were secretly taped by an informant , according to court documents filed by the government .
A 40 - mile aviation fuel pipeline runs from a fuel tank farm at JFK through Staten Island , Brooklyn and Queens , according to New York Police .
Ibrahim is from Trinidad .
Nur and Kadir are from Guyana .
The three , who all have maintained their innocence , were being held at a maximum security prison in Trinidad .

I 'm always interested in new ways to present the ideas of quantum mechanics to a wider audience .
Unfortunately the conventional description of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of complex numbers and vector spaces making it difficult to avoid falling back on misleading analogies and metaphors .
But there 's another approach to quantum mechanics , due to Feynman , that I have never seen mentioned in the popular science literature .
It assumes only basic knowledge of probability theory and negative numbers to get a foot on the ladder .
We start with tweaking probability theory a bit .
One of the axioms of probability theory says that all probabilities must lie in the range zero to one .
However , we could imagine relaxing this rule even though on the face of it it seems meaningless .
For example , suppose we have a coin that has a 3 / 2 chance of landing heads and a - 1/2 chance of landing tails .
We can still reason that the chance of getting two heads in a row is 3/2×3/2=9/4 by the usual multiplication rule .
But obviously no situation like this could ever arise in the real world because after tossing such a coin 10 times we 'd expect to see - 5 tails on average .
But what if we could contrive a system with some kind of internal state governed by negative probabilities even though we could n't observe it directly ?
So consider this case : a machine produces boxes with ( ordererd ) pairs of bits in them , each bit viewable through its own door .
Let 's suppose the probability of each possible combination of two bits is given by the following table : Obviously if we were able to look through both doors we 'd end up with the meaningless prediction that we'd expect to see 00 a negative number of times .
But suppose that things are arranged so that we can only look through one door .
Maybe the boxes self - destruct if one or other door is opened but you still get enough time to see what was behind the door .
Now what happens ?
If you look through the first door the probability of seeing 1 is P ( 10 ) + P( 11 ) =1 .
We get the same result if we look through the second door .
We only get probabilities in the range zero to one .
As long as we 're restricted to one door we get meaningful results .
If we were to perform this experiment repeatedly with different runs of the machine , each time picking a random door to look through , we 'd eventually become very confident that every box contained 11 .
After all , if we freely choose which door to look through , and we always see 1 , there 's no place 0's could be ' hiding ' .
But now suppose a new feature is added to the box that allows us to compare the two bits to see if they are equal .
It reveals nothing about what the bits are , just their state of equality .
And of course , after telling us , it self - destructs .
We now find that the probability of the two bits being different is P ( 01 ) + P( 10 ) =1 .
So if we randomly chose one of the three possible observations each time the machine produced the box we 'd quickly run into the strange situation that the two bits both appear to be 1 , and yet are different .
But note that although the situation is weird , it 's not meaningless .
As long as we never get to see both bits at the same time we never directly observe a paradox .
If we met such boxes in the real world we'd be forced to conclude that maybe the boxes knew which bit you were going to look at and changed value as a result , or that maybe you did n't have the free will to choose door that you thought you had , or maybe , even more radically , you 'd conclude that the bits generated by the machine were described by negative probabilities .
That 's all very well , but obviously the world does n't really work like this and we never see boxes like this .
Except that actually it does !
The EPR experiment has many similarities to the scenario I described above .
The numbers are n't quite the same , and we 're not talking about bits in boxes , but we do end up with a scenario involving observations of bits that simply do n't add up .
If we do try to explain what 's going on using probability theory , we either conclude there 's something weird about our assumptions of locality or causality or we end up assigning negative probabilities to the internal states of our systems .
In fact , you can read the details in an article by David Schneider .
Being forced to conclude that we have negative probabilities in a physical system is usually taken as a sign that we have a contradiction .
In the case of Bell 's theorem it shows that we can't interpret what we see in terms of probability theory and hence that the weirdness of quantum mechanics can't be explained in terms of some hidden random variable that we can't see .
QM simply does n't obey the rules you 'd expect of hidden variables we can't see .
But in a paper called Negative Probability , Feynman tried taking the idea of negative probabilities seriously .
He showed that you could reformulate quantum mechanics completely in terms of them so that you no longer needed to think in terms of the complex number valued ' amplitudes ' that physicists normally use .
This means the above is n't just an analogy , it 's actually a formal system within which you can do QM , although I have n't touched on the bit that refers to the dynamics of quantum systems .
So if you can get your head around the ideas I 've talked about above you 're well on your way to understanding some reasons why quantum mechanics seems so paradoxical .
At this point you may be wondering how nature contrives to hide these negative probabilities from direct observation .
Her trick is that making one kind of observation disturbs up the state of what you 've observed so that you can't make the other kind of observation on a pristine state .
You have to pick one kind of observation or the other .
Electrons and photons really are a lot like the boxes I just described .
So why do n't physicists use this formulation ?
Despite the fact that negative numbers seem simpler to most people than imaginary numbers , the negative number formulation of QM is much more complicated .
What 's more , because it makes exactly the same predictions as regular QM there 's no compelling reason to switch to it .
And anyway , it 's not as if directly observing negative probabilities is any more intuitive or meaningful than imaginary ones .
Once you 've introduced negative ones , you might as well go all the way !
This all ties in with what I said a while back .
The important thing about QM is that having two ways to do something can make it less likely to happen , not more .
For a different perspective this is an interesting comment .
Footnote :
We can embed QM in negative probability theory .
But can we do the converse ?
Can every negative probability distribution be physically realised in a quantum system ?
I 've a hunch the answer is obvious but I 'm too stupid to see it .
John
Yoo must be disbarred , and held accountable for his so - called “ torture memo ” .
The ACLU has just demanded that a Special Prosecutor be called immediately .
I proposed this , with help , last February when BuZh admitted his guilt !!
And I have repeatedly asked that the OpEd News readers read the information I have provided in the links below .
It is time that all these items get maximum exposure , and are posted on the social networks , including this column .
I ask that we accept NO SUBSTITUTES other than than immediate action .
Please help this important information go viral !
Post it everywhere !!
http://www.opednews.com/articles/2/genera_ladybroa_080215_special_prosecutor_i.htm
I ask that everyone please start writing articles which includes the special prosecutor information link in it - you can still digg that item UP and you can also digg up the Blackwater proposal !!
I have followed all this intentlly - and I do n't think " running John Yoo " out of town on a rail is the answer !!
I think the momentum to finally get people to act in concert and move people out of their armchairs is here at last .
People can be of GREAT ASSISTANCE here at OpEd News - we can provide the legal information people need .

Magnetic resonance imaging is the most popular method for scanning the brain both for research and for clinical investigations .
I ’ve just found a wonderfully written article that gives a great introduction to the physics of how MRI scanners work .
It is both clearly written for the non-specialist and fantastically complete .
This is a rare and valuable combination .
There are some other guides to MRI physics which are also wonderfully written but most lack the sufficient detail that would bring you up to ‘ entry level ’ in the field .
For example , How Stuff Work ’s guide to MRI is a great place to start , but it wo n’t tell you about why and how T1 and T2 imaging are different , or any of the other things you need to know to understand the fundamentals of MRI technology .
You do n’t need to know maths to understand the article ( the downfall of most ‘ introductory ’ guides to MRI ) and the author uses wonderfully clear analogies throughout .
The article is written by radiologist Robert Pooley , who should give himself a pat on the back for such a great job .
It was published as an open - access paper in the journal RadioGraphics .
Perfection !

It ’s gone .
HD DVD lost the war , Blu - Ray is the winner .
Toshiba has admitted defeat and will discontinue all of its HD DVD products .
No more players , no more recorders , no more discs , no more Xbox 360 players , it ’s all dead in the water .
And that leaves you HD DVD owners up a certain creek without a paddle .
But , it ’s not all doom and gloom .
For a start , if you do have an HD DVD player , you ’re about to get your hands on some seriously cheap movies ; expect markdowns of 75 % or more .
And if you do n’t own an HD DVD player yet , would you be so stupid as to buy one now ?
Well , why not ?
Sure , the future is dead .
But the movies you can get right now , coupled with the silly price of the players , means that you can quickly build a library of your favorite movies in the highest quality at a fraction of the price of Blu - Ray , or even regular DVD .
Maybe not something for the living room , but if you ’ve got a den it beats the crappy old VHS player that chews up your tapes and spits them back at you with glee .
If all that is of no comfort , which to be honest it probably is n’t , here ’s a list I ’ve put together of things you could do with your player and discs .
1 : One million dollars !
Create a powerful “ laser ” weapon .
Kipkay from Metacafe shows you how to turn an old , defunct laser device into a Maglite laser weapon .
World domination beckons .
2 : Impress friends with really low IQs .
Show them the fantastic set - up you have in your living room , and the amazing quality it produces .
If one of them utters anything like “ Duh , is n’t that like that crappy HD DVD thing ” then eject them from the room and never invite them back .
3 : A Gangster ’s paradise .
Concrete is expensive .
Simply tie an HD DVD player to the feet of a lightweight stooge ( informant ) and send him to sleep with the fishes .
4 : Cheap jewelry .
Ladies ( or pirates ) .
Two HD DVDs dangling from your ear lobes makes an impressive , cheap statement about your fashion sense .
5 : Prop up your kids .
An HD DVD player gives several inches of extra height to kids having trouble reaching the table .
Prop it under them at mealtimes .
Also , they can stand on it to reach things they ’re not supposed to reach but really want to .
6 : Party hearty Marty .
Make a disco ball .
This one uses old CDs , but it ’s the same principle .
All you need is a styrofoam ball , a bottle of glue and a some flared leopardskin pants .
7 : Tom Cruise – gain extra height on the red carpet .
Tie an HD DVD player to each foot and tower over Katie Holmes and those tall people who make fun of Scientology .
8 : Re - gift it .
Ok , so technically it has to be a gift before it can be re-gifted , but now we ’re splitting hairs .
Just box it up and give it to someone as a deliciously nasty present .
Watch them fake a smile and say something like “ wow … that ’s … great .
Really … great . ”
9 : Put it on eBay .
You may be able to make some of your money back .
Not a lot , but it ’s better than nothing .
10 : Keep it for 50 years .
In 2058 it will be a collector ’s item and make you rich .
Most of them will have been junked long ago .
The NYT " Covers " the Susan Lindauer Hearing
From the People Who Brought Us Judith Miller & George Bush
Former New York New York Times reporter , Judith Miller , who wrongly claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and her president .

" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , DC
The New York Times disgraced itself and betrayed the citizens of the United States when it repeatedly headlined misleading stories by reporter Judith Miller that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
The paper issued a meandering apology well after the 2003 prompted by the inaccurate reporting of Miller , the self - styled " Miss Run Amok " reporter , and others .
But it was too little and too late to correct the damage .
And it seems the Times is still running amok at the expense of what 's in the public interest .
One has to wonder if the New York Times and the White House coordinated efforts on the WMD matter .
They certainly worked very well together , propping up in tandem the fear - based prophecy of a menacing Saddam who would deliver his nuclear filled hate to our shores .
This was total nonsense , to put it kindly .
We know that the Bush administration and the New York Times editor , William Keller , communicated about a very sensitive matter before the 2004 election .
New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau had discovered that the Bush administration had been illegally wiretapping citizens since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" Internal discussions about drafts of the article had been ' dragging on for weeks ' before the Nov. 2 election , Mr. Keller acknowledged , " according to an article by Times public editor Byron Calme Instead of publishing the story , Times editor Keller killed and barred the story from public release until December 16 , 2006 , 13 months after the 2004 election .
Was this a coincidence ?
Not at all .
Bush requested the story be killed for " national security " reasons .
Forgetting the paper 's shining moment when it released the Pentagon Papers , Keller willingly complied .
This was the election that would determine if Mr. Bush would have another four years to work the magic that 's brought the nation to its current state of peril .
When the story finally broke , it created a wave of negative reaction across the political spectrum .
Thanks to the New York Times ' deliberate delay , we 'll never know how the public would have responded just weeks before the 2004 vote .
Based on the public response when the story was released , it may well have created enough of a shift to render the dirty tricks of Ohio and elsewhere meaningless .
The false WMD reports represented propaganda of the most frightening type .
It came from reporter Miller who had relied largely on one source , Ahmad Chalabi .
He was on the Defense Department payroll at the time that reporter Miller gained the WMD information from him .
Without any doubt , the New York Times was a major enabler of the Iraq invasion and occupation .
By withholding a most devastating indictment of the lawless regime in power , namely illegal wiretapping of U.S. citizens , the New York Times denied citizens the option of a fully informed choice in 2004 and it played a major role in returning Bush - Cheney to power .
Four thousand U.S. deaths , tens of thousands of life long injuries to U.S. troops , 1.2 million dead Iraqis due to civil strife triggered by the war , 5 million Iraqi orphans , and the loss of United States ' prestige on a massive scale : this is the shared legacy of the New York Times coverage leading up to the Iraq invasion .
A nation on the verge of bankruptcy , foreclosures at epidemic rates , national debt so out of control it is difficult to even measure and a deep recession with possibly worse down the road : this is just a part of the legacy of the New York Times ' coverage of the 2004 election .
How low will they sink ?
Even on a smaller scale , their depths are without limits , it would seem .
The most recent example is the New York Times ' coverage of the competency hearing on June 17 , 2008 in the Susan Lindauer versus the United States in the Federal District Court , Southern District of New York , in lower Manhattan .
Antiwar Activist Returns to Court for Iraq Spy Case , Alan Feuer , New York Times , June 18 , 2008 .
The headline betrays the first major problem with the New York Times coverage .
Susan Lindauer has claimed all along that she was an anti-war and anti-sanctions activist as well as a U.S. asset .
However , no one who has read the indictment or the informed coverage would refer to Lindauer as an accused " spy . "
She is charged with being an " unregistered foreign agent . "
The " high water mark " of the indictment , as Judge Mukasey called it , is the charge that Lindauer attempted to influence U.S. policy on behalf of pre-war Iraq through the delivery of this January 2003 letter to Andrew Card , then chief of staff for President Bush , and Colin Powell , then secretary of state .
The New York Times story opens with this curious statement :
" She rolled her eyes .
She stuck her tongue out at the prosecutor .
It was decidedly not the usual courtroom demeanor .
Then again , it was not the usual federal case . "
New York Times , June 18 , 2008 ( NYT )
I attended the hearing and sat in the front row of the courtroom .
Of all the spectators , I had one of the best views of defendant Susan Lindauer and the witnesses .
With regard to " rolling her eyes , " that was simply not visible from the public seating since Lindauer faced the judge showing spectators only her back except when she turned and was visible in profile .
As for " sticking out her tongue , " I saw no such behavior and Lindauer denies the reporter 's claim vigorously .
The alleged gesture was not reported by the New York Daily News , Associated Press , and New York Metro .
Nor did I report it in this article on the hearing .
Why would the reporter begin a news story with such an inflammatory unverified charge ?
If we skip to the end of the article , we might find an answer .
The reporter closed the story with this statement by Lindauer from her post hearing press conference in the hall just outside Judge Loretta Preska 's courtroom .
" She angrily contested an accusation in her indictment that she had illegally lunched with Iraqi intelligence operatives .
" You want to send me to prison because I had a cheeseburger , " she said , " even though I 'm not the person who actually ate the cheeseburger . "
NYT
The reporter plucked out of context a random remark about cheeseburgers to characterize Lindauer 's denial of serious charges as weak and less than serious .
Lindauer was arguing that the indictment was both flawed and incorrect .
She denied these charges , pointed out that she had not been in the city on the dates alleged , and asserted that she can prove it .
Then she illustrated what she clearly believed to be the absurdity of the charges with the cheeseburger remark .
By lifting this quotation out of context , an entirely different meaning is implied .
The New York Times reporting on the facts of the case is also notably wanting .
The reporter echoed the prosecutors claim that " a half - dozen doctors claimed Lindauer suffered from paranoia and delusions of grandeur . "
Lindauer , the subject of these professionals , questioned the accuracy of the prosecutor 's statement .
The story leaves out the psychiatrist who examined Lindauer just after her arrest and found no such thing .
It fails to mention the two psychotherapists who saw Lindauer over a period of months and failed to report any of this .
Observation and interaction over an extended period are powerful tools for diagnosis .
The reporter also failed to note the completed report submitted to the court by a distinguished Washington , D.C. area psychiatrist and academic which reportedly says that Lindauer is competent to stand trial .
The psychiatrist is scheduled to appear on Lindauer 's behalf at the next hearing before Judge Preska on July 7 , 2008 .
But discovering this would require that the reporter actually talk to the defendant .
This was , after all , a competency hearing on the mental capacity of Lindauer to stand trial .
Would n't you expect the New York Times to cover both sides of the story ?
The New York Times described the last hearing of former judge , now U.S. Attorney General Mukasey , on the prosecution 's request to have Lindauer forcibly drugged .
He said that " Judge Mukasey declined to rule on the request , saying that the case would be assigned to a new judge -- which turned out to be Loretta A. Preska -- and that she would eventually have to decide . "
NYT
That 's entirely incorrect .
In his " Opinion and Order " of Sept. 6 , 2006 , Mukasey wrote : " Based on the evidence presented at a Sell hearing on May 4 and May 9 , 2006 , for the reasons explained below , the government has failed to carry this burden ---
Accordingly , the motion is denied .
" ( Author 's emphasis )
The New York Times article referred to the defense witnesses ' testimony as " suggestively odd . "
Why would the Times make that inference ?
The first witness , Kelly O'Meara , was a former reporter for the Washington Times and Insight Magazine and a senior congressional staffer for over two decades .
She established a strong connection between Lindauer and an individual reported to be a part of U.S. intelligence , a relationship that endured over time .
The second witness , Dr. Parke Godfrey , was deliberate and thoughtful .
He is a long time associate of Lindauer 's and a PhD level associate professor of computer science with a solid academic record .
He told of Lindauer 's anti-war activism and also of her warnings about 911 .
" Appearing for the defense , Dr. Godfrey testified under oath that Lindauer told him of her specific concerns about an attack on the United States .
She told him that a " massive " attack would occur in the southern part of Manhattan , involving airplanes and possibly a nuclear weapon .
The witness said that she mentioned this in the year 2000 , which coincided with the Lockerbie trial .
And then in 2001 , Lindauer also mentioned the anticipated attack in the spring , 2001 and then August 2001 .
Godfrey said , at that time , Lindauer thought an attack was " imminent " and that it would complete what was started in the 1993 bombing ( the original World Trade Center bombing ) . "
" Scoop " Independent News , Michael Collins , June 18 , 2008
The Associated Press covered the 9/11 portion of the testimony but not the New York Times .
The New York Times coverage of this story opens with an inflammatory personal attack verified only by the reporter - the claim that Lindauer stuck her tongue out .
It ends with a quotation clearly out of context leading to a negative view of Lindauer 's coherence .
Combined , the two inflammatory aspersions have the effect of presenting an unstable individual .
Is the reporter qualified to make this assessment from the gallery ?
Is this some new form of remote diagnosis ?
The story erred by ignoring Mukasey 's highly significant " opinion and order " that denied the government the ability to physically force drugs on the defendant .
The reporter jettisoned the facts by claiming that Mukasey simply passed that issue along to Lindauer 's current judge , a factually incorrect statement .
The story ignored mental health reports that are the crux of the competency issue and favorable to Lindauer 's claim , instead relying solely on the prosecutor 's characterization of the government 's evidence .
The New York Times blithely extended the personal attack on Lindauer to her witnesses by calling their testimony " suggestively odd . "
Both witnesses presented calm , considered demeanors , described relevant information , and gave every appearance , in my opinion , of being open and cooperative with the hearing process .
What is the New York Times up to ?
Was this just the product of a bad day by a reporter who preferred to be somewhere else ?
Is the New York Times entering a new realm of coverage that includes highly subjective personal attacks ?
Are we seeing the birth of a new deductive journalism in which the facts are tailored to create a story that the paper prefers ?
These are the people who brought us Judith Miller 's fatal distortions and covered up George Bush 's illegal surveillance activities from consideration in the 2004 election .
They continued that tradition in the article on the Lindauer competency hearing by inflammatory claims that would lead uninformed readers to a significant bias against the defendant and factual errors about the history of the case that are less than helpful .
The reporter from the New York Times characterized Lindauer in a derisive and mocking tone .
If he truly believed the prosecutor 's experts with regard to Lindauer 's mental state , he would be guilty of behavior that is simply not acceptable in almost any circle .
Let 's give him the benefit of the doubt and presume that he had another motive for his characterizations .
Stories like this are not only unbalanced and biased .
They promote injustice to citizens who deserve an opportunity to achieve justice through a fair trial .

THE Communist Party 's top think tank has called for systematic liberalisation , including greater media and religious freedom in the next 12 years , as China seeks to become a " modern civil society " by 2020 .
The report by scholars at the Central Party School in Beijing , the key academy for training top officials , warns that China risks social and economic instability if the ruling Communist Party does not set some limits on its own power and acknowledge that the public are fed up with institutionalised corruption and other abuses .
It comes as China faces increased scrutiny over its human rights record , peaking last week when US film director Steven Spielberg severed his ties with the 2008 Olympics after accusing Beijing of failing to do enough to end atrocities in Darfur committed by its trading partner Sudan .
Zimbabwe 's ruling party lost control of parliament today and the opposition said it had also defeated veteran leader Robert Mugabe in a presidential vote .
Official figures said the combined opposition had taken 105 seats in the 210 seat parliament with one going to an independent .
Mugabe 's ZANU - PF has so far taken 94 .
The mainstream Movement of Democratic Change faction of Morgan Tsvangirai said he had won 50.3 per cent of the presidential vote and Mugabe 43.8 per cent according to its own tallies of results posted outside polling stations .

MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti said this absolute majority was enough for outright victory but Tsvangirai would accept a second round run-off against Mugabe " under protest " .
Biti appealed to Mugabe , president for the last 28 years , to concede defeat and avoid " embarrassment " .
Mugabe , 84 , faced an unprecedented challenge in Saturday 's elections because of the economic collapse of his once prosperous country .
His government immediately rejected the MDC victory claim as " mischievous " .
Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga told Sky television : " President Mugabe is going nowhere .
We are not going to be pressurised into anything . "
The government has warned that victory claims before an official result would be regarded as a coup d'etat .
Matonga said in a telephone interview with Sky : " No-one is panicking around President Mugabe .
The army is very solidly behind our president , the police force as well . "
He added : " We are not going to be rushed by anybody .
They can make statements left right and centre , but they are merely wasting their time . "

No official results of the presidential poll have been issued four days after the election and Mugabe has not been seen in public since voting , despite speculation he would make a television address on Tuesday night .
Biti's announcement indicated a change in the MDC position in accepting a second round run-off against Mugabe .
Tsvangirai said on Tuesday he had won outright .
Mugabe 's government appears to have been preparing the population for a run-off by revealing its own projections showing a second round would be required in the statutory three weeks after last Saturday 's vote .
Both Tsvangirai and the government have dismissed widespread speculation that the MDC was negotiating with ZANU - PF for a managed exit for Mugabe , who has ruled uninterrupted since independence from Britain in 1980 .
The state - owned Herald newspaper said on Wednesday projections for the presidential election showed Mugabe would fail to win an outright majority for the first time in nearly three decades .
The prospect of a run-off has raised fears both inside and outside Zimbabwe that the hiatus before a new vote would spark serious violence between security forces and militia loyal to Mugabe on one side and MDC supporters on the other .
The Herald also said the government had decided to immediately implement tax relief to cushion the effect of runaway inflation , officially over 100,000 per cent but estimated to be much higher - the world 's highest rate .
The widening of workers ' tax - free threshold tenfold to 300 million Zimbabwean dollars per month - $ 10,000 at the government 's official rate but about $ 7.50 on the black market - is widely seen as an attempt to curry favour with voters and suggests ZANU - PF is preparing for a run-off .
A senior Western diplomat in Harare told Reuters the international community was discussing ideas to try to persuade Mugabe to step down , " but I do n't think there is anything firm on the table . "
The opposition and international observers said Mugabe rigged the last presidential election in 2002 .
But some analysts say the groundswell of discontent over the economy is too great for him to fix the result this time without risking major unrest .
Apart from surreal inflation of more than 100,000 per cent and a virtually worthless currency , Zimbabweans are suffering food and fuel shortages and an HIV / AIDS epidemic that has contributed to a steep drop in life expectancy .
The opposition , including former Finance Minister Simba Makoni , who stood as a third candidate , is expected to unite behind Tsvangirai if there is a run-off .
From an article on jet lag , the story of Sarah Krasnoff ’s fatal jet setting :
One day in 1971 , a woman called Sarah Krasnoff made off with her 14 - year - old grandson , who was caught up in an unseemly custody dispute , and took him into the sky .
In a plane , she knew , they were subject to no laws , and if they never stopped moving , the law could never catch up with them .
They flew from New York to Amsterdam .
When they arrived , they turned around and flew from Amsterdam to New York .
Then they flew from New York to Amsterdam again , and from Amsterdam to New York , again and again and again , month after month .
They took about 160 flights in all , one after the other , according to the stage piece “ Jet Lag . ”
They saw 22 movies an average of seven times each .
They ate lunch again and again and turned their watches six hours forward , then six hours back .
The whole fugitive enterprise ended when Krasnoff , 74 , finally collapsed and died , the victim , doctors could only suppose , of terminal jet lag .

Union Square  the soapbox , front porch and crunchy granola bar of New York City  has been witness to many curious things .
Once , under a hot sun in 2005 , a soft drink maker tried to stand upright a frozen Popsicle the size of an ICBM .
It melted into ooze .
But few things were more curious than what was staged on Friday evening , at the south end of Union Square near East 14th Street .
More than a thousand people , most of them young , gathered for a dance party without audible music , known as a silent rave .
It was striking for what could not be heard .
On the west side of the square , city workers ripped up the street with jackhammers .
On the east side , a stalled caravan of drivers , no doubt frustrated by streets ’ closing for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI , leaned on car horns .
According to a recent , sensational survey from Samsung Mobile , 61 percent of lazy , distracted , and impossibly ignorant cellphone users over the age 18 say they would be comfortable casting their vote for President of the United States via a text message .
Meanwhile , the totally serious and meaningful survey found that eight in ten ( or 80 percent ) of teens under the legal voting age would use their mobile devices to cast a ballot in the election .
Additionally , Samsung Mobile discovered that 90 percent of cellphone users would like an ice cream cone , while another 87 percent would like an ice cream cone only after eating a quarter - pounder with cheese .
Soon Samsung Mobile hopes to determine what percentage , if any , of the people surveyed know who is running for the office of president .
Next Monday , Steve Jobs will take the stage in San Francisco for 2008 's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference .
Almost everyone expects that Jobs will announce the second edition of the iPhone .
And that the announcement will be followed by a barrage of stylish and witty ads .
And that those ads will be followed by an avalanche of snarky spoofs on YouTube .
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , then Apple 's marketing department must be blushing .
The company 's television ad campaigns are the subject of hundreds if not thousands of parodies on the Internet .
Lots of them are -- let 's be honest -- painfully amateurish and not all that funny .
But some really get it .
They take Apple 's minimalist look , its deliberately casual style , and its laidback sincerity , and turn everything on its head .
Sometimes the target is Apple itself , while other times Apple 's competitors are in the crosshairs -- and still other times , the idea is just to have a laugh .
Here are some of the greatest hits from the Apple - mockumercial archives .
Apple ' Switch ' Campaign : Crash Different
In 2002 , Apple launched its " Switch " ad campaign , in which a person against a white backdrop talked about how easy it was to change from a Windows machine to a Mac .
A major part of each ad featured the former Windows user bemoaning their PC 's limits and flaws .
Hunter Crestle did n't buy the ad's premise , because he knew that using a Mac can be just as frustrating .
In his 3.5 - minute spoof , Crestle rants and raves about his Mac , complaining about system lockups , interface confusion , and update hassles .
Interspersed are shots of him drop - kicking an iMac and otherwise violating Apple hardware .

October 12 , 1976 : Nurse Jacqueline Spaky administers a swine - flu injection with an injector gun on the first day of the immunization program in New York City .
Photo courtesy Bettman / Corbis 1976 : President Gerald Ford orders a nationwide vaccination program to prevent a swine - flu epidemic .
Ford was acting on the advice of medical experts , who believed they were dealing with a virus potentially as deadly as the one that caused the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic .
The virus surfaced in February at Fort Dix , New Jersey , where 19 - year - old Pvt. David Lewis told his drill instructor that he felt tired and weak , although not sick enough to skip a training hike .
Lewis was dead with 24 hours .
The autopsy revealed that Lewis had been killed by " swine flu , " an influenza virus originating in pigs .
By then several other soldiers had been hospitalized with symptoms .
Government doctors became alarmed when they discovered that at least 500 soldiers on the base were infected without becoming ill .
It recalled 1918 , when infected soldiers returning from the trenches of World War I triggered a contagion that spread quickly around the world , killing at least 20 million people .
Fearing another plague , the nation 's health officials urged Ford to authorize a mass inoculation program aimed at reaching every man , woman and child .
He did , to the tune of $ 135 million ( $ 500 million in today 's money ) .
Mass vaccinations started in October , but within weeks reports started coming in of people developing Guillain - Barré syndrome , a paralyzing nerve disease , right after taking the shot .
Within two months , 500 people were affected , and more than 30 died .
Amid a rising uproar and growing public reluctance to risk the shot , federal officials abruptly canceled the program Dec. 16 .
In the end , 40 million Americans were inoculated , and there was no epidemic .
A later , more technically advanced examination of the virus revealed that it was nowhere near as deadly as the 1918 influenza virus .
The only recorded fatality from swine flu itself was the unfortunate Pvt. Lewis .
History 's verdict of the program is mixed .
Critics assail Ford , accusing him of grandstanding during an election year – it did him no good , because he lost anyway – while kowtowing to the pharmaceutical companies .
Supporters laud the ability of the nation 's health bureaucracy to mobilize so effectively .
Those who remembered 1918 probably consider it money well spent .

i shall tell a real story how I made my husband a real toilet and how I cuckold him .
I am a nurse working in london suburb .
i am hailing from india , I am in london for the past 7 years .
I have brought my family 3 year back only .

The most peaceful place in the Arab world is ruled by a gay sultan .
At least that 's the word on the street in Oman , where the childless and divorced sultan Qaboos bin Said bin Taimur Al Bu Saidi is a popular and successful ruler .
The 68 year old monarch is the 14th Saidi Sultan of Oman , his family having been in charge continuously since 1749 .
Despite all the talk of the sultan preferring men , he is widely regarded as a very manly fellow .
He overthrew his unpopular father , whom he had been feuding with most of his adult life .
Earlier , the Sultan went to the British military academy , Sandhurst , and served several years as an officer in a British infantry regiment .
Upon taking the throne , he had to face a communist insurrection ( fueled by Yemeni communists just across the border ) and a rebellion in the south ( Dhofar ) .
While the Sultan 's father was a reactionary , and a not very effective ruler , the son was quite the opposite .
The Sultan reformed the government administration ( including the military ) , mended political fences , and used his British Army contacts to get some help from the British SAS ( similar to American Special Forces ) to help deal with the most uncooperative of the rebels .
He hired dozens of British officers and NCOs to improve the training and leadership of the Omani armed forces , and by the mid 1970s , the rebellions were defeated .
Since the Sultan has no children , he has secretly selected a heir , and given the name to a trusted aid , to be revealed when he dies .
That choice may be overruled by a family council , but the Sultan is on good terms with most of his extended family and is keen to keep the dynasty going one way or another .
For the last three decades , the Sultanate has been one of the most peaceful and prosperous Arab states .
With a land area larger than Britain , it has only 3.3 million people .
The place is mostly desert .
The Sultan has encouraged education , free enterprise and the rule of law ( even though he is an absolute monarch ) .
He has organized a 120 member symphony orchestra , one of the finest in the Middle East .
This appalls some of his more religious subjects , because the orchestra has male and female musicians .
There is no terrorism in Oman .
No al Qaeda , no religious violence .
There are some Islamic conservatives , but even they do not dare threaten the popular monarch .
This despite the fact that the Sultan has expressed an interest in working out a peace deal with Israel .
Most other Arab rulers consider the Omani Sultan a bit odd , and do n't consider him an example worth emulating .

9 World 's Longest limousine
The longest limousine in the world is a true testament to making things bigger than everyone else , and if that means utterly destroying the original function then by God , we 'll do it because this is America , son , and your Commie notions of " efficiency " and " not pissing resources down the vast hole of ego " wo n't fly here .
Over 30 meters long with 12 sets of wheels , this abortion of internal combustion has one function only -- to make its owner feel like a real man :

As you can see , it has its work cut out .
There is not a single element of this picture that is not tragically failed overcompensation .
Even the panther looks embarrassed to be near him , and that 's a fucking cat wearing a necklace .
If Limo Bob was spending any more on compensation , he'd be Paul McCartney .
The limo claims to have a helipad and a swimming pool ( complete with diving board ) , but considering that the only person to land a helicopter on a moving car was Howlin ' Mad Murdock ( retired ) and that the car is still only the width of a regularly - stupid limo , what you really have is a square of roof and a bath that someone 's nailed a plank over .
And most cars have roofs already .

The world 's top oil producers are proving unable to put more barrels on thirsty world markets despite sky - high prices , a shift that defies traditional market logic and looks set to continue .

People in England and Wales are becoming more likely to live to 75 People in the South West are more likely to live into their mid 70s than those living elsewhere in England and Wales , official data shows .
The Office for National Statistics compared the current likelihood of living to 75 with the early 1980s .
It found survival chances increased from 47 % to 66 % for men and 66 % to 77 % for women in England and Wales .
Survival was generally higher in the south but there were signs the gap with the north was narrowing .
See breakdown of best and worst from area to area The North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Humber all saw the largest improvements in the probability of surviving to 75 when comparing 1981 - 3 and 2004 - 6 .
However , this could be because areas in the south already had more people surviving to 75 and , therefore , had less scope to improve .
Overall , in the South West men now have a 70 % chance of survival to 75 compared with a 62 % probability in the North East .
For women , it stands at 80 % and 74 % respectively .
People can make healthier choices and government can put health programmes in place
Professor Alan Maryon Davis
Faculty of Public Health
On a local authority level , residents of East Dorset topped the long - life league .
Women had a 86 % chance of survival and men 78 % .
At the other end of the spectrum , men in Manchester had only a 52 % chance , while women in Blaenau Gwent in south Wales had a 67 % chance .
Professor Alan Maryon Davis , president of the Faculty of Public Health , said : " It is the big north - south divide again .
" The reasons are complicated .
It is really a combination of factors , lifestyle , access to health services and the environment , including employment and housing . "
But Professor Maryon Davis said it was wrong to point the finger of blame because everyone had a role to play .
" People can make healthier choices and government can put health programmes in place . "
And Dr Tim Crayford , of the Association of Directors of Public Health , added : " Health inequalities largely come about through differences in people 's family environment , education and personal wealth .
" These affect the values people place on health and life and knowing the importance of making healthy choices .
" For example , smoking is one of the behaviours that has the biggest impact on your health and people from deprived backgrounds are more likely to smoke . "

What are these ?
Shannon Larratt , founder of the body modification online publication BMEzine , pointed us a few days ago to a first - person essay that a person named Yard [ D]og was writing , regarding the adoptive father of Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove ( shown in the image at left ) .
Yard [ D]og claims to have been a close personal friend of the now - deceased elder Rove .
About the essay 's contents , Mr. Larratt said :
" Karl Rove 's father was not only gay , but a part of the early body piercing scene and a regular at 70s piercing parties …
There are pictures of him on BME . "
Here is part of that essay .
BMEzine just published it in entirety with detailed photos said to depict the elder Mr. Rove 's numerous genital piercings .
I have no way of immediately verifying the statements in this essay , or the source of the photos .
I am pursuing that now , have received responses which so far indicate that this material is valid , and I will update soon .
I do know that Mr. Larratt is a friend of the author ( a known participant in the body modification community ) , that he is personally familiar with the story , and is not given to publishing material he believes to be false .
With that disclaimer out of the way , here 's an excerpt :
Louie loved his piercings , they made him smile .
People who are pierced will understand .
So there on the floor in his library , amid teaching videos on piercings and piles of [ Piercing Fans International Quarterly ] , I listened to one man 's account of his travels through the Los Angeles piercing community in the 70's and 80's — the " piercing parties " with folks getting pierced on coffee tables in private homes , nurses that helped , and a guy named Jim .
I knew about Jim .
I had both my nipples pierced at The Gauntlet .
Louie also knew about play piercing ; I wanted to learn and so he taught me .
And so between splashing in the pool , brunches , visiting his volunteer list of AIDS patients , eating at all numbers of restaurants , visiting friends who lived around the area , birding at the Salton Sea and eating TV dinners , we explored needles and the effect they have on you .
During the day I was told the names of piercings …
I hated the words but I wanted to know about each kind .
To this day I 've never gotten a dydoe because Louie told me it was a hard heal .
I never copied Louie 's piercings but I never got them out of my mind .
Some years after I last saw him , I found another friend , a professional piercer name Sque3z who took me on another journey recounted here on BME .
Louie would be proud .
Louie and I exchanged gifts over the years .
He really liked those stainless ball weights and I like gold jewelry … so I have a 14 karat gold cock ring that once belonged to Louie , and he had a bunch of ball weights that belonged to me .
So who cares about one man 's journey into piercing ?
For me it is not about a gossipy story , though some people will take it that way .
It is not about telling secrets or things left best unsaid ; it is about a little piece of history .
Perhaps in telling this story someone else will be able to tell a better one another day .
The " Jim " in this story is the Jim Ward who started the piercing industry .
Louie is Louis Claude Rove whose adopted son's first name is Karl .
Louie died quietly in Palm Springs as his very secular , not - believing son ran President Bush 's campaign for President of the United States that energized the Christian evangelical base around the wedge issue of gay marriage …
As I watched the news this week , I saw a Karl Rove standing beside the President , his voice crocking , talking about his love for Bush and his country but over that " noise , " I heard the memory of Joe Koons whispering in my ear .
" You do know who his son is ? "
… Oh My God !
And now I wondered if that son ever cried for the man who raised him and watched him grow up ?
I 'd be curious as to how Karl Rove would ever explain his pierced , gay father ?
He never told the people in Louis ' phone book that he had died , nor invited them to a service if there was one .
No one even knows where he is buried .
As for me ?
Well , I am the proud owner of Karl Rove 's father 's pure , solid gold cock ring !
I 've put it away with a few memories and pictures of his father .
And in my garden grows a nasty , prickly little cactus from Louie 's backyard … alive and well .

NSFW advisory : Contains links to photographs of pierced genitals said to those of Karl Rove 's father , with a " modesty mosaic " imposed over the thumbnail images at that main link .
FWIW , Wikipedia has this to say about Louis Claude Rove Jr. :
Rove was born the second of three children in Denver , Colorado , and later raised in Sparks , Nevada .
His biological father abandoned the family early on and his mother remarried .
His new adoptive father , Louis Claude Rove Jr. , was a mineral geologist , and his mother , Reba Wood , was a gift shop manager .
His older brother is Eric P. Rove , and his younger sister is Reba A. Rove - Hammond .
His adoptive father is of Norwegian descent .
Reader comment : muckraker says ,
While the details about Louie Rove 's reported piercing hobby are new to me , his sexual identity was also mentioned in a book called The Architect , published in 2006 .
Regarding the essay author 's question about the relationship between Karl and his dad , there 's this part : Karl Rove frequently visited his father in the 1980s .
Joseph Koons said he did n't sense " any great tension " between Karl and his father .
Rove keeps a photograph of his father on his White House desk and has remarked to reporters that his father " lived life exactly the way he wanted to live it . "
The Huffington Post has two posts up about this book : Link 1 , Link 2 , and here 's a CBS News report .

APPEARING in court for the first time since his capture five years ago , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - confessed mastermind of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States , brushed aside a warning from the military judge that he could face the death penalty , saying that he had wanted to “ be a martyr for a long time ” , adding , “ I will , God willing , have this by you . ”
The pre-trial hearing of Mr Mohammed and four others charged with conspiracy and mass murder “ in violation of the laws of war ” , in relation to the 2001 attacks , was the highest - profile test so far of the controversial military commissions .
These were set up by President George Bush to try suspected terrorists , charged with war crimes , being held at the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba .
So far 20 detainees have been indicted , excluding Mohammed al - Qahtani , the alleged “ 20th hijacker ” involved in the September 11th attacks .
But all charges against him were suddenly dropped , without explanation , last month .
Although dozens of pre-trial hearings have been held before the tribunals , no actual trial has yet taken place .
One of those charged , David Hicks , an Australian , pleaded guilty last year before his case went to trial .
The trial of Salim Hamdan , Osama bin Laden 's former driver , had been due to begin on June 2nd , but the presiding military judge , Keith Allred , decided to postpone it until after the Supreme Court announced its eagerly awaited judgment on whether Guantánamo detainees have the right to challenge , before American federal courts , their indefinite detention .
This , Judge Allred said , would permit all parties “ to have the benefit of a decision that may well change the tenor or conduct of the trial , ” as well as avoiding “ potential embarrassment , waste of resources , and prejudice to the accused ” .
The ruling is expected by the end of this month .
For now the focus remains on Mr Mohammed and his four alleged co-conspirators .
The Pakistan - born Kuwaiti's appearance has changed dramatically from the photograph of a fat , dishevelled man in a T - shirt with an unshaven face that was flashed around the world after his capture in Pakistan in 2003 .
Now considerably thinner , he appeared in court wearing thick prison - issue glasses , a long white tunic with matching white turban , and sporting a long grey beard .
Speaking in brisk but broken English , interspersed with occasional Koranic verses , he denounced the court as illegitimate , refused to accept a lawyer and said he would represent himself .
Although the military commissions have improved greatly since they were first set up in 2001 , particularly since the Supreme Court ruling in 2006 deeming the original model to be unconstitutional , they are still severely criticised .
The Pentagon insists that the detainees will get all the normal due- process rights accorded to American defendants — the right to remain silent , to cross -examine witnesses , to be represented by a lawyer , to remain present during the presentation of evidence and so on — as well as having three different levels of appeal all the way to the Supreme Court .
But critics claim that classified evidence will not be heard in open court .
Furthermore , they say that information extracted under harsh interrogation techniques , such as “ water - boarding ” ( simulated drowning ) , will be admissible .
Before being taken to Guantánamo in September 2006 , with 11 other suspects , Mr Mohammed was held for three years in secret CIA prisons abroad where he was subjected to water - boarding as well as other harsh procedures , as the CIA itself has admitted .
He claims that he and the other defendants were tortured .
All face execution if convicted .
Colonel Morris Davis , a former chief prosecutor at Guantánamo , is now one of the fiercest detractors of the military commissions .
Appearing as a defence witness on behalf of Mr Hamdan in April , he claimed that the tribunals were subject to political interference , saying that he had “ significant doubts ” about whether they would deliver “ full , fair and open hearings ” .
As chief prosecutor , he had been told by his military superiors that there could be no acquittals he claimed .
He feared the possibility of “ rigged outcomes ” .

If a small team of Silicon Valley millionaires get their way , in a few years , you could have a new option for global citizenship : A permanent , quasi - sovereign nation floating in international waters .
With a $ 500,000 donation from PayPal founder Peter Thiel , a Google engineer and a former Sun Microsystems programmer have launched The Seasteading Institute , an organization dedicated to creating experimental ocean communities " with diverse social , political , and legal systems . "
" Decades from now , those looking back at the start of the century will understand that Seasteading was an obvious step towards encouraging the development of more efficient , practical public - sector models around the world , " Thiel said in a statement .
It might sound like the setting for the videogame Bioshock , but the institute is n't playing around :
It plans to splash a prototype into the San Francisco Bay within the next two years , the first step toward establishing deep - water city - states , or what it calls " seasteads " – homesteads on the high seas .
Within the pantheon of would - be utopian communities , there 's a particularly rich history of people trying to live outside the nation - state paradigm out in the ocean .
The most ambitious was Marshall Savage 's Aquarius Project , which aimed at nothing less than the colonization of the universe .
There was also Las Vegas millionaire Michael Oliver 's attempt to create a new island country , the Republic of Minerva , by dredging the shallow waters near Tonga .
And the Freedom Ship was to be a mile - long portable country costing about $ 10 billion to construct .
None of these projects has succeeded , a fact that The Seasteading Institute 's founders , Google 's Patri Friedman and the semi-retired Wayne Gramlich , are keenly aware of throughout the 300 - page book they 've written about seasteading .
Instead of starting with a grand scheme worthy of a James Bond villain , the Institute is bringing an entrepreneurial , DIY mentality to creating oceanic city - states .
" There 's a history of a lot of crazy people trying this sort of thing , and the idea is to do it in a way that 's not crazy , " said Joe Lonsdale , the institute 's chairman and a principal at Clarium Capital Management , a multibillion - dollar hedge fund .
The seasteaders want to build their first prototype for a few million dollars , by scaling down and modifying an existing off - shore oil rig design known as a " spar platform . "
This schematic illustrates the ballasting system that Wayne Gramlich imagines would keep the seastead from tipping over .
The amount of water in the ballasts could be raised or lowered to move the seastead up and down .
Holl Liou / Wired.com
In essence , the seastead would consist of a reinforced concrete tube with external ballasts at the bottom that could be filled with air or water to raise or lower the living platform on top .
The spar design helps offshore platforms better withstand the onslaught of powerful ocean waves by minimizing the amount of structure that is exposed to their energy .
" You have very little cross-sectional interaction with waves [ with ] the spar design , " Gramlich said .
The primary living space , about 300 square feet per person , would be inside the tube , but the duo envisions the top platform holding buildings , gardens , solar panels , wind turbines and ( of course ) satellites for internet access .
To some extent , they believe the outfittings for the seastead will be dependent on the business model , say aquaculture or tourism , that will support it and the number of people aboard .
" We 're not trying to pick the one strategy because we think there will be multiple people who want one for multiple reasons , " Gramlich said .
Dan Donovan , a long - time spokesman for Dominion , an energy company that operated Gulf of Mexico - based gas rigs , including Devils Tower , the world 's deepest spar structure , said the group 's plan was n't too far - fetched .
His company 's off - shore rigs , which are much larger than the institute 's planned seasteads , provided long - term housing for its workers .
" They were sort of like mobile homes .
We could move them from one place to another , " Donovan said .
" People did live on them . "
But even the institute members admit that their plans are n't far enough along to stand up to rigorous engineering scrutiny .
Some engineers , Gramlich said , have been skeptical of their plan , particularly their desire to do it on the cheap .
" We have some legitimate doubting Thomases out there , " Gramlich said .
But if the idea turns out to be just crazy enough that it works , Friedman , following in the footsteps of his grandfather , the Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman , envisions transforming the way that government functions .
" My dad and grandfather were happy arguing their ideas and were happy influencing people through the world of ideas , " Friedman said .
" I see a real need for people to go out and do something and show by example . "
True to his libertarian leanings , Friedman looks at the situation in market terms : the institute 's modular spar platforms , he argues , would allow for the creation of far cheaper new countries out on the high - seas , driving innovation .
" Government is an industry with a really high barrier to entry , " he said .
" You basically need to win an election or a revolution to try a new one .
That 's a ridiculous barrier to entry .
And it 's got enormous customer lock - in .
People complain about their cellphone plans that are like two years , but think of the effort that it takes to change your citizenship . "
Friedman estimates that it would cost a few hundred million dollars to build a seastead for a few thousand people .
With costs that low , Friedman can see constellations of cities springing up , giving people a variety of governmental choices .
If misguided policies arose , citizens could simply motor to a new nation .
" You can change your government without having to leave your house , " he said .
Of course , one major role of government is to provide security , which would seem to be an issue on the open sea .
But Friedman 's not worried about defense beyond simple firearms because he thinks pirates will lack the financial incentive to attack the seasteads .
" More sophisticated pirates will take entire container ships that have tens of millions of dollars of cargo and 10 crew [ members ] , " he said .
" On a seastead , there 's a much different crew - to - movable assets ratio . "
In fact , his only worry is that a government will try to come calling and force their jurisdiction upon them .
Toward that end , they are planning to fly a " flag of convenience " from a country that sells them , like Panama , to provide them with protection from national navies .
" If you 're not flying a flag … any country can do whatever they want to you , " he said .
Even if their big idea does n't end up panning out , their story should live on in internet lore for confirming the dream that two guys with a blog and a love of Ayn Rand can land half a million dollars to pursue their dream , no matter how off - kilter or off - grid it might seem .
" Everything changed when we got the funding , " Friedman said .
" Before that , it was two guys with some ideas writing a book and blogging about their ideas ....
Now that we 've got some funding , it 's something I plan to make a full - time job out of . "
Sleep Waking is an unusual art work that combines recorded brainwave activity and REM sleep with robot behaviors .
The Sleep Waking robot plays back your dreams , or , if you will , presents an interpretive dance of your dreams .
The Sleep Waking robot is the result of a collaboration between Fernando Orellana and Brendan Burns .
Orellana spent a night in The Albany Regional Sleep Disorder Center in New York .
The staff wired him up and collected data of every conceivable kind : EEG , EKG , rapid eye movement - you name it .
Orellana describes the use of the data to animate the robot in this way : " The eye position data we simply apply to the position the robot 's heads is looking .
So if my eye was looking left , the robot looks left .
The use of the EEG data is a bit more complex .
Running it through a machine learning algorithm , we identified several patterns from a sample of the data set ( both REM and non -REM events ) .
We then associated preprogrammed robot behaviors to these patterns .
Using the patterns like filters , we process the entire data set , letting the robot act out each behavior as each pattern surfaces in the signal .
Periods of high activity ( REM ) where associated with dynamic behaviors ( flying , scared , etc. ) and low activity with more subtle ones ( gesturing , looking around , etc. ) .
The " behaviors " the robot demonstrates are some of the actions I might do ( along with everyone else ) in a dream . "
Orellana and Burns used a Kondo KHR - 2HV humaniod robot for their project .
Orellana believes that the Sleep Waking robot is a metaphor in which the robot is allowed to augment or act out human experience .
The robot becomes an extension of the person and ( I would add ) an extension of the deeper unconscious level of the person ( see video ) .
In the classic 1956 film Forbidden Planet , Dr. Morbius unconsciously uses Krell machinery when sleeping ; the unthinkably powerful Krell technologies act upon his unconscious cues , and destroy his enemies .
You might want to have some constraints built into the robot that is going to act out your dreams .
Sleep is important ; you might want to try the Metronap Sleep Pod or even Orexin , the sleep surrogate .

A liquid magnet , or ferrofluid , is a colloidal mixture of magnetic particles ( ~10 nm in diameter ) in a liquid carrier .
When no external magnetic field is present , the fluid is not magnetic and the orientation of the magnetite particles is random .
However , when an external magnetic field is applied , the magnetic moments of the particles align with the magnetic field lines .
When the magnetic field is removed , the particles return to random alignment .
These properties can be used to make a liquid that changes its density depending on the strength of the magnetic field and can form fantastic shapes .
The liquid carrier of a ferrofluid contains a surfactant to prevent the particles from sticking together .
Ferrofluids can be suspended in water or in an organic fluid .
A typical ferrofluid is about 5 % magnetic solids , 10 % surfactant , and 85 % carrier , by volume .
One type of ferrofluid you can make uses magnetite for the magnetic particles , oleic acid as the surfactant , and kerosene as the carrier fluid to suspend the particles .
You can find ferrofluids in high - end speakers and in the laser heads of some CD and DVD players .
They are used in low friction seals for rotating shaft motors and computer disk drive seals .
You could open a computer disk drive or a speaker to get to the liquid magnet , but it 's pretty easy ( and fun ) to make your own ferrofluid .
Here 's how :
01 of 05 Safety Considerations Fuse / Getty Images
This procedure uses flammable substances and generates heat and toxic fumes .
Wear safety glasses and skin protection , work in a well - ventilated area , and be familiar with the safety data for your chemicals .
Ferrofluid can stain skin and clothing .
Keep it out of reach of children and pets .
Contact your local poison control center if you suspect ingestion .
There is a risk of iron poisoning ; the carrier is kerosene .
02 of 05 Materials jopstock / Getty Images
Here are the materials you 'll need : Household ammonia
Oleic acid ( found in some pharmacies and craft and health food stores )
PCB etchant ( ferric chloride solution ) , available at electronics stores .
You can make ferric chloride or ferrous chloride solution or you can use magnetite or magnetic hematite powder if you have either of those minerals handy .
( Magnetic hematite is an inexpensive mineral used in jewelry . )
Steel wool
Distilled water
Magnet
Kerosene
Heat source
2 beakers or measuring cups
Plastic syringe or medicine cup ( something to measure 10 ml )
Filter papers or coffee filters
While it is possible to make substitutions for the oleic acid and the kerosene , changes to the chemicals will result in changes to the characteristics of the ferrofluid , to varying extents .
You can try other surfactants and other organic solvents ; however , the surfactant must be soluble in the solvent .
03 of 05 Synthesizing Magnetite Ekaterina Lutokhina / Getty Images
The magnetic particles in this ferrofluid consist of magnetite .
If you are n't starting with magnetite , then the first step is to prepare it .
This is done by reducing the ferric chloride ( FeCl 3 ) in PCB etchant to ferrous chloride ( FeCl 2 ) .
Ferric chloride is then reacted to produce magnetite .
Commercial PCB etchant is usually 1.5 M ferric chloride , to yield 5 grams of magnetite .
If you are using a stock solution of ferric chloride , then follow the procedure using a 1.5 M solution .
Pour 10 ml of PCB etchant and 10 ml of distilled water into a glass cup .
Add a piece of steel wool to the solution .
Mix the liquid until you get a color change .
The solution should become bright green ( green is the FeCl 2 ) .
Filter the liquid through filter paper or a coffee filter .
Keep the liquid ; discard the filter .
Precipitate the magnetite out of the solution .
Add 20 ml of PCB etchant ( FeCl 3 ) to the green solution ( FeCl 2 ) .
If you are using stock solutions of ferric and ferrous chloride , keep in mind FeCl 3 and FeCl 2 react in a 2:1 ratio .
Stir in 150 ml of ammonia .
The magnetite , Fe 3 O 4 , will fall out of solution .
This is the product you want to collect .
04 of 05 Suspending Magnetite in a Carrier Westend61 / Getty Images
The magnetic particles must be coated with a surfactant so that they wo n't stick together when magnetized .
The coated particles will be suspended in a carrier , so the magnetic solution will flow like a liquid .
Since you will be working with ammonia and kerosene , prepare the carrier in a well - ventilated area , outdoors or under a fume hood .
Follow these steps :
Heat the magnetite solution to just below boiling .
Stir in 5 ml oleic acid .
Maintain the heat until the ammonia evaporates ( approximately an hour ) .
Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool .
The oleic acid reacts with ammonia to form ammonium oleate .
Heat allows the oleate ion to enter the solution , while the ammonia escapes as a gas ( which is why you need ventilation ) .
When the oleate ion binds to a magnetite particle , it is reconverted to oleic acid .
Add 100 ml kerosene to the coated magnetite suspension .
Stir the suspension until most of the black color has been transferred into the kerosene .
Magnetite and oleic acid are insoluble in water , while oleic acid is soluble in kerosene .
The coated particles will leave the aqueous solution in favor of the kerosene .
If you make a substitution for the kerosene , the solvent must have the same property : the ability to dissolve the oleic acid but not uncoated magnetite .
Decant and save the kerosene layer .
Discard the water .
The magnetite plus oleic acid plus kerosene is the ferrofluid .
