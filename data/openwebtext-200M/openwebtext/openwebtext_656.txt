The Earth is in the midst of the sixth mass extinction of both plants and animals , with nearly 50 percent of all species disappearing , scientists say .
Because of the current crisis , biologists at UC Santa Barbara are working day and night to determine which species must be saved .
Their international study of grassland ecosystems , with flowering plants , is published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" The current extinction event is due to human activity , paving the planet , creating pollution , many of the things that we are doing today , " said co-author Bradley J. Cardinale , assistant professor of ecology , evolution and marine biology ( EEMB ) at UC Santa Barbara .
" The Earth might well lose half of its species in our lifetime .
We want to know which ones deserve the highest priority for conservation . "
He explained that the last mass extinction near the current level was 65 million years ago , called the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction event , and was probably the result of a meteor hitting the Earth .
It is best known for the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs , but massive amounts of plant species became extinct at that time as well .
According to the current study , the most genetically unique species are the ones that have the greatest importance in an ecosystem .
These are the ones that the scientists recommend be listed as top priority for conservation .
" Given that we are losing species from ecosystems around the world , we need to know which species matter the most –– and which we should pour our resources into protecting , " said first author Marc W. Cadotte , postdoctoral fellow at UCSB 's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ( NCEAS ) .
Cadotte , Cardinale , and co-author Todd Oakley , an EEMB associate professor , put together a " meta- analysis " of approximately 40 important studies of grassland ecosystems around the world .
They reconstructed the evolutionary history among 177 flowering plants used in these studies by comparing the genetic makeup of the plants .
The scientists found that some species are more critical than others in preserving the functions of ecosystems and that these species tend to be those that are genetically unique .
Therefore , they are looking to evolutionary history for guidance in conservation efforts and in understanding the potential impacts of species loss .
Recent studies show that ecological systems with fewer species generally produce less biomass than those with more species .
Less plant biomass means that less carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere and less oxygen is produced .
So , as the biomass of plants plummets around the globe , the composition of gasses in the atmosphere that support life could be profoundly affected .
Additionally , there are fewer plants for herbivorous animals to eat .
Entire food chains can be disrupted , which can impact the production of crops and fisheries .
The loss of species that are not closely related to other species in the ecosystem reduces productivity more than the loss of species with close relatives .
And the more genetically distinct a species is , the more impact it has on the amount of biomass in an ecosystem .
" Losing a very unique species may be worse than losing one with a close relative in the community , " said Oakley .
" The more evolutionary history that is represented in a plant community , the more productive it is . "
Cadotte explained that the buttercup is a very unique species , evolutionarily .
Losing the buttercup , where it occurs in grasslands , would have a much bigger impact on the system than losing a daisy or a sunflower , for example .
The latter species are closely related .
Each could therefore help fill the niche of the other , if one were to be lost .
The daisy and sunflower also have a more similar genetic make - up .
" These 40 studies are showing the same thing for all plants around the world , " said Cardinale .
" It is not a willy - nilly conclusion .
This study is very robust .
It includes studies of plants that are found throughout the U.S. , Europe , and Asia .
We can have a high degree of confidence in the results .
And the results show that genetic diversity predicts whether or not species matter . "

John McCain is heading to near - certain defeat in the elections because American voters no longer trust Republicans on the economy , a Republican strategist warned today .
Steve Lombardo , who has worked on Republican campaigns since 1992 and advised McCain 's opponent , Mitt Romney , in the primaries , said it would take a major external event - such as a terrorist attack - or a crippling error by Barack Obama for McCain to make a comeback .
" Basically unless there is some external event the dynamics of this race are being driven almost entirely by the financial situation here in the United States and globally , and that works for Barack Obama , " Lombardo said .
" If there is n't some sort of event or , God forbid , a terrorist attack that moves the election on to foreign affairs or national security , it is unlikely that McCain can regain the lead just because the American voters have decided that the base of the problems they face are the Republican party , George Bush , and by extension John McCain . "
The bleak assessment of McCain 's prospects from one of his own comes on a day when the economic crisis brought George Bush to an historic new low in his popularity .
Bush 's 25 % approval rating was recorded just after Congress approved a $ 700 bn economic bailout , suggesting the public gave no credit to the White House for its rescue plan .
The rating , a new nadir for an historically unpopular president , puts Bush one point ahead of Richard Nixon on the eve of his departure from the White House in 1974 .
It is just three points higher than the poll 's all - time low for any president , Harry Truman 's 22 % job approval rating in 1952 .
Lombardo laid out his misgivings in a memo obtained by the Guardian in which he wrote that McCain 's attempts to distract voters from the economy and make the election about Obama 's character were unlikely to work .
The memo argues such attacks at this point seem " desperate " and " off- key " , and that the time to define the Democrats ' character was in August - before the presidential debates .
" The economic situation has virtually ended John McCain 's presidential aspirations and no amount of tactical manoeuvring in the final 29 days is likely to change that equation , " the memo said .
It concludes : " There are more turns to come in this election and it is not over yet but it sure seems like it is . "
The memo said McCain lost the election on September 15 - two days after Lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy - when he told a rally in Jacksonville , Florida : " The fundamentals of the economy are strong . "
McCain saw fresh signs today of the damage to his own presidential prospects from the economic crisis in a new set of polls showing him trailing in four battleground states and fighting to hang on to two states - Indiana and North Carolina - formerly seen as Republican strongholds .
McCain suffered another blow when the wife of a retiring Republican senator seen as one of the Republicans ' experts on national security officially endorsed Obama .
" The fact is we 're in two wars , two of the longest we 've ever been in .
We 've run up a third of our nation 's debt in just the past eight years .
We 're in the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression , " said Lilibet Hagel , whose husband , Chuck , is a senator from Nebraska .
With less than four weeks to go until election day , the slide in the polls brought an even more aggressive and personal edge to McCain 's attacks on Obama .
The Obama camp hit back with a new ad released on cable networks today accusing McCain of being " out of ideas " and seeking to distract voters from America 's economic problems .
" With no plan to lift our economy up , John McCain wants to tear Barack Obama down , " the ad said .
The Republican is also giving a larger role to his running mate , Sarah Palin , who is recovering her popularity among the party base following her adequate debate performance last week .
In the latest bad news for McCain , a Time magazine - CNN poll showed the Republican struggling to hold on to states that George Bush carried by large margins in 2004 .
In Indiana , which has voted solidly for Republicans in presidential elections since 1964 , McCain and Obama were tied among registered voters , with 48 % support .
Obama was also widening his lead in battleground states won by George Bush , including Ohio which decided the 2004 elections .
Obama now leads McCain by 50 % to 47 % among likely voters in the Time - CNN poll .
A day after accusing the Democrat of " palling around with terrorists " , the campaign today shifted focus from Obama 's connections to the candidate himself .
Palin meanwhile emerged as the Republican 's lead attack dog .
The vice - presidential candidate was scheduled to address three rallies .
In the first of two appearances in northern Florida , a vote - rich battleground state where the Republicans are struggling to remain in contention , Palin also re-directed her attack from Obama 's association with the 60s era radical Bill Ayers to Obama himself .
" You mean he did n't know that he had launched his own political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist ? "
Palin asked a rally in Jacksonville .
" This election is about the truthfulness and judgment needed in our next president , " she said .
" John McCain has it and Barack Obama does n't . "
Palin was also scheduled to appear in North Carolina tomorrow .
The last Democrat to win North Carolina in a presidential election was Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
But an aggressive push by Obama , who spent time there preparing for the debate , and invested resources in voter registration , has put McCain on the defensive .
Today 's polls showed the two virtually tied in the state , with Obama on 49 % and McCain on 48 % .
She said the filter scheme was " fundamentally flawed " because it failed to tackle the problem at the source and would inadvertently block legitimate resources .
Furthermore there was no evidence to suggest that children were stumbling across child pornography when browsing the web .
Doel - Mackaway believes the millions of dollars earmarked to implement the filters would be far better spent on teaching children how to use the internet safely and on law enforcement .
" Children are exposed to the abusive behaviours of adults often and we need to be preventing the causes of violence against children in the community , rather than blocking it from people 's view , " she said .
" The constant change of cyberspace means that a filter is going to be able to be circumvented and it's going to throw up false positives - many innocent websites , maybe even our own , will be blacklisted because we reference a lot of our work that we do with children in fighting commercial sexual exploitation . "
Doel - Mackaway noted the claims by the internet industry that the filters would be easily bypassed , would not block content found on peer - to - peer networks and chat rooms and would be in danger of being broadened to include legitimate content such as regular pornography , political views , pro-abortion sites and online gambling .
Laboratory test results released in June by the Australian Communications and Media Authority found available filters frequently let through content that should be blocked , incorrectly block harmless content and slow network speeds by up to 87 per cent .
James McDougall , director of the National Children 's and Youth Law Centre , expressed similar views to Save the Children .
He said the mandatory filters simply would not work and children should be able to make decisions for themselves .
Concerned parents could easily install PC - based filters on their computers if they desired , or ask their internet providers to switch on voluntary filtering .
" This is called a child protection measure yet the vast majority of all serious child abuse does not occur on the internet , it occurs in the home , " said McDougall .
" I take issue with the minister 's perspective that children are themselves the danger in a sense that we have to make this decision for them because they are not capable of making it for themselves - I think there 's very little evidence to support that and plenty of evidence to show that children are responsible decision makers given the skills and information . "
Other childrens ' welfare organisations , such as Child Wise and Bravehearts , continue to support the filters , saying the flaws are acceptable as long as they help block some child pornography .
On Thursday , as political activist group GetUp announced its plans for an elaborate anti-filtering campaign , 70 ISP filtering stakeholders converged on the University of NSW to examine the merits of the proposed censorship scheme .
" There seemed to be some consensus that the proposed mandatory filter model would not actually be directed at the real channel of child porn distribution , which is not the blacklist of known web sites , but via various other internet protocols and tools , " said David Vale , executive director of UNSW 's Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre .
" The idea of doing whatever was possible in stopping the problem at the source , including education of parents , kids , teachers and politicians , and serious law enforcement efforts at detection and prosecution of perpetrators and distributors , was seen as probably as , or more , effective than a filter initially aimed at preventing inadvertent browsing of child porn on the web by young people .
" Another aspect was the potential for the filter , once in place , to become the subject of a repeated bidding war , depending on which minor politicians had balance of power in parliament , or who had the ' moral panic of the day ' . "
Senator Conroy 's spokesman , Tim Marshall , has consistently failed to respond to requests for comment on the issue .
Scientists in Switzerland are reporting that bacteria in the human mouth play a role in creating the distinctive flavors of certain foods .
They found that these bacteria actually produce food odors from odorless components of food , allowing people to fully savor fruits and vegetables .
Their study is scheduled for the November 12 edition of the ACS bi-weekly Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
In the study , Christian Starkenmann and colleagues point out that some fruits and vegetables release characteristic odors only after being swallowed .
While scientists have previously reported that volatile compounds produced from precursors found in these foods are responsible for this ' retroaromatic ' effect , the details of this transformation were not understood .
To fill that knowledge gap , the scientists performed sensory tests on 30 trained panelists to evaluate the odor intensity of volatile compounds – known as thiols – that are released from odorless sulfur compounds found naturally in grapes , onions , and bell peppers .
When given samples of the odorless compounds , it took participants 20 to 30 seconds to perceive the aroma of the thiols – and this perception persisted for three minutes .
The researchers also determined that the odorless compounds are transformed into the thiols by anaerobic bacteria residing in the mouth – causing the characteristic ' retroaromatic ' effect .
" The mouth acts as a reactor , adding another dimension to odor perceptions , " they explain .
However , the authors conclude , it is saliva 's ability to trap these free thiols that helps modulate the long - lasting flavors .

Our man in Japan , Ben Torode , has exclusively translated a recent interview feature with the team behind the PS3 and PSP firmware updates , just for us .
If you ’d like to read more about the PS3 browser , the simultaneous PS3 / PSP updates and various techy features on upscaling , read on .
SCE ( Umemura ) , on the reason for implementing simultaneous updates for PS3 and PSP :
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
With respect to the PSP , enabling direct access to the PS Store was the biggest change .
But doing so required support on the PS Store server - side .
While there were changes on the PS3 side as well with PlayStation Network account management and other functions were moved over to the XMB , since the same servers are used for the PSP , we wanted the changes to the PSP to coincide with those on the PS3 side ( in the interests of maintaining compatibility ) .
SCE ( Noda ) , on DRM for downloadable contents :
“ Device Authentication ” is carried out when transferring content .
While this was implemented in the past when transferring from the PS3 or PC , in the case of direct access ( to the store ) from the PSP , this authentication is carried out on a per unit basis when downloading .
This device authentication is something that authenticates the PSP unit .
Therefore , even a memory stick holding this data is inserted into another unauthenticated PSP , it wo n’t run .
SCE ( Takase ) On PS3 Browser :
Even using our own benchmarks , the Java Script execution speed is 2.8 times faster than the previous version , and is of a comparable level to viewing on PCs … while it loses out to browsers such as Google Chrome that have made recent advances , we believe it is faster than regular browsers such as IE7 .
The PS3 ’s memory has always posed problems .
However , since we have supported “ virtual memory ” using the hard disk from Version 2.0 onwards , this has been eased to some extent .
Even so , since accessing data from the HDD reduces speed , the fact that there is a struggle with memory has n’t changed .
Playback of H.264 content from within Flash is handled through an independent process on an SPU .
Processing different aspects of the web browser independently has the characteristic of making it easier to improve frame rates .
While I ’d stop short of saying we will eliminate all dropped frames in the future , this can be considered a strength unique to the PS3 .
SCE ( Takase ) on Chroma Up - sampling :
Even up to now we have been doing 4:2:0 - to - 4:2:2 up - sampling .
But we introduced features to produce an even higher quality output this time .
While this will of course have some effect on HD picture quality , since HD by nature is higher quality , it will not be that noticeable .
For SD , however , you will clearly see the effects of the improved picture quality .
Q : Specifically what kind of algorithm processing is being carried out ?
A ( Takase ) :
When converting from 4:2:0 to 4:2:2 , we carry out a kind of chroma upsampling processing that adjusts to movement in the footage .
A special method unique to the PS3 is used to process the video .
However , please allow me to keep the technical specifics of this undisclosed .
Q : Why ca n’t Blu - Ray discs recorded with the BDMV format use the chroma upsampling function ?
A ( Takase ) :
If this is requested by customers we will consider supporting it , but as always , we do not intend to implement features as console functions if users cannot experience any benefits from those features .
SCE ( Matsui ) on future firmware updates :
In future updates , there are thoughts of raising the level of interaction , in the sense of “ interactive entertainment ” .
Among those ideas are enabling the PSP to cope with more processing while using computational resources on the PS3 side for areas where the PSP lacks resources , so we think that interaction between the two systems will be possible by having them successfully complement each other .
In addition , as with Life with PlayStation , we take the approach of making the PS3 something people will use from when they wake up , like switching it on to watch the news in the morning .
Since we believe that there must still be many areas in with both the PS3 and PSP can be of use in people ’s daily lives , we want to continue to make firmware updates with this perspective in mind .
SCE ( Umemura ) on the lack of ad - hoc WIFI support on the 20 GB PS3 :
At present , an add - in such as a USB WIFI adapter is difficult .
So for the 20 GB model , there is unfortunately no solution .

WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - A New Zealand rape victim drove her rapist to a police station when he fell asleep in his car after assaulting the woman , local media reported on Wednesday .
Vipul Sharma , 22 , was found guilty of abduction and two charges of rape by the Auckland District Court Tuesday , court officials told Reuters Wednesday .
The New Zealand newspaper said Sharma met the woman at an Auckland bar in 2006 and later drove her first to a park where he raped her in the back seat of his car .
After the attack Sharma allowed the woman to drive and fell asleep in the passenger seat , so the woman drove him to Auckland Central police station where he was arrested , said the newspaper .
“ She showed a lot of bravery and common sense .
I have nothing but respect for what she has endured , ” police detective Simon Welsh told the newspaper .
Glennn Beck , ( KTTH m- f , 6 - 9a ) in a Wendy 's for a Frosty ™ last Saturday night , was accosted as he stood in line by a truck driver with " food in his hair " who called him a " racist bigot . "
" It happened to me at Wendy 's Saturday night .
We are on the bus and we stop to get fuel and I said , I 'm going to go in , I 'm treating .
Everybody wants a Frosty™ .
I 'm going to go get Frosties™ .
And one of the security guys , said , No , you 're not .
I said , Yeah , I am .
I mean , it 's a truck stop .
How much trouble am I going to get in in a truck stop ?
Everybody here you can trust .
You 're not going in .
I went in , but I had to bring the swat team with me and so I 'm just , I just want to Frosty ™ please , the guy standing next to me , who , by the way , I may point out .
Had food in his hair , is a truck driver and he turned around .
He looked at me and the recognition was immediate and he said , You racist bigot !
And I just said -- I wanted to say , I think you have me mistaken for someone else , but I knew he knew who I was and he just hated me for who I was .
You conservatives that have destroyed this country !
And the hatred was so deep , it was breath taking .
Luckily the swat team was there and I just separated myself from him and he just shouted through other people and there were children in the restaurant and he blamed me for everything , I believe including the Holocaust , and the hatred was palpable .
The guy screamed at the restaurant , you better not let me see you in the parking lot because I 've got a truck and I 'll run your ass over !
Wow .
Is this who we 've become ?
Is this who we 've become ?
Who WE'VE become , Glennn ???
Spare us puh-leaze , you glib fake .
You 've grabbed every headline you could by trying to ignite the racial and ethnic slime of the male knuckle - dragging wing of the wingnut base -- you can't get all self - righteous on us now now ...
Slime is hard to light , but here are some of his more notorious attempts :
~~ Beck once speculated that Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's wife was under the influence of " some sort of ... date rape drug , " one that is " not powerful enough to actually knock you out , but it 's powerful enough to , like , make you think that you 're not standing next to Dennis Kucinich and making out with him . "
Maybe , he said , the right drug could be " cyanide , " adding : " That would be the only thing that would really dull the senses enough .
Even then , your dead body would be like , ' Dennis Kucinich has his tongue in my mouth . ' "
~~ " Hey , you know what ?
There are good Muslims and bad Muslims .
We need to be the first ones in the recruitment office lining up to shoot the bad Muslims in the head "
~~ He 's called President Jimmy Carter a " waste of skin , " Cindy Sheehan a " prostitute . "
~~ " When I see a 9/11 victim family on television , or whatever , I 'm just like , ' Oh shut up '
I 'm so sick of them because they 're always complaining . "
~~ “ The only [ Katrina victims ] we ’re seeing on television are the scumbags . ”
~~
He commented on a mock ad produced by subscribers to his website depicting a giant refinery that produces " Mexinol , " a fuel made from the bodies of illegal Mexican immigrants .
Beck read from the ad : " At Evil Conservative Industries , we know four things for certain .
The country needs cheap , alternative fuel source .
Two : the human body is 18 percent carbon .
Three : carbons can be turned into hydrocarbons .
Four : we have a buttload of illegal aliens in our country .
~~ " I 'm thinking about killing Michael Moore , and I 'm wondering if I could kill him myself , or if I would need to hire somebody to do it . "
~~ To Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , the first Muslim congressman , Beck said , “ I have been nervous about this interview with you because what I feel like saying is , ' Sir , prove to me that you are not working with our enemies . ’ ”
~~ He 's advocated nuking Venezuela and the Middle East .
Beck is ending his show on CNN Headline News after being hired by Fox News to host the 5p hour , beginning next spring .
Beck signed a multi - year agreement to host a weekday programs well as a weekend show .
Although we defend his right - blah - bitty blah - blah - to say it , but we love that Joe the Truck Driver pitched the hateful little hemorrhoid some feces on a November night , and might possibly intruded on his Frosty™ moment .
Even though many people understand the importance of self confidence and self esteem , unfortunately many of us do not realize that our confidence is low and that we need to find ways for building our confidence and self esteem .
Even those who understand it , they do not know how to improve it !
In today ’s world with such increased obligations to our personal and professional live , the security that confidence and self esteem gives us is more than essential .
If you have confidence you will win the respect of other people around you .
Confidence and self esteem is not something that can be hidden when it exists .
A pre-requisite in building confidence and self esteem is to first understand what causes the reduction of self esteem and what signs in our behaviour indicate that we have a low self - esteem problem .
Low self - esteem , more often stems from the way we see ourselves and not by the way others treat us .
Experiences from childhood or teenage may have affected and may have distorted the image we have for ourselves .
Also other frequent causes of low self - esteem is the abuse of all kinds ( physical , verbal , psychological ) the sharp criticism we may have received as children by our parents .
Some experiences that made us feel shy or even humiliated during childhood or as adults and finally the requirement set by ourselves or our parents to be « perfect » .
People with low self - esteem often receive ( or continue to receive ) the following messages from their environment : that they are unsuccessful , that they have low intellectual level , that they are not capable .
Some of these reasons and in the worst cases a combination of them , results in a sense of low self - esteem .
We need to emphasize here that our experiences from childhood alone are enough to reduce our confidence because during childhood we create some entrenched views about ourselves that are difficult to change later in life as adults .
How we can understand that we have a low self esteem ?
If we feel without any particular reason that we are ugly , unsuccessful or unwanted and if we continue to feel like that even when we take exactly the opposite messages from our environment , then unfortunately we are captive to the vicious circle that we lack confidence and self esteem .
People with low self - esteem are usually hypersensitive , sheepishly , feeling rejected by others , find it difficult to take decisions , they are offensive , they always shout to get attention and they need continuous confirmation for their value from others .
People with low self - esteem usually choose to shut themselves and be isolated from others and often become aggressive in order to do that .
Many times they talk about themselves and they try to persuade others of their value .
The coverage of their insecurity is based on the excessive visibility .
In some other cases people with low self - esteem are too modest to the point that reduce themselves and their achievements because they believe they are not as important as other people tell them .
Another characteristic of people with low self - esteem is that they try to copy and imitate others who believe they are successful .
If there is confidence and self esteem there is no need to imitate the personality of another individual .
Unfortunately , this action instead of strengthening the confidence of the people it mocks them down even more because anyone can distinguish the difference of authentic from the copy !
Thus , their confidence is reduced even more .
Building confidence and self esteem
Accept your self as it is
Our first step towards self - improvement is to accept our self , with its advantages and its defects , just as it is .
Nobody is perfect and we all have points in our personality or appearance that could be improved .
But this self - improvement analysis should not take us under .
Instead , it should give us the courage and desire to fight and to become better .
The defect is a human characteristic .
We should love our faults because it is an integral part of our unique identity and personality .
Change the way you “ see ” yourself
Self esteem and self - confidence is reduced because we tend to attach too much importance to all our negative points while turning a blind eye to our positive points .
We must change the way we see ourselves !
It is always good to know our self but this knowledge should not lead us only to the discovery of what we do well or on all those things we have to change .
Self - knowledge is the possibility of us to recognize our talents , our successes and our abilities .
We all have special talents that only if we accept and recognize them we will be able to raise them to the surface .
Start small – plan big
In order for us to increase our confidence and self esteem , we must have some victories in our hand !
We first need to set small goals , which we can achieve .
Slowly – slowly we can build our confidence and we will start to believe that we are capable to achieve even more difficult goals !
Always think positive
Positive thinking !
We should stop thinking the worst for our abilities and ourselves .
When the inner voice of pessimism and insecurity begins to shout in us , we should make it stop !
Yes , we can achieve things !
Yes , we are capable and deserving !
Yes , we are attractive and cannot deal with everything !
To make others believe in us , you must first believe in ourselves .
Do not always blame yourself
We should not blame ourselves for everything .
We ought to realize that we should not get all the blame for things that happen in our lives .
In other words , if someone rejects us this does not mean that we fail in love .
It could be simply because our chemistry does not fit with the other person .
If we were rejected for a particular job , this does not mean that we do not have the background and abilities to work .
We were simply not the right person for this job and this does not mean that we are not the appropriate person for another !
Nobody is perfect
We must get rid of our perfectionism and accept that all people , rightly or wrongly , have flaws and weaknesses .
That is the beauty of all of us .
We should have an objective view of ourselves and we should be fighting with all our strengths to achieve our goals .
We must dare to take risks because success requires some risk .
We can take the risks only when we have faith in our selves and only when we learn to appreciate our abilities .
If we manage to win low self - esteem and build confidence , then we have managed to get rid of all the burdens that keep us away from our dreams , wishes and our needs .
If we win ourselves , we will be free to create , to dare to take risks to succeed and to claim all that we want for ourselves .

Few are predicting that this new relationship born of mutual respect and self - interest will grow into a tight bond between the new president and the woman who will be the public face of his foreign policy , though some say it is not impossible .
They argue that a close friendship between the two powerful officials is useful but not essential , and is not a predictor of the success of the nation ’s chief diplomat .
While James A. Baker III was extraordinarily close to the first President George Bush and is widely considered one of the most successful recent secretaries of state , Dean Acheson was not a friend of Harry S. Truman and Henry A. Kissinger did not particularly like Richard M. Nixon .
“ Two of the nation ’s greatest secretaries of state in the modern period , Dean Acheson and Henry Kissinger , were not personally close but were intellectually bonded to their presidents , ” said Walter Isaacson , the author of a biography of Mr. Kissinger and the co-author , with Evan Thomas , of “ The Wise Men , ” a book about America ’s postwar foreign policy establishment .
“ I think that Obama and Clinton could form a perfect partnership based on respect for each other ’s view of the world . ”
Colin L. Powell , who was President Bush ’s first - term celebrity secretary of state , would appear to be a cautionary tale for Mrs. Clinton since his relationship with the president was strained , and he left office an unhappy man .
But Mr. Bush ’s second - term secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , is generally not viewed as having the success her unusually tight bond with the president might have engendered .
An organization calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for attacks in Mumbai India that have killed at least 80 people and wounded over 250 .
The group sent an email to news organizations claiming responsibility .
Here ’s part of the email they sent out :
You should know that your acts are not at all left unnoticed ; rather we are closely keeping an eye on you and just waiting for the right time to execute your bloodshed .
We are aware of your recent raids at Ansarnagar , Mograpada in Andheri and the harassment and trouble you created there for the Muslims
You threatened to murder them and your mischief went to such an extent that you even dared to abuse and insult Maulana Mahmood - ul - Hasan Qasmi and even misbehaved with the Muslim women and children there .
“ If this is the degree your arrogance has reached , and if you think that by these stunts you can scare us , then let the Indian Mujahideen warn all the people of Mumbai that whatever deadly attacks Mumbaikars will face in future , their responsibility would lie with the Mumbai ATS and their guardians – Vilasrao Deshmukh and R R Patil .
You are already on our hit - list and this time very very seriously .
The Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility for bombings in Jaipur in May .
More when we have it .
Update : unconfirmed reports suggest that the Deccan Mujahideen is related to Lashkar - e - Taiba and the Harkat ul Jihad al Islami , with possible support from Pakistan ’s Inter - Service Intelligence .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
What does the likely choice of New York Federal Reserve chief Timothy Geithner as his Treasury Secretary say about our President - elect ?
Simple :
He believes in change , just not too much of it .
Geithner 's selection emphasizes continuity and experience , the benefits you 'd get from keeping Hank Paulson in the job , but is more appealing because the 47 - year - old central banker gives the appearance of a fresh face arriving in Washington .
Yet he is a Washington veteran whose fingerprints are all over the federal government 's attempts to rescue ailing financial markets .
The harsh economic lesson facing President - elect Obama is that markets do n't like change .
Since his Nov. 4 victory , the Dow Jones average has gyrated wildly , ending 2,073 points lower as of Thursday , Nov. 21 .
Of course , the Dow 's stomach - churning fall below the 8,000 mark this past week can be attributed to frightening economic realities ranging from the stubborn persistence of a global credit crunch to the shaky conditions of name - brand financial firms and automakers .
But uncertainty about the incoming administration also played a role .
That much became clear Friday , when the Dow surged nearly 500 points , ending at 8,046 , after news of the Geithner choice emerged .
Obama is reportedly planning to unveil his entire economic team next week , as early as Monday , in order to further calm markets .
Meanwhile , the President - elect is already taking ownership of the troubled economy he will inherit .
In his weekly radio address , Obama acknowledged that the economy is " likely to get worse before it gets better . "
" We now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further , " President - elect Obama said .
Noting that " we 've lost 1.2 million jobs this year " and could lose millions more before the crisis is over , Obama said he has directed his economic team to design a massive federal jobs plan , employing 2.5 million Americans by 2011 to rebuild roads , bridges and schools and to construct alternative - energy projects including wind farms and solar - power installations .
Among the candidates Obama considered for Treasury Secretary , Geithner was the least well known to him .
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , who is now expected to be tapped for a top White House job , was part of Obama 's inner circle of economic advisers during the general election campaign .
But Geithner and his likely new boss have much in common , starting with age :
They were born just 14 days apart .
Both men have lived overseas : Obama as a young boy in Indonesia ; Geithner as the son of a U.S. AID official who spent part of his childhood in India and Thailand .
And Geithner , despite his even temperament and serious demeanor , has a wicked sense of humor that would appeal to the President - elect .
Geithner , moreover , brings the kind of nonpartisan , pragmatic - minded approach to the job that Obama has insisted he values on his economic team .
Geithner , who has a master 's in international economics from Johns Hopkins ' School of Advanced International Studies , does not have a doctorate in economics or experience as a private sector banker .
But he is a quick study and notably circumspect about how one part of the economy affects another .
During his career he has sought counsel from a range of experts that cross the political divide , from Republicans like Henry Kissinger ( his first boss ) , Alan Greenspan and John Thain to Democrats like Robert Rubin and Summers , his successive bosses as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs during the Clinton administration .
In his radio address , President - elect Obama said that Jan. 21 , his first day in office , would bring a " new direction , new ideas and new reforms " -- and certainly an FDR - style federal jobs program would mark a big change from Bush administration 's approach to the economic crisis .
But it 's not clear Obama will bring much change to the Treasury 's $ 700 billion rescue effort that has members of Congress growing increasingly impatient .
It was Geithner who engineered J.P. Morgan 's buyout of troubled Bear Stearns with a $ 29 billion loan from his New York Federal Reserve bank -- the first of the government 's serial interventions in the markets -- and he has remained a key figure in efforts that followed .
Wall Street may applaud the Geithner appointment but there are members of Congress who will make his nomination hearing a grueling experience , largely out of frustration that the Treasury Department 's ever - changing rescue attempts still have n't unplugged the credit crunch .
But this is nothing Geithner has n't faced before .
Last spring , it was Geithner who took on the heavy lifting during a Senate Banking Committee interrogation that also featured Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox .
Geithner repeated , over and over and with much detail , his case that the Bear Stearns deal was made with taxpayer interests in mind , and with the intention of avoiding the " moral hazard " of a bailout that would reward dangerous risk - taking .
And , in a moment that showed that this longtime Washington hand , who was on the frontlines of dealing with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 - 98 , is not easily intimidated by his inquisitors , Geithner insisted , " Can I just go through a few important things , for the record ? "
After a relatively crappy day , I got off the subway , and there ’s a couple of buskers playing a fiddle and a banjo at the station .
And they ’re really going at it , playing the hell out of those things , and I can’t figure out why ’til I get up close .
The answer turns out to be that a couple of local b- boys have decided that it ’s time to throw down , to the tune of these guys playing some good old - time country fiddlin ’ and pickin’ .
And man , did that cheer me up .
So I did what any sane person would do in that situation , and recorded a video .
I feel bad that I broke one of the lesser rules I ’m going to be pushing at my presentation later this month , but I ’m glad I saved the moment for posterity , and for you .
UNITED NATIONS , Nov 12 : United Nations General Assembly President Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann said on Tuesday that the world body should ban defamation of all religions and disagreed that such a move would impinge upon freedom of speech .
“ Yes , I believe that defamation of religion should be banned , ” he said in response to a question at a press conference to highlight the interfaith conference at the UN headquarters .
No one should try to defame Islam or any other religion , he said , adding : “ We should respect all religions . ”
Mr D’Escoto , a former Nicaraguan foreign minister who himself is a priest , said that religion was a very divisive subject and that ’s why the meeting would concentrate on common ethical values to make a common front against hunger , ignorance and disease .
“ People talk about bailing out the Wall Street when , in fact , humanity needs to be bailed out , ” he added .
He rejected a correspondent ’s suggestion that the meeting was aimed at forging an Arab - Israeli front against the growing influence of Iran and said : “ What we are only trying to do is to forge a front against ignorance , hunger and disease . ”
Asked to comment on reports that US military forces had used secret authority to conduct previously undisclosed attacks on Al Qaeda in Pakistan , Syria and elsewhere since 2004 , he said such strikes were violation of the UN Charter .
Nations must respect others ’ sovereignty and territorial integrity , Mr D’Escoto said , adding that such acts even amounted to be acts of aggression .
Firefox only ( Windows / Mac / Linux ) : The Firefox Universal Uploader extension ( aka fireuploader ) uploads and downloads files to and from popular web sites through a simple dual - pane interface .
In essence , the Universal Uploader acts very much like previously mentioned FireFTP — the extension that turns Firefox into an FTP client — but it uploads directly to popular web sites like Flickr , Facebook , Google Docs , Picasa , Box.net , and YouTube .
So rather than require you to log in to those sites to upload photos , videos , documents , or other files , you can fire up this extension and simply drag and drop files to the webapp you want to upload to .
The extension is a little rough around the edges , but it 's a great idea and works as advertised .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With auto sales at the weakest pace in 25 years and a government bailout far from certain , job losses in the struggling industry could potentially get much worse .
If the Big Three carmakers were to cut U.S. operations by 50 % , 2.5 million jobs could be lost in 2009 , according to a study released Wednesday .
The Center for Automotive Research reported that the total employment impact includes nearly 250,000 jobs lost at the automakers and nearly 800,000 at suppliers .
In addition , the organization estimates another 1.4 million job losses outside the industry , such as those caused when stores go out of business in communities hit by plant closings .
In economic terms , cutting operations in half would reduce personal income by more than $ 125.1 billion in the first year , and $ 275.7 billion over three years , the center said .
Such a decline in personal income would cost the government tax dollars -- $ 49.9 billion in 2009 and more than $ 108.1 billion over three years .
Automakers GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler employ hundreds of thousands of well - paid workers and support far more retirees and their families with health care and other benefits .
In addition , dozens of suppliers and thousands of dealerships depend on the Big Three .
" The likelihood of one or two of the Detroit Three manufacturers ending operations is very real , " David Cole , chairman of the center , said in a statement .
But a larger fear is a complete shutdown .
A 100 % reduction in Big Three operations would cost about 3 million jobs in the first year alone .
" A complete shutdown of Detroit Three U.S. production would have a major impact on the U.S. economy in terms of lost wages , reductions in social security receipts , personal income taxes paid , and an increase in transfer payments , " Sean McAlinden , the center 's chief economist , said in a statement .
" The government stands to lose on the level of $ 60 billion in the first year alone , and the three year total is well over $ 156 billion . "
Year to date , the auto industry has announced 110,610 job cuts , more than double than the same period in the year before , and the highest of any industry with the exception of finance , according to a report released Wednesday by global outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
More than 15,000 layoffs were announced in the automotive industry in October alone , the report said .

If it 's flat and has a big - screen , it 's high - def , right ?
Apparently , a lot of HDTV buyers think so .
A recent survey by the Leichtman Research Group ( LRG ) shows that 18 percent of HDTV owners think they 're watching high - definition shows , when in fact they 're viewing standard definition programming .
The findings are based on a telephone survey of 1302 U.S. households .
This is LRG 's sixth annual study on the topic .
Given the general consumer confusion surrounding HDTV - all those mind - numbing specs like 1080 p and HDMI are n't easy to grasp - it 's no surprise that many buyers are still clueless .
Standard content that 's stretched to fill the entire screen may look funny , but at least the picture 's big .
Problem is , buyers may start to wonder why they abandoned their tube TV for a pricey set with a worse picture .
The halfhearted roll - out of HD service by cable providers is n't helping either .
Optional high - definition service often includes only a dozen or so highly compressed HD channels , which look pretty crappy and do n't do justice to HD 's potential .
Retailers could do more to help too .
Just 42 percent of HDTV owners say they were told to get high - def programming when they bought their sets .
And Blu-ray sales have been disappointing thus far , so most buyers are n't seeing HD in its full , 1080 p glory .
When you can count Johnny Depp 's nose hairs in Pirates of the Caribbean , there 's no turning back .
Despite the confusion , HD adoption is booming .
A third of HDTV owners have more than one high - def set , and 25 percent plan to buy another one in the next year .
Also , a third of U.S. households have at least one HDTV , roughly double the percentage that had an HD set two years ago , the survey says .
This story , " HD or Standard Def ? One in Five HDTV Owners Don't Know the Difference " was originally published by PCWorld .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Stem cells from tiny embryos can be used to restore lost hearing and vision in animals , researchers said Tuesday in what they believe is a first step toward helping people .
A cell cluster cultured from embryonic stem cells is seen in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / National Science Foundation / Handout
One team repaired hearing in guinea pigs using human bone marrow stem cells , while another grew functioning eyes in tadpoles using frog cells .
While there are no immediate uses for humans , they said their findings help describe some of the most basic biological processes underlying the development of hearing and sight , and may help in the development of the new field of regenerative medicine .
“ These discoveries illustrate stem cell research ’s continuing extraordinary potential to treat a wide range of deadly and disabling diseases that affect millions , ” said Anand Swaroop , a stem cell researcher at the National Eye Institute , one of the National Institutes of Health .
Dr. Sujeong Jang of Chonnam National University in Gwang - ju , South Korea , and colleagues used mesenchymal stem cells from human bone marrow to restore hearing in guinea pigs whose hearing had been destroyed using chemicals .
They grew the stem cells into neuron - like cells in lab dishes and then transplanted them into the inner ears of the guinea pigs .
Three months later , the animals appeared to have some hearing , Jang told a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience .
Jang said the goal was to regrow the tiny hair cells that are essential for mammals to hear , although she is not sure yet how the stem cells made this happen .
They would eventually like to try something similar in humans , Jang told a news conference .
“ When sensitive hair cells in the inner ear of humans and other mammals are killed -- by loud noise , autoimmune attack , toxic drugs , or aging -- the damage is permanent , ” Jang said in a statement .
“ Birds and reptiles are luckier .
Their damaged hair cells apparently regenerate and can restore normal hearing . ”
Michael Zuber and colleagues at the SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse , New York , grew functioning eyes in blinded frog embryos using stem cells .
Usually , frog stem cells just form skin when grown in a dish .
Zuber ’s team added seven different genetic “ factors ” that turned on eye formation genes .
When they transplanted the transformed cells into frog embryos , the resulting tadpoles could see out of those eyes , Zuber told the meeting .
They tested the tadpoles by putting white tissue paper over their tank , Zuber said in an interview .
Normal tadpoles will stay in the lighter side of the tank , covered by the white paper .
He showed video of blind tadpoles swimming randomly around the tank while the tadpoles with the transplanted cells stayed on the light side .
Genetic tests showed that the stem cells had transformed , a process called differentiation , into many different cell types .
“ All the cells that make an eye are in there , ” Zuber said .
He does not see any immediate uses for people but noted that regrowing many different cell types is the goal of regenerative medicine .
“ The retina , like all body organs , contains multiple , distinct cell types .
Therefore , successful recovery from blindness due to injury or disease will require the functional replacement of multiple retinal cell types , ” he said .
CAMBRIDGE , England ( CNN ) -- Professor Stephen Hawking , one of the world 's great scientists , is looking to the stars to save the human race -- but pessimism is overriding his natural optimism .
Stephen Hawking , here delivering a lecture in May , spoke recently to CNN about his vision of the future .
Hawking , in an exclusive CNN interview , said that if humans can survive the next 200 years and learn to live in space , then our future will be bright .
" I believe that the long - term future of the human race must be in space , " said Hawking , who is almost completely paralyzed by the illness ALS .
" It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in the next 100 years , let alone next thousand , or million .
The human race should n't have all its eggs in one basket , or on one planet .
Let 's hope we can avoid dropping the basket until we have spread the load . "
Hawking is one of the few scientists known to a wide audience outside academia thanks to his best - selling books , a guest spot on " The Simpsons " and an ability to clearly explain the complexities of theoretical physics .
He has 12 honorary degrees , was awarded the CBE in 1982 and since 1979 has been at Cambridge University 's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics , where he is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics -- a post once held by Isaac Newton .
Speaking at Cambridge 's Centre for Mathematical Studies , he said : " I see great dangers for the human race .
There have been a number of times in the past when its survival has been a question of touch and go .
The Cuban missile crisis in 1963 was one of these .
Watch the interview in full »
" The frequency of such occasions is likely to increase in the future .
We shall need great care and judgment to negotiate them all successfully .
" But I 'm an optimist .
If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries , our species should be safe , as we spread into space . "
Twenty years ago , Hawking wrote " A Brief History of Time . "
Now he is looking forward to a space flight of his own next year .
He said : " I do n't think the human race has a moral obligation to learn about space , but it would be foolish and short sighted not to do so .
It may hold the key to our survival . "

Carrot Musicians
People who make music out of carrots
The World Carrot Museum has discovered several groups of people who make , and then play , musical instruments from Carrots ( and other vegetables and fruit ) .
Select one of the links to read more about each individual group .
Make your own here .
Or here video here .
Carrot whistle here ( youtube )
Here are the major players in this genre :
Here are some of the instruments that can be made out of vegetables : A carrot and a bell pepper makes a horn .
A pumpkin can become a drum with tiny eggplant , squash or carrot drumsticks .
Carrots of various sizes with holes drilled into them can make panpipes , flutes , recorders and clarinet - like instruments .
Leaks can be transformed into a violin .
Celery can be used to transformed into a guitar thanks to its fibrous composition .
The combinations of vegetables to make instrumental sounds are endless , according to the Vienna Vegetable Orchestra .
The group has been told that this use of food is wasteful , to which they have responded saying that their instruments , in addition to being biodegradable , actually cost less than most traditional instruments .
They also turn some of the instruments into vegetable soup , which is served to the audience , after a performance .

Flutenveg
What is Flutenveg ??
It 's Kerry Fletcher and Alain Thirion from Perth in Western Australia who make mu sical instruments out of carrots and other vegetables .
Carrot Museum editor 's note : Flutenveg is now defunct as the musicians have gone their separate ways .
You had better believe it , you can even see and hear them playing on their web site at Flutenveg com - carrot musicians .
Kerry and Alain have just come back from a Festival South of Perth in a town called Esperance where they have the annual " Festival of the Wind " The carrots were a huge success .
They had some 30 people walking in the parade blowing three different notes - C , E , G chord - in single pipes carrots whilst Kerry and Alain improvised on a full set - 12 notes - carrot panpipes .
Sounded great as well as the munching sound at the end of the playing !
They are also known as Bella Music and tour all the music festivals and do a lot of work in schools - they must be a truly amazing site when in full swing .
They also do a first class job in promoting healthy vegetable eating .
Good on ya !
Flute ' n '
Veg can also enhance corporate functions , Stress Management Workshops and team - building events .
Is there no end to this talented bunch ?
To quote from their site " From corporate functions to festivals across Australia these finely tuned and sculptured carrot instruments a peel to all ages !
Tuned carrot panpipes can be made to create massed harmonies followed by carrot munching .
How do they make the musical instruments ?
With lots of time and patience !
Selecting them at the various local supermarkets can be time consuming .
Long ones are best - between 15 and 25 cm - not too thin , at least 4 cm in diameter at the thick ( leafy ) end and as straight as possible ( makes drilling not too tricky ! ) .
In an ordinary kitchen it takes about 3 hours to make a full set of panpipes - 12 notes .
Another 2 to 3 hours to make the flageolet and quena flutes .
In all a full day 's work at the office !
Sometimes 2 depending how many are required ( Duo or quartet )
Once finished they are wrapped in very wet tea - towels and kept in the fridge until performing time , carrying them in a cool " hand portable fridge " ( called esky ) .
The fresh celery addition happens minutes before the performance followed a fine tuning session with the piano accordion using mung beans to slightly raise the pitch if necessary .
They are pre-tuned at 440 Hz whilst making them , with a electronic tuner .
They need refreshing - with the aid of a squeeze bottle - regularly throughout the performance to keep them moist , so that they do n't dry out ( easier to play ) and look fresh at all times .
As you can imagine they are very demanding !
Why going through all that bother for instruments that after all only last the time of one performance ?
The smiles and joy - astonished looks and comments - from young ones to seniors listening attentively is so rewarding and thus worth the effort of making them .
Or maybe simple , gentle madness !
The tools specifically created and designed for the job , were made by Kerry 's partner who is a luthier of international reputation .
He specialises in the making and restoration of ancient wind instruments .
So there you are , you know just about all the " secrets " of the trade !
Surely another fine example of carrot madness .
Keep it going Bella Music .
When John visited Alain in Belgium he kindly made some one off pieces to show how it is done .
Here are the results .
Linsey Pollak - The Carrot Musician
Here 's a guy who can do incredible things with a simple carrot .
When Linsey hits the stage expect the unexpected !
What does he do ??
he plays carrots - Yes !!
combining comedy with music making , and generally giving people a good time .
He is a home - styled kitchen hand with a difference .
Hes eccentric , hilarious and totally irresistible .
And he lives in a musical world where all is possible ....
From the moment that he walks into the kitchen , everything becomes musical .
He even transforms a carrot into a clarinet before our very eyes .
Using digital technology to record sounds instantaneously the audience is able to see each piece being constructed layer by layer , with all the sounds coming from the cooking utensils and food .
This musical world that Linsey creates is more than a series of clever tricks .
It is an aural world of depth , energy and beauty .
Although the materials are disconcertingly simple , the music itself is complex , rich and emotive , ranging from energetic and percussive cross rhythms to haunting and lyrical woodwind ( or should we say vegiewind ) melodies .
Linsey Pollak is an artist with a reputation for not only creating , but also playing instruments made out of everything from carrots , watering cans , chairs , bins and brooms to rubber gloves .
For over 30 years , he has toured in Australia , Asia , the Americas and Europe .
Linsey is well known all around Australia as a musician , instrument maker , composer , musical director and community music facilitator .
He has worked as a musical instrument maker for over 20 years and has designed a number of new wind instruments as well as specialising in woodwind instruments from Eastern Europe ( having studied Macedonian bagpipes in Macedonia ) .
He has specialised in designing and making marimbas and other tuned percussion .
His ongoing obsession combines much of this : Making music more accessible to the Community through musical instrument making and playing workshops .
Linsey has a reputation for making and playing instruments made from rubber gloves , carrots , watering cans , chairs , brooms , bins , and other found objects .
First developed in his solo show  Bang it with a Fork and further in the acclaimed childrens show  Out of the Frying Pan , this line of musical inventiveness has ultimately led him to also encompass modern digital technology and develop his solo shows  Knocking on Kevins Door ,  Playpen ,  The Art of Food and " Making Jam " and the larger scale outdoor environmental performance  Bim ... BamBoo !!
More recently he is using a midi wind controller to play and loop samples of everything from voices to frogs .
He is currently building a musical installation where the sound of frogs are triggered when large aluminium frogs are hit with a stream of water  SQUIRT  .
Linsey Pollak is one of Australia 's most brilliant and under -rated composer / musicians .
He is wildly innovative in the use of instruments but never lets his experimentation get in the way of the musicality of a work .
Queenslands Linsey Pollak makes music from carrots and other household items , such as watering cans and camping stools .
Heres how he makes a carrot clarinet .
Cut the carrot to 187 mm .
For the thumb hole at the back , mark a spot 22 mm from the tip ( the thinner end ) .
For the finger holes on the opposite side of the carrot , mark holes at 39 mm , 54 mm , 74 mm , 97 mm , 123 mm and 140 mm from the top .
Drill a hole all the way through the length of the carrot with a 12 mm drill bit .
Blow out shavings .
Use a 7 mm drill bit to drill thumb and finger holes , only drilling through to the hole in the middle .
Clean up the front of the thumb and finger holes using a vegetable peeler so they are easy to see .
Join an alto sax or clarinet mouthpiece to the top using a short length of 12 mm tube , such as hose joiner .
If adding a funnel , cut the thicker end of the carrot so the finished length ( excluding mouthpiece ) is 187 mm .

Vienna Vegetable Orchestra
This is Viennas Vegetable Orchestra : a 10 - piece ensemble from the city of Beethoven , Brahms and Mozart that plays music with instruments made entirely from fresh produce .
Over the past 21 years , the group has played nearly 300 shows at packed venues around the globe and performed everything from classical with cabbage to techno with turnips in a rich , rhythmic ratatouille .
The orchestra recently released its fourth album after a successful  Krautfunding  ( herb - funding ) campaign and is showing the world that , actually , you can play with your food .
The Vegetable Orchestra was founded in 1998 .
It consists of 11 musicians , a sound engineer and a video artist .
Based in Vienna , the Vegetable Orchestra plays concerts in Europe and Asia .
From time to time workshops are given - on how to manufacture an instrument or on musical topics .
The Vegetable Orchestra performs music solely on instruments made of vegetables .
Using carrot flutes , pumpkin basses , leek violins , leek - zucchini- vibrators , cucumberophones and celery bongos , the orchestra creates its own extraordinary and vegetable sound universe .
The ensemble overcomes preserved and marinated sound conceptions or tirelessly re-stewed listening habits , putting its focus on expanding the variety of vegetable instruments , developing novel musical ideas and exploring fresh vegetable sound gardens .
They spend time scouring outdoor markets for the freshest produce to drill , cut , peel and scrape into colourful instruments .
Watch their youtube video here - http://youtu.be/hpfYt7vRHuY
Carrots are hollowed out and made into recorders that sound strikingly similar to the plastic kind ; onions are pulled apart and the skins rubbed together to make a subtle crunch ; big pumpkins become bongos .
A concert of the Vegetable Orchestra appeals to all the senses .
As an encore at the end of the concert and the video performance , the audience is offered fresh vegetable soup .
There are no musical boundaries for the Vegetable Orchestra .
The most diverse music styles fuse here - contemporary music , beat - oriented House tracks , experimental Electronic , Free Jazz , Noise , Dub , Clicks 'n ' Cuts - the musical scope of the ensemble expands consistently , and recently developed vegetable instruments and their inherent sounds often determine the direction .
Orchestra co-founder Ernst Reitermaier describes performing with the group as being part of a bigger instrument .
I like it that the audience is amazed by what we do .
And though its second album , Automate , was inspired by electronica , he insists the band is equally influenced by classical and other genres and prefers to define its sound simply as vegetable style . 
Of course like all the carrot musicians the World Carrot Museum has come across , these people are very serious about their music - it is not a " just for fun " project .
The Vienna Vegetable Orchestra makes it cool to play with your food .
Some of the instruments used in performances :
Radish Flute Recorder Cucumber Carrot Karimba Flute Radirimba
Recorders Sticks

It is inspired by the fact both the participants have allotments and are making feeble attempts at cultivating vegetables - as well as some of the characters they have met along the way .
It includes a love song to Alan Titchmarsh , a rap battle between a gardener and a slug and a Eurovision number inspired by BBC Radio 4's Gardeners ' Question Time .
They are keen to include vegetable instruments in the show and were inspired by some of the other musicians featured in the Carrot Museum , especially Heita and the Vegetabl e Orchestra of Vienna .
Dan plays the cucumber trumpet and carrot panpipes in the show and Jo plays the hosepipe tuba .
They also do workshops showing others how to make vegetable instruments .
The Can You Dig It ? crew recently won the " Carrot Olympics " , a competition run by the British Carrot Growers ' Association and performed the theme tune to 1980s children 's cartoon

Long Island Vegetable Orchestra
A Vegetable Orchestra featuring a renowned violinist and music students playing instruments carved from fresh broccoli , eggplant and carrots .
The Long Island Vegetable Orchestra ( LIVO ) , has actually created some funky instruments using vegetables such as carrots , potatoes , pumpkins , cucumbers , lemongrass and bamboo sticks .
And this unique veggie jam is definitely a delish musical salad making all kinds of right noises .
According to the band 's official website , the group was founded in 2011 at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University .
" LIVO was created by Grammy - nominated music professor , Dr Dale Stuckenbruck , who investigated carving musical instruments out of vegetables , " reads the introduction .
LIVO performs with freshly prepared instruments such as a saxophone - like cucumberphone , pumpkin bass drums struck with lemongrass , various carrot flutes , delicious daikon double reeds , butternut squashes that carry the sound of brass instruments , sweet potato ocarinas , natural clarinets and bamboo violins .
On March 30 , 2011 the Long Island Vegetable Orchestra performed a brief experimental musical composition - a four - minute , original classical piece called " Carrots and Strings " - a feast for your ears - not on ears of corn , but on cucumber , radish , eggplant and green pepper , with a solo or two on carrot .
In the tradition of the Vienna Vegetable Orchestra , which has received hearty acclaim for its performances and produced a cornucopia of CDs .
The concert featured music students led by Adjunct Professor Dale Stuckenbruck , a renowned violinist and concert master of such Broadway shows as  Promises , Promises ,   Jekyll and Hyde and  yes   A Catered Affair . 
But it was the produce which topped the bill .
The orchestra is really more of an ensemble made up of four high school vegetable players and Stuckenbruck , accompanied by a violin , a viola and a cello .
Afterward , they eat their veggie instruments , so there 's no waste , Stuckenbruck says .
" My daughter , she made a carrot cake , " he says .
Stuckenbruck also has made soup .
" If you cook it at really hot temperatures , it 's servable to other people , " he says .
The watermelon hull and veggie skins are contributed to a compost pile on campus , he adds .
The freshly prepared instruments include a saxophone - soundalike cucumberphone ,  pumpkin basses , carrot flutes and eggplant for percussion .
The musicians , dressed in black , borrowed from a range of musical genres including jazz , beat and classical under the guidance of a master musician whose résumé includes stints with the Brooklyn Philharmonic , Tchaikovsky Chamber Orchestra , Taipei City Symphony Orchestra and Long Island Philharmonic ; teaching at Juilliard ; and profiles in the New York Times , Strings magazine , and Newsday
Professor Stuckenbruck has taken his fresh perspective on music education for students in a vegetable ensemble at the Waldorf School in Garden City , N.Y. ( not to be confused with the Waldorf Salad ) and is delighted to be directing this concert at C.W. Post .
 With my students , the message is clear :
Do not waste ,  he said .
 People who may never eat their vegetables at home will eat their carrots following our performance . 
Ask music teacher Dale Stuckenbruck his favourite instrument , and it 's quite possible he 'll say " the eggplants . "
Rub two together and they make a squeaking sound like sneakers on a gymnasium floor , or a monkey chanting " ooh ooh ooh , " he says .
A close second might be the carrot .
Carve it into a recorder - like instrument and it carries a flutelike melody .
Then there 's the watermelon .
Hollow it out and thump it with lemongrass stalks and it offers a drumbeat .
Put them together and you 've got what Stuckenbruck has dubbed " The Long Island Vegetable Orchestra , " .
Stuckenbruck , who teaches violin and is also a music teacher at the Waldorf School , a private school for preschool through 12th grade in Garden City .
It was while teaching there that he launched a vegetable orchestra to teach students " everything around you in life can become a musical instrument . "
Stuckenbruck got the vegetable orchestra idea from the Viennese Vegetable Orchestra , which was founded in 1998 .
An orchestra in Vienna was asked to do an experimental performance at a festival and decided to make music from the toughest items they could think of -- soup ingredients .
For his Long Island version , Stuckenbruck goes shopping before rehearsal at Chinese and Korean vegetable markets and at Whole Foods , and he also gets donations from C.W. Post .
Stuckenbruck might be in the produce aisle , looking at a bunch of celery stalks to see whether rubbing the leaves together makes a rushing sound like the wind .
Or tapping the watermelons to see if the shell is hard enough to play .
It costs $ 200 to $ 300 in vegetables to rehearse four times , do a sound check session and perform , he said .
The microphone check is a key element of preparation , so the vegetable sounds can be heard .
The instruments have to be created as close to the performance as possible , and wo n't last more than 24 hours because they dry out .
At a recent rehearsal on a Thursday night at Stuckenbruck 's West Hempstead home , the group made instruments in his backyard , using an ice - cream scoop to hollow the watermelon , a handheld , motorized drill to tunnel through the cucumber and the carrots , and a paring knife to carve embouchures , or mouthpieces .
Max Cheney , 15 , is a Waldorf sophomore from Glen Cove , and he made a trumpet - like instrument from a cucumber , a carrot and a red bell pepper .
Orin Pearce , 16 , is a sophomore at Waldorf from North Woodmere who usually plays the drums ; it was a natural transition for him to take on the watermelon .
" With the drums , there are a lot more options , " Orin says , such as striking the cymbals .
" Here you are more limited , so you have to be a lot more creative . "
Stuckenbruck 's daughter , Erin , 16 , is a junior and she plays the carrot alongside her dad .
Rehearsal involved reading off regular musical scores with measures and notes .
It 's a challenge to keep it going -- Erin 's carrot , for instance , was getting soggy and would n't play .
Stuckenbruck is no stranger to unusual musical performances .
He was nominated for a Grammy for playing the musical saw , and he also plays the wine glasses .
The veggie group is slated to perform again at C.W .
Post when summer classes are in session in July .
Says Stuckenbruck : " These are the concerts these kids will remember 50 years from now .
The Wyld Men - The Vegetable Musicians
Dr. Cranius Lunch , Seth Sethstherton and Grebe , are more commonly known as the Wyld Men , specialising in Veggie Music - ye s music played on real vegetables !
Think of it as precycling .
Before you use something , you use it for something else first -- in this case , parts of your next meal .
Read on , follow the links and engage your imagination !
The Wyld Men are three like minded artists who perform and experiment in the realms of music , theatre and movement .
The " Veggie Music " CD is an exploration of song styles , soundscapes and radio theatre featuring the use of flutes made out of vegetables and other inventive sources of music .
In this recording you will hear such instruments as Yam , Broccoli and Carrot Whistles as featured on the album cover .
They have found in live performance that they must be able to create their instruments on stage , or no one believes that they are really vegetables .
While it is technically possible to create a fingered fife or flute from , say , a carrot , this is an exacting , tedious and lengthy process  and one at which they are not at all accomplished .
The solution is to quickly create musical vegetables by drilling them out , then assembling a number of these vegetables creates , in effect , a set of pan pipes ( no pun intended , though they are all ultimately destined for the pan .
When playing the street at a festival the Wyld Men like to claim that we are the only musicians out there guaranteed to go home to supper ) .
Wyld Men 's own page in the Museum here .
Described as " A playful and eclectic melange of diverse musical styles , comedy and theatre using flutes made out of vegetables as well as experimental instruments such as the umbrella - phone and a whiskey - in - the - jar - o - phone . " - it is great music and great fun !
The Veggie Music CD gives the band ample opportunity to share the tunefulness of tubers .
Seth 's
My favourite veggie cut ( which is making more and more ipod downloads !! ) is Location 5 , an ode to David Brubeck '' Take Five .
The guitar man Frank is awesome , David ( Grebe ) performs some monstrous percussion , and Seth ( Douglas ) is very sassy on the beet , yam and broccoli and Jonathan explores the unexplored on slide potato .
The whole CD is beyond expectation - give it a listen here - and let the jaw slacken just a little , the eyes widen and allow that laugh to start way down deep in the belly .

Wild Carrot
Although Wild Carrot are not strictly " carrot " musicians , they clearly have a link to carrot world as they are known to give out wild carrot seeds at their performances !
Carrot Pam Temple and Spencer Funk of Wild Carrot met through music , married and began performing full - time together in 2000 .
They were quickly voted  Best Folk Act in their hometown of Cincinnati and have since crisscrossed the country pleasing audiences with their eclectic mix of award - winning original songs , traditional tunes , swing , blues and more , being chosen twice as the only U.S. Folk Act to serve as Cultural Ambassador to Chile , South America with the U.S. State Department .
When they re not performing , Spencer is also a respected guitar teacher and Pam , on - air music host of the American Roots program , The Front Porch , at local NPR affiliate 89.7 FM WNKU .
Wild Carrot is also available as a trio ( Wild Carrot Trio ) or quartet ( Wild Carrot with Their Roots Band ) to fit your venue 's needs and budget .
The latest CD from Wild Carrot ( with Their Roots Band ) was recorded live with an audience and is called Crowd Around the Mic , on their own Chocolate Dog Music label , released through Blue Jordan Records .
It was truly grown from the ground , funded almost entirely by the audiences and donations from fans .
So , where did they get the name " Wild Carrot ' ?
A wild carrot is the same as Queen Anne 's Lace .
Their music has been described as being rooted in the solid earth of tradition and untainted by commercialism ; strong while displaying a delicate intricacy , like Queen Anne 's Lace .

Nan Weidong and Nan Weiping - Two brothers in Beijing have come up with an alternative use for roots , tubers and gourds .
Nan Weidong and Nan Weiping have refined the art of fashioning musical instruments out of vegetables .
The idea of playing music with vegetables came to Nan Weidong , 43 , and Nan Weiping , 41 , only two years ago , but it has since become a passion and a career .
The brothers learned to play conventional instruments from their father , a music teacher , when they were children .
Now the pair live and work in a narrow apartment in Beijing , drilling holes in carrots , marrows , lotus roots and Chinese yams to make vegetable instruments that they perfect using an old electronic tuner .
They now live and work in a narrow Beijing apartment , drilling holes in carrots , marrows , lotus roots and Chinese yams and nibbling silently on the shavings all the while .
A sweet potato becomes a perky ocarina , a bamboo shoot a mellow , reedy flute .
A row of carrots tied upright to leeks is transformed into a set of Chinese panpipes .
According to the brothers , different vegetables have different scales and are therefore suited to different melodies : a sweet potato makes an ocarina , a bamboo shoot becomes a flute , a yam , a whistle .
But controlling the pitch is still extremely difficult , because changes in the air temperature , humidity and other factors can warp the shape of the holes and put the notes out of tune .
The Nan brothers , whose repertoire ranges from traditional Chinese flute music to modern pop to western folk songs like Auld Lang Syne , have appeared on talent shows in China and can receive payments of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan ( £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 ) for a performance .
Youtube video here - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7qiwu46hrA
Nan Weidong explains that picking the right vegetable at the right time is essential .
" If the water content in vegetables evaporates , the tune will become higher than the basic tune or go out of tune .
Therefore we choose the vegetables with as much water content as possible .
The vegetables have to be solid and hard .
We can't use those vegetables left over for days .
They are too soft to be played . "
The deeper the hole , the lower the pitch .
The shallower the hole , the high the pitch .
Besides , the size of the hole also matters to guarantee the quality of the sound .
The leeks only serve as decoration .
It was made based on the principles of how Chinese panpipes work .
Of course vegetables have a shelf life , so each show requires a brand new set of carrot and leak panpipes and potato ocarinas .
Koyama Junji also known as Heita3 from Japan - A " Vegetable musician and amateur poet " , his videos introduce the vegetable musical instruments he makes and then he plays them .
Fascinating stuff !
There are eight kinds of vegetable musical instruments .
Enjoy the videos with sound on youtube , including simple instructions on making a carrot ocarina - great sounds !

Make a Carrot Kazoo ( with adult help ! )
Ingredients - 1 Medium to large carrot ; 1 Kitchen Knife ; 1 Drill ; 1 Longish drill bit , say 15 mm , long enough to drill a hole lengthways through the carrot .
A small piece of greaseproof paper .
Method :
Make a cut across the carrot to create a flat end to drill into .
Carefully drill a hole through the carrot lengthways .
Check you can sing or talk down the carrot .
If you cant , the hole is probably blocked or not big enough .
Drill another large hole from the side of the carrot into the centre of the bore .
Cover the side hole with greaseproof paper and lightly hold in place with your fingers around the edges .
Start singing ...
The key to this instrument is to find the frequency the paper wants to rattle at , so experiment with singing at different pitches .
You might need to fiddle with the paper to get it to work .
It should be covering the hole so it gets moved by the air , but not so tightly held that it cant rattle .
You can hold the paper in place with your fingers or elastic bands , but this must not be on top of the hole , otherwise you stop the paper moving .

Democrats in the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate workers ’ personal retirement accounts — including 401 ( k ) s and IRAs — and convert them to accounts managed by the Social Security Administration .
Triggered by the financial crisis the past two months , the hearings reportedly were meant to stem losses incurred by many workers and retirees whose 401 ( k ) and IRA balances have been shrinking rapidly .
The testimony of Teresa Ghilarducci , professor of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research in New York , in hearings Oct. 7 drew the most attention and criticism .
Testifying for the House Committee on Education and Labor , Ghilarducci proposed that the government eliminate tax breaks for 401( k ) and similar retirement accounts , such as IRAs , and confiscate workers ’ retirement plan accounts and convert them to universal Guaranteed Retirement Accounts ( GRAs ) managed by the Social Security Administration .
Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , in prepared remarks for the hearing on “ The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Workers ’ Retirement Security , ” blamed Wall Street for the financial crisis and said his committee will “ strengthen and protect Americans ’ 401 ( k ) s , pensions , and other retirement plans ” and the “ Democratic Congress will continue to conduct this much - needed oversight on behalf of the American people . ”
Currently , 401 ( k ) plans allow Americans to invest pretax money and their employers match up to a defined percentage , which not only increases workers ’ retirement savings but also reduces their annual income tax .
The balances are fully inheritable , subject to income tax , meaning workers pass on their wealth to their heirs , unlike Social Security .
Even when they leave an employer and go to one that does n’t offer a 401 ( k ) or pension , workers can transfer their balances to a qualified IRA .
Mandating Equality
Ghilarducci ’s plan first appeared in a paper for the Economic Policy Institute : Agenda for Shared Prosperity on Nov. 20 , 2007 , in which she said GRAs will rescue the flawed American retirement income system ( www.sharedprosperity.org/bp204/bp204.pdf).
The current retirement system , Ghilarducci said , “ exacerbates income and wealth inequalities ” because tax breaks for voluntary retirement accounts are “ skewed to the wealthy because it is easier for them to save , and because they receive bigger tax breaks when they do . ”
Lauding GRAs as a way to effectively increase retirement savings , Ghilarducci wrote that savings incentives are unequal for rich and poor families because tax deferrals “ provide a much larger ‘ carrot ’ to wealthy families than to middle - class families — and none whatsoever for families too poor to owe taxes . ”
GRAs would guarantee a fixed 3 percent annual rate of return , although later in her article Ghilarducci explained that participants would not “ earn a 3 % real return in perpetuity . ”
In place of tax breaks workers now receive for contributions and thus a lower tax rate , workers would receive $ 600 annually from the government , inflation - adjusted .
For low - income workers whose annual contributions are less than $ 600 , the government would deposit whatever amount it would take to equal the minimum $ 600 for all participants .
In a radio interview with Kirby Wilbur in Seattle on Oct. 27 , 2008 , Ghilarducci explained that her proposal does n’t eliminate the tax breaks , rather , “ I ’m just rearranging the tax breaks that are available now for 401 ( k ) s and spreading — spreading the wealth . ”
All workers would have 5 percent of their annual pay deducted from their paychecks and deposited to the GRA .
They would still be paying Social Security and Medicare taxes , as would the employers .
The GRA contribution would be shared equally by the worker and the employee .
Employers no longer would be able to write off their contributions .
Any capital gains would be taxable year - on - year .
Analysts point to another disturbing part of the plan .
With a GRA , workers could bequeath only half of their account balances to their heirs , unlike full balances from existing 401 ( k ) and IRA accounts .
For workers who die after retiring , they could bequeath just their own contributions plus the interest but minus any benefits received and minus the employer contributions .
Another justification for Ghilarducci ’s plan is to eliminate investment risk .
In her testimony , Ghilarducci said , “ humans often lack the foresight , discipline , and investing skills required to sustain a savings plan . ”
She cited the 2004 HSBC global survey on the Future of Retirement , in which she claimed that “ a third of Americans wanted the government to force them to save more for retirement . ”
What the survey actually reported was that 33 percent of Americans wanted the government to “ enforce additional private savings , ” a vastly different meaning than mandatory government - run savings .
Of the four potential sources of retirement support , which were government , employer , family , and self , the majority of Americans said “ self ” was the most important contributor , followed by “ government . ”
When broken out by family income , low - income U.S. households said the “ government ” was the most important retirement support , whereas high - income families ranked “ government ” last and “ self ” first ( www.hsbc.com/retirement).
On Oct. 22 , The Wall Street Journal reported that the Argentinean government had seized all private pension and retirement accounts to fund government programs and to address a ballooning deficit .
Fearing an economic collapse , foreign investors quickly pulled out , forcing the Argentinean stock market to shut down several times .
More than 10 years ago , nationalization of private savings sent Argentina ’s economy into a long - term downward spiral .
Income and Wealth Redistribution
The majority of witness testimony during recent hearings before the House Committee on Education and Labor showed that congressional Democrats intend to address income and wealth inequality through redistribution .
On July 31 , 2008 , Robert Greenstein , executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , testified before the subcommittee on workforce protections that “ from the standpoint of equal treatment of people with different incomes , there is a fundamental flaw ” in tax code incentives because they are “ provided in the form of deductions , exemptions , and exclusions rather than in the form of refundable tax credits . ”
Even people who do n’t pay taxes should get money from the government , paid for by higher - income Americans , he said .
“ There is no obvious reason why lower - income taxpayers or people who do not file income taxes should get smaller incentives ( or no tax incentives at all ) , ” Greenstein said .
“ Moving to refundable tax credits for promoting socially worthwhile activities would be an important step toward enhancing progressivity in the tax code in a way that would improve economic efficiency and performance at the same time , ” Greenstein said , and “ reducing barriers to labor organizing , preserving the real value of the minimum wage , and the other workforce security concerns . . . would contribute to an economy with less glaring and sharply widening inequality . ”
When asked whether committee members seriously were considering Ghilarducci ’s proposal for GSAs , Aaron Albright , press secretary for the Committee on Education and Labor , said Miller and other members were listening to all ideas .
Miller ’s biggest priority has been on legislation aimed at greater transparency in 401 ( k ) s and other retirement plan administration , specifically regarding fees , Albright said , and he sent a link to a Fox News interview of Miller on Oct. 24 , 2008 , to show that the congressman had not made a decision .
After repeated questions asked by Neil Cavuto of Fox News , Miller said he would not be in favor of “ killing the 401 ( k ) ” or of “ killing the tax advantages for 401 ( k ) s . ”
Arguing against liberal prescriptions , William Beach , director of the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation , testified on Oct. 24 that the “ roots of the current crisis are firmly planted in public policy mistakes ” by the Federal Reserve and Congress .
He cautioned Congress against raising taxes , increasing burdensome regulations , or withdrawing from international product or capital markets .
“ Congress can ill afford to repeat the awesome errors of its predecessor in the early days of the Great Depression , ” Beach said .
Instead , Beach said , Congress could best address the financial crisis by making the tax reductions of 2001 and 2003 permanent , stopping dependence on demand - side stimulus , lowering the corporate profits tax , and reducing or eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends .
Testifying before the same committee in early October , Jerry Bramlett , president and CEO of BenefitStreet , Inc. , an independent 401 ( k ) plan administrator , said one of the best ways to ensure retirement security would be to have the U.S. Department of Labor develop educational materials for workers so they could make better investment decisions , not exchange equity investments in retirement accounts for Treasury bills , as proposed in the GSAs .
Should Sen. Barack Obama win the presidency , congressional Democrats might have stronger support for their “ spreading the wealth ” agenda .
On Oct. 27 , the American Thinker posted a video of an interview with Obama on public radio station WBEZ - FM from 2001 .
In the interview , Obama said , “ The Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth , and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society . ”
The Constitution says only what “ the states ca n’t do to you .
Says what the Federal government can’t do to you , ” and Obama added that the Warren Court was n’t that radical .
Although in 2001 Obama said he was not “ optimistic about bringing major redistributive change through the courts , ” as president , he would likely have the opportunity to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices .
“ The real tragedy of the civil rights movement was , um , because the civil rights movement became so court focused that I think there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalition of powers through which you bring about redistributive change , ” Obama said .
Karen McMahan is a contributing editor of Carolina Journal .
With “ Bush derangement syndrome ” having infected large swaths of the Left , it is no surprise that their fever dreams feature the prosecution of Bush Administration heavies for their “ crimes against humanity ” and the U.S. Constitution .
This weekend , the otherwise unremarkable Massachusetts School of Law at Andover will host a conference to that end .
“ This is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred , ” says dean Lawrence Velvel , but “ a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth . ”
Even the Obama campaign has latched onto the idea , and that support has been a major sop for the hard - left disenchanted since the campaign began its pivot to the center for the general election .
Those planning up in Andover this weekend have a clear vision in mind .
“ For Bush , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and John Yoo to spend years in jail or go to the gallows for their crimes would be a powerful lesson to future American leaders , ” says Velvel .
No doubt .
But in today ’s Wall Street Journal , Alan Derschowitz — no fan of the Bush Administration — considers what that lesson would be :
The real question is whether investigating one ’s political opponents poses too great a risk of criminalizing policy differences — especially when these differences are highly emotional and contentious , as they are with regard to Iraq , terrorism and the like .
The fear of being criminally prosecuted by one ’s political adversaries has a chilling effect on creative policy making and implementation .
The heart of the problem is that the criminal law touches too much .
As Dershowitz explains , “ A politically appointed prosecutor , imbued with partisan zeal , could find technical violations of the criminal law in some of the envelope - pushing policies of virtually every administration . ”
He aptly quotes Stalin ’s enforcer Lavrentiy Beria : “ Show me the man and I ’ll find you the crime . ”
For those who do not inhabit the fever swamps , it should be obvious that prosecuting on the basis of policy difference –circumventing the impeachment mechanism put into the Constitution for just this purpose –would cripple the operation of government .
And not just Iraq or other things one party or the other may dislike , but everything–guns , butter , and all .
Dershowitz suggests that prosecutions be limited to cases where “ the criminal act and mens rea [ guilty mind ] are so apparent to everyone that no reasonable person would suspect partisanship . ”
That ’s good advice , but probably not enough at a time when the criminal law reaches so much ordinary conduct and increasingly lacks mens rea requirements .
With around 4,500 possible federal offenses on the books , according to a recent study by Prof.
John Baker , any prosecutor worth his salt could find something to charge .
Really , the only thing to keep an Obama or McCain Administration from prosecuting is its own discretion–a weighing of the costs and benefits–and the fear that its officials might suffer the same fate someday .
The real lesson in this is not that we are all equal before the law ( the common refrain among the hard - left as they daydream of sentencing Bush for his tax cuts ) but that , under the criminal law today , a prosecutor can find a charge that would stick against anybody .
It ’s not just government officials making tough choices with life or death consequences who are at risk–we all are .

Being Ted Stevens means never having to say you 're sorry
Facing the toughest race of his 40 - year congressional career , Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) proclaimed once again that he is innocent in a special two - minute ad being aired tonight in Alaska .
Stevens was convicted last week on seven corruption counts in a federal court in Washington , D.C .
Stevens also suggested that his seniority in the Senate will help bring federal dollars back home to Alaska , something his Democratic opponent , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , will have a tougher time doing as a freshman back - bencher .
Stevens unveiled a two - minute ad tonight , titled " Experience Counts , " in which he claimed that he was railroaded into a conviction by " overzealous prosecutors " from the Justice Department who " violated the Constitution by knowingly withholding evidence confirming my innocence . "
" My future is in God ’s hands , " Stevens says .
" Alaska ’s future is in yours . "
Stevens did not apologize for his legal problems , something he has not done since his July 29 indictment , although he did express regret for the controversy surrounding his case .
" These past few months have been difficult for all Alaskans , including my family , " Stevens says .
" I deeply regret that .
From the bottom of my heart , I know that I ’m innocent . "
Stevens adds : " Everyone has the right to a fair trial and an appeal because some times innocent men are found guilty .
This is one of those times . "
Stevens , a legendary pork - barrel politician of the old school , brags about federal dollars he was able to steer back home thanks to his perch on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee .
" My actions in the Senate during the past few weeks alone secured more than $ 200 million for our military in Alaska , obtained tax relief for the Exxon - Valdez victims , invested in alternative energy projects , and doubled federal funding for many school districts , " Stevens says .
" When you vote tomorrow , ask yourself :
Who will fight for Alaskans to provide affordable access to health care , lower energy cost , and work hard to ensure a bright future during these uncertain economic times ?
Experience counts and empty promises just do n’t cut it . "
Stevens never mentions
Begich by name in the ad , instead repeating the same two themes that he has pushed in the final days of the campaign — he was a victim of an unfair and improper prosecution by the Justice Department , and his experience in the Senate helps him deliver federal funds for Alaska .
Oil prices fell to their lowest level in 20 months on Tuesday , despite efforts by the OPEC cartel to stem the slide , as weak economic growth continued to reduce consumption around the world .
Lower energy prices are providing some welcome relief for struggling consumers , but a 59 percent decline in oil prices since their summer peak also shows how radically the prospects of the global economy have darkened in recent months .
At an emergency meeting last month , members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduce their output , as of Nov. 1 , to slow the price slide .
While there is no official tally of OPEC production , several members  including Algeria , Qatar , the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait  have signaled in recent days that they had begun paring their production .
Jersey City Councilman Steve Lipski may have been unknown to most of the world before today , but things can rapidly change .
Steven Lipski apparently likes a drink , but its what he did while drunk Friday that has exposed him to a wider audience .
Lipski was arrested Friday night for urinating on a crowd of concertgoers from the balcony of a Washington nightclub .
Lipski was attending the club to hear a Grateful Dead tribute band .
According to sources quoted by the New York Daily News , Lipski was “ very drunk ” but this was n’t the first time Lipski had caused a ruckus at the venue : “ We ’ve dealt with this man before , ” the source added .
“ He ’s never peed on anybody , but he gets really belligerent and drunk . ”
Lipski , who is serving his second term in office was charged with simple assault .
As well as serving as a Jersey City Councilman , Lipski was previously a mayoral candidate as well .
The ultimate Rick Astley scooped Best Act Ever .
Rick was not available to attend the Awards .
In his absence the Award was picked up by Katy Perry and Perez Hilton who charmed the audience with a quick dance routine to his famous track Never Going To Give You Up .
In a statement Astley said : " I am honoured that my fans worked so hard to help me win Best Act Ever at the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards .
This is the first time I have been nominated for the EMAs and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me . "
Today we can bring you early word that Circuit City is apparently on the verge of closing 155 stores and withdrawing from the consumer electronics business for good .
Sister site the Consumerist broke the unverified news thanks to an insider tip , which has since been corroborated by a forum post over at Google Finance .
Consumerist also reports that employees in certain departments , like car installation , will be unemployed within 48 hours ( warranties will still be honored ) .
Most closings are expected to be wrapped up by December 31 , 2008 .
It 's a sad day for everyone at Circuit City , but also an inevitable one , given the coverage we 've seen over the past year .
The Sony truck turnaround story from earlier this week was especially damning .

Sully , the wild turkey who has become a celebrity in Southie , has not been seen in over a month .
On the street , speculation about his whereabouts is rampant .
( Chatter about the location of missing characters is , after all , a time - honored tradition in Southie . )
With Thanksgiving approaching , things do not look good .
Either the turkey 's gone on the lam before it got too late , locals say , or it 's already too late .
Sully reportedly arrived in the neighborhood more than six months ago with a half - dozen other turkeys , but they all left and he stayed behind and set up a territory in the area around Dorchester Heights .
His fame was immediate - There 's a wild turkey !
Living in Southie ! - but the more he hung around , the more he endeared himself .
There have been increasing reports of wild turkeys settling in urban areas , but locals say this was no ordinary turkey .
He had a certain strut about him , an attitude .
He was cocky .
As he made his daily strolls through the neighborhood , he would often stop for long periods to admire his own reflection on car doors .
If you stared at him , he would stare right back .
He was n't overly friendly , but he was n't rude .
If you left him alone , he would do the same .
And , they say , he was fearless .
Barking dogs and beeping cars did nothing to ruffle his feathers .
He was , many locals say with pride , a Southie turkey .
" When he first got here , it was like this mania , " said Tracy Falcone , who lives on East 6th Street in the heart of Sully 's territory .
" People would stop their cars .
You 'd see 20 people taking pictures .
Everyone was talking about it .
' Did you see the turkey ?
Did you see the turkey ? ' "
Sully spotting became a game , and he made it easy because he seemed to go everywhere .
He cruised Broadway ; he strolled along L Street ; he went to the beach .
When someone posted a fake notice in May in South Boston Online , a local weekly , claiming that the turkey was lost and there was a reward for anyone who found him , the paper received dozens of phone calls from people who complained that the 800 number in the ad did n't work .
( They missed the fact that the ad was a joke for someone 's birthday , and that the 800 number contained four too many digits . )
On East 8th Street , Sully , and his nonchalant jaywalking , became a part of the daily ritual for those who rode the No. 11 bus in the mornings .
" It just fascinated everyone , " said John Keller , who drove the morning shift on the No. 11 all summer and estimates he saw Sully between 40 and 50 times .
" Everyone would rush to the front of the bus in amazement .
The thing was huge , at least three or four feet tall .
Sometimes , he 'd just be standing there in the middle of the street , in no hurry to move .
All the bus drivers liked him ; we'd tell each other when he was out so we would n't run him over . "
Seeks Dismissal of Criminal Corruption Case Due to ' Repeated , Deliberate ... Violations of Congressman's Attorney - Client Privilege '
Charges DoJ Had Been Listening in on Republican Strategy Phone Calls ...

The Hill reports today that defense attorneys for Congressman Rick Renzi ( R - AZ ) have filed a motion to dismiss 35 charges of corruption stemming from a sweetheart real estate deal , claiming the federal government secretly and illegally wiretapped Renzi 's cell phone .
Ironically , Renzi appears to have been caught up in the very same warrantless wiretapping that he supported as a Congressman ...
Renzi ’s legal team , fighting 35 criminal counts brought by the Department of Justice ( DoJ ) , contends that the federal government recorded portions of a conference call involving the entire House Republican Conference --- days after the mid-term elections when Democrats won control of Congress .
In one of many legal motions filed on Wednesday , Renzi ’s lawyers stated , “ The Justice Department recorded calls in which Congressman Renzi engaged in sensitive discussions concerning the leadership and direction of the House Republican Party with other members of Congress , including candidates for the leadership . ”
[ T ]he Renzi legal motion states , “ on April 19 , 2007 , during the Attorney General ’s testimony before the Judiciary Committee hurriedly executed a search at Congressman ’s Renzi ’s family insurance business , without even signing the warrant papers … ”
...
The lawmaker ’s attorneys are calling on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona to dismiss all the counts against the lawmaker for a variety of reasons , “ including the government ’s repeated , deliberate , and continuing violations of [ the ] Congressman ’s attorney - client privilege . ”
...
[ T ]he government initially indicated it would monitor only certain phone calls , according to Renzi .
Yet , Renzi ’s motion claims , the government did not abide by that promise .
Of course Renzi 's defense team will throw everything under the sun to get their client off the hook , but it is an example of a surveillance - happy Republican hoist on his own petard .
Perhaps Renzi would like to go back in time to revise his many votes in favor of the Bush Administration 's domestic surveillance activities .
Last week , more wiretapping abuses were revealed , as noted by Glenn Greenwald , and of course , widely ignored by the corporate broadcast media :
In the most unsurprising revelation imaginable , two former Army Reserve Arab linguists for the National Security Agency have said that they routinely eavesdropped on --- " and recorded and transcribed " --- the private telephone calls of American citizens who had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism .
The two former NSA employees , who came forward as part of journalist James Bamford 's forthcoming book on the NSA , intercepted calls as part of the so - called " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " whereby George Bush ordered the NSA in 2001 to eavesdrop on Americans ' calls in secret , without first obtaining judicial approval as required by the law ( FISA ) .
That illegal eavesdropping continued for at least six years --- through 2007 .
...
Faulk told Ross : " when one of my co-workers went to a supervisor and said : ' but sir , there are personal calls , ' the supervisor said : ' my orders were to transcribe everything ' . "
He said that the intercepted calls included highly personal and intimate conversations and even phone sex .
One final note : if broad , unchecked domestic spying powers led to " unintentional " wiretapping of the Republican Congressional leadership 's strategy sessions in a case unrelated to their organizational planning , it does beg the question of how many secret wiretaps have led to surveillance on Democratic leadership strategy sessions .

The two false choices in America
The two false choices in America Broadly put , politics in America is a clash between two ideological camps --- conservatives and progressives .
While there are varying positions on numerous social and economic issues , people and parties are forced into of one these two groups ( on all issues ) .
These two ideologies respectively , are now supported by the two main parties : Republican and Democratic .
" Tax and spend liberals " make the Democratic party of " big government " .
" Fiscal conservatives " make the Republican party of " small government " .
This classification , in my opinion , is utterly false .
A recent exchange between Barack Obama and " Joe the Plumber " exemplifies this myth .
Let me not pick on Joe , but he is clearly representative of the Republican party 's ardent supporters .
He uses talking points like " redistribution of wealth " , and " Obama is a socialist " .
Now , to my actual point .
Obama and " Joe the Plumber " are discussing Obama 's tax plan where he proposes to increase the tax rate for individuals and small businesses making above $ 250,000 from 36 % to 39 %.
39 % was the rate during Bill Clinton ( D ) , and Bush ( R ) cut it down .
( It is a different story that national debt grew during Bush , and all Republicans were carrying his water . )
In the video , they are pretty much haggling over the merits of a 3 % rate increase on additional profit above $ 250,000 .
Somehow , a 36 % tax rate is not " socialist " but a 39 % rate is .
What the role of government should be , is an important discussion to have .
It is however disingenuous ( or plain stupid ) to support Republicans because they are fiscal conservatives .
There is hardly any ideological difference between the two parties when it comes to fiscal responsibility .
That black hole that was going to eat the Earth ?
Forget about it , and keep making the mortgage payments  those of you who still have them .
A new particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Collider scheduled to go into operation this fall outside Geneva , is no threat to the Earth or the universe , according to a new safety review approved Friday by the governing council of the European Organization for Nuclear Research , or Cern , which is building the collider .
“ There is no basis for any concerns about the consequences of new particles or forms of matter that could possibly be produced by the LHC , ” five physicists who comprised the safety assessment group wrote in their report .
Whatever the collider will do , they said , Nature has already done many times over .
The report is available at http://lsag.web.cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf.
The physicists , who labored anonymously for the last year and a half , are John Ellis , Michelangelo Mangano , Gian Giudice and Urs Wiedemann , of Cern , and Igor Tkachev , of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow .
In a press release , Cern ’s director general Robert Aymar said , “ With this report , the Laboratory has fulfilled every safety and environmental evaluation necessary to ensure safe operation of this exciting new research facility . ”
Experts Endorsing Ron Paul ’s Sensible Plan To Permanently Dismantle Federal Reserve
The trillion - dollar Wall Street bailout plan negotiated by the White House and Congress has reinvigorated the debate about Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul ’s Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act ( HR 2755 ) , which was introduced into Congress in June 2007 .
In the halls of Congress , legislators have yet to bring Paul ’s bill to the floor .
It is currently languishing in the House Committee on Financial Services .
However , there has been a great deal of discussion about this landmark legislation on the Internet and in the alternative press .
Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin has even made abolishing the Fed one of the top planks in his platform .
Paul ’s measure , as it is now , would kill the Federal Reserve Act and would then phase out the Federal Reserve one year after the bill becomes law .
The Federal Reserve Act , passed by Congress in 1913 , laid the foundation for the creation of a privately owned and controlled central bank and gave private bankers the power to control the nation ’s money supply .
Nearly 100 years later , the role the central bank has played in the financial scandal has been widely reported in the mainstream .
Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , once heralded as “ the maestro , ” has been feeling the heat for supporting the deregulation of financial institutions and flooding markets with cheap dollars .
U.S. News & World Report had a recent commentary titled “ From Enron to the Financial Crisis , With Alan Greenspan in Between ” excoriating Greenspan , who as the nation ’s top banker , repeatedly downplayed the risks associated with derivatives even after the collapse of Enron in 2002 .
On September 27 , The New York Times also hit Greenspan for his failure to watch over and regulate greedy banks .
To its credit , the Times also blasted Congress for dismantling important safeguards , including the Glass - Steagall Act , which kept commercial and investment banks at a safe distance .
“ Now we know that an entire ‘ shadow banking system ’ has grown up , ” wrote the Times , “ without rules or transparency , but with the ability to topple the financial system itself . ”
Even the cable news shows are getting in on the game .
NBC ’s cable news show interviewed well - known investor Jim Rogers , who made a fortune betting on commodities markets .
“ How much money does the Federal Reserve have ? ” asked Rogers .
“ I know they can run their printing presses forever , but that is not good for the world .
Inflation is not good for the world .
A collapsing currency is not good for the world .
It means worse recession in the end .
. . .
I would abolish the Federal Reserve . ”
Neo -conservative talk show host Glenn Beck has also assailed the Federal Reserve for its role in the financial crisis .
On September 15 , Beck had a lively debate about who exactly owns the Federal Reserve .
“ The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with the government , ” said Beck .
“ It ’s a separate , global banking system .
. . .
And when everyone was meeting with our Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson , I thought to myself : ‘ Who the hell is representing us , the American people ? ”
Ron Paul financial advisor Paul Schiff responded : “ The Fed got us into this mess .
It drives me crazy to see Alan Greenspan on television talking about this ‘ 100 year flood , ’ like the events that are taking place today are random and have nothing to do with his monetary policy .
He blew up the bubble , and now it ’s burst . ”
Wall Street Journal editorial writer Steven Moore added : “ And by the way , who elected Ben Bernanke ?
Who elected Alan Greenspan ? ”
Now is the time for Americans to fan the flames .
Call your congressman and two senators and ask them to support Paul ’s bill , which would abolish the Fed .
There can be no end to these manufactured financial crises until the government gets rid of the Fed and replaces it with honest , debt - free money .

( Issue # 41 , October 13 , 2008 )
As of commit 5 fa0457 ( on Thanksgiving Day 2008 , nonetheless ) , Edge Rails is getting work done on having plugins as engines .
An engine ( as of now ) is defined as a plugin that has an app / folder , which includes controllers , helpers , models and views .
There ’s also support for plugin routes at this moment .
As of the commit mentioned above , Rails engines are not yet app slices .
A slice , at least in my opinion , contains its own assets ( public / ) and its own migrations .
In essence , a slice would have the same structure as a regular Rails app .
Not sure what the core guys have planned , but also having support for these two would greatly improve on the value of writing engines .
This replaces the old components framework , and paves the way for a new way of writing re-usable Rails plugins .
For example , the 15 - minute blog screencast can easily be reworked to be an engine and re-used within multiple apps .
You can also write engines for audio , video , maybe a wiki engine and so on .
We ’ve been working on the problem of sharing code between multiple apps for quite some time now at Intridea , and I ’ve also been talking about it a lot at RailsConf Europe with Michael Bleigh and at Bay Area Ruby meetups .
The commits I ’m noticing in core are great , hopefully soon there will be some more relevant work into officially namespacing the new code so that engines are distinct from plugins externally ; storing them in vendor / engines or app / engines would also be good — a clean codebase is always something to look forward to .
Interesting fact : Merb ’s had this for a while 🙂
Well , that locks up the cranky old lady vote .
I think it 's funny that after all that tsoris she is voting for Obama .
Wonder if Fox will still let her on ?
Enlarge By Melissa Golden for USA TODAY Wendy Blackwell , head of recruiting for Alberta 's employment and immigration agency , speaks to immigrants in the U.S. on Tuesday about working in Alberta at a job fair in Chantilly , Va. CHANTILLY , Va .  Fawad Rehman can't wait to show his adoptive country his entrepreneurial streak .
Rehman , an immigrant from Pakistan , plans to start a business school , similar to the one his family runs back home , and a construction business .
A big obstacle stands in the way , though :
He does n't know which country will adopt him , the United States or Canada .
Rehman , 29 , an information technology consultant who lives in Columbia , Md. , is in this country on a temporary H - 1B visa , the kind issued to skilled workers for up to six years .
He wants to become a permanent resident .
But he is n't sure if or when that will happen .
So , about a month ago , he applied to become a permanent resident in the province of Alberta , Canada , through a special program that fast - tracks applications from skilled immigrants in the United States .
If he qualifies , he could be approved in less than a year .
In the United States , that could take at least three years .
And it 's not a sure thing , because an employer must sponsor the worker .
" I want to start these businesses , " Rehman says .
" But I 'm not trying here yet because I do n't know if I will be here permanently . "
At a time when the immigration debate in the U.S. is tied to national security and tightening borders , Alberta is urging immigrants to cross over and come north .
Since the Alberta government started recruiting immigrants in the USA in April , it has aggressively courted people such as Rehman , who are here on H - 1 or E - 3 visas for specialized work in technology , health care and other fields .
Alberta needs to fill high - demand jobs , including pharmacists , iron workers and architects .
The province , which has a population of about 3.3 million , is experiencing explosive population and economic growth , particularly in oil and natural gas production .
" It 's virtually full employment in Alberta , " says Gary Mar , Alberta 's official representative to the United States .
Skilled immigrants in the USA are attractive because they have North American work experience , know the culture , speak English and assimilate quickly , he says .
In the U.S. , the federal government handles immigration .
In Canada , provinces have some authority for the skilled workers they recruit , says Wendy Blackwell of Alberta 's Ministry of Employment and Immigration .
On Monday , Alberta immigration officials held an information session for about 200 immigrants at the Canadian Embassy in Washington .
They were at an area job fair here Tuesday and planned to attend one in Maryland today .
They have traveled to Houston , Chicago , Philadelphia and Palo Alto , Calif . , and will be in New York City next month .
So far , about 500 people have submitted initial applications for permanent residency , Blackwell says .
The program appeals to skilled immigrants who are frustrated with the U.S. immigration system , she says .
Getting permanent status here can take years , and some immigrants complain because their spouses are n't allowed to work .
Alberta 's program grants eligible applicants and their families permanent residency in six to 12 months and allows spouses to work .
Those interested do n't need to secure a job before applying .
" People say it 's so difficult for them here , " she says .
" The people who have been coming to see us have been the well - educated , people that are concerned about the way the U.S. economy is going , people that really want to start looking at other options . "
Saskatchewan , the province east of Alberta , also is growing rapidly and needs workers , says Rob Norris , the minister responsible for immigration .
It , too , is considering recruiting skilled immigrants in the USA , he says .
Jeff Lande is senior vice president at the Information Technology Association of America , a trade group that lobbies for more visas for skilled workers and legal permanent residents , known as green - card holders .
He believes most immigrants are n't leaving willingly .
" If they have the option of staying in America , where they have established roots and jobs and contacts , chances are they would , " he says .
" Because they can not get that green card , they look at options elsewhere . "
Peter Njoroge , 26 , visited Alberta 's booth at the job fair .
He came to the USA from Kenya as a refugee in 2001 and says he 's upset by the pace of the immigration process .
He 's not eligible for Alberta 's program because he's not on a skilled - worker visa , but Blackwell says people like him might get temporary worker visas that could lead to permanent residency .
" I love the U.S. , " he says , " but if it means my life 's going to get better by living in Canada and getting the process taken care of , I 'll definitely look into it . "

On the occasion of Veterans Day , Facing South last week had a post up about veterans in the South and veteran care .
Part of the post was a list of the “ 10 Cities with Highest Percentage of Veterans ” .
Nine turn out to be in the South .
It made me curious : Southern cities with a high percentage of veterans , those can’t have been the most promising locales for the Obama surge , can they ?
The lone non-Southern city was the conservative redoubt of Colorado Springs , after all .
Looking up the results for the counties in question yielded an unexpected mish - mash of votes , however .
First , here is the list of the top 10 cities and the counties they are in – note that in Virginia , the cities are their own counties .
( For a methodological note , see footnote 1 ) . )
Table 1 : Top 10 cities with highest percentage of veterans in 2000
Now for the election results from 2004 and this year in those top 10 cities that had the highest share of veterans in 2000 ( respectively the counties they are in ) .
As said , it ’s a very mixed picture :
Table 2 : Top 10 cities with highest percentage of veterans in 2000 ( resp. the county they are in ) : how did they vote in 2004 and 2008 ?
In 2004 , George Bush won five of these cities / counties , and John Kerry won five as well .
The margins varied from a 35 % Bush lead to a 25 % Kerry lead .
When comparing the results in these counties with the results of the states they are in , it looks like they were actually relatively Kerry - friendly grounds .
In six of the ten , Kerry did better in the county than he did in the state it was in , and in almost all of those by 10 % or more .
Conversely , there were just two counties where GWB won by a margin that was higher by double digits than the one he led by in the state overall .
In 2008 , seven out of the ten cities / counties in this Veteran Top 10 went for Obama , by anything between 1 % and 43 % .
In just two of them did McCain win comfortably ; El Paso county in Colorado , where Colorado Springs is , being one of the two .
Also in seven out of ten cases , the county was more Obama - friendly than the state it was in , and again usually by double digits .
Top 10 cities with highest percentage of veterans in 2000 , resp .
the counties they are in : what was the swing to Obama ?
This table makes the implied comparison explicit : by how much did the margin between the Democrat and the Republican change ?
In every one of these counties , Obama did better than Kerry — or McCain worse than Bush , however you want to put it .
Whether Obama ’s lead was larger than Kerry ’s , or his deficit smaller than Kerry ’s , or the county actually gave Obama the lead when Kerry had lost ; the swing was universal .
This of course is not in itself surprising , even taking McCain ’s expected appeal to military veterans into account , since the same holds true for 78 % of counties nationwide .
But that ’s where the third column comes in : in every one of these counties , the swing was as large or larger than in the state it was in .
E.g. in Montgomery County , Tennessee , there was a 9 % swing toward Obama , even as the state overall swung ever so slightly to McCain .
In North Carolina there was an overall 12 % swing to Obama – but there was a 22 % swing in veteran - heavy Cumberland County .
What does this mean ?
Well , you ca n’t extrapolate the voting behavior of veterans from the voting patterns in the towns or counties they live in .
That ’s a tricky kind of conflation : just think of all those poor states that strongly lean Republican , but in which the lower - income groups in turn tend to be a lot more Democratic again .
Top 10 cities or not , veterans still clearly constitute a minority in these places .
To isolate the veteran vote , the exit polls remain your best bet .
Nationally , 54 % of veterans voted for McCain , making for a 10 - point McCain lead when Obama led by the same numbers among non-vets .
Bush had led by 16 points in 2004 , so the swing among veterans was 6 points , which was a little smaller than the 9 point swing nationally – if still enough to make for a fairly even spread of votes between the two candidates this time .
There ’s something of a paradox , in short .
Veterans , who overall tend to lean somewhat ( if not overwhelmingly )
Republican , apparently live in the highest concentrations in cities and counties which do not .
And which swung especially strongly to Obama this year .
Is it a question of those places tending to be low - income counties ?
What other correlations could there be ?
One thing this does mean is that there ’s no reason to assume that centres of veteran population are conservative bulwarks .
Colorado Springs is actually the exception .
So next time you hear a pundit opine on election eve that Obama will have a hard time making progress in , say , Virginia Beach because it ’s a military bastion , do n’t panic .
( Obama lost Virginia Beach by just 1 % , enjoying an 18 - point swing that was above - average even for Virginia . )

1 ) On a methodological note , one downside is that the Top 10 Cities list is based on the Census data from 2000 – so for the corresponding numbers by county , where differing , I ’ve also used the 2000 data in the US Census Bureau Fact Sheets .
Aside from other demographic changes since then , that means that veterans of the current Iraq war are not included .
The US Census Bureau has conducted a more regular American Community Survey , which also includes data on veteran populations , but they were only conducted in selected counties ; and although the Bureau ’s website provides a ranking of states by percentage of veterans for 2006 , there ’s no corresponding ranking of top counties , neither nationally nor by state .
( There ’s a map , though . )
SEATTLE , Nov. 16 ( UPI ) --
The Seattle Parks and Recreation board has decided the city is large enough and diverse enough to include those who like to bare it all in public .
Parks commissioners have dropped an effort to have those who go nude in the parks charged with criminal trespass , The Seattle Times reported .
They even said they will ask officials to consider making one of the public beaches clothing optional .

A large crowd attended Thursday night 's meeting , a spokeswoman told the newspaper .
Most of them , apparently , opposed criminalizing nudity .
The plan was introduced after police received complaints about the World Naked Bike Ride July 12 .
The event , publicizing dependency on oil , began in Gas Works Park , where the riders stripped to the buff and painted their bodies before taking off on a ride through the city .
Dewey Potter , the parks spokeswoman , said Seattle has no laws governing public undress .
Washington state bans public nudity only if it offends someone or is considered a hazard .
Wellesley College economist Karl Case , the “ Case ” in the widely followed S&P / Case - Shiller index of U.S. housing prices , thinks that the housing market may be near a bottom .
If he ’s right , financial firms may be able to breathe a sigh of relief .
At its most recent reading for June , the Case - Shiller index was 19 % below its [… ]
The site maps the state - by - state prevalence of flu Google 's philanthropic arm Google.org has released a new site that tracks the incidence of flu in the US based on terms used in Google searches .
The system uses aggregated , anonymous results from searches for flu - related terms and plots their locations .
The approach , validated against Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) flu records , provides timely data that could be two weeks ahead of government figures .
The site , which is free to use , will pass the early - warning data to the CDC .
Hundreds of billions of Google searches from 2003 onwards were used to develop the model , which was then compared with CDC data on outbreaks .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year , " Google said in their official blog on the topic .
" We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu - like symptoms each week . "
Traditional survey techniques employed by the CDC take about two weeks to precisely identify outbreaks , and Google hopes that its data , based on a stream of current searches , will serve as an early warning system that the CDC can then act upon .

Huge foe of global warming efforts is ousted from post John Byrne
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This Automakers ' closest friend kicked out of chairmanship
It 's the end of an era -- Michigan Democrat John Dingell has been officially toppled from his post as head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
In a secret ballot , Dingell was voted out by the Democrats 137 - 122 and replaced with Rep. Henry Waxman , a notable critic and aggressive investigator of the Bush Administration as chairman of the House Oversight Committee .
The vote is a victory for environmentalists and a huge new blow for the US auto industry .
Dingell was one of the auto industry 's biggest supporters -- his wife Debbie is a lobbyist for General Motors and is a descendant of the founding family -- and a consistent for of tighter fuel efficiency [ CAFE ] standards for automobiles .
Dingell and his wife are pictured above right .
In effect , Dingell was probably the biggest Democratic opponent to efforts to tighten fuel economy standards as a means of combating now accepted global warming concerns .
Waxman is younger than the long - serving Dingell , who is near to becoming the longest serving House member in history .
Waxman is 69 ; Dingell is 82 .
" The ascension of Waxman , a wily environmentalist , recasts a committee that Dingell has chaired since 1981 with an eye toward protecting the domestic auto industry in his native Michigan , " Politico noted Thursday .
" The Energy and Commerce Committee has principal jurisdiction over many of President - elect Barack Obama 's top legislative priorities , including energy , the environment and health care . "
" Seniority is important , but it should not be a grant of property rights to be chairman for three decades or more , " Waxman told reporters after the vote .
Astronomers have taken direct images of a three - planet solar system around a distant star , using a revolutionary technique that may one day lead to the discovery of an Earth - like planet that can harbour life .
All three planets are orbiting a star known as HR 8799 , which is 130 light years from Earth and is just visible to the eye in the constellation of Pegasus .
A team of British and American astronomers detected the planets using the Gemini North and Keck Observatory telescopes on Hawaii .
The planets are larger than Jupiter , the biggest planet in our solar system , and orbit too close to their sun to support life .
The images confirm that there are other solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy .

Astronomers took the images of the planets in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum using a technique called adaptive optics to eliminate the interference and turbulence that the Earth 's atmosphere causes .
" Until now , when astronomers discover new planets around a star , all we see are wiggly lines on a graph of the star 's velocity or brightness .
Now we have an actual picture showing the planets themselves , and that makes things very interesting , " said Bruce Macintosh , a team member from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in California .
Astronomers were hoping to eventually take images and measurements of Earth - like planets .
" After all these years , it 's amazing to have a picture showing not one but three planets .
The discovery of the HR 8799 system is a crucial step on the road to the ultimate detection of another Earth , " he said .
Astronomers have detected about 200 " exoplanets " orbiting distant stars , but they are normally discovered by measuring the dip in luminosity of the star as a planet passes in front of it .
The planets , which formed about 60 million years ago , are still young enough to glow from the heat that was released as they contracted after their initial formation .
The brightness and colours that the scientists analysed indicate that the planets are between seven and 10 times the mass of Jupiter .
The star HR 8799 has about 1.5 times the mass of our Sun , is five times more luminous , and is younger .
Infrared observations by satellites have shown evidence of a massive disk of cold dust orbiting the star , according to Professor Ben Zuckerman , from the University of California at Los Angeles .
" HR 8799 's dust disk stands out as one of the most massive in orbit around any star within 300 light years of Earth , " Professor Zuckerman said .
The study is published in the journal Science alongside another study that has added another exoplanet to the list of planets found outside our solar system .
A separate team detected the planet orbiting the star Formalhaut .
While most people were focused on the presidential elections , far more interesting IMO was the US Senate elections and the “ race for 60 ” .
Briefly , of the 100 US Senators , 50 are required for a majority but 60 are required for a “ filibuster proof majority ” through which any sort of legislation can be rammed through regardless of dissent from the opposing party .
As of midnight of election day itself , the polls stood at 56 Democratic Senators ( including independants Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman in the count ) to 40 Republican Senators with 4 election races on the knife edge .
As of today , Oregon has been called for the Democrats , Alaska is still counting mail in and absentee votes , Minnesota is going into a mandatory recount and Georgia is going into a mandatory runoff .
There are signs that Alaska could be called for the Democrats in which cases the Democrats would have already grabbed two for two of the swing seats .
Where it gets really interesting is if Minnesota is either called for the Democrats or is still mired in recount and legal woes by December 2nd , at which time Georgia will hold it ’s runoff voting .
If this is the case , Georgia might just become the most unanticipated important election of the year in terms of how much effect each voter could have .
If Georgia becomes the battleground for the filibuster proof majority , expect the see the might of both the Democratic and Republican National Committee to descend with full force for the biggest get out to vote efforts ever seen .
There are a few things that make me optimistic about the Democrats ’ chances in Georgia .
For one , the Democrats have conclusively proved that their ground game far outranked the Republicans in the general election and all that infrastructure is still in place .
For two , the most lucrative pool of voters to chase after is those of the Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley who drew support away from the Democratic candidate more than the Republican one .
A series of relatively unlikely series of events need to happen for such a scenario to occur but it seems to be not beyond the pale to think that such an election could end up happening .
If so , be prepared for a piece of political theatre that will be to the general election what Applejack is to cider .
It ’s gold rush , even at premium Text Size : | NAGPUR : The global slowdown brought a Dhanteras bonanza for Indian consumers .
Gold prices crashed right amidst the festive season and consumers rushed to make Dhanteras purchases .
So heavy has been the demand that in Nagpur gold was being quoted at a premium of Rs 400 against its basic market rate of Rs 12,000 per tola ( 10 grams ) on Saturday .
Traders say the situation will continue on Sunday too .
World Gold Council claimed that 50 tonnes of gold was sold in the last 20 days in the country .
Gold is weak in the international market for a host of factors .
Firstly , financial institutions in the West are resorting to selling off their gold holdings to tide over the liquidity crisis .
��
�This has proved a boon for Indian consumer as the yellow metal has become cheaper at home , ��� said Ashok Minawala president of All India Gems and Jewellery Federation .
Many harried speculators in the US had squared off their trades , pulling down the rates too , add traders .
Gold rates fell to $ 699 per ounce on Friday before settling at $ 732 .
This was a god - sent for Indian consumers , who are eager to buy gold on Dhanteras .
Just before the auspicious day , prices dwindled to Rs 12,000 per tola ( 10 grams ) as compared to an all - time high of Rs 14,000 .
Even traders who were expecting a dull Dhanteras had their cash registers ringing .
In fact , jewellers are now faced with a supply crunch and wholesalers are charging a premium over and above the base price , which is calculated by adding the local taxes to the dollar rates .
Nilesh Rathi of SMS Bhav , an online rate information agency , said that against the wholesale price of Rs 12,100 in Mumbai which is the centre , in Nagpur it is being quoted at Rs 12,400 , while at some counters it is as high as Rs 12,600 .
There is a bank holiday on Sunday , so are bullion traders closed for Diwali , which has put tremendous pressure on the supply side leading to the premium .
The rates in bigger centres like Mumbai , Delhi or Ahmedabad are between Rs 12,100 to 12,150 due to the proximity of supply points .
Even many of the couriers who ferry gold to smaller centres are on a vacation which has added to the supply shortage .
It is the middle class buyer who is driving the market .
The sixth pay commission arrears has brought a huge funds in the market .
So did several employees in the private sector get bonus .
�� �A windfall gain coupled with low rates has buoyed the buying , ��� said Ajay Shah of Shreeji Jewellers .
Kumudini Kadhao , a housewife had no plans to buy gold this year , had the rates not fallen .
�� �I feel the rates are comfortable for me to purchase .
It has been a tradition in our house to buy gold on Dhanteras and the low prices have surely helped .���
Sudhanshu Mishra , an executive in a private firm said , says he could buy one more ornament for his wife due to the low prices .
Otherwise , he had plans to buy just for namesake this Dhanteras .
So were Ravindra and Pratima Dewtale , happy over the fall in prices .
��
�It has been a Dhanteras gift for us , ��� said the couple .

Bush steps up fight over congressional authority Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
The Bush administration is raising the stakes in a court fight that could change the balance of power between the White House and Congress .
Justice Department lawyers said Wednesday that they will soon ask a federal appeals court not to force the president 's top advisers to comply with congressional subpoenas next month .
President Bush argues Congress does n't have the authority to demand information from his aides .
U.S. District Judge John Bates strongly rejected that stance last month , ordering former White House counsel Harriet Miers to testify and White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten to turn over documents related to the firing of federal prosecutors .
It was a historic loss for the Bush administration , a stinging ruling in the first such case ever to make it to the courts .
The House Judiciary Committee responded swiftly , demanding Miers appear Sept. 11 as it investigates whether federal prosecutors were inappropriately fired as part of a White House effort to politicize the Justice Department .
The Bush administration had already indicated it would appeal but Justice Department lawyers said Wednesday that they will ask the court to step in quickly and temporarily put Miers ' appearance on hold while the appeal plays out .
It 's a risky move for an administration that has spent years trying to strengthen the power of the presidency .
If the appeals court refuses to temporarily block the testimony , it would essentially be endorsing Bates ' ruling against the Bush administration .
Miers likely would have to comply with the subpoena , setting a precedent that would give Congress new teeth in its investigations and weaken future presidents .
On the other hand , if the appeals court temporarily blocks Miers ' testimony , it could allow the Bush administration to run out the clock before a new Congress comes to Washington and the case becomes moot .
In that situation , Bates ' order will have been weakened and future presidents will have more wiggle room .
The Bush administration could have taken other steps to avoid a showdown at the appeals court .
Even if it appealed Bates ' ruling , it could have negotiated a deal with Congress in which Miers and Bolten provided some information voluntarily and lawmakers agreed to withdraw the lawsuit .
But House counsel Irv Nathan said negotiations have been " completely useless . "
" We have not found willing partners on the other side of the table , " Nathan said in court Wednesday , telling Bates that " we 're being dunced around here . "
Justice Department attorney Carl Nichols called those statements misleading but declined to elaborate .
He said the Justice Department would file documents with the appeals court by Thursday asking the judges to step in .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
The rejection of gay marriage by California voters has unleashed a hurricane of protest on the Internet , with some supporters venting their anger and others planning national demonstrations .
Amy Balliett , 26 , used her lunch break last Friday to start a website -- www.jointheimpact.com -- to call for coordinated action across the United States this weekend .
In a few days , more than 1 million people have visited her site and dozens of marches and meetings are now planned for 1:30 p.m. EST ( 1830 GMT ) on Saturday .
By the evening jointheimpact.com was created , it was visited 10,000 times .
By Sunday , there were 50,000 visits per hour and the computer running the site crashed .
It has moved computers twice since in an effort to keep up .
“ Why do we have to wait for someone to step up and say let ’s do a protest ? ”
Balliett remembered thinking after her friend , Willow Witte , posted a blog about California .
“ Over email we decided to do it . ”
California ’s Supreme Court opened the way to gay marriage in May , putting it among a handful of states , provinces and European countries that allow same - sex couples to marry .
But after a $ 70 million - plus campaign , a measure to ban gay marriage in California passed in a vote held alongside the U.S. presidential and congressional elections on November 4 , stunning a community that had expected its first major ballot box win .
Balliett ’s plan is to create an educational dialogue but others have diverse goals or are simply speaking out as Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , text messages , blogs and websites buzz with protest about the vote in California .
Members of the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community say they were hurt deeply and want to bring their civil rights argument -- that same - sex couples deserve the same treatment as others -- to a national audience .
“ It took the rights being taken away from people to really get across that it ’s not a California issue .
It ’s a nationwide issue , ” said Brandon Williamson , who was about to start his own protest website when he found Balliett ’s and joined forces as publicist .
‘ IT ’S MASSIVE ’
Gay marriage is legal in two U.S. states , Massachusetts and Connecticut , where court - approved same - sex weddings began on Wednesday .
But dozens of states have laws that limit marriage to a man and a woman .
This month ’s election also saw bans on gay marriage pass in Florida and Arizona , while Arkansas stopped gay couples from adopting children .
This is not the first time gay marriage proponents or their adversaries have used technology .
Both sides of California ’s Proposition 8 , the gay marriage ban , used websites and more .
But the ability of the Internet to organize grass - roots movements has been especially clear since the ban ’s passage .
Balliett , whose job is publicizing websites through searches , says she has never seen anything like it .
Civil rights campaigners agree .
“ It ’s massive , ” said Scott Robbe , a gay rights veteran based in Wisconsin , adding that election campaigns from Howard Dean to Barack Obama had paved the way for the civil rights movement to use the Internet on a massive scale .
Balliett directs volunteer organizers to start MySpace and Facebook sites for their own cities but the Internet action is about more than her efforts .
The Facebook group “ 1,000,000 Million Strong Against Newly Passed Prop 8 ” has about 68,000 members , for instance .
The group ’s creators identify themselves as high school students .

X - ray reveals cell phone in death row inmate 's rectum Inmate also had accessories hidden in Bible ; lawmaker criticizes system
AUSTIN — Another day , another cell phone found on Texas ' death row .
Prison staff conducting a shakedown of the row Friday found a cell phone secreted in the rectum of convicted murderer Henry Skinner at the Polunsky Unit in Livingston , said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Michelle Lyons .
They first found two SIM cards , or memory chips , in Skinner 's Bible , she said .
Because they suspected he also had a cell phone , they took him to the infirmary , did an X - ray and found the cell phone .
' Just very alarming '
The matter was turned over to the prison system 's inspector general , John Moriarty , for investigation .
It was the second cell phone found on death row in a matter of days , and the 14th since last month .
" It 's just very alarming .
It 's very disturbing , and we must be diligent and just demand that it be fixed once and for all , " said Senate Criminal Justice Committee Chairman John Whitmire , D - Houston , who has been the target of a death threat by a different death - row inmate , Richard Tabler .
" I think I 've reached the conclusion the people that operate that system need to be held accountable , " Whitmire said .
" Somebody was definitely negligent in keeping contraband out of our prison system . "
A spokeswoman for GOP Gov. Rick Perry , however , said the fact the contraband was discovered shows the effectiveness of the system .
Perry appoints the board members who oversee the prison system .
" The fact they found the phones is proof positive the processes they now have in place to identify and apprehend contraband are working , " said Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle .
After the lockdown
Prison officials have said it 's difficult to keep contraband out of the hands of inmates , who are allowed visitors and a number of possessions .
A prison lockdown was instituted in October after officials found 10 death row inmates had made nearly 2,800 calls from a cell phone linked to Tabler , who had himself called Whitmire .
A lockdown means all programs cease , offenders are confined to their housing areas , visitations are suspended and inmates ' property is searched .
Before the latest discoveries , the lockdown had yielded on death row alone 12 cell phones , nine chargers , three cell phone batteries , seven SIM cards and two weapons , Lyons said .
Hours after the lockdown was lifted Wednesday , officials found a cell phone and other contraband in the possession of death row inmate Mark Stroman .
Concern over that discovery was heightened when officials Thursday said Tabler had made death threats against Whitmire and Austin American - Statesman reporter Mike Ward , who also had received calls from the inmate .
A death row cell phone could be used to order a hit by someone on the outside .
Skinner , the most recent inmate to be found with a phone , was sent to death row in the murder of his girlfriend and her two sons at their Pampa home in 1993 .

Bush wants to hand out party favors to all of Big Oil executives before he leaves office and one last brutal assault on the environment .
He is trying to justify it by saying Clinton did the same thing .
The end of this error ca n’t come soon enough .
What he has planned for Utah is tantamount to plundering 6 million acres for commercial exploitation .
Gale Norton has to be happy .
In 2003 , Ms. Norton , then President Bush ’s secretary of the interior ( and now a senior oil executive at Royal Dutch Shell ) , struck a deal with the governor of Utah that would open about 3 million pristine acres of federal land to oil and gas drilling .
Environmental groups and the courts managed to keep the drillers at bay .
No longer .
On Tuesday , the bureau announced that it would soon begin selling oil and gas leases – essentially the right to drill – in some of the most beautiful and fragile areas .
It ’s no wonder that Conservationists and Environmental groups are upset – all of this is being done without consulting with the National Park Service .
They plan to just auction off over two dozen leases around Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park , the bureau will be putting in jeopardy not only the water source but the air also .
This sort of pillage would be hard to justify even if Utah ’s reserves were large enough to make a difference , which they are not .
The Energy Information Administration says that Utah has 2.5 percent of the country ’s known natural gas reserves and less than 1 percent of its known oil reserves .
And even if those reserves were worth going after , it would still be essential to protect areas of special cultural , scenic and recreational value .
Last but not least , Keith weighs in on Bush ’s attempt to sell mining leases .
I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I had forgotten to make .
I found the number and dialed it .
A man answered , saying , “ Hello . ”
I politely said , “ This is Jason Braemore .
Could I please speak with Rachel Carter ? ”
Suddenly , the phone was slammed down on me - I could n’t believe that anyone could be so rude .
I tracked down Rachel ’s correct number and called her - I had transposed the last two digits of her phone number .
After hanging up with her , I decided to call the “ wrong ” number again
When the same guy answered the phone , I yelled , “ You ’re a scumbag ! ” and hung up .
I wrote his number down with the word “ scumbag ” next to it , and put it on my speed dial .
Every couple of weeks , when I was paying bills or had a really bad day , I ’d call him up and yell , “ You ’re a scumbag ! ”
It always cheered me up !
When Caller ID came to our area , I thought my therapeutic “ scumbag ” calling would have to stop .
So , I called his number and said , “ Hi , this is John Smith from the Telephone Company .
I ’m just calling to see if you ’re familiar with the Caller ID program ? ”
He yelled , “ NO ! ” and slammed the phone down .
I quickly called him back and said , “ That ’s because you ’re a scumbag ! ”
One day I was at the store , getting ready to pull into a parking spot .
Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for .
I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot .
The idiot ignored me .
I noticed a “ For Sale ” sign in his car window so I wrote down his number .
A couple of days later , right after calling the first scumbag , I thought I had better call the BMW scumbag too .
I said , “ Is this the man with the black BMW for sale ? ”
“ Yes , it is . ”
“ Can you tell me where I can see it ? ”
“ Yes , I live at 1969 West 35th Street .
It ’s a yellow house , and the car ’s parked right out in front . ”
“ What ’s your name ? ” I asked .
“ My name is Don Hanson , ” he said .
“ When ’s a good time to catch you , Don ? ”
“ I ’m home every evening after five . ”
“ Listen , Don , can I tell you something ? ”
“ Yes ? ”
“ Don , you ’re a scumbag . ”
Then I hung up , and added his number to my speed dial .
Now , when I had a problem , I had two scumbags to call
But after several months of calling them , it was n’t as enjoyable as it used to be .
So , I came up with an idea .
I called Scumbag # 1
“ Hello . ”
“ You ’re a scumbag ! ” ( But I did n’t hang up )
“ Are you still there ? ” he asked .
“ Yeah , ” I said .
“ Stop calling me , ” he screamed .
“ Make me , ” I said .
“ Who are you ? ” he asked .
“ My name is Don Hanson . ”
“ Yeah ?
Where do you live ? ”
“ Scumbag , I live at 1969 West 35th Street , a yellow house , with my black Beamer parked in front . ”
He said , “ I ’m coming over right now , Don .
And you had better start saying your prayers . ”
I said , “ Yeah , like I ’m really scared , scumbag . ”
Then I called Scumbag # 2 .
“ Hello ? ” he said .
“ Hello , scumbag , ” I said .
He yelled , “ If I ever find out who you are , I ’ll … ”
“ You ’ll what ? ” I said .
“ I ’ll kick your ass , ” he exclaimed .
I answered , “ Well , scumbag , here ’s your chance .
I ’m coming over right now . ”
Then I hung up and immediately called the police , saying that I lived at 1969 West 35th Street , and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover .
Then I called CKVU Channel 13 News about the gang war going down on West 35th Street .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to 35th Street .
There I saw two scumbags beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars , a police helicopter , and news crew .
Now I feel a lot better

It ’s not something that could necessarily work in the US because taxes ( of this kind ) are done at a state level but it ’s an interesting idea .
Over here we ’ve noticed nervous sellers already and in general people are cutting back on holiday spending .
With the crisis we ’re in a tough spot in that we need people to save money to help keep cash in banks but at the same time , our economies rely on spending and lots of it .
A massive dry spell of shopping is not going to help so maybe somewhere in the middle is n’t such a bad idea .
Cutting a few points is not going to bring the end to the tax revenue stream but might help during this very rough patch .
Plans to raise the top rate of income tax for high earners from 40 p to 45 p in the pound will be announced today as Gordon Brown makes a decisive break with the policies of the Blair era .
In his crucial mini-Budget , the Chancellor Alistair Darling will say that the higher rate would be introduced after the next general election – so as not to break Labour ’s manifesto pledges since 1997 not to raise income tax rates .
The proposed new top rate is expected to apply on incomes above £ 150,000 .
Mr Darling will that “ fair ” tax increases will be needed to bring the public finances back into balance in the medium term .
He will disclose that government borrowing will rocket to almost £ 200bn over the next two years to fund an £ 18bn “ fiscal stimulus ” – including tax cuts – designed to ensure a “ short and shallow ” recession .

I remember taking an operating systems class in college and marveling at the fact that operating system design seemed less about elegant engineering and more about [ what I viewed at the time as ] performance hacks .
I saw a similar sentiment recently captured by Eric Florenzano in his post It 's Caches All the Way Down where he starts describing how a computer works to a friend and ends up talking about the various layers of caching from CPU registers to L2 caches to RAM and so on .
At the end of his post Eric Florenzano asks the following question I 've often heard at work and in developer forums like programming .
reddit
That 's what struck me .
When you come down to it , computers are just a waterfall of different caches , with systems that determine what piece of data goes where and when .
For the most part , in user space , we do n't care about much of that either .
When writing a web application or even a desktop application , we do n't much care whether a bit is in the register , the L1 or L2 cache , RAM , or if it 's being swapped to disk .
We just care that whatever system is managing that data , it 's doing the best it can to make our application fast .
But then another thing struck me .
Most web developers DO have to worry about the cache .
We do it every day .
Whether you 're using memcached or velocity or some other caching system , everyone 's manually moving data from the database to a cache layer , and back again .
Sometimes we do clever things to make sure this cached data is correct , but sometimes we do some braindead things .
We certainly manage the cache keys ourselves and we come up with systems again and again to do the same thing .
Does this strike anyone else as inconsistent ?
For practically every cache layer down the chain , a system ( whose algorithms are usually the result of years and years of work and testing ) automatically determines how to best utilize that cache , yet we do not yet have a good system for doing that with databases .
Why do you think that is ?
Is it truly one of the two hard problems of computer science ?
Is it impossible to do this automatically ?
I honestly do n't have the answers , but I 'm interested if you do .
Eric is simultaneously correct and incorrect in his statements around caching and database layers .
Every modern database system has caching mechanisms that are transparent to the developer .
For LAMP developers there is the MySQL Query Cache which transparently caches the text of SELECT query and the results so that the next time the query is performed it is fetched from memory .
For WISC developers there are the SQL Server 's Data and Procedure caches which store query plans and their results to prevent having to repeatedly perform expensive computations or go to disk to fetch recently retrieved data .
As with everything in programming , developers can eke more value out of these caches by knowing how they work .
For example , using parameterized queries or stored procedures significantly reduces the size of the procedure cache in SQL Server .
Tony Rogerson wrote an excellent post where he showed how switching from SQL queries based on string concatenation to parameterized queries can reduce the size of a procedure cache from over 1 Gigabyte to less than 1 Megabyte .
This is similar to understanding how garbage collection or memory allocation works teaches developers to favor recycling objects instead of creating new ones and favoring arrays over linked lists to reduce memory fragmentation .
Even though there are caching mechanisms built into relational databases that are transparent to the developer , they typically are n't sufficient for high performance applications with significant amounts of read load .
The biggest problem is hardware limitations .
A database server will typically have twenty to fifty times more hard drive storage capacity than it has memory .
Optimistically this means a database server can cache about 5 % to 10 % of its entire data in memory before having to go to disk .
In comparison , lets look at some statistics from a popular social networking site ( i.e. Facebook )
48 % of active users log - in daily
49.9 average pages a day viewed per unique user
How much churn do you think the database cache goes through if half of the entire user base is making data requests every day ?
This explains why Facebook has over 400 memcached hosts storing over 5 Terabytes of data in - memory instead of simply relying on the query caching features in MySQL .
This same consideration applies for the majority of social media and social networking sites on the Web today .
So the problem is n't a lack of transparent caching functionality in relational databases today .
The problem is the significant differences in the storage and I/O capacity of memory versus disk in situations where a large percentage of the data set needs to be retrieved regularly .
In such cases , you want to serve as much data from memory as possible which means going beyond the physical memory capacity of your database server and investing in caching servers .

Nation ’s Most Populous County Joins — for the First Time — the Legal
Defense of Equal Protection , Fight for Marriage Equality in California
LOS ANGELES — City Attorney Dennis Herrera today hailed the passage of a motion by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors instructing the County Counsel there to take immediate steps to join litigation to uphold the equal rights of all California residents by challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 8 .
The action assures that the County of Los Angeles will be the fourth local government along with San Francisco , the City of Los Angeles and Santa Clara County to join a petition originally filed with the California Supreme Court last Wednesday arguing that the state constitution ’s equal protection provisions do not allow a bare majority of voters to use the amendment process to divest politically disfavored groups of constitutional rights .
With more than 10 million residents , Los Angeles County is the most populous county in the nation .
It had not previously been involved in the legal fight for marriage equality as a party or amici .
City Attorney Herrera , who is a lead counsel in the public sector legal effort , was first to address the five - member board in support of the motion this morning .
Said Herrera :
“ No matter what your view of same - sex marriage , the passage of Proposition 8 has pushed California to the brink of a constitutional crisis , and it ’s important to understand why .
This measure sought to do something that no constitutional amendment has ever done in our history : to strip a fundamental right from a protected class of citizens .
In doing so , it did not merely undo a narrowly disfavored Supreme Court decision .
Its effect is nowhere near so simple or elegant .
“ Rather , it upended a doctrine of separation of powers deeply rooted in our system of governance ; it trounced upon the independence of our state ’s judiciary ; and it eviscerated the most foundational principle of our state ’s constitution .
“ If allowed to stand , Prop 8 would so devastate the principle of equal protection that it could endanger the fundamental rights of any potential electoral minority — even for protected classes based on race , religion , national origin and gender .
“ It would mean that a bare majority of voters could enshrine any manner of discrimination against any unpopular group — and our state constitution would be powerless to disallow it .
“ Let us be clear : equal protection of the laws is what separates constitutional democracy from mob rule tyranny .
It is a principle reaching back eight centuries to the Magna Carta .
And it is what guided the founding of our state and our nation . ”
The motion was sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Gloria Molina .
Voting in support of the motion were : Board of Supervisors Chair Yvonne Burke and Supervisors Yaroslavsky and Molina .
Supervisors Don Knabe and Michael D. Antonovich were not present for the vote .
Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo joined Herrera and others in speaking in support of the motion .
Santa Clara County Counsel Ann M. Ravel is an additional co-counsel in the effort .
Together , the petition by local governments argues that such a sweeping redefinition of equal protection would require a constitutional revision rather than a mere amendment .
Article XVIII of the California Constitution provides that a constitutional revision may only be accomplished by a constitutional convention and popular ratification , or by legislative submission to the electorate .
The civil action by city and county governments mirrors private legal actions by the National Center for Lesbian Rights , Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred and others on behalf of same - sex couples .
Herrera has pledged to lead an aggressive effort to enlist additional support in the civil litigation from other California cities and counties .
Herrera represented San Francisco as a lead plaintiff in the original constitutional challenge filed in 2004 , which resulted in the landmark state Supreme Court decision earlier this year recognizing marriage as a fundamental right guaranteed to all Californians , “ whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples . ”
More than simply toppling a marriage exclusion that discriminated against millions of gay men and lesbians , the high court ’s May 15 , 2008 ruling established gays and lesbians as a suspect class under the California Constitution ’s equal protection clause , including it among protected classes subject to a standard of strict scrutiny for judicial review .
The City and County of San Francisco was the first government entity in American history ever to sue for marriage equality , asserting in its March 2004 constitutional challenge a broad societal interest to strike down the marriage exclusion in California statutes .
By the time the marriage cases were finally decided by the state high court more than four years later , fully twenty - one California cities and counties had joined San Francisco in support of marriage equality for same - sex partners .
In total , some 7 of the state ’s 8 largest cities united for the successful effort : Los Angeles , San Diego , San Jose , San Francisco , Long Beach , Sacramento and Oakland .
Until today , the County of Los Angeles had not taken an official position on the matter of marriage equality .
Fearing illegality , Justice Department blocked NYPD wiretaps Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This The New York Police Department and the Justice department feuded over the legal boundaries of national security wiretaps with Attorney General Michael Mukasey taking the unorthodox step of blocking a surveillance order , arguing that the NYPD 's eavesdropping would be illegal .
The dispute , revealed Thursday in the New York Times , has scrambled traditional perceptions of a Justice Department that has previously seemed willing to cast aside legal blockades for the sake of national security .
At issue are wiretaps the NYPD asked the FBI to authorize under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act aimed at suspected terrorists in the city .
The two law enforcement agencies are forced to work together to protect New York , although bureaucratic turf battles often strain the relationship .
Each agency participates in the city 's Joint Terrorism Task Force , which aims to prevent another domestic attack .
NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly wrote to Mukasey last month arguing that the FBI held its FISA warrant requests to too strict a standard in refusing to submit them to the FISA court for approval .
He alleged the decision endangered national security .
" DOJ 's internal procedures for handling domestic FISA applications are unduly constraining the ability of the New York JTTF to investigate high priority subjeccts of international terrorism investigations in the greater New York area , " Kelly wrote in a letter dated Oct. 27 .
" Consequently , the federal government is doing less than it is lawfully entitled to do to protect New York City , and the City is less safe as a result . "
Four days later , Mukasey fired back , accusing Kelly of seeking to violate FISA .
" If effect what you ask is that we disregard FISA 's legal requirements , which are rooted in the Constitution , " Mukasey wrote .
" Not only would your approach violate the law , it would also in short order make New York City and the rest of the country less safe . "
Kelly's and Mukasey 's letters ( pdfs ) were obtained and posted online by the Wall Street Journal .
Full details of the denied wiretaps are unknown because the case remains classified .
Mukasey 's letter , though , mentions several " communications facilities " the NYPD apparently wanted to eavesdrop upon .
Officials who had been briefed on the case told the Times that the requests were overly broad and included public telephones in places like train and subway stations instead of phones connected to individuals .
Obama Says McCain Would Pose a National Security Risk Obama is up in Virginia while McCain tries to hold on to battlegrounds .
Oct. 22,2008 RICHMOND , VA. , 2008 -- As Sen. Barack Obama continued to gain ground in key battleground states Wednesday , he sharpened his attacks against Sen .
John McCain and issued a grave warning that a vote for his rival could put the country at risk .
The latest Mason Dixon poll shows Obama with a 2 - point lead in Virginia , which Bush won by 10 points in 2004 .
Though he 's mainly stayed focused on the economy in these last few weeks , Obama shifted his attention to talk about an issue of paramount importance in a state that includes a naval base , a Marine headquarters and the Pentagon -- national security .
Flanked by national security experts from previous Democratic administrations , Obama told Richmond voters that a President John McCain would pose a national security risk .
" As president , he would continue the policies that have put our economy into crisis and endangered our national security , " Obama said .
The Illinois senator also sought to downplay the buzz made by his running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , at a Seattle fundraiser earlier in the week when Biden predicted America 's enemies would test a new young President Obama .
" Mark my words , it will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy , " Biden said in Seattle .
" The world is looking .
We 're about to elect a brilliant 47 - year - old senator president of the United States of America .
...
Watch , we 're gonna have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy . "
Obama dismissed the comments as " rhetorical flourishes " but added that Biden 's " core point was that the next administration is going to be tested , regardless of who it is . "
Flourishes or not , Obama sought to prove that he is the best candidate to pass the national security test by tying the economy to national security .
" We need leadership that understands the connection between our economy and our strength in the world .
We often hear about two debates -- one on national security and one on the economy -- but that is a false distinction . "
Obama sought to emphasize this distinction by renewing his call for a withdrawal from Iraq .
" We 're not going to defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries through an occupation of Iraq , " Obama said .
" We should n't keep spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqis sit on a huge surplus , " Obama said .
Obama Makes Gains in Unexpected Areas
While a recent Mason Dixon poll show that Obama has cut McCain 's sizable 43 - point lead on who 's best prepared to handle national security issues , McCain still retains a 19 - point lead .
But other numbers in Virginia work in Obama 's favor .
Obama has consistently polled well on the issue of the economy , and Virginia 's economy is struggling .
The Democratic candidate told Richmond voters today that McCain 's economic plans did more to help Wall Street than Main Street .
" Let 's be clear who Sen. McCain 's fighting for .
He 's not fighting for Joe the Plumber , he 's fighting for Joe the hedge fund manager . "
Obama also has an edge on sheer manpower in the state .
As a result of breaking his promise to enter into the public financing system , Obama has enjoyed an overwhelming fundraising advantage , and in Virginia McCain is drowning in Obama 's money .
Obama has 50 campaign offices and 200 paid staffers in Virginia to McCain 's 24 campaign offices and 50 paid staffers .
Obama is spending a quarter million dollars a day on TV ads in the state -- compared to McCain 's $ 30,000 a day .
Obama Looks for Huge Turnout in Northern Va .
Obama hopes to get an overwhelming turnout in northern Virginia where a third of the state electorate lives .
He 's been aided in that effort by Republican fumbles , such as when McCain adviser Nancy Pfotenhauer implied that northern Virginia did n't count as " real Virginia . "
" The Democrats have just come in from the District of Columbia and moved into northern Virginia , and that 's what you really see there , " Pfotenhauer told MSNBC's Chris Matthews .
" But the rest of the state , ' real Virginia , ' if you will , will be very responsive to Sen. McCain 's message . "
Obama has cited Pfotenhauer 's remark on the stump ever since , declaring in a popular line that " there are no real parts of the country or fake parts of the country . "
Obama 's Richmond visit marked the 31st time the Obama - Biden ticket has been in the state since securing the nomination .
The McCain - Palin ticket has visited the state 12 times , which has been a real source of contention among local Republicans who want McCain to spend more time there .
ABC News ' Andy Fies , Sunlen Miller , and Julia Hoppock contributed to this report .
Are the media really that annoyed with how Sarah Palin talks ?
Or is it what she 's saying ?
A quick perusal of the Internet shows that maybe it's a bit of both .
Even after surpassing all expectations on Thursday night in the debate against Joe Biden ( admittedly expectations were quite low ) , it does n't appear that Palin has many friends in the media .
No respect , I tell ya '
The late comic Rodney Dangerfield used to cock his head , grab his tie , bulge his eyes and say , " Tough crowd , I 'll tell ya , tough crowd . "
Although she is a bit more telegenic than Dangerfield , Sarah Palin could easily pull off the same routine if she were to read the nation 's editorial pages .
And according to Palin , she reads 'em .
Too much
The criticism ?
She 's too inexperienced .
She 's not up for the job .
She 's a gimmick .
She 's way too conservative .
She 's too attractive .
Regardless of the specific criticism , one thing seems to unite the critics : her voice .
That 's the common ground .
Rarely do you read a column on Palin without the author throwing in a " you betcha " or a " darn right . "
It 's great material .
It gives the very talented Tina Fey a lot to work with as she does her dead - on impersonation of the governor .
Tina Fey
And Fey delivered again last night .
Asked by Gwen Ifill ( played by Queen Latifah ) how a McCain - Palin ticket would deal with the financial crisis , Palin ( Fey ) responded :
" You know , John McCain and I , we 're a couple of mavericks .
And gosh darnit , we 're gonna take that maverick energy right to Washington and we 're gonna use it to fix this financial crisis and everything else that 's plaguin ' this great country of ours . "
Not laughing
Great comedy .
But the media are n't laughing .
They are n't the laughing sort .
But it does n't stop them from throwing in a Palin 'ism or two .
Or three .
We 'll start with the Providence Journal .
Not only do they not like the talk , they do n't like the walk .
Alaska is n't just for Alaskans , say the editors from the Ocean state .
We were not won over by her irrelevant populist rifts and appeals , the “ betchas , ” the “ darn rights , ” the references to Joe Six - Pack , hockey moms or the “ kids ’ soccer game on Saturday . ”
We were certainly not amused by her divisive pitting of energy - producing states against East Coast politicians , who by the way , have every bit as much right to oversee federal lands in Alaska as do Alaskans living next to them .
Do you think the New York Times ' Maureen Dowd has an opinion ?
Always .
And it 's scathing ...
" Being mush - mouthed helped give the patrician Bushes the common touch .
As Alistair Cooke observed , ' Americans seem to be more comfortable with Republican presidents because they share the common frailty of muddled syntax and because , when they attempt eloquence , they do tend to spout a kind of Frontier Baroque . '
" Darn right .
And that , doggone it , brings us to a shout - out for the latest virtuoso of Frontier Baroque , bless her heart , the governor of the Last Frontier .
Her reward ’s in heaven .
" At Sarah Palin ’s old church in Wasilla , they spoke in tongues .
Maybe that ’s where she picked it up . "
Dick Polman at the Philadelphia Inquirer is n't that impressed with the Palin 'isms either .
He , like many , spots a similarity between Palin and a character in a cult - classic .
" Folksy , for sure : '... go to a kid 's soccer game ... I betcha .... darn right it was the predatory lenders ... Joe six pack ... hockey moms across the nation ... a heckuva lot ... darn right we need tax relief ... now doggone it ...'
" After awhile , I started to think I was listening to Marge Gunderson , the pregnant hick cop in Fargo . "
Jon Meacham , although not nearly as brutal as others , still throws in the obligatory Palin - speak in a cover story for Newsweek .
" Perhaps Sarah Palin will somehow emerge from the hurly - burly of history as a transformative figure who was underestimated in her time by journalists who could not see , or refused to acknowledge , her virtues .
But do I think I am right in saying that Palin 's populist view of high office — hey , Vice President Six -Pack , what should we do about Pakistan ? — is dangerous ?
You betcha . "
It is safe to say that Marjorie Eagan at the Boston Herald genuinely dislikes Palin altogether .
There 's nothing Palin could do to get on Eagan 's good side .
Nothing .
Ever .
" She is perky , peppy , bubbly , one of those shiny , happy glass - half - full types whose folksy ' betchas ' and ' shout - outs ' to third - graders and winks would be welcome in the nurse wheeling you from the operating room or the flight attendant reassuring you as your jet bounces at 30,000 feet .
Her style would go over great debating for student council .
" But in a person who could be president ?
It ’s just weird , childish , silly , even patronizing , as if we voters are third - graders ourselves .
And that relentless chipperness , real or faux ?
Enough already . "
Even Peggy Noonan , over at the Wall Street Journal , was critical .
Not terribly critical of Palin , but appears to be more irritated at the McCain campaign .
" ' It 's time that normal Joe Six - Pack American is finally represented in the position of vice presidency , ' Mrs. Palin told talk - show host Hugh Hewitt .
This left me trying to imagine Abe Lincoln saying he represents ' backwoods types , ' or FDR announcing that the fading New York aristocracy deserves another moment in the sun .
I 'm not sure the McCain campaign is aware of it — it 's possible they are — but this is subtly divisive .
As for the dismissal of conservative critics of Mrs. Palin as ' Georgetown cocktail party types ' ( that was Mr. McCain ) , well , my goodness .
That is the authentic sound of the aggression , and phony populism , of the Bush White House .
Good move .
That ended well . "
Bill Curry , in the Hartford Courant , also brings up Fargo but is over - thinking this a bit .
Certainly he's not seriously believing the Palin - speak is a Rovian tactic , is he ?
" Why then did Palin take a drubbing in the polls ?
It may have to do with the very personality that brought her to the ball .
You may recognize it : it 's Marge Gunderson , from the darkly comic Coen Brothers film ' Fargo . '
For her portrayal of the small - town sheriff forever saying ' golly ' and ' you betcha , ' Frances McDormand won an Oscar .
So should Palin .
The resemblance is uncanny .
Some reporter should find out if Palin talked that way before the movie came out . "
Even across the pond over at the Daily Mail , they had their opinions too -- although they did n't seem to get caught up in the Palin - talk , they are certainly more blunt over there .
Surprising ?
Maybe not .
" Crashing bore meets dingbat Mom .
That , to be brutal , was the line - up in the U.S. vice - presidential candidates ’ debate .
...
Mrs Palin is clearly not a member of the Beltway tribe .
She spoke of foreign presidents like a woman who has just learned to pronounce the name of exotic mushrooms .
" At one point she denied the charge of ‘ naiveté ’ but made it sound like a range of ladies ’ evening garments .
" Plenty to play for , and these two are only the sidekicks .
But the score from Missouri , folks : Bore 0 , Dingbat 1 . "
Not everyone was brutal , however .
Ellis Henican from Newsday and a political analyst for Fox News ( there ya ' have it ) sympathizes with having a prominent accent , but is n't afraid to make fun it anyway .
" When I first moved up North , I tried to hide my Southern accent .
I thought it made me sound , you know , ignorant - like the kind of guy who'd marry one of his cousins and then insist on turning up at the wedding in a baseball cap .
I do n't try to hide my accent anymore .
" Winking warmly at the camera .
Filling the silence with actual words .
Steering the conversation to taxes and energy , the two political topics she 's most comfortable with .
It was far from a brilliant debating performance .
But the Alaska governor has this much :
She beat the low bar of expectations by a North Country mile .
" She was n't nearly as bad as most people thought she 'd be .
You betcha , y'all ! "
WASHINGTON  Despite signals that Senator John McCain would have new prescriptions for the economic crisis after a weekend of meetings , his campaign said Sunday that Mr. McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , would not have any more proposals this week unless developments call for some .
The signs of internal confusion came as the campaign was under pressure from state party leaders to sharpen his message on the economy and at least blunt the advantage that Democrats traditionally have on the issue in hard times .
Republicans have grown fretful as Senator Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , has edged ahead in polls three weeks before the election , while Mr. McCain has veered between ill - received economic plans and attacks on Mr. Obama ’s character .
Mr. McCain took a break Sunday from filming campaign advertisements and practicing for a final debate with Mr. Obama on Wednesday to cheer volunteers at a phone bank near his Northern Virginia headquarters .
Mr. McCain told them he planned to “ whip his you - know - what in this debate . ”
The group erupted with laughter and applause .
On Saturday , his advisers were considering a range of economic ideas , one indicated .
On Sunday , on the CBS News program “ Face the Nation , ” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , a confidant of Mr. McCain , confirmed a report on Politico.com that Mr. McCain was weighing proposals to cut taxes on investors ’ capital gains and dividends .
“ It will be a very comprehensive approach to jump - start the economy , ” Mr. Graham said , “ by allowing capital to be formed easier in America by lowering taxes . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Google Inc. on Wednesday unveiled a $ 4.4 trillion energy plan to greatly reduce U.S. use of fossil fuels by 2030 by tapping alternative sources , including wind and solar power .
Google GOOG , +0.32 % has explored a number of alternative - energy initiatives through its nonprofit organization Google.org , including investments in startups developing related technology .
As justification for its interest and investments in alternative energy , the Internet giant has cited a need for more efficient ways to power its data centers around the globe .
In an online posting , Jeffery Greenblatt , Google.org 's climate and energy - technology manager , wrote that while the cost of Google 's plan would be significant , exceeding $ 4 trillion , it could result in net savings of $ 1 trillion over its 22 - year span .
Visit Google 's blog .
The plan is the result of an analysis by Google , which said its goal is to " stimulate debate . "
The company said its own related initiatives have included making $ 5 million in " building efficiency " investments , which it aims to recoup in two and a half years .
In addition , Google last month announced that it would begin partnering with General Electric Co. GE , - 1.29 % to lobby Washington lawmakers and promote the use of alternative energy .
See related story .
Greenblatt wrote that the " Clean Energy 2030 " plan would involve heavy investments in transmission capacity for wind and solar power in the " Great Plains and desert Southwest " to help cut 88 % of fossil fuel use and 95 % of carbon - dioxide emissions by 2030 .
In addition , Greenblatt wrote that geothermal energy , or natural energy that can be harnessed beneath the Earth 's surface , is the " sleeping giant " of alternative energy .
Geothermal - energy systems promise " extremely rapid growth if key technologies can be proven in the next few years , " he said .
Through Google.org , Google has invested in geothermal - energy company Potter Drilling , which is developing technology to pierce hard rock and has provided a grant to Southern Methodist University 's Geothermal Lab .
Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt is scheduled to speak publicly in San Francisco Wednesday evening about geothermal energy and other related topics .

The French distributor of Taser - brand cattleprod stunguns has been arrested along with nine other suspects - including policemen and private detectives - for allegedly spying on a communist politician .
Various French and worldwide media reported on the arrests , which follow an investigation by L'Express magazine .
The magazine looked into the matter after complaints of being followed and spied upon by Olivier Besancenot , outsider presidential candidate in 2007 and spokesman for the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire ( LCR ) party .
The long - running affair has pitted Besancenot against Antoine Di Zazzo , head of SMP Technologies , which distributes Taser stunguns in France .
SMP is engaged in legal action against Besancenot for publicising cases in which people have died after being Tasered .
Radio France Internationale quotes the leftist politician as saying that Di Zazzo is " seeking € 50,000 from me just because I drew attention to an Amnesty International report " .
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for a moratorium on the use of Tasers .
Investigators suspect that Di Zazzo engaged a private detective agency run by a former police officer to spy on Besancenot .
It is alleged that improper access to bank accounts and vehicle registration data may have taken place , and that intrusive surveillance may have been used .
Taser International , based in Arizona , was quick to distance itself from Di Zazzo .
" Antoine is purely a distributor in France , " company spokesman Steve Tuttle told the Arizona Republic .
" He is not an employee in any way , shape or form . "
Besancenot has said that the case illustrates the dangers of uncontrolled state surveillance , and believes it will provide ammunition against upcoming French legislation intended to widen government spying powers .
There was no report of the French cops needing Tasers to subdue Di Zazzo and his associates . ®
RACINE , Wisconsin ( Reuters ) - Republican
White House hopeful John McCain accused Democrat Barack Obama on Thursday of playing racial politics in some of the most biting back - and - forth of the presidential campaign .
The negative twist in the campaign for the November 4 election was prompted by a McCain television advertisement on Wednesday that called Obama a celebrity akin to star - crossed U.S. personalities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
In response , Obama said McCain was trying to scare voters away from him by pointing out he had “ a funny name , and he does n’t look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills . ”
Obama , whose father was Kenyan , would be the first black U.S. president .
Only white men , most of them former presidents , are on U.S. paper currency .
“ Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck .
It ’s divisive , negative , shameful and wrong , ” McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said in a written statement .
McCain agreed with Davis , telling reporters he was “ very disappointed ” that Obama had used the race card .
“ Race will not have any role in my campaign , nor is there any place for it .
I ’m disappointed that he ’s used it . ”
He dismissed Democratic charges he was taking the low road , saying Obama had “ run negative ads on me continuously , and I might point out for the record that his was the first . ”
Obama fired back during a town hall meeting in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , that the attacks did not help voters deal with the array of problems they face .

“ You ’d think we ’d be having a serious debate but so far all we ’ve been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
I do have to ask my opponent :
Is that the best you can come up with ? ” the Illinois senator said .
He said McCain had pledged to run an honorable campaign but had fallen back into “ these negative ads , these negative attacks . ”
At a later fundraiser in Houston , Obama called the McCain attacks “ intellectually bankrupt . ”
“ Our politics is small when we need to be thinking big , ” he said .
“ The times are serious .
It calls for serious people . ”
McCain defended the ad when a woman asked him about it at a town hall meeting in the battleground state of Wisconsin .
The woman said the tone of the ad did not square with his earlier promises to avoid “ mudslinging ” and asked him whether he was now flip - flopping .
McCain said , “ We ’re proud of that commercial . ”
“ I admire his ( Obama ’s ) campaign , but what we are talking about here is substance and not style .
And what we ’re talking about is who has an agenda for the future of America .
Campaigns are tough , but I am proud of the campaign that we have run , ” McCain said .
UNDERDOG
The McCain campaign is trying to shake up a race that currently favors Obama at a time when the U.S. economy is weak , the U.S. military is stretched fighting two wars , and the annual budget deficit is approaching a half - trillion dollars .
The McCain campaign believes the 71 - year - old Arizona senator is the underdog but that the race is close .
It is trying to paint Obama as an inexperienced lightweight .
McCain went through a point - by - point litany of questions about Obama ’s positions on taxes , energy and the Iraq war .
Noting Obama ’s opposition to offshore oil drilling , he said his Democratic rival had urged Americans to make sure their tires were properly inflated as a way to increase gas mileage .
“ Yesterday , he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas .
My friends , let ’s do that .
But do you think that ’s enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil ?
I do n’t think so , ” he said to chuckles from the crowd .
The “ celebrity ” television ad showed spliced images of Spears and Hilton with video of Obama addressing 200,000 people in Berlin last week .
The Obama camp launched a Web site called “ The Low Road Express ” to respond to what it considers inaccurate ads and statements from McCain .
Obama adviser Robert Gibbs said on NBC’s “ Today ” show that “ the McCain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative .
We believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years . ”
Both candidates vying to succeed President George W. Bush have said in the past they planned to run campaigns that would stay away from the negative attacks that marked some presidential contests in recent years .
The Pirate Bay has reached yet another milestone .
Today , they track more than 20 million unique peers for the first time since the site was launched .
It is estimated that the Pirate Bay tracks more than half of all BitTorrent users at any given point in time .
By November 2007 , The Pirate Bay was tracking around 6 million peers , up from ‘ just ’ 3 million the year before .
The growth has been amazing , and it does n’t seem that it is going to slow down anytime soon .
One of the reasons it was possible for the site to handle this record number of peers are the constant improvements on the software and hardware side .
New servers are added regularly , budget permitting , and UDP trackers were added to all the torrents on the site , which are less resource consuming than TCP trackers .
Pirate Bay co founder Peter Sunde , who just returned from his trip to Malaysia , told Torrent Freak that they previously had a limit on the amount of peers they could track , but that this has increased with all the recent changes .
“ I wish we had lots and lots of money so we could just buy like 10 servers and another gigabit , ” he mused .
At the current growth rate , The Pirate Bay may be tracking over 25 million peers by the end of the year .
Peter himself is aiming for 24 million peers by Christmas eve .
The Pirate Bay is not the only BitTorrent site that has been growing , other torrent sites is oHunt and Mininova are breaking visitor records every week .
The only downside to this news is , that The Pirate Bay is one of the few sites that operates a ( public ) tracker .
With 50 % of all BitTorrent users relying on a single tracker , things can get quite ugly when it goes down .
The Pirate Bay encourages others to start their own tracker , using Opentracker for example .
The more heads the Hydra has , the better .
Windows cross-compiler
Summary
Build and test full - featured Windows programs , from the comfort of the Fedora system , without needing to use Windows .
Owner
Please send any email correspondence about this feature to the fedora - mingw mailing list ( you do not need to be subscribed ) .
Current status
Targeted release : Fedora 11
Last updated : 2009-03-11
Percentage of completion : 100 % ! ( 38/38 packages reviewed )
We would like to get the following package reviews completed ( although they are not strictly necessary for F11 , just nice to have ) :
Detailed Description
The Fedora MinGW project 's mission is to provide an excellent development environment for Fedora users who wish to cross -compile their programs to run on Windows , minimizing the need to use Windows at all .
In the past developers have had to port and compile all of the libraries and tools they have needed , and this huge effort has happened independently many times over .
We aim to eliminate duplication of work for application developers by providing a range of libraries and development tools which have already been ported to the cross -compiler environment .
This means that developers will not need to recompile the application stack themselves , but can concentrate just on the changes needed to their own application .
Benefit to Fedora
There are two primary benefits for Fedora users .
Firstly , developers who are asked to write software for Windows will no longer need to deal with Windows and all the proprietary compilers / software on top of Windows .
Instead they can throw a " configure switch " and build ( and test ) the software without leaving Fedora .
Secondly — and this is the long term goal — it should mean that Windows users can have a greater choice of higher quality open source applications available to them .
( Developers who are primarily Linux users will actually be able to produce daily builds for Windows and respond to bug reports from Windows users , so the quality will generally improve ) .
Windows users can use these applications instead of the usual choice of closed , proprietary , expensive apps , giving them at least some freedom .
Once they are used to the high quality free applications available , it will be much easier for them to switch to a fully open platform .
The GNU project started out in much the same way by providing much better quality command - line tools for proprietary platforms such as SunOS , and eventually SunOS users liked them so much they switched over to GNU on Linux .
Scope
Requires importing the libraries and development tools from our repository .
How To Test
0 . What special hardware / data / etc. is needed ( if any ) ?
No special hardware is needed : it should be possible to test using a standard Fedora installation .
1 . How do I prepare my system to test this feature ?
What packages need to be installed , config files edited , etc . ?
The tester should install the mingw32-* packages and wine from Fedora 11 .
Wine then needs an extra configuration step described in MinGW / Configure wine .
2 . What specific actions do I perform to check that the feature is working like it 's supposed to ?
hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/fedora-mingw--devel/ cd fedora - mingw -- devel ls */NOT-FOR -FEDORA
Look for some application packages .
These are marked by having the file NOT - FOR - FEDORA in the subdirectory , meaning the package is not a development tool or library and so cannot be added to Fedora , but is kept as an example or for testing purposes .
( An example is Inkscape ) .
In these directories you will find a spec file which will try to cross -compile the application and produce a binary RPM .
Test by attempting to build these applications , then running them under Wine and comparing them to the native Fedora application .
3 . What are the expected results of those actions ?
The cross-compiled applications , running under Wine , should behave more or less similarly to the same Fedora application running natively .
User Experience
A user wo n't see any visible changes , for example in menus .
However we would like to make a comps.xml " Windows cross - compiler " group available .
This will allow them to install the basic packages and a useful subset of the libraries and development tools through PackageKit .
Dependencies
None .
Contingency Plan
No contingency plan is necessary .
Documentation
Release Notes
Fedora 11 implements a complete Windows cross-compiler along with prebuilt libraries and development tools .
This allows developers to target their software at Windows users .
We currently support C , C++ , FORTRAN , OCaml , Objective C and Objective C++ cross-compilation .
Developers can do this using entirely open source software for building and testing ( through Wine ) , and the development environment is integrated with normal Fedora build and test tools .
Rep. Michele Bachmann gestures as she speaks at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , on Sept. 2 . Bachmann turns to overdrive
Rep . Michele Bachmann ’s call for a media investigation into “ anti- American ” members of Congress may have been the macaca — or McCarthy — moment of 2008 , but it has also given the Minnesota Republican something she ’s been angling for since arriving in Congress two years ago : the national spotlight .
To be on Bachmann ’s press e-mail listserv these last few months is to see her determined , deliberate march to the top of the cable news booker list .
It ’s Bachmann on Larry King , Bachmann on Bloomberg , Bachmann on Cavuto , Bachmann on O’Reilly , Bachmann on CNBC ’s “ Squawk Box . ”
Advertisement
Bachmann , Bachmann everywhere .
The congresswoman has been on national cable news shows at least 23 times since the beginning of September , a scheduled guest of Larry King ’s on seven occasions .
She is very good at what she does , ” explains Michelle Marston , Bachmann ’s chief of staff , who is on leave to serve as the congresswoman ’s reelection campaign spokeswoman .
“ Once we got her on these national media outlets and she could show how well she presents the conservative argument and how she can put a fresh face and perspective [ on it ] , they started calling her back . ”
A Minnesota GOP operative close to Bachmann casts the congresswoman ’s love for the camera in a less positive light .
I think that she ’s a media hound first and foremost , ” said the operative .
“ That has been her biggest goal from Day One : to be in the media spotlight , to be a representative who is the spokesman for the Republican Party — and she ’s made that a very concerted effort , to be in the spotlight as much as possible .
“ Why would Larry King or Chris Matthews want to have her on ?
Precisely because of what happened on Friday . ”
A former House GOP leadership aide refers to Bachmann as this cycle ’s version of former Florida Rep. Katherine Harris .
But Harris had an independent cause célèbre , having served as Florida ’s secretary of state during the 2000 presidential election and recount .
As a freshman with a lone Financial Services Committee assignment — Bachmann is 29th in seniority among 32 Republicans — she has had to create her own publicity , and she ’s done her darnedest .
Backed by a three - person communications staff — a press secretary for national media , a press secretary for local media and a staffer to handle the blogs and other new media — Bachmann has volunteered herself for the attention she ’s enjoying a little less this week .
“ Freshman members usually get more attention because they are new to the Washington scene and unknown quantities , ” said the former Republican leadership aide .
“ Michele Bachmann is getting more attention because she has a few ingredients in addition to being a freshman :
She ’s somewhat attractive for TV , is somewhat willing to say controversial things , and she ’s willing to be on TV . ”
It was this willingness that found Bachmann on “ Hardball ” with Chris Matthews on Friday .
As Matthews explained it to Politico , one of his bookers called John McCain ’s presidential campaign early in the day for help in filling a hard - to - book Friday afternoon slot .
The campaign , Matthews said , suggested the ever - willing Bachmann .
The YouTube moments that other members fear will ruin their careers — see Allen , Former Sen. George — seem only to have aided Bachmann ’s quest for media ubiquity .
“ I would say she likes controversy , but there are Type - A personality types — if anything is calm and steady , that ’s not where they thrive , ” says Sean Nienow , the congresswoman ’s former district director .
“ I think she is more on that end . ”
Bachmann first hiked the national eyebrow with her awkwardly long shoulder grasp of President Bush in the moments after his 2007 State of the Union address .
A video clip landed in heavy rotation online , as did clips of Bachmann sermonizing about being “ hot for Jesus , ” referring to Terri Schiavo as “ healthy ” and disputing that “ global warming is the issue of the day . ”
But none of those resulted in the attention — or the blowback — that Bachmann ’s exchange with Matthews has produced .
Early in the “ Hardball ” interview , Bachmann said she was “ very concerned ” that Barack Obama “ may have anti-American views . ”
When Matthews pressed her about the connections between liberalism and anti-Americanism , Bachmann continued to blow on the coals : “ Well , the liberals that are Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers , they are over - the - top anti-American , and that ’s the questions that Americans have . ”
She grouped into this Michelle Obama ’s comments that “ she ’s only recently proud of her country . ”
Matthews kept pressing .
“ I guess when I heard the word ‘ anti- American ’ [ applied ] to Barack , I wanted to see how ready she was to apply it , ” Matthews told Politico on Monday .
“ And she was ready to apply it pretty broadly . ”
Matthews asked Bachmann how many of her colleagues were “ anti-American . ”
“ What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look , ” Bachmann responded .
“ I wish they would .
I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think people would be — would love to see an exposé like that . ”
The backlash was immediate and intense .
Colin Powell called Bachmann ’s comments “ nonsense . ” Nancy Pelosi said Bachmann had “ discredited ” herself .
Republicans did n’t exactly rush to Bachmann ’s defense .
Spokesmen from the offices of the House minority leader , the House minority whip and the Republican Study Committee all declined to comment Monday .
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers would n’t address Bachmann ’s comments directly , but he said that the Arizona senator does n’t question Obama ’s patriotism .
And even as Marston argued that Matthews had backed Bachmann into a corner , the congresswoman ’s Democratic challenger , El Tinklenberg , was taking in more than $ 800,000 in fresh contributions from donors around the country .
Marston , who previously worked for Rep. Scott Garrett ( R - N.J. ) , joined Bachmann ’s staff in February , bringing along with her another former Garrett staffer , press secretary Mary Vought , several months later .
Marston said Bachmann ’s media approach reflects the reality of life in the minority .
“ When you ’re a minority member , communication becomes that much more important ; you do n’t have that much control over schedule or agenda , ” Marston said .
“ Communication becomes the way to get the word out . ”
It worked for Bachmann during the spring and the summer , when she made herself one of her party ’s leading proponents of “ drill , baby , drill ” — an odd achievement , considering that neither where she ’s from nor the committee on which she serves has an energy - specific focus .
As Nienow put it , “ She seemed to be a spokesman for drilling , and I ’m not sure how that happened . ”
Nienow , who served with Bachmann in the Minnesota State Senate before working on her staff , said that while she had a presence in local conservative media before coming to Congress , it was nothing like what she ’s established for herself these days .
“ Every cycle creates its own cast , ” says Democratic strategist James Carville , who tussled with Bachmann a few times in recent months on “ Larry King Live . ”
“ I think it ’s kind of a match made in heaven .
I think TV likes her , and she likes it . ”
Out of all the things one could talk with President - Elect Obama , someone apparently brought up this : " All your base are belong to us . "
That 's right , the funny English phrase from Zero Wing turned internet meme .
In a one - of - us - one - of - us thread over at Scifi site Tor.com in which Obama 's geekatude is being discussed , one commenter recounted a story from a friend who claims to have interned for the Obama presidential campaign :
The job involves getting him something to eat , maybe playing a little basketball with him , and basically chatting and getting whatever he needs between important things .
During the conversation , apparently Zero Wing came up .
You know , the Sega Genesis video game .
I do n't know how .
And apparently , my friend made the off - hand comment of " All your base are belong to us " .
And Obama leaned forward in his chair , quirked his eyebrow a bit , and responded " What you say ? "

Granted , this nugget comes from a random
Tor commenter 's friend , so it 's tough to verify — we 're going to call this a rumor , a delicious rumor .
Quick !
Somebody find John McCain and tell him about the " full extent of the jam . "
He must know !
Great Caesar 's ghost !
[ Tor.com Thanks , Eric - Jon ! ]

A bipartisan Alaska legislative panel has found that Sarah Palin Abuses her authority as governor in firing the state ’s public safety commissioner .
The report finds that she violated the public trust .
We can now close the book on the Sarah Palin gamble .
Palin now has no credibility , and has likely destroyed her own ticket .
The most damning quote from the report is , ” Governor Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda … to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired . ”
I think it was clear that something was up with this report , after it took so long to release .
If it did n’t contain anything bad for Palin you can believe that the McCain campaign would have been rushing to get it out into the news cycle today , but as the evening went on , the release of the report started to look more like a Friday night news dump .
To say this news is devastating , is an understatement .
It could be the final nail in the coffin for the McCain campaign .
Advertisements
The question is what does McCain do now ?
She has been a drag on the ticket for a month , and before this report was released some conservatives were calling for her removal .
It is likely that the McCain campaign is going to call this investigation partisan , and try to move on , but if McCain wants to , this would be the perfect time to dump Palin .
She is now toxic , and in no position to question the honesty and ethics of Barack Obama .
Sarah Palin has already demonstrated that she ca n’t be trusted to do news interviews alone .
She survived the vice presidential debate with charm and talking points .
Her lack of knowledge is embarrassing .
Because of this , her popularity has plummeted to the point where she now has a negative approval rating , and she is a national joke .
With the release of this report , she is such a huge liability to the campaign that it is difficult to see why they would keep her around .
McCain knew about this investigation before he chose her , so why did he do it ?
This development calls into question McCain ’s judgment .
Remember , that the committee that ruled that Sarah Palin violated an ethics law consisted of 10 Republicans and 4 Democrats .
Maybe McCain thought that this little investigation would go away , but instead it has doomed his campaign .
McCain can now no longer question Obama ’s honesty when his running mate lied to the people of Alaska .
The GOP will try to dismiss this , but in the end , the McCain campaign is now on the defensive , and trying to play catch up , with an ethically challenged running mate , and no issues to run on .

Resolver One 1.3 Released : Spreadsheet Web Server now Included
After a month of being about a week away from release , Resolver One 1.3 is finally out !
Most of the delay was in sorting out the documentation and the way the installers are built , because of the major new feature in 1.3 - the web server is now in all versions of Resolver One , including the free Open - Source and non-commercial version .
The web server serves spreadsheets created with Resolver One , including UI elements like images , editable fields , drop down lists and buttons - going back to the server to update the displayed results based on user actions .
Although Resolver One is Windows only ( but works great under virtualization ) we have had the web server working under Mono on Linux .
Hopefully soon we 'll be able to post instructions on serving Resolver One spreadsheets from Linux or the Apple Mac .
Other new features in this release :
Column - and row - level formulae , using headers .
So , for example , you can say that column A is " quantity " , column B is " price " , and then specify a column - level formula for column C to make it quantity times price .
No more duplicated formulae !
A 30 % improvement in startup time .
An option to trigger a recalculation , reloading all imports - Shift - F9 .
This is very useful when you 're developing and want to be able to change the Python scripts you depend on .
Handling of number formatting ( thousand separators , currency units , etc ) when pasting .
New ContentCells property for Row and Column objects , mirroring ContentRows / ContentCols on worksheet .
Upgrade to IronPython 1.1.2 .
And , of course , many other bugfixes and usability tweaks .
My colleague Jonathan Hartley has done a two minute screencast on the new features in Resolver One 1.3 .
The column and row level formulae are nice .
As well as being useful where you repeat the same formula in every row ( or column ) of a spreadsheet , you can use them in combination with list comprehensions to do some interesting data aggregation .
I'm in the middle of working on a short screencast ( my first for Resolver Systems ) illustrating this .
For release 1.4 we are working on the port of Resolver One to IronPython 2 ( based on the Dynamic Language Runtime ) .
IronPython 2 final is not out yet , but is still at Release Candidate stage .
Our port , which is going very well , has uncovered a few bugs in IronPython 2 in just the last few days - so it still needs work before a final release .
Resolver
One is quite finely tuned to the performance profile of IronPython 1 and so we also have quite a bit to do to get Resolver One running fast on IronPython 2 ( although the improvements in binary compilation mean that hopefully startup time will be significantly faster in the next release ) .
One of the tangible benefits of moving to IronPython 2 is that we will be able to integrate Ironclad into Resolver One , allowing the use of Python C extensions in the spreadsheet .
Ironclad is making fantastic progress , with a large chunk of the core Numpy tests now passing ( except for their evil use of sys._getframe in the test suite ) .
Release 1.4 will definitely include support for a wider range of statistical functions , but it will possibly also support the use of Numpy arrays and matrices for calculations on spreadsheet tables - which will be fantastic .
Resolver
One for commercial use is available at the discounted price of $ 199 , but the discount ends on November 27th when the price goes up to $ 399 .
Get it while its hot .
We 're starting to take Resolver Systems in an interesting new direction , focussing more on direct sales of Resolver One rather than the big - ticket ' consultancy - ware ' we have concentrated on up till now .
My boss has a good blog post on the subject ( including background on how the company was started ) if you are interested :

Researchers have unearthed rootkit - like functionality in an enterprise security product .
Network security software from a Chinese developer includes processes deliberately hidden from a user and , even worse , a hidden directory , Trend Micro reports .
Files in the hidden directory could exist below the radar of antivirus scanners , potentially creating a stealthy hiding place for computer viruses that their creators might seek to exploit .
Trend Micro has written to the software developers involved in what looks like a case of misguided software design , rather than anything worse .
Pending a fix from software developers , Trend Micro has slapped a " hacking tool " warning on the rootkit - like component of the network security tool ( called HKTL - BRUDEVIC ) .
It does n't name the developers except to say they are the same firm which bundles rootkit - like software with USB storage devices featuring fingerprint authentication .
Sony got a further black eye from issues with its MicroVault USM - F fingerprint reader software last year , which emerged a little over two years after its thorough mauling for including rootkit functionality on its music CDs .
The feature , designed to stop fans ripping music tracks , created a security hole exploited by a number of Trojans . ®
Alan Greenspan ’s testimony today before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is likely to be quoted for years .
Is there anyone in Washington with a better instinct for the jugular than Henry Waxman , the committee chairman , whose questioning evoked some of Greenspan ’s most evocative comments ?
( I know George already quoted this material , but it ’s worth quoting again . )
Greenspan : I made a mistake in presuming that the self - interests of organizations , specifically banks and others , were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms …
Waxman :
In other words , you found that your view of the world , your ideology , was not right , it was not working .
Greenspan : Absolutely , precisely .
You know , that ’s precisely the reason I was shocked , because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well .
At another point , Greenspan said that his faith in Wall Street ’s ability to regulate itself was based on his assumption that rational firms would not expose themselves to self - destructive risks .
He also assumed that the markets would “ properly price ” risky bundles of subprime mortgages , so that investors worldwide would understand that they presented unusual risks .
He continued , “ The whole intellectual edifice … collapsed in the summer of last year . ”
This is poignant , but also evasive .
The system of unregulated incentives , compensation systems , and business practices Greenspan oversaw — or at least tolerated without comment — was riddled with obvious conflicts of interest .
Why were collateralized debt securities bundling reckless subprime mortgages “ mis- priced , ” as Greenspan would have it ?
In substantial part it was because the for - profit ratings agencies , Moody ’s and Standard & Poors , blessed them as sound products , largely on the basis of representations made to them by the banks that marketed the securities .
Why did the ratings agencies fail to detect the true risks embedded in these securities — a failure of intelligence collection as grotesque as any preceding the invasion of Iraq ?
Not a complicated question : they were paid for their opinions by the very banks that sold the faulty products .
McCain ’s language is hard to argue with in this case — that ’s structural corruption .
You may not like it now , but you would be thankful for that big butt of yours if you ever got a chance to ride a bike fitted with designer Deco Goodman 's " Commuter Cyclist 's Sustainable Energy Source . "
The device attaches underneath the seat and collects power generated by the compression of the seat springs , braking , pedaling etc .
As a result , the electricity could be used to power headlights / taillights and any portable gadgets you bring with you on the road .
As you might have guessed , it is only a concept at the moment , but at least it does n't sound completely far - fetched .

トラブルに備え、未知のツールを便利なツールに
本稿で紹介したツール群は、無料で使えるJavaの標準的なツールです。しかしながら、すべてを熟知し、駆使して開発・デバッグを行っている人は実際のところ少数かもしれません。旧来のツールも便利な新機能が増えたり、ほかのツールと連携し効率よく使えるように機能強化されたものもあります。
また、例え ばJava VM用のデバッ ガ「 DTrace」のエージェント「dvm」を使えば、Java自身の深いところまで詳細な動きを知ることが可能です。さまざまな情報を知ることができる一方、プロファイラ系のツールは、オーバーヘッドを生じることが多く、パフォーマンスチューニングの際には、その状況をしっかりと把握して利用しなければいけません。DTraceについては、下記記事を参考にしてください。
便利なツールのありがたみが分かるのは、トラブルが起こったときです。重要な局面において、ちょっとしたツールを知っているか知らないかで、トラブルから抜け出せる確率が大きく違ってくることでしょう。慣れた環境の中で、慣れたツールを正確に使いこなすのも重要ですが、日々新しくなっていくツールに親しむ時間を作り、さらなる達人への道を歩んでいくことをお勧めします。
次回は2009年1月初めごろに公開の予定です。内容は未定ですが、読者の皆さんの興味を引き、役立つ記事にする予定です。何か取り上げてほしい内容などリクエストがありましたら、編集部や＠ITの掲示板までお知らせください。次回もどうぞよろしく。

Assassination Attempts on Hitler ’s Life - page 1 of 1 - a collection of accounts of some of the seventeen planned attempts , from 1939 to 1945 .
( The first attempt was by a lone assassin and therefore not planned by a group )
This is a summary of the main attempts .
MUNICH
Johann Georg Elser , born January 4 , 1903 , had served an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker ( Schreiner ) and from 1929 to 1932 worked in Switzerland at this trade then returned to Germany to assist in his fathers lumberyard .
He bitterly resented the Nazi stranglehold on labour unions and the growing restrictions on religious freedom .
He then decided to kill Hitler by placing a time bomb in one of the columns behind the podium where Hitler was to give a speech in the Burgerbrau Beer Cellar in Munich .
The bomb was set to detonate at preciesly 9.20 pm on Wednesday , November 8 , 1939 .
At 8.10 Hitler enters the beer hall but at 9.12 pm he suddenly ends his speech and departs .
Eight minutes later the bomb explodes killing eight people and wounding sixty - five including Eva Braun 's father .
Seven of those killed were Nazi Party members .
Elser , who , since 1933 , refused to give the nazi salute , is later arrested as he tried to cross the border into Switzerland at Konstanz .
He was held for questioning due to the ' strange content ' of his belongings .
He was transported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp , and later confined in the concentration camp at Dachau .
On the 9th Of April , 1945 , two weeks before the war ended in Europe , Johann Elser was executed by the SS .
In the city of Bremen a street was named in his honour , Georg - Elser Weg .
In Berlin a memorial has been erected and a plaque to his memory is sited in his hometown , Koenigsbronn .
( In September , 1979 , the Burgerbraukeller was demolished .
On its site now stands the Munich City Hilton Hotel )
THE BERGHOF
On March 11 , 1944 , Cavalry Captain Eberhard von Breitenbuch attended a conference at Hitler ’s villa the ‘ Berghof ’ on the Obersalzberg .
Concealed on his person was a small Browning pistol with which he intended to shoot his Führer and at the same time was willing to sacrifice his own life in the attempt .
He felt that the war was now at such a stage that the complete destruction of Germany was inevitable and that Hitler had to be stopped .
Breitenbuch enters the conference room behind Field Marshal Ernst Busch , who suspects nothing , but as he approaches the door he is stopped by the Duty Sergeant who explains " Sorry , no adjutants beyond this point , Führers orders " .
So yet another attempt fails .
BERLIN
On March 20 , 1943 , Colonel Rudolf von Gertsdorff , General Kluge 's chief of intelligence , tried to kill Hitler in the Zeughaus .
The concealed bomb was to be detonated by acid while he stood close to Hitler in the exhibit hall .
Unfortunately Hitler left the building before the acid could act and Gertsdorff immediately entered the men's room and flushed the fuse down the toilet .
In February , 1944 , Infantry Captain Axel von dem Bussche agrees to blow up Hitler and himself while he demonstrates a new army winter overcoat to the German leader .
Fate intervenes the day before when during a British air raid the uniforms were destroyed and Bussche was returned to duty at the front .
A few weeks later another ‘ overcoat ’ attempt was made .
This time the volunteer model was Ewald Heinrich von Kleist , son of one of the original conspirators and included Major General Helmuth Stieff .
Again the RAF saved the day with an air - raid just before the demonstration was about to take place forcing its cancellation .
Ewald von Kleist survived the war and became a publisher .
He died in Munich on March 8 , 2O12 , aged 90 .
THE BERGHOF
On July 11 , 1944 , Staff Officer Lt. Colonel Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg , convinced that he and he alone could assassinate Hitler , attended another conference at the Berghof .
Concealed inside his briefcase was a time bomb .
Waiting outside in a gateaway car was his co-conspirator , Captain Friedrich Klausing .
Inside the Berghof , Stauffenberg telephones his colleagues in Berlin to tell them that neither Goering nor Himmler is present .
They insist that the attempt be aborted .
Stauffenberg then returns to Berlin to plan his next assassination attempt .
RASTENBURG
Stauffenberg ’s second attempt occurs at Hitler ’s Wolf ’s Lair headquarters in East Prussia .
On July 15 , 1944 , he attends a Fuhrers briefing and observes with dismay that Himmler is again absent .
The attempt was once again aborted .
RASTENBURG
Thirty six year - old Stauffenberg ’s final attempt occurred on July 20 , 1944 .
Four days earlier , the attempt was decided upon during a meeting at his residence at No. 8 Tristanstrasse , Wansee .
Himmler or no Himmler , the attempt must go ahead , come what may .
If the attempt was successful , Hitler 's replacement was to be Karl Friedrich Goerdeler , former Lord Mayor of Leipzig and a diehard opponent of Hitler .
At 12.00 pm Stauffenberg and General Fromm report to Field Marshal Keitel ’s office for a briefing before entering the conference room .
At 12.37 pm , Stauffenberg places his briefcase , containing 2,000 grams of Plastik - W explosives , under the map table , then leaves the room on the pretext of making a telephone call .
The officer Colonel Brandt , No.4 who took his place noticed the briefcase and with his foot pushed it further under the table .
The heavy oak table support protected Hitler from the full force of the explosion .
At 12.42 pm , the bomb explodes .
By this time Stauffenberg is on his way back to Berlin .
At 6.28 pm a radio broadcast from Wolf ’s Lair reports that Hitler is alive but only slightly wounded .
Later that night , at 12.30 am , Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators , Haeften , Olbricht and Mertz , are arrested and executed by firing squad in the inner courtyard of the Bendlerstrasse Headquarters in the glare of a trucks head - lights .
( Immediately after Colonel Stauffenberg 's assassination attempt , his wife and four children were arrested and imprisoned .
Freed by the Allies at the end of the war and pregnant at the time of her arrest , she gave birth to her fifth child while in prison .
One of her brothers , Berthold , was also arrested and executed after the failed plot . )

Between August 8 , 1944 and April 9 , 1945 , Ninety persons were executed in Plötzensee prison for their part in the attempted coup of July 20 .
PARIS
Another attempt to assassinate Hitler was planned for July 27 , 1940 , in Paris , where Count Fritz - Dietlof von der Schulenberg planned to shoot Hitler from the reviewing stand during a military parade in Hitler ’s honour .
Hitler however secretly visited Paris in the early hours of July 23 , visiting all the city ’s famed buildings .
He began his tour at 6 am and by 9 am he ended his tour and departed the city .
A few days later Schulenberg recieved word that his hoped for July 27 military parade had been cancelled .
PARIS
Despite Schulenberg ’s failure to lure Hitler to Paris for the special parade , Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben had plans of his own to assassinate Hitler .
In May , 1941 , he attemped to lure Hitler to Paris under a similar pretext .
The visit was scheduled for May 21st but was abruptly called off at the last minute .
SIEGFRIED LINE
In 1939 , prior to the outbreak of WWII , German General Kurt von Hammerstein repeatedly attempted to lure Hitler into visiting the Army ’s fortifications along the Seigfried Line near the Dutch border where he commanded a base .
Hammerstein and his co-conspirator , retired General Ludwig Beck , had planned a ‘ fatal accident ’ to Hitler during his inspection of the base .
Hitler however , never honoured the invitation , instead he turned the tables on Hammerstein by placing him on the retired list .
POLTAVA
Another plot to assassinate Hitler was hatched at Army Group B Headquarters at Walki near Poltava in the Ukraine .
This time the conspirators were General Hubert Lanz , his Chief of Staff , Major - General Dr. Hans Speidel and Colonel Count von Strachwitz , the commanding officer of the Grossdeutschland Tank Regiment .
The plan was to arrest Hitler on his anticipated visit to Army Group B in the spring of 1943 .
Hitler , at the last minute , changed his mind and instead decided to visit his forces fighting in Saporoshe further east .
SMOLENSK
On March 13 , 1943 , three attempts were planned on Hitler ’s life .
Field Marshal Guenther von Kluge , commander of Army Group Center on the eastern front , finally managed to lure Hitler into visiting his headquarters at Smolensk .
However a number of officers on Kluge ’s staff had other thoughts on how to assassinate Hitler .
Colonel Henning von Tresckow , who hated Hitler and the Nazis , together with Lt. Fabian von Schlabrendorff , Colonel Rudolf von Gersdorff and Cavalry Captain Georg von Boeslager had hatched a plan to get rid of their Führer .
Plan 1
Captain von Boeslager and his company were to serve as armed escort to Hitler ’s motorcade .
During the drive from the airfield the Führer ’s car was to be gunned down in an ambush .
The attempt was aborted when Hitler arrived with his own armed escort of 50 SS guards .
Plan 2
The second attempt was to take place during lunchtime in the mess hall .
At a given signal , Tresckow was to rise from the table and open fire on Hitler as he ate lunch , but the sight of so many SS close to Hitler arouses fear of failure and so once again the attempt was aborted .
Colonel Treskow ( Now Major General ) on hearing the news of the failure of the July Plot of 1944 , in which he was implicated , committed suicide by walking into a Russian line of fire on the Eastern Front .
Plan 3
As Hitler leaves by plane for Berlin , Tresckow instructs Schlabrendorff to hand over a package to Colonel Heinz Brandt who is flying back with Hitler .
The package , containing two bottles of brandy , is a gift for Major - General Helmuth Stieff in Berlin .
Concealed in the package is a time bomb but it failed to explode owing to the high altitude cold air freezing the acid in the detonator cap .
When news of Hitler ’s safe arrival reached the plotters , Schlabrendorf immediately flew to Berlin with the regular courier plane and retrieved the package from Colonel Brandt , replacing it with two genuine bottles .
In February , 1945 , Albert Speer , Hitler ’s Armaments Minister , came to the conclusion that his Führer was deliberately committing high treason against his own people .
It was then that Speer decided that Hitler must be eliminated .
During one of his many walks in the Chancellery gardens he took note of a ventilation shaft leading to Hitler ’s bunker .
An idea formed in his mind and he discreetly asked the head of munitions production , Dieter Stahl , if he could procure some of the new gas , Tabun , which he intended to conduct into the ventilation shaft of the bunker .
Stahl , who was sympathetic to the idea , revealed that Tabun was effective only after an explosion and would not be suitable for the purpose which Speer intended .
Another gas had to be found but the whole idea was thwarted when armed SS sentries were placed around the bunker entrances and on the roof .
A chimney had also been built around the ventilation shaft to a height of ten feet which put the air - intake of the shaft out of reach .
At the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials , Albert Speer was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment , which he served to the very last minute , in Spandau Prison , Berlin .
While in Spandau he wrote his memoirs " Inside The Third Reich " .
Only time will tell whether President - Elect Barack Obama will be able to deliver on his promise to bring change to government , but the Illinois senator has already brought it to the dot - gov domain .
Obama 's transition Web site , Change.gov , went live today , soliciting suggestions from citizens and providing a guide to the people and procedures behind the transfer of executive power .
In many ways , the site — fairly clearly still a work in progress — resembles that of any other government agency , with biographies of the transition team , backgrounders on the incoming president 's policy priorities , and links to information about the cabinet offices to be filled when the Obamas move into the White House on January 20 .
But the speed with which the site was launched may nevertheless be an attempt to signal that Obama is serious about his pledge to bring greater transparency to government , and to put more data online more rapidly for public comment .
A Change.gov blog , for instance , promises regular updates on the transition process .
If it's on the Internet , it must be true
There are also several sections on the site that invite user feedback .
" Your Story " asks visitors to explain " what this campaign and this election means to you " — and is sure to be a source of Touching Anecdotes from Ordinary Americans in future speeches .
And there 's an online suggestion box where citizens can share their " vision " for America .
Perhaps most surprisingly , there 's a jobs page where visitors can submit applications for non-career positions in the new administration — including , apparently , some that " require Senate confirmation . "
Forgive us if we 're a bit doubtful that the next Secretary of Defense will be chosen from the pool of online applicants , however .
The Government Accountability Office launched its own transition site today as well , outlining 13 challenges facing the new administration .
Among these is the move from analog to digital television broadcast , which GAO warns could " undermine the public 's confidence in government " if it is n't carried out smoothly .
While change may have arrived rapidly , there is no sign — as yet — of hope.gov .
News
Étoilé intends to be an innovative , GNUstep - based , user environment built from the ground up on highly modular and light components .
It is created with project and document orientation in mind , in order to allow users to create their own workflow by reshaping or recombining provided Services ( aka Applications ) and Components .
Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow us to scale from handheld to desktop environments .
0.4 is a developer - targeted release on its way towards this goal .
As a developer - focussed release , this predominantly consists of frameworks .
A few demonstration applications are also included .
More will be added during the 0.4.x release series , leading to a user - focussed 0.5 release next year .
Highlights
CoreObject is a framework for describing and organizing model objects .
It supports automatic persistence and versioning by recording messages sent to objects .
It offers a flexible versioning scheme where both individual objects and their entire object graph can be versioned separately .
The built - in object model is a generalization of the property model used by the AddressBook framework .
Foreign model objects can be also integrated by wrapping them with a special proxy .
CoreObject uses the EtoileSerialize framework which , in many cases , allows objects and messages to be automatically serialized with no extra code being written .
LanguageKit is a compiler kit built on top of LLVM for creating dynamic language implementations using an Objective - C runtime for the object model .
This is used by SmalltalkKit , implementing Étoilé 's Pragmatic Smalltalk , a Smalltalk JIT compiler which generates code binary - compatible with Objective - C , allowing classes to be written in a mixture of Smalltalk and Objective -C .
EtoileFoundation is the core framework for all Étoilé projects , providing numerous convenience methods on top of the OpenStep foundation and significantly better support for reflection .
This includes EtoileThread which allows objects to transparently be run in a separate thread .
It also includes a number of extensions to the Objective - C object model , allowing traits and mixins .
This framework is used by most of the rest of Étoilé and provides a number of core functions , such as UUID and XML handling .
EtoileUI is also available as an early preview release and should not be considered stable .
EtoileUI is a high - level , object - oriented , user interface toolkit that provides a uniform tree representation for graphical objects on top of the AppKit .
All User Interface concerns such as layouts , event handlers , styles , model objects etc. will be implemented as pluggable aspects .
It also shares the same interfaces as other CoreObject systems .
The combination of these three key features makes possible to inspect and reshape both User Interface and model objects at runtime through direct manipulation .
It comes with a library of layouts where each one encapsulates a custom and pluggable visual presentation .
Other frameworks , such as LuceneKit , providing full - text indexing and searching , and OgreKit , a powerful regular expression framework are also included .
UnitKit is a simple and flexible unit testing framework used by much of Étoilé .
A new addition is MediaKit , a framework used to provide support for sound playback and recording and , in future , video .
SystemConfig has received a number of improvements since our last release , including support for modifying basic X11 keyboard settings and monitoring the battery level .
Several applications are part of this release , such as Mélodie , a music jukebox using CoreObject for the music library and MediaKit for playback .
Étoilé applications which use ScriptKit are scriptable from outside using Objective - C or Smalltalk .
This is used by the hot corners and gesture recognition tool to run arbitrary commands in response to corner activations or mouse gestures , and by ScriptServices which allows arbitrary shell or Smalltalk scripts to be invoked on the current selection from any GNUstep or Étoilé application .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- When Erin Callan , Lehman Brothers ' onetime golden girl , left the firm in July , it was a tumultuous end to what had been a stellar 13 - year run .
She 'd risen from tax lawyer to investment banker to a six - month stint as CFO - and was then thrown under the bus by her mentor , CEO Dick Fuld , as Lehman 's share price tanked and rumors swirled about the firm 's imminent demise .
Now that Lehman has gone splat , its shareholders have been wiped out , and the whole investment - bank model has been wiped away , the 42 - year - old Callan knows she dodged a bullet .
A few months before the house of Fuld filed for bankruptcy , she took a new job at Credit Suisse ( CS ) as head of the firm 's global hedge fund business .
Speaking to Fortune just four days after Lehman filed Chapter 11 , and at times choking up , Callan held forth on the fall of Wall Street , the rise of hedge funds and the dangers of celebrity .
Did you see the Lehman bankruptcy coming ?
Nobody thought this was a possibility .
In other downturns , market conditions improved .
The firm had a history of coming out on the other side and doing well .
But the harsh reality of this environment is that asset prices were declining at a shockingly fast pace , so the firm ran out of time .
Raising money to address declining prices was n't going to work .
What were the problem assets ?
The commercial real estate portfolio really was the albatross of the firm .
Organizations have to balance market volatility with a belief that the portfolio is worth its par value in the long run .
The lesson , which is something every good trader or anybody who's in the risk business knows , is to cut your losses .
It 's hard to do that if you think the endgame should be different , but sometimes the market tells you it 's time .
Perhaps John
Thain was able to cut his losses at Merrill ( MER , Fortune 500 ) because he was n't emotionally attached .
He had analytical distance .
Did Lehman think the Fed would help it ?
Yes .
No one knew what it looked like for a broker - dealer this big and connected to the world economy to go bankrupt .
And no one wanted to know .
Is this the worst storm you 've seen on Wall Street ?
Certainly , and there are a lot of people who have been in the business longer than me who have never seen anything like it .
That tells you something about the significance of what 's happening now .
The phenomenon of the independent investment bank falling by the wayside is shocking .
We thought the model would be challenged in the context of this environment , but it was about producing a 20 % return on equity vs. a 10 % return .
The question was not " Can this model continue to be part of the fabric of Wall Street ? "
How could the Street have been so blind ?
People have long asked when the crisis would end ; and until recently it has n't been okay for market participants to say ' I do n't know . '
The challenge in financial services when you have to answer that question is that you are in a confidence - based business .
There is a fine line between expressing confidence in a business and highlighting its weaknesses .
The question about why within a day a bank 's borrowing cost could double ; that 's the heart of the matter .
It 's not that somebody decides overnight that a bank is twice as risky .
They wonder if their entire view was misplaced .
They wonder whether these types of organizations without deposit bases should borrow at these kinds of rates .
That worry stems from a lack of confidence in the institution .
Were you forced out as CFO ?
No .
It was clear in the 24 hours after we announced second - quarter earnings that the market reaction was just terrible , and there was a rising sense in the organization that a management change was needed .
I went back to my office and decided I was willing to step down .
I 'd only been CFO for six months and had n't brought us to that moment , but I was the public face of the firm , and we had to show the world that we were making changes .
Joe Gregory [ then Lehman 's COO and president ] was thinking about stepping down , but he was not known to the outside world .
It would have mattered a lot internally , but I did n't think it would have a big impact on the market .
So we decided to do it together - to do the right thing for the organization .
In retrospect I was lucky to get out , but I was so sad .
It was n't a relief at the time .
I never thought I would leave that firm .
It had such a strong culture .
People really lived their lives there .
I think Dick felt personally horrible about it because I was his prot�g�e .
During this difficult conversation with me , he cried .
What mistakes did you make ?
You can't be naive about the press .
I had a lot of positive exposure but did n't recognize the opportunity for significant negative exposure .
Exposure becomes celebrity , and you get a persona .
That persona got away from me and the firm .
There were so many pieces to it , not least of which was the phenomenon of a woman CFO on Wall Street .
Also , you find out that just because you 're the CFO you do n't get to make unilateral decisions .
But as CFO you 're steward of the cash .
But you 're not .
There are all these other people in the room making decisions .
To sell an asset you need the CEO , the president , and the president of that division to all sign off .
I think I could have had a bigger voice had I been in my position longer , but I had been there only a matter of months .
What about your relationships with hedge funds ?
Part of your Lehman legacy is your battle with David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital , who was shorting your stock .
Einhorn and I had one half - hour conversation .
I never thought about it again , talked to anybody about it again , knew it was a mistake .
The firm asked me to do it .
Even though I thought we should n't , I did because I was working within a team .
Our job was to work one - on - one with our clients and shareholders to address questions they had based on issues that he raised .
But the firm found it difficult to ignore the public dialog he started .
Einhorn actually never said anything that was outright false .
He had an opinion about lots of things .
And he was entitled to his opinion .
Do your clients worry about you because of the flap with Einhorn ?
No .
They know I 'm not part of the campaign against short - sellers .
I believe in efficient capital markets .
People should make long decisions and short decisions , and they have their investment theses .
What does the future hold for hedge funds ?
Big funds will become very large money managers with whole suites of alternative investment products - hedge funds and private equity funds to more traditional long - only investments .
Firms that offer all the different assets are likely to be the winners .
Will big players like Fortress , Citadel , and Blackstone ( BX ) fill the investment - banking void ?
I see firms like these easily stepping into some of this void .
They 're constrained only by their imaginations , and there are a lot of creative people in that community .
Some firms are already acting as market makers , lenders , and advisors .
But the hedge fund community faces the same issues that brought the Street to its knees : the availability of financing , the proper asset - liability structure of its balance sheet , the ability to raise capital from investors , and the ability to deploy it safely and efficiently over various horizons .
Whether you 're buy side , sell side - whatever way you 're participating in these markets - everyone is being cautious .
WASHINGTON  Democratic leaders in the Senate are prepared to give Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a still - undefined leadership role there if she does not become Barack Obama ’s secretary of state , Democratic officials close to the situation said Thursday .
The discussions about an enhanced position for Mrs. Clinton are factoring into her deliberations over joining the cabinet , the officials said .
Mrs. Clinton , the junior senator from New York , is wrestling with whether to abandon her independence to become the nation ’s top diplomat or remain in a chamber where lack of seniority limits her influence .
Mrs. Clinton asked to join the Senate Democratic leadership after the Nov. 4 election , and party leaders began trying to figure out a way to accommodate her without dislodging any of the current leaders , Democratic officials said .
The conversations , they added , preceded Mr. Obama ’s approach to her about becoming secretary of state and are on the table if she turns the job down .
Although advisers to Mr. Obama have said he has not made a formal offer , most Democrats believe the decision is hers to make , and friends said Thursday that she was wavering .
In tonight ’s installment of “ Sarah Palin and Katie Couric : The Miniseries , ” Governor Palin , 44 , is asked about her remarks that she has been listening to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. ’s speeches “ since I was in , like , second grade . ”
Ms. Couric asked Ms. Palin , the Republican vice - presidential nominee , if the comment was not “ risky ” considering her running mate , Senator John McCain is 72 years old :
Watch CBS Videos Online
Oh no , it ’s nothing negative at all .
He ’s got a lot of experience and just stating the fact there , that we ’ve been hearing his speeches for all these years .
So he ’s got a tremendous amount of experience and , you know , I ’m the new energy , the new face , the new ideas and he ’s got the experience based on many many years in the Senate and voters are gonna have a choice there of what it is that they want in these next four years .
Ms. Couric also asked Ms. Palin about her position on abortion , contraception , also known as the morning - after pill and about her preferred choice of reading material :
Couric :
And when it comes to establishing your worldview , I was curious , what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world ?
Palin : I ’ve read most of them , again with a great appreciation for the press , for the media .
Couric :
What , specifically ?
Palin :
Um , all of them , any of them that have been in front of me all these years .
Couric :
Can you name a few ?
Palin : I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news , too .
Alaska is n’t a foreign country , where it ’s kind of suggested , “ Wow , how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington , D.C. , may be thinking when you live up there in Alaska ? ”
Believe me , Alaska is like a microcosm of America .
More of the Couric / Palin interview here .
“ CBS Evening News ” will air a segment tomorrow night in which Ms. Palin and Mr. Biden will be asked questions .
Hundreds of gay and straight Mormons are resigning from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints over the Church 's funding and propaganda regarding proposition 8 , that led to a ban on same - sex marriage in California .
Many families with deep ties to the LDS Church are resigning in droves because they feel it was wrong for the church to get involved with a political issue , especially one that is as divisive as gay marriage .
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints have been taught , “ We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government … ” ( Doctrine and Covenants 134:9 ) .
In addition many Mormons do not feel their faith represents them on the issue of homosexuality , and marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples .
Below is a recent news assignment done covering the Signing for Something movement which has now helped hundreds of people leave the LDS movement .

What is success ?
Is success measured in downloads , or up - loads ?
are bugs filed as good as bugs fixed ?
are volunteer marketers as valuable as volunteer developers ?
If we have lots of bugs filed and lots of volunteer management material is that success ? is the pace of change important ?
Does successful QA exist to create process to slow and reject changes , or by accelerating inclusion of fixes improve quality ?
Is success having complete , up - to - date and detailed specifications for every feature ?
Is success getting everyone to slavishly obey laborious multi-step processes , before every commit ?
Alternatively does success come through attracting and empowering developers , who have such fun writing the code that they volunteer their life , allegiance and dreams to improve it ?
I encourage people to download & use OpenOffice.org in one of it's derivatives .
I 'm pleased when people file bugs , help with the QA burden , promote the projet etc .
However , in a Free Software project the primary production is developing and improving the software - ie .
hacking .
So the question is : how is OpenOffice.org doing in this area ?
Are we a success in attracting and retaining hackers ?
Is the project sufficiently fun to be involved in that lots of people actually want to be involved ?
As we are finally on the brink of switching away from the creaking ( 22 years old ) CVS ( provided by Collab.net ) , to an improved Sun hosted Subversion ( sadly not a DRCS ) - Kohei and I created a set of scripts to crunch the raw RCS files as they go obsolete .
They reveal an interesting picture .
Caveats
As with any measurement task , we believe these numbers are fairly reasonable ; and we try to make them meaningful .
On the other hand perhaps there is some horrendous thinko in the analysis , bug reports appreciated .
It 'd also be nice to see if the internal Sun statistics match these .
Firstly - the data is dirty ; since we 're analysing RCS files ; so - when files are moved to the binfilter , or even renamed they have been simply re-committed - causing huge commit spikes .
Similarly license changes , header guard removals and various other automated clean - ups , or check -ins of external projects cause massive signal swamping spikes .
We have made some ( incomplete ) attempts to eliminate a few of these .
In recentish times all work happens on a CVS branch , which is later merged release engineers ( who appear to have done ~ 50 % of the commits themselves ) , so we filter their ( invaluable ) contribution out by account name ( cf. rt's oloh score ) .
Secondly - another distorting factor is that we chart only lines added : in fact when you change a line it is flagged as an add and a remove ; so the number is more correctly lines added or changed .
This of course fails to capture some of the best hacking that is done : removing bloat , which should be a prioirity .
In the Linux kernel case this metric also gives extra credit to bad citizens that dump large drivers packed with duplicated functionality , and worse it rewards cut & paste coding .
I do n't often agree with Bill Gates but :
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight .
still at least the ' lines changed ' facet should be helpful .
Thirdly - release cycles cause changes in contribution patterns , clearly frantic activity during feature development lapses into more bug - fixing later in the cycle .
Thus we expect to see some sort of saw - shape effect .
Fourthly , working on OO.o is infernally difficult , getting code up - stream is extremely and unnecessarily painful - this results in many contributors leaving their code in patches attached to bugs in the issue tracker , and we make no account for these ; these changes ( if they are committed at all ) would appear to be Sun commits .
Thus it is possible that there is at least somewhat wider contribution than shown .
Clearly we would hope that full - time contributors would tend to commit directly to CVS themselves .
Magnitude of contributions
This graph is more meaningless than it might first appear , the raw data still shows noise like individuals committing obvious sillies copying chunks of OO.o to the binfilter eg .
To some extent it is further distorted by us trying to clean this up for the past couple of years before giving up :
So the data is not that useful .
Is it more useful to look at an individual to see if they are contributing something ?
If we threshold the data we can at least approximate an activity metric / boolean .
The graph below shows two developers - the Sun developer Niklas Nebel , and the Novell hacker Kohei Yoshida .
Both work primarily on calc , and you can see the large bar when Kohei committed his solver to a branch at the end of 2006 .
It seems clear that we can at least approximate activity with some thresholding .
More interesting than this though , we can see a most curious thing .
Despite Calc ( apparently ) being the relative weakness of OO.o , and Niklas being the maintainer of the calc core engine , and the calc " Project Lead " ( with special voting privileges for the ' community ' council ) , in fact he has n't committed any real amount of code recently .
That jumps out in the comparison with ( vote - less ) Kohei in the last six months .
It is very sad indeed to all but loose Niklas from the project , though at least we 'll see him at OOoCon .
Verifying this counter - intuitive result with bonsai reveals the same picture .
Activity graphs
Extending this metric to the entire project we see perhaps a more interesting picture .
By thresholding contributions at one hundred lines of code added / changed per month , we can get a picture of the number of individuals committing code to OO.o .
Why one hundred ?
why not ?
it 's at least a sane floor .
Clearly we get a metric that is very easy to game , but luckily that 's hard to do retrospectively .
It is clear that the number of active contributors
Sun brings to the project is continuing to shrink , which would be fine if this was being made up for by a matched increase in external contributors , sadly that seems not to be so .
Splitting out just the external contributors we see some increase , but not enough :
Novell 's up - stream contribution appears small in comparison with the fifteen engineers we have working on OO.o .
This has perhaps two explanations : of course we continue to work on features that are apparently not welcome in Sun 's build cf. the rejection of Kohei 's solver late in 2007 , and much of the rest of our work happens in ooo - build , personal git repositories , and is subsequently filed as patches in IZ .
A comparison
So , it should be clear that OO.o is a profoundly sick project , and worse one that does n't appear to be improving with age .
But what does a real project look like that is alive ?
By patching Jonathon Corbet 's gitdm I generated some similar activity statistics for the Linux kernel , another project of equivalent code size , and arguably complexity :
Graph showing number and affiliation of active kernel developers ( contributing more than 100 lines per month ) .
Quick affiliation key , from bottom up : Unknown , No-Affiliation , IBM , RedHat , Novell , Intel ...
There are a number of points of comparison with the data pilot of active developers aggregated by affiliation for OO.o .
Similarities : both graphs show the release cycle .
Spikes of activity at the start reducing to release .
Linux ' cycle is a loose 3 months , vs. OO.o's 6 months .
Conclusions
: most obviously , : OO.o peaked at aroundactive developers in late 2004 and is trending downwards , the Linux kernel is neareractive developers and trending upwards .- this is drastically reduced for the Linux kernel - down to the sheer volume of changes : eighteen months of Linux ' changes bust calc 's row limit , where OO.o hit only 15 k rows thus far . : the linux graph omits an in - chart legend , this is a result of the 300 + organisations thatcontribute to Linux ; interestingly , a good third of contribution to Linux comes from external ( or un-affiliated ) developers , but the rest comes from corporates .
What is stopping corporations investing similarly in OO.o?
Crude as they are - the statistics show a picture of slow disengagement by Sun , combined with a spectacular lack of growth in the developer community .
In a healthy project we would expect to see a large number of volunteer developers involved , in addition - we would expect to see a large number of peer companies contributing to the common code pool ; we do not see this in OpenOffice.org .
Indeed , quite the opposite we appear to have the lowest number of active developers on OO.o since records began : 24 , this contrasts negatively with Linux 's recent low of 160 + .
Even spun in the most positive way , OO.o is at best stagnating from a development perspective .
Does this matter ?
Of course , hugely !
Everyone that wants
Free software to succeed on the desktop , needs to care about the true success of OpenOffice.org : it is a key piece here .
Leaving the project to a single vendor to resource & carry will never bring us the gorgeous office suite that we need .
What can be done ?
I would argue that in order to kick - start the project , there is broadly a two step remedy :
Kill the ossified , paralysed and gerrymandered political system in OO.o.
Instead put the developers ( all of them ) , and those actively contributing into the driving seat .
This in turn should help to kill the many horribly demotivating and dysfunctional process steps currently used to stop code from getting included , and should help to attract volunteers .
Once they are attracted and active , listen to them without patronizing .
Distance the project from Sun : perhaps less branding , certainly less top - down control , reduce the requirement to ' share ' all your rights over to Sun before you can contribute to the project .
Better still , share ownership of the code with a non-profit foundation to guarantee stability and an independent future for the code - base .
Unfortunately , the chances of either of these points being addressed in full seem fairly remote - though , perhaps there will continue to be some grudging movement in these directions .
A half - hearted open - source strategy ( or execution ) that is not truly ' Open ' runs a real risk of capturing the perceived business negatives of Free software : that people can copy your product for free , without capturing many of the advantages : that people help you develop it , and in doing so build a fantastic support and services market you can dominate .
It 's certainly possible to cruise along talking about all the marketing advantages of end - user communities , but in the end - game , without a focus on developers , and making OO.o truly fair and fun to contribute to - any amount of spin will not end up selling a dying horse .
Postscript
Why is my bug not fixed ?
why is the UI still so unpleasant ?
why is performance still poor ?
why does it consume more memory than necessary ?
why is it getting slower to start ?
why ?
why ?
- the answer lies with developers :
Will you help us make OpenOffice.org better ?
if so , probably the best place to get started is by playing with go - oo.org and getting in touch , please mail us .
Finally - we invite you to repeat the analysis , the raw spreadsheet data ( for data - miners ) is here : ooo - stats.ods linux - stats.ods and the RCS parsing scripts parse_rcs.py with dependants in that same directory .
関西Ruby 会議01で喋ってきた。
で、質疑応答でやっぱりメンテナンスサイクルまわりをつっこまれた。UbuntuのLTSみたいに長期サポートされるリリースはないのか、とか。結局、みんなが安心して使うためにはメンテナンス保証が必要なんだよね。
1.8系統については卜部さんは特に前言を撤回していないので今まで通りにメンテナンスされていくことだろう。つまり、1〜2年ぐらいで新しいteenyリリースがあって、2本のteenyブランチがメンテナンスされる。今は1.8.6と1.8.7がメンテナンスされている。1.8.5はもう放棄される予定だ。1.8.8が出たら、1.8.6はじきに放棄される。
1.9系統はそれも分からない。1.9.2が出るまでは責任を持って1.9.1をメンテナンスするつもりだけど、2本並行してメンテナンスできるかな?
可能でさえあれば、やるつもりではいる。でも、trunkとの乖離が進めばメンテナンスはそれだけ手間を要するものになっていく。MVMや、その他1.9.5あたりで予定されている諸々の変更は1.9系統に大きな変化をもたらすから、4年後には1.9.1のメンテナンスはかなり困難になっていることだろう。そもそも、1.9.1はその時点で、普及度やその後のバージョンとの互換性の観点から見て保守するに足るものであるのか、1.9.2の姿がまだ見えない現状では何とも言えない。
teenyリリース間ではいろんな意味で互換性を保ちたかったけど、1.9では仕様が収束しないと言うことが判明して、結局バイナリ互換性は放棄した。だから、1.9.xでは1.9.1の拡張ライブラリは動かない、ということがあり得る。その場合でも可能な限り再コンパイルだけで動くようにする予定だけれども。
メンテナンスを望む声は私も仕事上のRubyプログラム保守経験から賛同する。だから、何も放棄ししたくて放棄するわけではない。たぶんだけど、1.8.5のメンテナンスを担当しますという立候補は歓迎されるんじゃないだろうか。私もなー、1.9のメンテナンスにフルタイムで従事する選択肢があれば考える。
ともあれ、誰がなにかしないことには状況は改善しない。マシン、お金、メンテナとしての立候補、バグ報告、コンパイル成功報告、導入事例、なんでもいいから。Ruby 1.9がenterprise readyであるためにはまだまだ協力をお願いしたい分野がいっぱいある。

A Muslim cleric has caused public outrage in Indonesia after marrying a 12 - year - old girl .
Pujianto Cahyo Widianto married the girl in the central Java city of Semarang , during an unofficial religious ceremony .
He reportedly chose her from a pool of 20 girls , before flying to Singapore with his new bride , as well as his first wife .
Police have launched an investigation into the incident .
Possible charges
Investigators from Indonesia 's child protection agency said Mr Widianto had chosen the girl based on her intelligence , maturity and physical development .
They said Mr Widianto , who runs an Islamic boarding school , had planned to put the child in charge of his second business - a calligraphy workshop .
It is unclear if the marriage has been consummated .
If it has , Mr Widianto could face charges under child protection , marriage and labour laws .
He is reported to have justified his actions by saying he was emulating Islam 's Prophet Muhammad , and that he would wait until his wife reached puberty before having sex with her .
But there has been fierce reaction to the marriage within Indonesia .
A senior member of the prominent Islamic party , PKS , said he thought Mr Widianto was wrong in what he was doing , and wrong in his thinking about Islam .
Police say they have not asked Singapore to extradite the cleric , but are continuing investigations .

We first saw Sean Casey 's latest and greatest in mobile tornado chasing insanity , the TIV - 2 , in a spy photo back in May , but now Sean 's given us this exclusive first - hand look at the truck - based tech - filled tank here at SEMA and the scoop on what to expect from the TIV - 3 for next season 's Discovery Channel show , " Storm Chasers . "
When we first saw the TIV - 2 in those spy photos in May , details were thin .
We did n't even realize it was his sequel to the original Tornado Intercept Vehicle ( TIV ) .
Now the TIV - 2 is the star of Discovery Channel 's " Storm Chasers " which debuted it 's latest season in mid-October .
The original TIV was based around a two wheel drive Ford F - 450 with a completely redesigned body optimized for protection and low to the ground with deployable ground anchors to keep winds from upending the vehicle .
While the approach worked in concept , out on the trail of tornadoes it did n't turn out so well , getting hung up on road debris and downed trees .
The original was more or less limited to on - road use — a type of geographic limiter tornadoes do n't maintain .
In addition to the low ground clearance , the incredibly high weight kept the truck 's top speed to a mere 61 MPH .
That 's where the TIV2 comes in .
The first thing you notice from the new chase vehicle is it has sides fitted with hydraulic skirts that can be dropped down to direct high - speed wind safely around the truck .
Whether the skirts are down or up , this sucker 's imposing thanks to a chassis based on the 2008 Dodge 2500 4x4 with a 1/8th inch welded steel plate body over a steel frame .
The chassis was originally strengthened by the now defunct USA 6X6 and welding students at Great Plains Technical Center .
We say originally because the USA 6X6 design kept snapping rear shafts due to the 17,500 lb. weight of the vehicle .
A new shop put two Dana 80s in the back and that 's helped .
Power comes from a 6.7 liter Cummins turbodiesel outfitted with propane and water injection — two methods for building muscle on demand , all the way up to 625 HP .
That power goes to good use too , the truck has three driven axles with two sets of dual tires on the back , all of which can be locked in for total forward power and have a self leveling mechanism to keep everything flat on awkward terrain .
The fun stuff does n't stop there .
The raison d'etre for the TIV2 is what it can do with the turret up top — film super high resolution IMAX video for a mega - screen movie about tornadoes .
The turret is constructed from steel plate , laminated tempered glass and polycarbonate sheets and can rotate 360 degrees to get what ever shot is needed .
Just behind the turret is the science mast , used to measure wind speed , relative humidity and barometric pressure .
The mast can actually fold down for clearance when the surroundings close in on the TIV - 2 .
As we said , all that steel and gear adds up , giving this baby a scale - tipping 17,500 lbs fully loaded , an asset when you do n't want to get picked up and tossed like a rag doll .
What 's doubly funny about this thing is with its 92 gallon fuel tank , the truck has a range of about 750 miles with this monster returning the same fuel mileage as a Hummer H2 at 12 MPG .
How that works out we have no idea .
On the inside there 's more levers and buttons than you can shake a stick at — everything from hydraulics to lower this beast and make it hug the ground and provide the necessary ground - hugging downforce when an F - 3 comes roaring overhead , to the Kicker speaker system wired into the CB radio in order to hear spotters on the line when trees are coming straight toward you .
They also have their very own mapping and topography system which , unfortunately , was n't plugged in and ready to go when we showed up .
But , the other scoop we learned is that Casey wants the next TIV , the TIV - 3 , to be a Baja pre-runner with a mid-mounted engine and the ability to really drop the truck to the lowest degree possible — a mere 4 feet tall when lowered for tornado - bunkering .
Now that 's a truck we want to see .
You can see Sean Casey and the rest of his team , along with the TIV2 do their thing on the Discovery Channel at 10 PM eastern .
We 're wondering if we ask nicely , when the the TIV2 has lived out its years , if Casey and Co. will donate it to Jalopnik 's Post - Apocalyptic Vehicle garage .
GIVING NEW MEANING TO BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME STORM CHASERS ROARS BACK FOR SECOND SEASON ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL —
All new original series premieres Sunday , October 19 , 2008 , at 10 PM ( ET / PT ) — ( Silver Spring , Md. ) –- Discovery Channel returns to the nation 's heartland - Tornado Alley - for a firsthand look at one of nature 's most destructive forces in an all new season of STORM CHASERS , premiering Sunday , October 19 , 2008 , at 10 PM ( ET / PT ) .
Veteran research meteorologist Dr. Joshua Wurman , IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey and chaser prodigy Reed Timmer all race to capture rare footage and valuable scientific data .
Last season , Casey 's tank - like Tornado Intercept Vehicle ( TIV ) , raised eyebrows roaring down the nation 's highways and byways looking for the shot of all time – filming from inside a tornado .
Now , his new and improved creation , the TIV - 2 , raises the stakes , providing not only astonishing footage and but also new information on how tornados are formed , grow and travel – research that can be used to increase early warning systems and save lives .
" Mixing science , fear and a good old fashioned American road trip STORM CHASERS packs a torrent of excitement , knowledge and entertainment for the ultimate in television immersion , " said John Ford , president and general manager , Discovery Channel .
Casey and Wurman make an unlikely team .
Filming from the turret of his self - designed and self - built TIV - 2 , Casey risks his life to get the most elusive tornado footage ever shot .
As the leader of the team , Wurman guides the TIV from inside his own vehicle command post , The Doppler on Wheels ( DOW ) .
He makes split - second life - or - death decisions based on information from Doppler radar ; as the safety of the entire team rests on his shoulders .
Hot on their trail , and often one step ahead , is storm chasing wunderkind Timmer , a PhD candidate in Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma and , ironically , a former student of Wurman .
Timmer and his rag tag team of buddies Joel ( driver ) and Chris ( hailstone collector ) , track storms in their unique way .
Freed from complicated on - board computer systems and intricate vehicle design , the threesome set a course for surprise and adventure .
STORM CHASERS is produced for Discovery Channel by Original Media .
Charlie Corwin , Lisa Bloch and Clara Markowicz are executive producers for Original Media .

STORM CHASERS Storm Facts
What is Tornado Alley ?
Tornado
Alley is a nickname in the popular media for a broad swath of relatively high tornado occurrence in the central U.S. Violent or killer tornadoes do happen outside this Tornado Alley every year .
Tornadoes can occur almost anywhere in the U.S. , including west of the Rockies and east of the Appalachians — and even in Canada and overseas .
What is tornado season ?
Tornadoes can happen any time of year if the conditions are right .
However , tornado season usually refers to the peak period for historical tornado reports in an area .
There is a general northward shift in " tornado season " in the U.S. from late winter through mid summer .
The peak period for tornadoes in the southern plains , for example , is during May into early June .
On the Gulf coast , it is earlier during the spring ; in the northern plains and upper Midwest , it is June or July .
How many people are killed every year by tornadoes ?
How do most deaths happen in tornadoes ?
On average , tornadoes kill about 60 people per year — most from flying or falling debris .
How many tornadoes hit the U.S. each year ?
About one thousand .
The actual average is unknown , because tornado spotting and reporting methods have changed so much in the last several decades that the officially recorded tornado climatologies are believed to be incomplete .
Also , in the course of recording thousands of tornadoes , errors are bound to occur .
Events can be missed or mis-classified ; and some non-damaging tornadoes in remote areas could still be unreported .
What was the strongest tornado ?
What is the highest wind speed in a tornado ?
Nobody knows .
Tornado wind speeds have only been directly recorded in the weaker ones , because strong and violent tornadoes destroy weather instruments .
Mobile Doppler radars such as the OU Doppler on Wheels have remotely sensed tornado wind speeds above ground level as high as about 302 mph ( on 3 May 1999 near Bridge Creek OK ) — the highest winds ever found near earth 's surface by any means .
[ That tornado caused F5 damage . ]
But ground - level wind speeds in the most violent tornadoes have never been directly measured

Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has joined Twitter .
The Prime Minister ’s Twitter account , presumably updated by staff comes as part of the launch of the KevinPM site , a tame take on the Obama campaign ’s social media outreach during the US Presidential Election .
Along with his Twitter account , the Prime Minister also has links to accounts on Flickr , MySpace , Facebook and YouTube .
Rudd comes late to Twitter in Australia , with Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull having joined Twitter in mid-October .
Notably Turnbull regularly updates his account himself .
The first Prime Ministerial tweet reads “ Looking forward to communicating with you on Twitter . ”
Video from KevinPM as follows , and his Twitter account here .
Lets just hope he does n’t say anything to controversial , otherwise his own Government will have to censor it ;-)
Resampled Space [ Image : Photo by Filip Dujardin , courtesy of the artist ] .
Belgian photographer Mark Magazine explains .
The resulting projects look like old factory sites in the American rust belt – Mark describes them as " informal and often dilapidated structures with unspecified functions " – or , in some cases , new projects by
[ Image : Photo by Filip Dujardin , courtesy of the artist ] .
From Mark Magazine : Every montage , says Dujardin , is one project .
It begins with an idea for a specific image .
Often he starts off by building a model of the form he is trying to achieve – at first in cardboard , but he has recently discovered SketchUp .
He then goes on a photo safari , often just around the corner , to find suitable buildings " with a lot of the same things , " so that they can be cut and pasted and serve as building material .
In fact most of the fictional structures are buildings in Ghent , just resampled
There seem to be multiple sub - themes , and even sub - projects , within the larger effort .
There are surreal detached structures , for instance , like the image that opens this post , standing free amidst a recognizable but anonymous landscape .
In some of these we see that even geological forms become subject to resampling .
[ Image : Photo by Filip Dujardin , courtesy of the artist ] .
But then there are also what could be called a back series – that is , the backs of incredible buildings whose facades you can barely imagine .
These are groves of architecture , weird islands of form , like the city as seen from a rail line : sheds and retaining walls , stained by rain , their bricks chipped away behind piles of rubbish , their corrugated steel repeating ever onward in infinite ridges .
[ Images : Photos by Filip Dujardin , courtesy of the artist ] .
Then there are Dujardin 's relatively well - known images of impossible structures , buildings made from ambitious cantilevers and strained central masts .
They form vertical braidworks of halls and corridors woven through the sky above otherwise empty parks and dead fields .

That I actually want to play at being an architect , instead of only recording the buildings of others . "

The yellow - pages industry is running out of lifelines .
In recent years , as its customers migrated to the Web -- flocking to sites like Google -- the telephone - directory business followed , hoping the Internet would be its salvation .
But that strategy has n't panned out .
Now , the economic downturn is sending the already ailing business into a ...
Security researcher Stephan Chenette opened up to eWEEK about a new Web attack vector that could potentially render desktop and gateway anti-virus products useless .
Chenette , manager of security research at Websense , calls the attack script fragmentation .
Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks , it involves breaking down Web exploits into smaller pieces and distributing them in a synchronous manner to evade anti-malware signature detection .
" What this attack enables you to do is really get exploit code from the server into the browser memory and trigger the exploit , " Chenette said .
" Once you actually are able to trigger that exploit , you own that machine , so that means you can disable anti-virus , you can disable any protection mechanism after the fact . "
How will botnets change tactics to stay active ?
Click here to read more .
The attack works like this : Malware authors write benign client code and embed it in a Web page .
The only content contained on the initial page will be a small JavaScript routine utilizing XHR or XDR .
This code contains no actual malicious content , and the same type of code is found on all of the major legitimate Web 2.0 sites .
When a user visits the Web page , the JavaScript and the XDR or XHR will slowly request more code from other Web servers a few bytes at a time , thereby only allowing a user 's gateway anti-virus engine to analyze a few seemingly innocuous bytes as it tries to determine whether or not the Web site is malicious .
Once received by the client , the bytes are stored in an internal JavaScript variable .
The client will request more and more information until all the information has been transferred .
Once it has been transferred JavaScript will be used to create a Script element within the DOM ( Document Object Model ) of the browser and add the information as text to the node .
This in turn will cause a change to the DOM and execute the code in the script element .
According to Chenette , the entire process - from data being transferred over the network to triggering JavaScript within the DOM - can slip under the radar because no malicious content touches the file system .
It 's done completely in memory , and any content that is transferred over the network is done in such tiny fragments that anti-virus engines parsing the information do n't have enough context or information to match any signatures .
The attack , which has not been seen in the wild by Websense , works on all the major browsers .
Technically , however , it is not a browser vulnerability - it merely takes advantage of the way browsers work .
Given that much of Web - based malware is distributed through compromised sites as opposed to rogue sites created by attackers , the method poses a significant threat in today 's non-static , Web 2.0 environment , Chenette said .
While disabling JavaScript , for example , would prevent the attack , that 's not a realistic answer for most Web users .
" The problem with not allowing scripting is you break the functionality of almost all the top 50 Web sites that require JavaScript to be enabled , " Chenette said .
" One of the things that security vendors have to do is start understanding that we live now in a Web 2.0 world , not a Web 1.0 world , where active content is something we need to deal with everyday .
That is the content that needs to be scanned ... it is very important not only to look at the static content that has been put on disk but be able to detect changes inside of the browser . "
FreeBSD 6.4-RELEASE
Announcement
The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 6.4 - RELEASE .
At this time 6.4 - RELEASE is expected to be the last of the 6 - STABLE releases .
Some of the highlights :
New and much - improved NFS Lock Manager ( NLM ) client
Support for the Camellia cipher
boot loader changes allow , among other things , booting from USB devices and booting from GPT - labeled devices with GPT - enabled BIOSes
DVD install ISO images for amd64/i386
KDE updated to 3.5.10 , GNOME updated to 2.22.3
Updates for BIND , sendmail , OpenPAM , and others
For a complete list of new features and known problems , please see the online release notes and errata list , available at :
For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities , please see :
http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/
The FreeBSD Security Team intends to support 6.4- RELEASE until November 30th , 2010 .
Availability
FreeBSD 6.4- RELEASE is now available for the amd64 , i386 , pc98 , and sparc64 architectures .
The builds for the alpha architecture have not completed yet and will be announced later .
FreeBSD 6.4 - RELEASE can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network ; the required files can be downloaded via FTP or BitTorrent as described in the sections below .
While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures , they will all generally contain the more common ones , such as i386 and amd64 .
MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO images are included at the bottom of this message .
The contents of the ISO images provided as part of the release has changed for most of the architectures .
Using the i386 architecture as an example , there are ISO images named " bootonly " , " disc1 " , " disc2 " , " disc3 " , " docs " , and " dvd1 " .
The " bootonly " image is suitable for booting a machine to do a network based installation using FTP or NFS .
The " disc1 " , " disc2 " , and " disc3 " images are CDROM - sized ( 700 MB media ) and are used to do a full installation that includes a basic set of packages and does not require network access to an FTP or NFS server during the installation .
In addition , " disc1 " supports booting into a " live CD - based filesystem " and system rescue mode .
The " docs " image has all of the documentation for all supported languages .
The " dvd1 " image is DVD - sized and includes everything that is on the CDROM discs .
So " dvd1 " can be used to do a full installation that includes a basic set of packages , it has all of the documentation for all supported languages , and it can be used for booting into a " live CD - based filesystem " and system rescue mode .
Most people will find that " disc1 " , " disc2 " and " disc3 " are all that are needed if their machine does not have a DVD - capable drive .
For people with machines that do have a DVD - capable drive " dvd1 " should be all that is required .
If you intend to install ports from source instead of using the pre-built packages included with the release only " disc1 " is needed .
FreeBSD 6.4 - RELEASE can also be purchased on CD - ROM from several vendors .
One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 6.4 - based products is :
BitTorrent
6.4-RELEASE ISOs are available via BitTorrent .
A collection of torrent files to download the images is available at :
http://torrents.freebsd.org:8080
FTP
At the time of this announcement the following FTP sites have FreeBSD 6.4 - RELEASE available .
However before trying these sites you may want to check your regional mirror (s ) first by going to :
ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.
FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD
Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2 , ftp3 and so on .

FreeBSD Update
The freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases .
Systems running 6.3- RELEASE , 6.4- BETA , 6.4- RC1 , or 6.4 - RC2 can upgrade as follows :
# freebsd - update upgrade -r 6.4- RELEASE
During this process , FreeBSD
Update may ask the user to help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that the automatically performed merging was done correctly .
# freebsd - update install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# shutdown -r now
After rebooting , freebsd - update needs to be run again to install the new userland components , and the system needs to be rebooted again :
# freebsd - update install
# shutdown -r now
Note that FreeBSD Update stores downloaded upgrades in / var / db / freebsd - update , so at least 400 MB should be free in / var before running freebsd - update ; if the / var partition is too small , the -d option to freebsd - update can be used to indicate that the upgrades should be stored in a different directory .
For more information , see :

Conclusion -- Screaming Fast With Overclocking " Protection "
Unlike the Core 2 Quads , which still consisted of two dual - core CPUs , the Core i7 is a native quad - core processor .
On the whole , the new processors are more efficient , although the system does draw more power at the platform level than the previous generation .
The performance comparison with long - time rival AMD ’s offerings is nothing short of painful .
The fastest Core i7 , the 965 Extreme , is 64 % faster than AMD ’s current flagship CPU , the Phenom X4 9950 BE .
Across our benchmark suite , the AMD processors never placed better than towards the lower middle of the field , tending instead to fill the lower spots .
However , Intel has also created some competition for itself , because the Core i7 is clearly superior to the Core 2 CPUs where performance is concerned .
Surprisingly , the reintroduction of Hyper - Threading technology has no small part in this performance leap .
The platform itself brings a few drawbacks to the table , at present .
The new CPUs will only work on expensive boards based on Intel ’s current high - end chipset , the X58 .
Also , it runs exclusively with DDR3 memory , which is n’t exactly cheap either .
The new LGA1366 socket also requires a new cooler .
Meanwhile , AMD falls even further behind in the x86 performance rankings , leaving price as its only counter - argument .

Now you can catch all my mistakes .
An apt intro to this post :
Stimulus Package Will Be Waiting for Obama Democratic sources tell ABC News that President - elect Obama 's transition team " is working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill so that on Mr. Obama 's first day in office , January 20 , 2009 , an economic stimulus package has passed both house of Congress and is awaiting his signature . "
Reports suggest the size of the package may be $ 700 billion .
The markets are up 311 as I type this .
Liveblogging Obama's Big Presser
Obama
Tim Geithner
Larry Summers :
Christina Romer
Melody Barnes
Q : Where is the money going to come from ?
O :
The most important thing is that we have a consensus between conservative and liberal economist that we need a big stimulus package to jolt the economy back into shape , create 2.5 million jobs .
Make sure the financial system is stable , too ,
Q : Could n't hear this one .
O :
Q : Size of stimulus package ... as much as one trillion ?
O :
Q : Bush administration has been criticized for taking an ad hoc approach .
How will you differ ?
O :
Q : Auto hearings ... did they make their case ?
O :
Q : How should the second half of the rescue money be spent ?
Are you talking to the administration ?
O
: The economy sucks [ obviously paraphrased ] .
We ca n't underestimate our capacity to overcome these challenges .
It wo n't be easy .
We need the best minds to guide us , which is what I sought to do in assembling my economic team .
They share my belief that we can't have a thriving Wall St. w/o having a thriving Main St.
He names : Geithner , Summers , Romer , and Barnes . ( treasury ) will waste no time , and already has insight into the markets and ways to revive them .
It 's a global crisis , and we 'll need to reach out to countries around the world .
He has international experience , so he is uniquely suited ....
He speaks Japanese and Chinese ...
He 's served under Dems and Republicans ...
He 's been an honest broker ...( head of economic council ) Brings skill , intellect , experience ...
He has guided us through many international crises ...
[ Listing his accomplishments ] ...
He 's earned a global reputation of getting to the heart of challenges ...
He 'll coordinate economic policy in the White House . ( chair of econ .
advisors ) : Leading macro economist and historian .
[ giving her resume now ]
Has researched tax policy and recessions , praise from Rs and Dems . ( dir. of domestic policy council ) , working with team to chart course to economic recovery : Health care reform included .
[ giving her resume now ]
Was chief council to Ted Kennedy .
Protected civil and women 's rights , religious freedom .
He 's outlining his goals ... saving jobs , Wall St./ Main St. recovery ...
Restore confidence in markets as well as middle class families ...
He wants daily briefings from his team ...
Hopefully the new Congress will get to work immediately on an economic plan to hit the ground running .
Families can't keep waiting / hoping for a solution .
...
This will not be easy , no shortcuts or quick fixes to something that 's been many years in the making .
Full recovery will not happen immediately .
There will be meaningful cuts in the budget ... and sacrifices .
I believe in the spirit and resilience of this nation .
We 'll succeed if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together .
I want to see it enacted right away , but can't get into number right now .
My team will shape the details .simultaneously .
We have to invest in clean energy , in health care , education to remain competitive .
So deal with immediate crisis and lay groundwork for longterm growth .
My plan represents a net tax cut. 95 % of workers will get a net tax cut .
That 's important because it 's good for families plus we need it for stimulus .
Put money in pockets so people can buy computers for school , deal with heat , groceries , etc .
Plus , restore balance to our tax code .
The Bush cuts were targeted to the wealthiest .
To help pay for some of these expenditures , those who can pay more should pay more , whether through repeal or through not renewing tax cuts ... my team will advise .
But tax cuts will go to the vast majority of Americans .
And the wealthiest will pay a little bit more .
I can't discuss numbers right now .
The team needs to recommend .
There is a consensus across the political spectrum that we need a significant stimulus to jolt the economy .
It needs to put people back to work , make investments , restore confidence in the business community that it will have customers .
We 'll do what 's required .
It 'll be costly .
Even if we did nothing for the rest of this year , we 'll have a substantial deficit next year .
Now we 're adding , how do we pay for it ?
Answer :
We have to first focus on getting economy back on track , create 2.5 million jobs , invest in growth over the long term .
Then , reform how business is done in Washington , how the budgeting process works ... so that we have a path towards a responsible budget scenario down the line .
Short term :
Boost the economy , create jobs .
Long term : Reforms in Washington .
I do n't want to look backwards .
We have an unprecedented crisis .
Some things did n't work , Paulson admits that .
I want to make sure that moving forward , we are articulating what our end goals are , clarity and transparency to our plan .
There may be adjustments , to adapt to the situation .
But we want to provide clarity , not confusion .
Plus :
Even as we do what we must to stabilize the financial system , we also must recognize that a strong Main St. will reinforce a strong Wall St. Address home foreclosures , things that take place outside of Wall St .
They have been the backbone of U.S. manufacturing .
It 's not just them , it 's all the suppliers and related businesses that are at stake .
We can't allow the auto industry to vanish .
And we can't just write a blank check to them .
I was surprised that they did n't have a better thought - out proposal .
Congress told them to come up with a plan .
We should help them , but we should expect than any help is designed for a strong , sustainable industry .
They need to give us some clarity .
We 're entering into a new energy economy that 's competitive globally .
That 's the kind of plan we need to see , not more job loss . : I spoke to Bush and Bernanke today .
We have to do what is required to keep the financial system working and capital flowing , important for all of us .
Bush has said he has the same attitude .
A lot of authority has been given to the administration .
We need to make sure that authority is used forcefully to stabilize the situation in the coming weeks .
I 'll make further assessments as the administration and Paulson / Bernanke provide me information .
There 's only $ 60 billion left of the first $ 350 billion tranche of what was once known as the Trash Asset Removal Plan ( and is now known as the only pot of available money in the world ) .
So many companies of all shapes , sizes , and flavors are demanding cash that Treasury can barely process the requests .
Congress will presumably order the Treasury to immediately begin doling out the second $ 350 billion , which , a few months ago , was seen as a sort of " just in case " reserve fund .
No more .
In addition to the nine banks that got $ 125 billion shoved down their throats , the TARP has gone to a crowd of smaller banks and AIG , which just gulped down another $ 40 billion .
Next up is Fannie Mae , which lost $ 29 billion yesterday , and General Motors and Ford , which are running on fumes .
WSJ : The rescue efforts are " evolving in ways that I do n't think anyone anticipated , " said Camden Fine , president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America , a trade group .
" Things are just hitting them from every single direction , every day , and I do n't think they know whether to spit or go blind . "
Meanwhile , when Hank Paulson goes hat in hand to Congress to ask them to approve the next $ 350 billion , he 'll likely get the Greenspan treatment :
The Treasury secretary is likely to face a hostile reception from lawmakers angry over Treasury 's reluctance to aid the auto industry as well as its decision not to force banks receiving government assistance to lend out those funds to consumers and small businesses .
And that 's only the beginning of what Congress is angry about .
Remember how a key part of the TARP 's success was going to be a Darwinian survival of the fittest , in which the Treasury gave money only to the strongest banks and let the weak ones die ?
Well , that 's backasswards , says Sen.
Schumer :
Sen .
Charles Schumer of New York said lawmakers want Treasury to put in place new requirements to encourage lending and to focus the program on struggling , not healthy , institutions .
Mr. Schumer also wants
Treasury to widen the scope of the program to include a greater variety of financial firms .
Get ready for TARP II .

After midnight Sunday , John Osnes , a pianist who performed jazz standards and Beatles songs at piano bars in Hollywood , put an empty glass down on the counter of one of his favorite haunts , The Spotlight , and waved goodbye to an employee .
“ He said , ‘ Benji , I will see you tomorrow for sure , ’ ” bartender Benjamin Avery recalled .
An hour later , Osnes , 55 , lay dying in a crosswalk a few blocks away , the victim , police say , of a violent road rage attack by a Swedish hip - hop artist .
The rapper , David Moses Jassy , also known as Dave Monopoly , 34 , made a brief appearance in Superior Court on Wednesday .
His arraignment was postponed a week to allow him to hire an attorney .
Advertisement
According to authorities , Osnes , who did not own a car and was a stickler for pedestrian rights , was crossing a street near his residence when Jassy ’s rented SUV drifted into the crosswalk .
After Osnes struck the front of the vehicle with his hands , Jassy allegedly got out , punched Osnes , kicked him in the head when he stooped to recover his glasses and then ran over him with the vehicle .
Bystanders , including an off - duty Anaheim police officer , witnessed the assault and tried unsuccessfully to detain Jassy , according to authorities .
Osnes was pronounced dead at a hospital , and Jassy was arrested Monday after investigators traced the license of his rented vehicle .
He faces charges of assault , battery and leaving the scene of an accident , but the district attorney ’s office is mulling additional counts depending on autopsy results and further investigation .
Although he identifies himself as the “ CEO of Jassy World Entertainment ” on his MySpace page , Jassy is a minor music industry player whose biggest accomplishment to date is rapping on an album track for “ High School Musical ” actress Ashley Tisdale .
Advertisement
Avery , the bartender , came to court for the short hearing , in part , he said , to see what sort of man would hurt Osnes , who he described as rail - thin and “ frail . ”
Jail records show that Jassy outweighed Osnes -- who friends say weighed about 150 -- by 50 pounds .
“ I guess I was expecting someone who was really gangster or homeless , but he does n’t appear that way , ” Avery said of Jassy , a trim man with light eyes and a shaved head .
Before the short hearing , Jassy huddled in a holding pen with a public defender , an interpreter and a representative from the Swedish Consulate .
When he spotted a contingent of journalists from his homeland , some armed with video and still cameras , he pulled his blue jail - issue shirt over his head and kept it there as Commissioner Henry Hall asked if he agreed to the postponement .
“ Yes , ” he shouted through the shirt .
Advertisement
The public defender said Jassy planned to meet with a private attorney in jail after the hearing .
If he makes his $ 1 - million bail , Hall said , Jassy will be required to turn over his passport and wear an electronic tracking device .
Osnes never owned a car , and friends and relatives said inconsiderate drivers were his pet peeve .
“ He was a very strong advocate for pedestrians , ” said his sister - in - law , Darcy Bushnell .
Bushnell attended the hearing on behalf of Osnes ’ father and sisters .
Her partner , Osnes ’ sister Kris , is in “ end- stage ” emphysema and is awaiting a lung transplant at their home in Albuquerque , Bushnell said .
She said that despite his piano gigs and part - time work as a travel agent , Osnes made time every day to speak with his ailing sister .

“ He was instrumental in keeping her from feeling lonely , ” Bushnell said , her eyes reddening .
She said Kris Osnes is trying to balance her grief with her illness , because “ if she cries , she ca n’t breathe . ”

There are 351 men in California locked up in a state mental hospital as sexually violent predators , prone to attack again and again .
Then there is Charlotte Mae Thrailkill .
The 43 - year - old mother of two is California ’s only female violent sex offender , confined to a maximum - security state mental hospital after experts decided she was too dangerous for release .
Only a handful of women , including Thrailkill , have ever been confined to mental institutions under state laws that allow for civil commitments of sex criminals after they have served their prison terms .

Women are less likely than men to commit sex offenses , but they also are less likely to be reported and prosecuted .
Many experts contend that women commit sex offenses far more often than is generally believed .
“ It happens a lot more than gets reported , and I think part of that is due to our culture , ” said Steven B. Blum , a consulting psychologist to a sex offender program in Nebraska .
“ There are a lot of women who have sexual contact with teenage boys , and they do n’t get reported . ”
In the state ’s regular prison system , only 103 of the 9,746 women behind bars -- 1.06 % -- are there for sex offenses , including statutory rape and lewd acts with children .
That compares with about 12,500 men , 8 % of the total male prison population .
Paul Federoff , a forensic psychiatrist in Ottawa , Canada , said one of the female sex offenders he counsels is an exhibitionist .
She opens her living room curtains and strips off her clothes when people pass by .

He told her that unless she stopped this illegal activity , she would be arrested .
“ ‘ Doctor , if someone calls up and says he saw me disrobing in the window , who do you think they are going arrest ?
Me or him ? ’ ” Federoff said she replied .
“ And she is absolutely right . ”
It was widely assumed until recently that women just did n’t sexually abuse children , Federoff said .

But during the past two decades , as parents and others have encouraged children to disclose improper sexual behavior , kids have been confiding about abuse by women as well as men .
“ Now we are discovering that there are a lot of women who do sexually abuse children , but they get away with it , ” Federoff said .
“ There is a growth industry of treatment programs , particularly for adolescent female sex offenders who commit a lot of the crimes while they are baby - sitting . ”
Thrailkill , whose sexual predator status is up for review by the state in September , told psychiatrists she molested children , ages 5 to 8 , whom she baby - sat or enticed into her Santa Rosa apartment to play with her children .
Her story , pieced together from court records , is a less a rarity than crime statistics suggest .

Thrailkill , the third of six children , was born with scoliosis and a deformity in her mouth that caused speech difficulties .
“ She stated that school was difficult for her , not only due to her learning difficulties but also due to constant ridicule by her peers because of her physical deformities , ” according to a state mental heath report on file in Santa Rosa .
When older children picked on her during elementary school , “ she would then bully and beat smaller , defenseless children , ” according to the May 2000 report .
She told counselors that she had a good relationship with her father , but complained that her mother regularly beat her with narrow leather straps , sticks and her fists .
Thrailkill ran away several times between the ages of 11 and 16 and was gang - raped at age 15 , she told authorities , by four men who grabbed her off a street .
That same year she was severely wounded in a random shooting and spent nine months in a hospital .
She never returned to school .

Thrailkill married a U.S. Marine at 19 .
They had two daughters .
She left him five years later , complaining their marriage was sexless , and won custody of their daughters .

Women who commit sex offenses often fit into one of three categories .
The “ teacher - lover ” or “ Mrs. Robinson ” type has sex with underage boys .
These women fancy themselves in love with the boy and do n’t see the relationships as harmful , experts say .
Advertisement
The women tend to be immature and get an “ ego boost ” from the involvement , said Blum , the Nebraska psychologist , who counsels such offenders .
“ Without exception , all of our patients have had a substance abuse problem and also were partying with their victims , ” he said .
“ Generally the male does n’t feel victimized , ” he said .
“ A lot of teenage boys would see that as their lucky day . ”
Despite such perceptions , researchers maintain that many boys may be left confused and angry , and if they are particularly young , they may be sexualized too early and have sexual problems later in life .
Women who have sex with minors make the same kinds of excuses as their male counterparts , said Florence Wolfe , co-director of Northwest Treatment Associates , a Seattle - based program for sex offenders .

Wolfe said the women tell her : “ ‘ I wanted the closeness , the excitement , not the sex .
I wanted the safety .
He was 13 .
I was only 27 .
The kid wanted it .’ ”
A study of college students and prisoners found that 16 % of the college men and 46 % of the male prisoners reported they had sexual experience before the age of 16 with a woman at least five years older .
The average age of the men at the time of the contact was 12 .
A second type of offender is called “ predisposed ” and includes mothers who molest their children .
Wolfe says more than 50 % of the 150 female offenders she has counseled molested their own children , primarily daughters .

Some women considered predisposed to sexually molest children are pedophiles with an assortment of mental illnesses .
Wolfe described one such offender she has met as a sexual sadist .
“ She looks like everybody ’s lovable grandmother : pink cheeks , gray hair , chunky , ” Wolfe said .
“ She volunteered to baby - sit for young single moms .
They jumped at the chance . ”
Most of this offender ’s victims were girls , and most were not yet verbal .
The woman would slap them until their teeth cut their mouths or start a nosebleed .
Their pain gave her sexual pleasure , Wolfe said .
“ She finally molested a 4 - year - old , and that kid was verbal enough to tell someone , ” Wolfe said .

The third type of female sex criminal is called the “ male - coerced ” or “ male - accompanied ” offender .
These women commit sex crimes in the company of a man .
Thrailkill , who declined to be interviewed for this story , fits in this category .
*
Thrailkill told psychologists that she had sex with 20 to 50 different men in the year after her divorce .
She eventually met Daryl Ball and allowed him and his young sons to move into her apartment in Santa Rosa .
Ball introduced Thrailkill to sex with children , according to a state Mental Health Department report filed with Santa Rosa Superior Court .
Thrailkill at the time was thin , with long , dark blond hair .
She looked older than her 27 years .
She was quiet , shy and submissive , attorneys recall .

Seven years her senior , Ball was a brutal boyfriend , Thrailkill told others .
She said he violently sodomized her , threw her from a car once and beat her to unconsciousness twice .
She molested his sons , police said .
Not only was Ball aware of the molestations , he joined her in having sex with children , police and criminal records say .
Ball and Thrailkill had sex a couple of times a day with children and with as many as five children at a time , she told psychiatrists .
The victims were her boyfriend ’s sons and other children in the apartment complex whom Thrailkill baby - sat or lured into their apartment .
During the eight months in which she molested , Thrailkill drank and used methamphetamine , first snorting the drug and later injecting it , she told mental health workers .

“ When she was intoxicated , she was sexually promiscuous , violent and sexually perverse , ” according to a May 2001 report by the state Department of Mental Health .
Both Thrailkill and Ball threatened the children that their parents or siblings would be killed if they told anyone .
Eventually , one of the children did tell , and Thrailkill and Ball were arrested .
When a parent of one of the victims confronted Thrailkill , she said she molested because she was “ afraid ” of Ball , who was then 34 .
“ He made me do it , ” she said .
Advertisement
But in records on file at the Santa Rosa courthouse , Thrailkill admitted she molested five children -- four boys and one girl - - on her own .
She said she abused them to get even with the victims ’ parents .
Thrailkill typically endured extensive mistreatment in relationships , a mental health evaluation found .
When she finally felt sufficiently hurt by the abuse , she lashed out at others .
“ She admits she takes anger out on weaker , often innocent individuals , ” a mental health counselor wrote .

A 1981 national study of both reported and unreported child abuse indicated that as many as 24 % of boys and 14 % of girls who are molested are victimized by women .
Although sexual abuse by both men and women is underreported , female offenders are less likely than men to be prosecuted .
“ I have had so many clients , both males and females , who talked about mothers or their baby - sitters molesting them , ” said Charlene Steen , a psychologist in Napa who has treated sex offenders for 20 years .
“ And they were never reported . ”
Dr. Robert Kolodny , who has directed behavioral research institutes and written about sexual behavior , said he periodically gets calls from befuddled prosecutors who have cases in which a man has accused a woman of rape .
Advertisement
“ Although it sounds counterintuitive , men can indeed be raped , ” Kolodny said .
People commonly assume that men cannot be forced into sex against their will .
But experts say men may be physically capable of sex even while under extreme duress .
Female rapists are sometimes acquaintances of their victims and get them drunk or drugged before they force them to submit to sexual acts .
“ We do n’t really have good studies that would give us an accurate picture of how often it happens , but it is not rare ... not a one - in - a - thousand kind of thing , ” Kolodny said .

Some case studies describe rapes of men committed by two or more women .
In a report in the Archives of Sexual Behavior , two physicians described 11 cases of rapes of men , including a man who picked up a woman in a bar and then went to a motel with her .
The man had a drink and fell asleep , the 1982 report said .
When he awoke , he was gagged , blindfolded and tied to the bed .
He heard the voices of several women .
Steen , who is also a lawyer , described one man who was drugged and raped by two women and a man .
The victim was later found wandering the streets with his clothes tied around his neck .
Observed Steen : “ There are women out there who are doing some pretty horrible things . ”

Thrailkill initially faced more than 50 counts of felony child molesting .
She pleaded no contest in 1988 to five counts of molestation in exchange for a 14 - year prison sentence .
Ball , whom Thrailkill married after the arrests but divorced while in prison , pleaded no contest to several counts of lewd and lascivious conduct upon children and was sentenced to 24 years in prison .
Thrailkill began serving her sentence in September 1988 and was paroled in September 1994 .
She then worked in construction and had what court records described as two “ normal ” relationships with adult men .

In July 1996 , she violated her parole by using alcohol , associating with convicted sex offenders and having contact with children .
She returned to prison and again was paroled in March 1998 .
Within a month , parole was revoked because she had used alcohol .
The state began proceedings to commit her as a sex predator , and she did not oppose the effort .
Marie Case , a Santa Rosa criminal defense lawyer who represented her , said Thrailkill was “ intimidated by the whole proceeding ” and horrified that media coverage might hurt her daughters , who were then in school .
“ I found her to be very shy and very private , and it was very painful for her to discuss ” her past , Case said .

Thrailkill was certified as a sexually violent predator in September 1998 and sent to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County .
Like other sex predators who have been committed , Thrailkill ’s status must be reviewed by the state every two years .
She may be recommitted only if two mental health experts determine her mental problems make her likely to molest again .
During therapy , she has expressed regret about her two daughters , who are now adults .
Thrailkill conceded at the hospital that her daughters had been “ sexual victims of her husband and emotional victims of her , ” a report said .
Ball , now 50 , was released on parole in January .
Two state - appointed mental health experts evaluated him and found he does not have a mental disorder that makes him likely to molest again .
Advertisement
Thrailkill is scheduled to leave Patton in September unless the state tries to renew her commitment .
A staff psychologist with the department wrote that Thrailkill does not wish to be released until she is convinced she can “ manage ” her behavior .
According to a May 2000 report , she has “ genuine shame for her behavior and remorse for her victims . ”
“ She has never shown any interest in coming out , ” Case said .
“ I think she feels safe there . ”
Here is a question that you may have been thinking about :
How do the different candidates ' tax plans affect Greg Mankiw 's incentive to work ?
Okay , you probably have n't been thinking about this .
But I have , because , after all , I am Greg Mankiw .
And if you are here reading my blog , maybe you have some interest in the random thoughts running through my brain .
So bear with me .
Let me start with my personal situation : I am a pretty lucky guy .
I have a comfortable , upper middle class life style that includes one house , two cars , three kids , a wife , and a dog .
I am fortunate enough that I do n't have trouble keeping that going .
I am also fortunate enough that I do n't crave much more than I already have .
I do n't particularly want to own multiple houses or drive a Ferrari or wear Armani suits .
You might say that I am close to being sated .
On a regular basis , I am offered opportunities to make some extra money .
It could be giving a talk , writing an article , editing a journal , and so on .
What incentive is there to put forward that extra work effort ?
To a large extent , the beneficiaries of that extra effort are my kids .
My lifestyle is , as a first approximation , invariant to my income .
But if I make an extra few dollars today , I will leave more to my kids when I move on .
I wo n't leave them enough so they can lead lives of leisure , but perhaps I will leave them enough so they wo n't have to struggle too much to afford a downpayment on their houses or to send their own kids to college .
Now back to the McCain and Obama tax plans .
Here is a neat summary from the Wall Street Journal Let me try to put each tax plan into a single number .
Let 's suppose Greg Mankiw takes on an incremental job today and earns a dollar .
How much , as a result , will he leave his kids in T years ?
The answer depends on four tax rates .
First , I pay the combined income and payroll tax on the dollar earned .
Second , I pay the corporate tax rate while the money is invested in a firm .
Third , I pay the dividend and capital gains rate as I receive that return .
And fourth , I pay the estate tax when I leave what has accumulated to my kids .
Let t1 be the combined income and payroll tax rate , t2 be the corporate tax rate , t3 be the dividend and capital gains tax rate , and t4 be the estate tax rate .
And let r be the before - tax rate of return on corporate capital .
Then one dollar I earn today will yield my kids :
For my illustrative calculations , let me take r to be 10 percent and my remaining life expectancy T to be 35 years .
If there were no taxes , so t1=t2=t3=t4=0 , then $ 1 earned today would yield my kids $ 28 .
That is simply the miracle of compounding .
Under the McCain plan , t1=.35 , t2=.25 , t3=.15 , and t4=.15 .
In this case , a dollar earned today yields my kids $ 4.81 .
That is , even under the low - tax McCain plan , my incentive to work is cut by 83 percent compared to the situation without taxes .
Under the Obama plan , t1=.43 , t2=.35 , t3=.2 , and t4=.45 .
In this case , a dollar earned today yields my kids $ 1.85 .
That is , Obama 's proposed tax hikes reduce my incentive to work by 62 percent compared to the McCain plan and by 93 percent compared to the no-tax scenario .
In a sense , putting the various pieces of the tax system together , I would be facing a marginal tax rate of 93 percent .
The bottom line :
If you are one of those people out there trying to induce me to do some work for you , there is a good chance I will turn you down .
And the likelihood will go up after President Obama puts his tax plan in place .
I expect to spend more time playing with my kids .
They will be poorer when they grow up , but perhaps they will have a few more happy memories .
Its unique black - and - white coloring helps the many - spotted tiger moth both stand out and blend in .
Native to the western U.S. , this moth may feed on mildly toxic plants like milkweed , taking the plant poisons into its own body as a natural defense against predators .
Most often , the species ' white body advertises " I taste bad " to birds who spot it flying in the air , says biologist Rebecca Simmons of the University of North Dakota .
But when it comes to rest against a dappled background , like the one pictured here , Hypercompe permaculata 's coloring also breaks up the outline of its body , allowing it to blend in and hide from birds that might not heed its white warning .

The graves contained mainly women and children
The oldest genetically identifiable nuclear family met a violent death , according to analysis of remains from 4,600 - year - old burials in Germany .
Writing in the journal PNAS , researchers say the broken bones of these stone age people show they were killed in a struggle .
Comparisons of DNA from one grave confirm it contained a mother , father , and their two children .
The son and daughter were buried in the arms of their parents .
Dr Wolfgang Haak , from The Australian Centre for Ancient DNA , in Adelaide , conducted the DNA analysis .
He says the scientific evidence supports the idea that they were indeed a family .
" We 're really sure , based on hard biological facts not just supposing or assuming . "
The bodies of the family were intertwined
In total , the four graves contain 13 bodies , eight children aged six months to nine years and five adults aged 25 to 60 .
In two graves , DNA was well preserved , which allowed comparisons between the occupants .
One of these contained the nuclear family , while the other grave contained three related children and an unrelated woman .
The researchers suggest she may have been an aunt or stepmother .
Corded Ware
These stone age people are thought to belong to a group known as the Corded Ware Culture , signified by their pots decorated with impressions from twisted cords .
In their burial culture all bodies usually face south .
In the family grave the adults did face south , but the children they hold in their arms face towards them .
The researchers say an exception to the cultural norm was made so as to express the biological relationship .
We do n't know how hard daily life was back there and if there was any space for love
Dr Wolfgang Haak
The care with which the bodies were laid out shows that whoever buried them must have known who they were says Dr Haak .
He adds he was moved the first time he saw the grave .
" You feel some kind of sympathy for them , it 's a human thing , somebody must have really cared for them .
Normally you should be careful in archaeological research not to allow feelings in that make us base judgements on modern ideas , we do n't know how hard daily life was back there and if there was any space for love . "
Teeth hold clue
As well as looking at the DNA of each individual the researchers examined deposits of the element strontium in their teeth .
Found in rocks and soils , strontium is taken in from food as teeth grow in childhood .
It can act as an indicator of where people came from .
Life in central Europe could be violent in the stone age The children and adult males had the same type of strontium - which was also found locally , but the nearest match to the women 's teeth was at least 50 km away , suggesting they had moved to the area .
Dr Alistair Pike from Bristol University , who carried out the strontium analysis , says this indicates a culture of exogamy or marrying out .
" It 's a bit like kings and queens in Europe in the past , creating an alliance by marrying out sons and daughters .
This creates a bond between communities - useful if your harvest fails or if you need help fighting a war . "
Broken bones
The most grisly aspect of the find is the manner of their death .
Dr Pike says it was violent .
" They were definitely murdered , there are big holes in their heads , fingers and wrists are broken . "
They suffered a violent death
At least five of the individuals show the effects of a violent attack , one even had the tip of a stone weapon embedded in a vertebra .
Wolfgang
Haak says that as most of the people in the graves were women and children it is probable that most of the adults were elsewhere at the time of the attack , perhaps out fighting or working in their fields .
" They returned home to the village and found their loved ones dead .
It 's an assumption , but the most plausible explanation . "
Researchers say such violence fits with what we know about life in central Europe at the time - the area had fertile soils , a stable climate and natural access routes .
This made it a desirable place to live , but also created competition amongst its inhabitants , leading to violent confrontations when one community tried to displace another .

As a nation we 've racked up nearly £ 1.5 trillion of personal debt , and are increasingly falling behind with payments on our credit cards , overdrafts and bank loans .
But now many financial institutions - also strapped for cash - want their money back and they are calling in specialist companies to chase up non-payers .
Panorama's Can't Pay , Wo n't Pay looks at how lenders are using the courts to retrieve their money , while some people are refusing to pay a penny back .
One couple , who claim the law is on their side , managed to avoid paying almost £ 100,000 out of their £ 120,000 debts .
After studying the Consumer Credit Act , Basil and Amanda Rankine looked for a number of potential slips in their credit agreements .
These included checking that the correct APR was included , that the forms had actually been signed and that the lenders had kept a copy of the paperwork .
Tougher tactics
The Rankines said they wrote to their credit card firms and managed to get a total of £ 37,000 written off .
Take the debt test Following this success , they decided to take some of their other creditors to court .
But it proved to be a step too far .
In the High Court , the judge dismissed the case and said they were trying to wriggle out of debt .
A legal technicality meant that as their lenders had n't pursued their claim in the courtroom , they could no longer enforce the outstanding debts .
But while they 'd avoided repaying nearly £ 100,000 in debt , the Rankines now face a legal bill of almost the same amount .
Creditors are using tougher tactics to make debtors pay back their debts - with a recent surge in applications for charging orders .
These court orders enable lenders to secure bad debt on plastic and on loans against borrowers ' properties .
When unsecured loans become attached to the sale of a house , the debtor is obliged to pay off a chunk of the debt if they ever sell up or re-mortgage .
However , some lenders are now unwilling to wait , and are applying for an ' order for sale ' which forces the property - owner to sell up straight away and pay off their debt from the capital .
Bad debt
In the first six months of this year alone , UK banks and building societies wrote off £ 1.8 bn in bad consumer debts for various reasons .
1st Credit statement Loopholes clear couple 's debts Chasing bad debt is time - consuming and expensive and lenders are increasingly opting to sell on our bad loans at a knockdown price to firms that specialise in debt collection .
One of the industry 's largest debt purchasers is 1st Credit .
It says it acquires 12,000 new debtors every month , and claims to be sympathetic to those who genuinely cannot pay .
However , when Leanne Blurton had to deal with her stepfather 's financial problems after he was committed to a psychiatric hospital , she found it did n't live up to that claim .
While other creditors suspended repayments , 1st Credit was the only one to refuse to freeze his account .
Instead , it continued to take £ 54 a month .
In a series of phone calls , Ms Blurton is asked to provide evidence of her stepfather 's illness but when she does , she is then told repeatedly there is still nothing the company can do to help .
When Panorama contacted 1st Credit , it apologised to Ms Blurton and said in a statement : " We 're very sorry that our actions have caused him and his daughter considerable distress .
" 1st Credit is re-training staff members concerned and issuing clearer guidelines to all staff regarding the handling of cases such as this . "
1st Credit have now frozen his account .
Sale threat Driving charging orders through the courts is a new breed of debt collector , which do not purchase debts , but pursue them .
Malina Bergeman found that her £ 1,700 sofa shot up to £ 6,200 after interest and penalty charges were added .
She bought the sofa on a ' pay nothing for a year ' deal , but by the time the year was up had lost her job and was struggling financially .
A debt charity advised reducing monthly re-payments on the sofa from £ 121 to £ 40 .
She took its advice .
But Creation Finance - which operates Land of Leather 's credit agreements - demanded the entire amount owed , and then applied for a charging order on Ms Bergeman 's home .
The company went further and threatened her with an order for sale .
Her father was forced to step in and paid a settlement of £ 4,700 using a credit card .
However , consumer advice agencies say they are dealing with rising numbers of applications , which puts those in debt increasingly at risk of losing their homes .

It 's been some time since Sony 's Blu-ray high definition movie format knocked off its stiff competition from Toshiba and HD - DVD .
However , the monopoly on HD flicks has n't yet morphed into big sales , according to reports .
In fact , the slowing global economy could drastically hurt the transition from standard ( and cheaper ) DVD .
Although it took a good long time for Blu-ray to nudge out HD - DVD , there had been speculation for some time that this would be the final result .
Toshiba 's HD - DVD caught fire early because of its cheaper price tag and a popular Xbox 360 add - on ( yours truly was a sucker for that one ) , but Blu-ray 's tag team partnership with the increasingly popular PlayStation 3 console and decisions by movie studios to jump aboard Sony 's bandwagon killed HD - DVD earlier this year .
However , despite the fact that Blu-ray is available for many new flicks coming to home video , the transition has been a slow one .
The big problem is clearly the cost .
" You need the high - definition television set , you need the player , you need the cables , you need the software , " said Lori MacPherson , General Manager of domestic home entertainment at Disney .
" The economy is the biggest challenge , because there are just so many pieces to the Blu-ray puzzle that consumers face . "
( Source : xbitlabs.com )
Unlike the old VHS days , one needs more than just a cheap knock - off television set to watch Blu-ray .
You need a decent HDTV , expensive component ( or optimally , HDMI ) cables to get the right signal and picture , and in the best case scenario , a home theater stereo system to top it off .
Although the last one is optional , it is an integral part of the experience and one people are having a tougher time affording this holiday season .
With that said , there is good news on the way .
HDTV prices are plummeting right now ; in fact , most LCD panels have dropped as much as 30 - 40 % since this time last year .
A close friend of mine recently paid the same price for a 40 " 1080 p Samsung HDTV that he did for a 26 " 720 p Samsung a year ago .
Blu-ray is also coming down .
Best Buy 's own in - house Insignia brand now has a player with 1080 p output capabilities for just $ 250 .
Not bad , considering these things retailed for about $ 1,000 two years ago .
MacPherson believes high - def technology can survive the recession .
" For me , it 's the difference between costume jewelry and a diamond , " she said .
" Costume jewelry is nice , but I still want the diamond . "

Chemistry hobbyists face a labyrinth of local and state regulations
VICTOR DEEB'S HOUSE sits on a quiet street a few blocks off the main drag in Marlborough , Mass. , about an hour 's drive from Boston .
A lush garden of flowers meticulously maintained by Deeb 's wife , Ghada , fills the front lawn .
From the outside , the only thing that suggests something unusual took place in this peaceful suburban home is a second - story window covered in plywood .
On Aug. 5 , a police officer passing Deeb 's home noticed smoke coming out of an air conditioner in the window and called the fire department .
After putting out the flames , a fire fighter went to turn off the power in the basement .
He did n't find the electrical circuit box there — it 's in the garage .
Instead , he found Deeb 's basement laboratory .
Bethany Halford / C&EN
Shut Down Deeb in what remains of his basement lab .
By the end of the day , the home would become the site of a Tier 3 hazardous materials cleanup , visited by city code inspectors , the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) , the local board of health , the state bomb squad , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Stories like Deeb 's worry the small community of hobby chemists who operate small laboratories in their homes .
Having a lab in the basement , garage , or backyard shed was once a rite of passage for scientifically minded kids and a common hobby for science - curious adults .
Now , between the war on terror , the war on drugs , and the Consumer Product Safety Commission 's ( CPSC's ) crackdown on homemade fireworks ( C&EN , July 9 , 2007 , page 31 ) , home science is increasingly coming under attack .
Anyone who wants to pursue chemistry as a hobby these days has to navigate a maze of federal , state , and local laws or run the risk of having a hazmat team show up at their door .
According to reports in the Worcester Telegram & Gazette , authorities found more than 1,500 vials , jars , and bottles of chemicals in Deeb 's basement and garage .
A hazmat crew spent three days clearing out the materials they determined to be potentially hazardous , ultimately collecting and removing the various chemicals in 35 drums .
Deeb has not been fined or cited for the lab , but he has received a $ 17,000 bill for the cost of the cleanup .
The City of Marlborough has said that the chemicals in his home laboratory constituted a violation of the city 's sanitary code .
Specifically , says Cynthia Panagore Griffin , Marlborough 's assistant solicitor , the chemicals in Deeb 's basement " were deemed by the board of health to pose a health risk to the occupants of the home . "
The incident report from the Massachusetts DEP notes " a significant amount of mixed chemicals with very poor housekeeping and no apparent segregation or order " in Deeb 's basement .
The agency says the chemicals posed neither a radiological nor a biological hazard , and although some were flammable or explosive , none were more dangerous than many common household products .
Deeb says the most dangerous chemicals in his collection were boron trifluoride etherate , dicyclopentadiene , and some organic peroxides .
" Who is more qualified to determine what is a public safety threat ?
The city or me , with 50 years of experience in the chemical industry ? " he asks .
" And would I have hazardous material where I , my wife , and my child live ?
Where my grandchildren visit ? "
Deeb , 71 , spent decades working in the field of polymer chemistry .
After 20 years as a chemist with W.R. Grace , Deeb retired in 1995 and devoted himself full - time to his basement lab .
" My desire to create and innovate is still very active , " he says .
" I find it demoralizing to sit in front of the television all day . "
He formed a company , R&D Technology International , and received patents for his work , which has been focused on reclaiming rubber from tires for a second life as paving and roofing materials .
Deeb is also working on developing bisphenol A - free coatings and sealants based on modified vegetable oil for food jar lids .
The City of Marlborough views such activity as a violation of its zoning laws , which prohibit people from running a business in an area that 's only zoned for residences .
Deeb 's case is currently making its way through the legal system .
A temporary restraining order has been issued to keep Deeb from restarting the lab .
He is suing the City of Marlborough for $ 10 million , claiming that along with the chemicals , authorities also removed his research notes , making it impossible for him to protect the intellectual property they contained .
The notes held the formulas for two sealants that he was in contract negotiations to sell to a German corporation .
Without the notes , he says , the deal soured .
HOBBY CHEMISTS will tell you that home labs have been the source of some of chemistry 's greatest contributions .
Charles Goodyear figured out how to vulcanize rubber with the same stove that his wife used to bake the family 's bread .
Charles Martin
Hall discovered the economical electrochemical process for refining aluminum from its ore in a woodshed laboratory near his family home .
A plaque outside Sir William Henry Perkin's Cable Street residence in London notes that the chemist " discovered the first aniline dyestuff , March 1856 , while working in his home laboratory on this site and went on to found science - based industry . "
Barbara Fritchman Thompson Try This At Home Thompson works in his home chemistry lab .
Even in the 21st century , when home labs tend to be more synonymous with methamphetamine than major discoveries , there are some professional chemists who pursue their science at home .
Just 90 miles southeast of Deeb 's house , Osamu Shimomura , one of the scientists who shared this year 's Nobel Prize in Chemistry , runs a small lab in the basement of his Falmouth , Mass. , residence , where he studies bioluminescent materials from animal tissues .
" I do n't have anything that is dangerous in my lab .
I have many chemicals in small amounts — salts and buffers " as well as some organic solvents , such as methanol , Shimomura says .
He tells C&EN that he has a business license for scientific research , for which he simply had to go to the town hall , fill out an application , and pay a fee .
For chemists who just want to run a lab as a hobby , figuring out which laws and regulations apply to them can be a daunting task .
" It 's pretty easy to find federal - level regulations regarding storage , transport , and handling of hazardous materials , " says Matthew Ernst , founder of the chemistry hobbyists ' forum sciencemadness.org .
" Most of those regulations would n't apply to hobbyists or even small businesses because they have threshold quantity exemptions . "
The Department of Homeland Security , for example , maintains a list of hundreds of " chemicals of interest " known as Appendix A .
The minimum threshold levels required for notifying DHS are so massive that it's hard to imagine a chemistry hobbyist would ever reach them .
Deeb would have needed at least 5,000 lb of BF 3 to reach DHS 's threshold .
The Environmental Protection Agency , the main watchdog for hazardous waste , defers to state and local agencies in most cases for home labs .
An EPA spokesperson tells C&EN , " In a situation where a home laboratory does exist and the operation of a home laboratory poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment , EPA has the authority to order the laboratory operator to clean it up and the authority to bring suit against the operator of the laboratory . "
For example , this summer , police following up on a missing person 's report in central New Jersey stumbled upon hundreds of chemicals , including radiological agents and several pounds of potentially explosive picric acid , in one retired chemist 's basement .
The basement was declared a Superfund site , and EPA spent several weeks cleaning up the home .
Agency officials were n't certain of the cleanup 's total cost but said the job had a $ 475,000 budget .
SOME STATES have regulations that address home - based chemistry , but these are largely focused on hazardous waste disposal or preventing illegal drug manufacturing .
Californians face a $ 25,000 fine if they do n't properly dispose of hazardous chemicals , whether they 're running a home lab or just using common household items .
Such items include anything that 's flammable or has an extreme pH .
The Texas Department of Public Safety requires anyone wanting to buy , sell , or trade certain chemicals or laboratory equipment to get a permit .
Most of the chemicals are drug precursors , but the equipment includes common glassware , such as Erlenmeyer flasks and condensers .
Before anyone can get a permit to purchase such chemistry mainstays for a home in Texas , both a background check and a home inspection are required .
" Local regulations are hardest of all , " Ernst says .
There is any number of local officials who could take issue with a home laboratory — the local fire marshal , board of health , or zoning commissioner .
" Any well - equipped home lab looks an awful lot like a meth lab to the untrained eye , " he points out .
" There 's definitely leeway for any official who comes across a lab to exercise their judgment to shut you down , and then you 're stuck with a very expensive legal fight or you can just cave in . "
" Why should anyone need permission to pursue a hobby ? " asks Robert Bruce Thompson , author of the " Illustrated Guide to Home Chemistry Experiments , " a comprehensive how - to book for setting up a home laboratory that comes complete with a broad range of experiments .
" If you have a hobby lab , you 're in good company .
Between hobbyists and homeschoolers , there are literally hundreds of thousands of households that have lab equipment and chemicals . "
Even so , Thompson confesses that he considered authoring his book anonymously , letting a lawyer in Switzerland handle the details .
He notes that he did take a few precautions when setting up a laboratory in his house , which he is currently using to test experiments for his next book on home forensics experiments .
He called his local department of environmental protection to find out if there were any guidelines — there were n't ; he asked two friends who are Ph.D. chemists to inspect the lab ; and he let his neighbors know what he was up to .
Thompson suggests that would - be home chemists avoid the Drug Enforcement Administration 's List I chemicals , which the agency tracks closely .
" There 's also a DEA List II , but most of the chemicals on it are so common that there 's no hope of tracking them , " he says .
" These are chemicals that you can buy literally by the gallon at hardware stores . "
Large amounts of oxidizers and fuels tend to attract the attention of DHS and CPSC , so he also suggests only purchasing small amounts of those materials .
" On general principles , and to avoid the possible wrath of EPA and similar agencies , I 'd avoid buying arsenic , mercury , or cadmium compounds .
Also , if you use compounds of lead , barium , or other heavy metals , it 's a good idea to have and use a labeled hazardous waste container , " Thompson adds .
" Not all of us are mad bombers or drugmakers , " Ernst says .
" We would like to be able to practice our hobby in peace if there 's a reasonable way for us to figure out the guidelines . "
SEOUL , South Korea 
In this city ’s Apgujeong district , famous for its high - end boutiques and plastic surgeons , tourist buses unload Chinese and Japanese visitors looking for a nip and tuck as part of their packaged tour .
On the resort island of Jeju , the government is building Health Care Town , a 370 - acre complex of medical clinics and upscale apartments surrounded by 18 - hole golf courses and scenic beaches , to lure foreigners in need of medical care .
West of Seoul , on the muddy beaches of Inchon where American troops splashed ashore 58 years ago to fight in the Korean War , a new steel - and - glass town is rising to attract foreign visitors , including medical tourists .
South Korea has joined Thailand , Singapore , India and other Asian nations in the lucrative business of medical tourism .
Heart bypasses , spinal surgery , hip - joint replacements , cosmetic surgery  procedures that may cost tens of thousands of dollars in the United States  can often be done for one - third or even one - tenth of the cost in Asia , with much shorter waiting times and by specialists often trained in the West .
With rumors about Paterson Joseph taking over the role of the Doctor from David Tennant in 2010 's fifth season of Doctor Who continuing to circulate , it 's beginning to look more and more likely that West Lothian 's favorite son might not be the man in the time - traveling blue box for much longer .
And while I have nothing against Paterson Joseph , there 's one other person that I 'd like to nominate for the role : Stephen Fry .
Fry , for those who are n't familiar with him , is an English actor , writer , comedian and jack - of - all - trades ( although perhaps without that " and master of none " bit at the end ) ; he started in the business we call show alongside House MD's Hugh Laurie as part of a comedy duo , before going on to appear in such shows and movies as Blackadder , Jeeves and Wooster , Wilde , the movie version of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy , Bones and V For Vendetta , amongst many other projects .
He 's also very much a fan of Doctor Who , and has been since the very first episode , as he explains :
When I was 7 my parents moved house .
Well , we all moved house as a family , I do n’t mean my parents left me behind , though who would blame them if they had ?
We owned , in those days , a television that disguised itself as a mahogany drinks cabinet , in the way they did – and they were never called just televisions , by the way , they were television sets .
This one ’s screen was , of course , black and white , it boasted one channel , the BBC ( what we ’d now call BBC1 ) and had a knurled volume knob in dark brown Bakelite .
The set smelled the way dust always did when it was cooked on Mullard valves as they warmed up .
It slid about on castors and had doors that closed with a satisfactory snick as a ball bearing rolled into its slots to secure it .
The week before we moved , the BBC started a new drama , starring William Hartnell .
An old man , whose name appeared to be Grandfather or the Doctor , had a police phone box of the kind we saw in the street all the time in those days .
It turned out to be a magical and unimaginably wonderful time machine .
My brother and I watched this drama in complete amazement .
The first ever episode of Doctor Who .
I had never been so excited in all my life .
A whole week to wait to watch the next instalment .
Never have seven days crawled so slowly by , for all that they involved a complicated house move from Buckinghamshire to Norfolk .
A week later , in that new house , my brother and I turned on the good old television set in its new sitting room , ready to watch Episode 2 .
The TV had been damaged in transit and was never to work again .
We missed that episode and nothing that has transpired in my life since has ever , or could ever , make up for that terrible , terrible disappointment .

In between all of his other day jobs , Fry narrowly missed out on a dream opportunity a couple of years ago , when he had to back out of writing an episode of Doctor Who 's third season ( after it had already gone through three drafts and been bumped from the second season for having been " too ambitious " ) , but that 's not why I 'm suggesting that he be considered to take over the unusual wardrobe and ownership of however many sonic screwdrivers - Although , if guilt works on the BBC , I think we should leave that possibility open - Instead , I just happen to think that Fry embodies the best of what a Doctor should be :
He 's wildly intelligent , amusing , eccentric , and just ever so slightly patronizing in the best way possible .
Sure , he may not be able to do all the action scenes that we 've come to expect from Tennant and Christopher Eccleston , but come on ; William Hartnell and Sylvester McCoy were never really men of excitement , either .
There may be some other problems -
What self - respecting cockney companion would end up falling for Fry 's deep - lidded gaze ? - but I 'd be willing to jettison some of the new cliches of Who 's current run in favor of a funnier , smarter and , dammit , just plain Stephen Fry-ier hour of television .
And if we can't get Fry , remind me to explain why Richard E. Grant should reprise the role for longer next time :
Pictured : Britney Spears leaves hospital with son following ' seizure ' drama
Popstar Britney Spears ' two - year - old son , who was hospitalized over the weekend after he had a reaction to something he ate , is said to have been released from the Mississippi medical facility .
Britney Spears rushed her two - year - old son to hospital after he suffered a suspected seizure during a family trip to her hometown .
Today the Spears family posted a statement on her official website www.britneyspears.com saying Jayden James was admitted to the hospital on Sunday , and " doctors concluded he had a reaction to something he ingested . "
Panic : Britney leaves hospital in Mississippi after her son's health scare
Jayden James was raced to the emergency ward after lapsing into a ' vague and unresponsive ' state .
The toddler fell ill yesterday afternoon at the family home in Kentwood , Louisiana .
It 's believed that Jayden James had had a " terrible allergic reaction " during a special trip to the Spears ' family home in Kentwood .
Sources say he broke out in " hives , and was itchy and irritable "
The entire Spears clan made the 25 - mile dash to Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Centre , Mississippi .
Doctors were unable to pinpoint the problem straight away and kept the toddler in for overnight observation .
Distraught Britney , 26 , refused to leave his side and asked for a bed next to him in the ward .
Her ex-husband , rapper Kevin Federline , is now believed to be making plans to jet out of Los Angeles to be with Jayden .
Emergency : Britney , pictured here arriving in Louisiana with son Jayden James on Friday , rushed the toddler to hospital over the weekend
She flew them into Louisiana on a private jet with her dad Jamie on Friday , the morning after her surprise appearance onstage with Madonna in Los Angeles .
The special week - long visit was to steal some family time ahead of Britney 's forthcoming promotional tour of her new album ' Circus ' .
She was also anxious to be reunited with her little sister Jamie - Lynn , 17 , who recently gave birth to daughter Maddie - Briann .
Spears reunion : Britney was back in her hometown to spend time with her family including mother Lynne Spears ( right )
Sources say chaos erupted when Jayden suffered a suspected seizure out of the blue , at about 3 pm yesterday .
' One minute Britney and her sons were relaxing and enjoying their first visit to Kentwood in months , and the next minute Jayden had fallen ill , ' said a source .
' He was vague and unresponsive so Britney dialled an ambulance .
But she was told it would take half an hour to arrive , and she was best trying to get Jayden to the hospital herself . '
Minutes later , two cars tore out of the Spears ' ' Serenity ' residence .
Health fears : Jayden James was taken to Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Centre
The first , a Lincoln Navigator , carried Britney , her mum Lynne and dad Jamie as well as the poorly toddler .
A Range Rover driven by Jamie - Lynn also carried their brother Brian .
When the convoy reached the motorway , Jamie - Lynn reportedly thwarted following photographers by refusing to let them pass .
She drove slowly alongside another vehicle to keep them back while her sister accelerated away .
When snappers arrived at the hospital , which is now being manned by police , Britney and her son had already dashed inside .
' Britney was insistent that would n't leave him .
She asked for a bed to be made up in the same room so she could be there at his side . '
The trip by Spears to Louisiana , her childhood home , was the first time she had been allowed to leave California with sons Sean Preston , 3 , and Jayden since their father Kevin Federline was given full custody in July .
Sources say Jayden ' is doing fine ' .

Ann Coulter may be completely silenced , at least for a while .
If the New York Post ‘s Page Six report is true , Coulter broke her jaw and her mouth is wired shut .
Left to right , Conservative Leader Stephen Harper , NDP Leader Jack Layton , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion and Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe listen to Green Leader Elizabeth May during Wednesday night 's debate in Ottawa .
(( Tom Hanson / Canadian Press ) ) Conservative Leader Stephen Harper defended himself against the barbs of the four other federal party leaders as they faced off Wednesday evening in the French - language debate .
With the U.S. financial crisis top of mind , the first portion of the two - hour session focused on the economy .
Harper was quick to downplay the potential effects the economic turmoil south of the border might have on Canada .
" Canada is not the United States , " he said , adding the country 's economic fundamentals are strong and jobs are still being created .
In a jab at the Liberals ' proposed carbon tax , Harper said the last thing needed at this time of financial uncertainty is a new tax system .
Liberals unveil economic plan
" Economic risk ?
You are the danger , " Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion shot back from across the oval table where the leaders were seated .
Stéphane Dion outlined a plan on how the Liberals would respond to the economic situation .
(( Tom Hanson / Canadian Press ) )
The seating arrangement was a departure from previous years when leaders spoke from podiums , and its informal atmosphere helped keep the leaders from shouting over one another .
With the debate focusing largely on the economy , Dion took the opportunity early on to announce that if the Liberals win the Oct. 14 federal election , they will act quickly on the economy .
In their first month , Dion vowed that the Liberals would ask Canada 's financial regulatory agencies to evaluate the financial situation , convene a meeting of major economists to report on the state of the world economy , and issue a fiscal update .
He said he would also call a first ministers ' meeting to talk about how the federal , provincial and territorial governments could work together to figure out how to stimulate the economy .
May scores points despite clumsy French
Green party Leader Elizabeth May 's debut in the debate saw her struggle in French .
But despite using a simple vocabulary and short sentences , she landed a few verbal jabs at Harper throughout the night .
Elizabeth May used basic French but managed to get a few shots in against Harper .
( ( Tom Hanson / Canadian Press ) )
" In the opinion of the economists worldwide and in an OECD report , the statements are clear — Mr. Harper 's policies are threatening Canada 's economy with the decisions he 's made to favour the oil sector , " May said .
The debates come amid worldwide market upheaval as the U.S. struggles to help Wall Street banks and investment houses deal with distressed debt .
In the midst of the debate , news broke that an amended $ 700 - billion bailout package rejected by U.S. lawmakers earlier in the week was passed by the U.S. Senate .
It still has to go to the House of Representatives for approval .
Opening and closing statements were dropped to dedicate the first half - hour to economic issues .
The adjustment was made by the broadcast consortium organizing the debates after a request Tuesday from Harper , with the support of the other leaders .
The debate took on a wide range of topics , including the deadly listeriosis outbreak , the military mission in Afghanistan , leadership , gun control and the environment .
Bloc compares Harper to Bush
What the leaders said about each other :
One of the more interesting questions posed by viewers was the request to have each leader say something positive about the leader sitting to their left .
All five managed to promote their cause in the process .
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe praised May 's environmental concerns but added that his party 's environmental platform is the best .
NDP Leader Jack Layton called Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion " an honest man " and , perhaps hinting at a coalition , added , " We can work together . "
Stephen Harper said despite their differences in philosophy , Layton is " honest " and noted the NDP agreed with the Tories on the apology for aboriginal residential schools and the Accountability Act .
Dion said when Duceppe is at his best he has " a sense of statesmanship , " although he added that he lacks ambition and the country needs a government that will " work for all Canadians . "
Green Leader Elizabeth
May also started on a personal tone , saying of Harper , " You 're a good father ; your kids are lovely . "
But she warned Harper that his " principles take us in a dangerous direction .
Your leadership is more autocratic . "
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe repeatedly compared the Conservatives to the unpopular administration of U.S. President George W. Bush .
" Mr. Harper is a laissez - faire - ist like Mr. Bush and we see the disaster happening in the United States now , " said Duceppe .
He also accused Harper of giving tax breaks on corporate profits that benefit Canada 's booming oil industry but doing little to help manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec .
NDP Leader Jack Layton also pointed to troubles in the U.S. and said the Harper government is going in the wrong direction with tax cuts for big oil companies and banks .
Duceppe also pointed to culture , calling it a " significant economic driver . "
It 's a sensitive issue in his home province where artists have been vocal against the Tory government 's cuts of up to $ 45 million in arts and culture funding across the country .
" There 's 314,000 jobs in Quebec that depend on culture and arts .
It 's not all spoiled children like you say , " said Duceppe , referring to a comment by Harper last week about arts cuts being a " niche issue . "
Harper said last Tuesday that he does n't think it resonates with " ordinary working people " when they " come home , turn on the TV and see … a bunch of people … at a rich gala all subsidized by taxpayers claiming their subsidies are n't high enough when they know those subsidies have actually gone up . "
Dion shot back : " For us Quebecers and francophones all across the country , culture is what really makes our language live .
The current government is not just cutting but really is working against artists . "
Harper calmly reiterated his party 's stance , saying his government increased the budget for culture and arts by eight per cent .
' Not talking about scuffles ' : Harper
Harper 's tough - on - crime approach also came under fierce opposition , with May accusing him of fear - mongering with his campaign pledge to introduce tougher sentences for young people 14 and over found guilty of serious crimes .
Stephen Harper remained firm on the Conservatives ' tough - on - crime approach and other policies throughout the evening .
( ( Tom Hanson / Canadian Press ) )
" You are trying to create the impression of a youth crime crisis but that 's not true , " she said .
Dion said the Conservatives are trying to import an unsuccessful American approach that would do little to ease crime rates .
Harper dismissed suggestions that his proposal would result in youths incarcerated in adult prisons , saying the types of crimes it would target would only be the most serious .
" We 're not talking about scuffles in the school , we 're talking about extremely violent cases , " said Harper .
He added that the Tories have also pledged about $ 50 million for prevention programs for youth at risk .
May said it was " quite ironic " Harper talked about crime and " yet he himself ignored legislation " on the Kyoto Protocol , fixed - date elections and the Atlantic Accord .
" He decides which legislation he likes and which he does n't like .
And that 's not a good example . "
Accuses Harper of fraud on the environment
She also accused Harper of defrauding Canadians with the Tory government 's approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" Your plan is a type of fraud — I do n't know how to say it in French , " May said , only to learn from the moderator that the word is essentially the same in both languages .
Harper responded by blaming the previous Liberal government for increasing greenhouse gas emissions by 35 per cent .
" We 've set targets — hard targets — of 20 per cent [ reductions ] by 2020 .
That 's one of the most aggressive plans in the world , " he said .
" I meet people , the leaders of countries around the world , that recognize this . "
May could no longer contain herself .
" Give me a break , " she bellowed in English .
" That 's ridiculous .
I 'm sorry , that 's a joke . "
On Thursday , the five leaders will face off in the English - language debate , starting at 9 p.m. ET .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama on Wednesday named former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to chair a new panel to advise him how to stabilize financial markets and navigate a potentially painful recession .
It was the latest step toward tackling problems undermining the U.S. economy and was part of an aggressive effort by Obama to demonstrate that his administration will face the global financial crisis head - on when he takes over on January 20 .
The new panel was modeled on an advisory panel that gives the president nonpartisan advice on national security matters , Obama said .
“ Sometimes policymaking in Washington can become a little bit too ingrown , a little bit too insular , ” Obama said at his third news conference in as many days .
“ This board will provide that fresh perspective to me and my administration . ”
Financial markets were not impacted by the news of the appointment , which had leaked overnight .
Volcker , 81 , has been an important adviser to Obama on economic issues .
As Federal Reserve chairman in the early 1980s , he was credited with taming inflation through policies that also contributed to a recession at the time .
Obama named campaign adviser Austan Goolsbee as the panel ’s staff director .
Obama said the University of Chicago professor had “ shaped his thinking ” on economic matters .
Asked about criticism that he was taking too many officials from the administration of former President Bill Clinton into his fold , Obama responded forcefully .
“ What we are going to do is combine experience with fresh thinking , ” he said .
If his top economic officials , such as his pick for treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , had not had ties to the Clinton government , whose term ended in 2002 , they would have no Washington experience at all , he said .
“ Understand where the vision for change comes from , first and foremost .
It comes from me , ” he said .
“ That ’s my job . ”
Other members of the new board , who will be named later , will be drawn from business , labor and academia , Obama said .
MORE BAD ECONOMIC NEWS
The drumbeat of bad news continued on Wednesday , as the Commerce Department reported consumers cut spending during October at the steepest rate in more than seven years and orders for costly manufactured goods plummeted .

Later on Wednesday Obama and his family handed out food to poor people in Chicago ’s South Side neighborhood ahead of the November 27 Thanksgiving holiday .
In addition to naming his top economic advisers , Obama has come closer to forming his national security team , with reports saying that current Defense Secretary Robert Gates will remain in his post and retired Marine Gen.
James Jones will take over as national security adviser .
Those appointments , along with New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state , are likely to be made early next week , after the November 27 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday .

For now Obama has put his focus squarely on the economy , pledging a costly stimulus package that he urged the next Congress to pass quickly .
On Tuesday , he vowed to cut billions of dollars in wasteful government spending .
But questions remain about both goals .
Obama declined to put a figure on the stimulus package -- other Democrats have said it could cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- and he did not identify specific government programs to be cut to help pay for it .
“ I think would hardly be expected to provide you a detailed list now , ” he told the news conference when asked about potential cuts .
“ The expectation is that we will identify those programs that are not working , make sure that those are eliminated , and put money into programs that do work . ”
Analysts said Obama ’s economic pronouncements showed the next president stepping into a leadership void left by Bush .
“ Confidence in Bush as an effective president has eroded so substantially that he is no longer taken seriously , ” said Paul Beck , a professor of political science at Ohio State University .
“ There is , of course , much more confidence in Obama or he would not have been elected as president , ” Beck said .
“ And he is the president - in - waiting , so the only alternative the country has to Bush as a leader , especially in a period when the markets have failed and government must play an enlarged role in them . ”
Obama has not shied away from telling struggling industries like banks and automakers to take responsibility for their ailing position in the economy .
In an interview with the ABC television , Obama said bank executives should forego their bonuses this year .
Obama takes largest lead yet in Gallup poll of likely voters John Byrne
Published : Saturday November 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) has taken the largest lead yet among likely voters against Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) in the national Gallup poll released Saturday .
Obama expanded his lead to ten percent from nine percent on Friday .
Obama 's lead is a dramatic rise from the 49 - 47 percent margin that Gallup registered just four days ago .
Gallup added , " This is the first time since Gallup began estimating likely voters in early October that there is no difference between Gallup 's two likely voter models .
Obama 's lead of 52 % to 42 % using Gallup 's traditional estimate of likely voting criteria takes into account past voting as well as current intentions .
Obama 's identical lead using the expanded model takes into account only current voting intentions . "
" Both of these likely voter estimates in turn are almost identical to Gallup 's 52 % to 41 % registered voter estimate .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup
Inc is looking at putting risky assets in a government - supported “ bad bank ” -- a step to reassure investors that the rest of its assets were safe , reports said on Sunday .
The “ bad bank ” might take on some of Citigroup ’s more than $ 1.23 trillion of off - balance sheet assets .
Citigroup might bear the initial losses on the assets , and the government might cover losses beyond a particular threshold , the Wall Street Journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter .
The U.S. government would receive a stake in Citigroup in exchange for taking most of the losses , the New York Times reported .
Talks are still fluid , the newspapers emphasized .
Citigroup spokesman Mike Hanretta declined to comment .
This sort of a plan would be similar to what the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program was set up to do : take assets from banks that were either troubled or likely to be troubled .
The TARP , signed into law last month , has since shifted its focus on giving direct capital injections to banks .
U.S. financial markets are waiting for some sort of Citigroup announcement this weekend , and if nothing happens , the bank ’s stock is likely to plunge further on Monday , analysts said .
Citigroup ’s shares fell 60 percent last week to $ 3.77 amid concerns about the bank ’s loan exposure amid a recession hurting many economies globally .
The bank is not in danger of near - term collapse , people close to Citigroup said on Friday .
Depositors are sticking with the bank , as are trading counterparties .
The capital ratio that regulators look at most carefully , namely the tier - one capital ratio , is well above minimum required levels .
But a rapid decline in share price can make customers skittish and cut into a bank ’s business , wrote analysts at independent research boutique CreditSights on Saturday .
“ Unfortunately , we feel like we have seen this movie before , ” they added .
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Washington Mutual Inc both experienced sharp declines in their shares , followed by an exodus of customers .
Lehman eventually filed for bankruptcy , while regulators took over Washington Mutual and sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co .

A SURPRISE TURN
Citigroup ’s executives last week debated options as the company ’s share price sank , including merging with another bank or selling off businesses .
Citigroup also spoke to the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury about the government making a public statement of support and perhaps even putting additional funds into the bank .
And Chief Executive Vikram Pandit told employees on a conference call last week that the bank was strong and had no liquidity problems .
Giving bad assets to the government could help Citigroup , but would also be a surprise turn , given the difficulties the TARP program ran into in when it tried to buy assets .
“ Buying assets , that ’s exactly the position the government did n’t want to be in , ” said Daniel Alpert , a banker at Westwood Capital .

I 'm lucky enough to be at RubyManor today ; a Ruby conference organised by Ruby users , for Ruby users , costing the grand total of twelve of your British pounds .
A bargain , as you 'll see if you check the lineup of talks and speakers .
I started making notes , but it seems to have evolved into some kind of blog post .
Apologies for typos , crap grammar and glaring errors .
Paul Battley -- I 'm an Evil iPlayer hacker
Paul Battley is a hacker .
BBC
News said so , so it must be true .
Paul started by running through the history of iPlayer 's development .
It launched in July 2007 in open beta , but required Windows XP and a custom client with built - in DRM .
In December 2007 a flash streaming version was released , which worked on Windows , Mac and Linux .
However you could only watch content for seven days .
In March 2008 an iPhone version of the iPlayer was released .
The iPhone does n't support flash , so the iPhone version streams MPEG4 over HTTP .
When first released it worked by sniffing the user agent , and checking for the string " iphone " !
Within hours people had released scripted solutions for downloading the videos , but one week later the BBC had plugged the hole .
Wasting no time , Paul discovered that the video is pulled with a different user agent to the page , and an extra HTTP header was required .
All was well with the world , but in June the downloaded files stopped working .
Comparing old files to the new ones , they discovered that the BBC had XOR 'd some data in the middle of the MPEG files .
That was easy to work around .
Later in June version 2 of the iPlayer came out with new URLs , but no new counter measures .
In September the iPlayer started to serve radio , which can also be downloaded with Paul 's scripts .
So the basic technique for downloading content from the iPlayer is to configure your client to pretend to be an iPhone .
Paul then talked about how to get a programme 's ID from some JavaScript served up with the programme 's web page .
This was one of the hardest parts of the job , requiring him to write a JavaScript tokenzer .
The flash version of the iPlayer uses the RTMP protocol , to make it a bit more difficult for people to " steal " the content .
The next thing that Paul decided to try and reverse engineer RTMP and write a Ruby library to process RTMP streams .
He 's not finished yet , but it looks as though he 's got quite a long way through the job .
Lessons learnt :
Releasing Ruby software to users is hard .
Writing GUIs is tedious ( but check out the iPlayer grabber ) .
Reverse engineering is fun and enlightening .
Obfuscation does n't work .
You need a feedback channel ( or people will make one ) .
It was a cracking presentation .
More information is available here :
If you want a graphical app for the Mac , iPlayer grabber looks great .
Dan Webb -- 8 Minutes on Rack
Dan Webb 's main message was that rack is worth everybody 's time , not just that of people who write web frameworks .
But what is it ?
It 's not a framework .
It 's not a library .
It 's just a convention .
The convention is this .
You have a call method on a ruby object that returns an array of three values ; the HTTP status code , a hash of headers to send to the client , and the response body .
Here 's an example :
app = Proc.new do |env| [ 200 , { " Content - Type " => " text / plain " } , " Hello World " ] end Rack : : Handler : : Thin.run ( app , : Port => 4000 )
The response body can be any object that responds to the each method , such as an open file object .
file = File.new ( " myfile.xml " ) [ 200 , { " Content - Type " => " application / xml " } , file ]
For binary files you can write your own class to stream anything you like .
Here 's an example of an each method that you could use to stream a binary file :
def each File.open ( @file , " rb " ) do file while part = file .read ( 8192 ) yield part end File.delete( @file ) end end
Why should you care ?
Passenger , Mongrel , CGI , SCGI , FastCGI , Thin , Webrick , Fuzed ( the list goes on ) .
Other things that Dan thinks are worth looking into :
The Rack Gem
Middleware ( very simple and clever , well worth a look )
Rack and Passenger
rackup
Check http://rack.rubyforge.org and read the ( slightly impenetrable ) documentation .
Dan will be writing some Rack stuff up on his blog , and his slides are available on slideshire .
David Black popped his hand up at the end and pointed out that strings in Ruby 1.9 do n't have an each method .
Ooops .
George Palmer -- Nanite
George Palmer gave an introduction to Nanite .
I missed the very beginning because I was chatting in the canteen .
Sorry .
There are currently three different broad brush approaches available to running background tasks in Ruby web frameworks :
Fork into background of rails process ( e.g. spawn , run_later ) .
Record a job to a file or database , for handling by a background deamon .
Fork into some kind of queue ( e.g. backgroundRB , beanstalk , starling , etc. ) .
Nanite is great for heavy lifting , and is designed for running jobs on other servers .
It 's based on RabbitMQ ; a queuing system written in Erlang .
As an aside , when installing Erlang on a Mac you need to avoid using the R12B5 of Erlang ; this means that you do n't want to use MacPorts , and are better off just downloading the source form the Erlang site .
AMQP stands for Advanced Messaging Queueing Protocol .
It 's an enterprise quality protocol , used by ( for example ) big financial corporations .
It 's also language neutral .
RabbitMQ implements AMQP 0.8 .
To install AMQP for Ruby you need the eventmachine gem , then grab the source from github and install the gem :
$ sudo gem install eventmachine $ git clone git://github.com/tmm1/amqp.git
$ cd amqp && rake gem && sudo gem install amqp-<version >.gem
Nanite mappers control and track the work .
You can run as many mappers as you like ; they get updates from the mapper exchange .
Mappers are run either inside your Rails / Merb app ( on Thin ) or via the command line .
Mappers assign work to agents .
Agents announce their presence when they start up so that the mappers know that they 're available .
Actors know how to do the work .
Here 's an example actor :
class Manor < Nanite :: Actor expose : name def name ( vars ) #
Do something interesting : result => " RubyManor " end end Nanite : Dispatcher.register(Manor.name )
There were a lot more code examples that I did n't manage to catch , but George will be uploading the slides to his blog , and I recommend taking a look .
This is what I did catch :
Nanite has no concept of security , but relies on the security in RabbitMQ .
George recommends monitoring your agents with a program like monit or god .
Once a nanite request has been sent to an agent and processed by an actor you can't check it for status ; use the database for that .
You can send files to your agents ( e.g. an image that needs resizing ) .
Nanite allocates work by looking at the currently available agents and sending the job to ( by default ) the least loaded server .
If you prefer you can choose to send a request to all agents , or a randomly selected agent .
You can also define your own metrics ( using Ruby ) for an agent 's " load " .
Finally , George ran a quick demo .
Members of the audience fired up a nanite agent ( an example agent that is distributed with the nanite source code ) that announced itself to a server running on his laptop , and he used the server to list the gems on everybody 's laptops .
A neat demo .
For more information , try these links :
The Nanite docs are n't currently that great , but the code is very readable .
Rob McKinnon -- Rugalytics
Rob wondered if there was a Ruby API for Google Analytics .
jnunemaker had written statwhore that gets you some XML , and wrapped it with helper methods such as pageviews and visits .
So that was cool , but Rob wanted more .
He wanted to emerge class definitions at runtime from the data .
So he forked statwhore , then hacked on it so much that he renamed it to Rugalytics .
Then he converted the XML to CSV to make it easier to work with .
Rob is now using Rugalytics to put a list of popular pages on his site , pulling the data direct from Google Analytics .
Fantastic stuff .
To get an Analytics report you pass the report name when calling analytics .
You can find the available reports by calling the brand new profile .
report_names method .
Google have a tendency to tweak the format of the CSV files , and this has been known to break Rugalytics .
There are also some language issues -- if you 've got your Google account setup to US english then you end up with a method ( dynamically created from the CSV ) called pageviews .
If you 're Google account is configured for UK english you used to get a method called page_views ( but Rob has now hardcoded it to pageviews ) .
In Italian you get pagine_visualizzate .
Nice !
The README file now advises that you choose US / UK english .
Rob also has a local web server ( which will be included in the gem ) -- similar to a Rack example that Dan talked about earlier -- that serves JavaScript to Rob 's Greasemonkey enabled browser .
Greasemonkey then annotates the pages on his site ( for him , and only for him ) showing which keywords people have used to find the page that he 's currently looking at .
Pretty impressive .
See Rob 's account on github to get the code .
Rugalytics is also available as a gem .
$ sudo gem install rugalytics
Murray Steele and Martin Saddler -- GUI Manor Born
Apparrently Ben Griffiths suggested all talks should be named around the phrase " To The Manor Born " .
As Murray put it , " at least we tried " .
So Murray and Martin are talking about how to build GUI apps with Ruby .
There are plenty of GUI toolkits available to Ruby , such as wxRuby , fxRuby , etc .
However for their example app ( a Twitter client ) Martin used Monkeybars and Murray used Shoes .
Monkeybars
Monkeybars is built using jRuby and produces a swing front end .
What you really need ( to follow along with Martin 's demo ) is JRuby , Netbeans and Ruby gems .
To start a new Monkeybars project you run a command that makes you a blank project ( much as Rails does ) :
$ monkeybars myapp $ cd myapp $ rawr install # choose option 2 $ jruby - S rake generate ALL='src/login '
At this point Martin demonstrated ( in the style of Blue Peter -- " here 's one I made earlier " ) how to build his Twitter client using Netbeans .
There 's a GUI builder that allows you to drag and drop GUI controls into the user interface .
You can then bind the widgets to the code using Netbeans ' normal GUI builder tools .
Monkeybars uses a form of the MVC design pattern .
The view binds the widgets defined in the GUI builder to Ruby code that you can access in the controller .
The controller and view are pretty much standard stuff .
You can easily create callback methods in your controller for widgets in your UI by taking the name of the widget ( e.g. login_button ) and creating a method called login_button_action_performed .
Seems prety straightforward .
You can use the rawr program to package your app .
The downsides ?
Not everything works in JRuby at the moment ( for example Martin could n't use the twitter4r gem ) .
Build paths can get mucked up .
Assumes knowledge of Java , there 's a learning curve , etc .
But these problems are being worked on .
The good bits ?
GUI Builder .
Interface to mature Java libs .
It 's all Ruby .
Cross platform distribution .
No platform dependency on Ruby .
See tweetobix.com to follow through with Martin 's example .
Shoes
Shoes is a GUI framework written by whytheluckystiff .
It was designed as a replacement for an HTML rendering engine for use when teaching people to code , so it 's pretty familiar to people who know a fair bit of HTML .
To install it you do n't install a gem .
Shoes is it 's own version of Ruby .
Download it and install it .
The code is pretty simple .
Murray 's app is called Talon .
You start with a block , which makes a window .
Then you can do stuff to the window .
Here 's the main window ( with no widgets in it ) :
Shoes.app : title => " Talon " do background " #fff " background " talon.jpg " , :bottom => 0 , : right => - 20 flow : width => " 100 % " do background " #df9 " , : curve => 12 title " Talon " , : stroke => " #691 FFF " , : align => " center " end end
The styling is a lot like CSS .
Backgrounds can be layered .
To layout widgets you do n't worry about layout managers ; you use stacks and flows .
Stacks allow you to lay things out vertically ( a bit like a vbox in GTK ) .
Flows are similar , but run horizontally ( a GTK hbox ) .
To load a gem you must reference it in the setup block .
This will ensure that when somebody runs your app that all required gems will be installed , rather than throwing a backtrace .
Shoes.setup do gem " twitter " end require " twitter "
Murray showed a lot of example code for laying out and animating widgets .
It seems very clear and succinct .
You can ask Shoes to package your app with one click , and it builds a package for Windows , Mac , etc .
For more info you can access the manual :
$ shoes -- manual
You should also check out Nobody Knows Shoes , which -- Murray assures us -- is fantastic .
The code for Murray 's example ( Talon ) is available on github .
Cracking stuff .
The Afternoon Session
At this point we went off to the pub for lunch , but when we got back I took notes in the afternoon session too .
See Notes from the Ruby Manor ( part 2 ) .
I love feedback and questions — please get in touch on Twitter or leave a comment .
" The situation is so confusing that people panic and hypercorrect .
To get it right , you need to look up the rules every time you think an apostrophe might be needed – and do this for the next six months in order to ' internalise ' the rules . "
Just when you thought the Pentagon ’s Dr. Strangeloves could n’t design anything more devilish than they have already , new plans on the drawing board may help make the science of repression an ever - more lucrative market for capitalist grifters in the defense and security industries .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Pentagon geek - squad that designs insidious ways to kill people , has announced a new project , Harnessing Infrastructure for Building Reconnaissance ( HIBR ) .
The Broad Agency Announcement ( BAA09 - 08 ) published October 10 , is seeking industry proposals for a suite of high - tech tools that will provide “ warfighters ” and “ peacekeepers ” with the uncanny ability to peer inside your apartment building , in what the agency claims would be an unprecedented opportunity to map rooms , stairwells and people in real - time – the better to “ pacify ” them .
When the project is completed , DARPA hopes it will have contrived a technology that can electronically bore into a 10 - story building with a dual - level basement .
According to DARPAcrats HIBR will develop ,
… broad and diverse technologies necessary for external sensing deep inside buildings with the objective of providing a suite of sensing technologies for situational awareness both above - and below - ground suitable across a broad range of building environments .
The component technologies must support all external ISR [ intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance ] concepts of operations ranging from pre-mission planning through detailed assessment of targeted structures , and live updates during mission execution .
( DARPA , Strategic Technology Office , “ Harnessing Infrastructure for Building Technology , ” BAA09 - 08 , October 10 , 2008 )
Indeed , the Strategic Technology Office ( STO ) will fully “ investigate individual technological approaches that leverage building infrastructure to opportunistically collect information for interior awareness .
DARPA believes that opportunistic sensing may be exploited to infer urban interior building awareness using exterior observations . ”
Readers of Antifascist Calling are well acquainted with the Pentagon ’s unbridled lust for “ situational awareness . ”
A DoD buzzword linked to the Rumsfeldian Revolution in Military Affairs ( RMA , also referred to as “ network - centric warfare ” ) , “ situational awareness ” is a theoretical warfighting construct that proposes ubiquitous military control over the “ battlespace . ”
This will be achieved by the deployment of “ stealth ” technologies , “ precision ” targeting via microscale sensor arrays and satellite geopositioning of military assets .
RMA presupposes that America ’s technological “ edge ” will translate into “ full - spectrum dominance ” over adversaries on land , air , sea and in space , thus assuring U.S. imperialist domination well into the 21st century .
Despite the cruel reality that automatic garage door openers , throw - away cell phones and decades ’ old ordnance reduced the “ up - armored ” American military machine to twisted hulks of molten metal in Iraq and Afghanistan , the high - tech “ revolution ” will continue , indeed intensify !
Since the 1980s , forward - looking military theoreticians have cautioned that all the high - tech wizardry in the world will not defeat determined insurgent forces .
This realization led to a rethinking of Army doctrine called Military Operations on Urban Terrain ( MOUT ) linked to “ asymmetric ” ( guerrilla ) warfare planning against well - entrenched partisans , particularly in cities .
They pointed to the examples of Algeria , Vietnam and El Salvador , particularly when guerrilla forces ( FLN , NLF and FMLN ) despite years of brutal counterguerrilla operations against their civilian infrastructures , launched bold urban offensives .
While guerrilla forces in cities may have been defeated militarily , the political dynamics created by ubiquitous “ facts on the ground ” rebounded unfavorably on the U.S. and their allies .
Indeed , an American colonel reportedly said to Vietnam People ’s Army commander General Vo Nguyen Giap , the brilliant tactician who defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu ( 1954 ) and fought the Americans to a stalemate during the Tet Offensive ( 1968 ) : “ You know , you never beat us in a battle . ”
Giap replied , “ That may be so , but it is also irrelevant . ”
As the battleground shifted from opposing NATO and Warsaw Pact armies facing off against one another to global South , and perhaps in the near future , heimat cities , urban space was envisaged as a labyrinthian warren hiding “ nests ” of insurgents and other “ enemies , ” say the vast majority of citizens who do n’t want to be “ liberated ” by imperialism .
A perusal of Joint Publication 3-06 , Doctrine for Joint Urban Operations ( JUO 3-06 ) , published in September 2002 under the auspices of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , provides an overview of Pentagon thinking as it relates to urban warfare planning .
As the authors of JUO 3-06 aver ,
Cities reduce the advantages of the technologically superior force .
The physical terrain of cities tends to reduce line of sight ( LOS ) and the ability to observe fires , inhibits command , control , and communications capability , makes aviation operations more difficult , and decreases the effectiveness of naval surface fire support and indirect fire support .
It also degrades logistics , and often reduces ground operations to the level of small unit combat .
In addition , the constraints imposed by a need to minimize civilian casualties and preserve infrastructure further reduce technological advantage .
( JUO 3 - 06 , I - 7 , 8 )
Despite the observations of Pentagon planners themselves , Rumsfeld ’s “ transformational ” hubris with its over - reliance on “ network - centric ” means of waging counterinsurgent warfare came at a very steep price , particularly as the cost of invading and occupying resource - rich global South cities led inevitably to high U.S. casualty rates as local insurgencies successfully fought back .
As we have seen , the political fallout on the home front in the wake of the disastrous Iraq occupation , increased geometrically as America ’s high - tech military machine was countered by throw away items and low - tech ordnance applied in ingenious ways .
As Durham University geographer Stephen Graham observed ,
The first key effort to redirect the RMA to the purported challenges of US forces attempting to dominate and control global south cities involve programmes designed to saturate such cities with myriads of networked surveillance systems .
The dream of US military theorists is that this can be done to such an extent that any identified target can be automatically identified at any time and so exposed to high - technology tracking and killing powers of ‘ network - centric ’ weapons .
Such visions imagine pervasive and interlinked arrays of ‘ loitering ’ and ’ embedded ’ sensors as overcoming all the limits and interruptions that megacity environments place in the way of successfully implementing network centric warfare .
( Stephen Graham , “ From Space to Street Corners : Global South Cities and US Military Technophilia , ” unpublished paper , 2007 , p. 18 )
Hence , outfits such as DARPA single - mindedly pursue technological workarounds to the innumerable political conundrums posed by occupation and resistance .
But far from leading to a diminution of resistance , increasing levels of repression and violence at the heart of systems such as HIBR will inevitably have a boomerang effect .
Thus HIBR , if technologically feasible , will be incorporated with other projects actively pursued by STO such as VisiBuilding .
As I wrote in July ,
VisiBuilding will address “ a pressing need in urban warfare : seeing inside buildings . ”
This Orwellian project proposes to 1 ) determine building layouts ; 2 ) find anomalous quantities of materials and 3 ) locate people within the building .
VisiBuilding “ will develop knowledge - deriving architectures for sensing people and objects in buildings ” in order to “ find which buildings should be searched , through detailed assessment of targeted structures for building layouts and behavioral analysis , live updates of building occupancy to support building raids , and finally post- mission analysis to find hidden objects or people . ”
( “ America ’s Cyborg Warriors , ” Antifascist Calling , July 23 , 2008 )
DARPAcrats hope that once overhead drones , prepositioned sensors and data derived by satellites have zeroed - in on “ which buildings should be searched , ” HIBR will provide “ peacekeepers ” kitted out with additional suites of sensors , real - time architectural snapshots of every room , wall , stairwell and basement in the “ target ” building , as well as “ the structural , electrical , plumbing , and ventilation systems . ”
Accordingly , DARPA theorizes that “ such information may be acquired through access to the exterior of buildings which may include direct contact with an exterior umbilical , but does not require contact or deployments within the building , ” and that “ multiple approaches may be required to provide complete building interior awareness . ”
In other words , “ approaches to acquiring such information may require active as well as passive sensing . ”
Meaning that “ mission execution ” may require previous intelligence gathering such as that supplied by infiltrators , provocateurs and other “ mission friendly ” assets bought - off by U.S. “ liberators . ”
But as Dr. Steve Wright , an Information Technology professor at Leeds Metropolitan University wrote ,
Peace enforcement implies coercion –including the kind of operations currently being undertaken in Iraq –while pacification operations imply a much more violent approach of wiping out dissent at any cost .
These latter operations … may be regarded as completely illegitimate by the targeted population .
In such a context , as a state loses legitimacy , it also loses authority and must deploy increasing levels of force in its enforcement activities , just to maintain the status quo .
During pacification operations , activities may go beyond the limits of the law and spawn a catalogue of human rights abuses including a crackdown on all forms of dissent , total surveillance and tracking of human rights defenders , ‘ disappearances ’ , imprisonment without trial and a range of cruel , degrading and inhumane treatments of the civilian population , including torture and extra-judicial execution .
( Dr. Steven Wright , “ Violent Peacekeeping : The Rise and Rise of Repressive Techniques and Technologies , ” Praxis Centre , Leeds Metropolitan University , UK , 28 January 2005 , pp. 1 - 2 )
Needless to say , Wright has described the entire panoply of horrors unleashed by the United States across the planetary “ battlespace ” of imperialism ’s “ war on terror . ”
And as I have documented in numerous articles , the coercive and repressive technologies of surveillance and control deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq have most certainly migrated from the “ network - centric ” fantasies of Pentagon repressors and come home with a vengeance .
From warrantless wiretapping , data mining and satellite surveillance , to the “ watch listing ” of dissidents , others deemed “ suspect ” by the panoptic police state , to the “ preemptive ” targeting of activists and journalists during the recent Denver and St. Paul political conventions of the major capitalist parties , “ keeping the lid on ” is a major preoccupation of our political masters .
But as socialist historian Mike Davis sagely reminds us in Planet of Slums : “ If the empire can deploy Orwellian technologies of repression , its outcasts have the gods of chaos on their side . ”
Study : Abstinence pledges may trigger risky sexual behavior NEW HAVEN , Conn .
( AP )  Adolescents who pledge to remain virgins until marriage are more likely to substitute high - risk sexual behaviors that increase the likelihood of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases , according to researchers who studied the sex lives of about 12,000 teens .
The report by Yale and Columbia University researchers could help explain why a study by the same group last year found that despite having fewer sexual partners and getting married earlier , teens who pledge abstinence are just as likely to have STDs as their peers .
The latest study , published in the April issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health , found that teens who pledge abstinence until marriage are more likely to have oral and anal sex than other teens who have not had intercourse .
" They substitute other non-coital sex , which , however , puts you at risk , " said Hannah Brueckner , assistant professor of sociology at Yale University and one of the study 's authors .
Among virgins , boys who have pledged abstinence were four times more likely to have had anal sex , according to the study .
Overall , pledgers were six times more likely to have oral sex than teens who have remained abstinent but not as part of a pledge .
The pledging group was also less likely to use condoms during their first sexual experience or get tested for STDs , the study found .
Data from the study was taken from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health .
The study used an in - school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7 through 12 , and followed up with a series of in - home interviews of students approximately one , two , and six years later .
It was funded in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Leslee Unruh , president of the National Abstinence Clearinghouse in Sioux Falls , S.D. , called the study " bogus , " and disputed that those involved had pledged true " abstinence . "
" Kids who pledge abstinence are taught that any word that has ' sex ' in it is considered a sexual activity , " Unruh said .
" Therefore oral sex is sex , and they are staying away . "
Millions of teens have signed written pledges or verbally promised to abstain from sex , part of a church - led effort to discourage premarital sex and the spread of disease .
President Bush has boosted funding for abstinence - only education in schools .
Critics say that education needs to be coupled with safe - sex education to be effective .
" If adolescents only had sex in monogamous , married relationships , by definition there would be no STDs , " Brueckner said , echoing President Bush 's remarks in last year 's State of the Union address .
" But the majority of adolescents do n't live like that .
They do have sex . "
Last year , the same research team found that 88 % of teens who pledge abstinence end up having sex before marriage , compared with 99 % of teens who do not make a pledge .

Hello .
We are in Day 7 of the food change over and it is nothing short of amazing .
Prior to buying Gentle Giants , we had to sprinkle some meat or pour some gravy on his food to get our dog , Dewy , to eat .
Now , when he hears it hit the bowl , he actually runs to eat , and eats it all , every time .
Tomorrow , we go 100 % Gentle Giants and are excited about it .
His energy level us up 100 % , too .
He 's wearing me out playing with him , but it 's FANTASTIC .
Thanks .

Love the food
Thanks , our dog Dewy , has lost a noticeable amount of weight .
We are going to get him weighed this week .
Several people have commented on the softness of his fur and he HAS walked away from finishing several meals .
We believed , but were skeptical .
IT WORKS !
Today , just about 6 weeks into it we put food in a big Tool Box , hoping he would self - regulate , but still a little skeptical .
In his first 3 feedings today , he only ate for about a minute then walked away .
My wife was AMAZED .
We should have the control he has eating .
THANKS .

Dear Gentle Giants :
I just wanted to let you know that I bought a large bag of Gentle Giants dog food today for my one - year - old male chocolate labrador retriever !
He is very picky about his kibble .
As soon as I put the Gentle Giants kibble in his bowl , he gobbled it up !
I was feeding him Science Diet Large Breed Adult food and he would not eat it unless I mixed in cooked chicken or ground beef .
Today I mixed the Science Diet with the Gentle Giants kibble and he did not eat the Science Diet !
He left all of the Science Diet kibble on the floor !
I will send you another email in the next couple of weeks to let you know how he is doing on his new food .
Sincerely ,
Evelyn M .
The Jaguar driver who police said veered onto a Mission District sidewalk at high speed and killed a cafe worker was recently released from prison and was barred from driving , having been punished with license suspensions three times this year , records show .
Jason Yantes was charged Tuesday with felony vehicular manslaughter and unlicensed driving , and was also accused of violating probation orders handed down after a drug - dealing conviction .
Yantes is expected to be arraigned today .
Prosecutors reviewed , among other evidence , footage from a private surveillance camera that captured the crash , authorities said .
Police said Yantes either passed out or fell asleep just after 8 a.m. Monday and ran over Gaspar Caballero , 27 , in a 1992 Jaguar convertible XJS that was traveling north on Mission Street near 21st Street .
Police said the car was going faster than the 25 - mph speed limit .
Yantes , a San Francisco resident , has struggled with drug use , said Miss Major , the organizing director of a nonprofit group with which Yantes volunteered .
San Francisco authorities said Yantes turned 36 on Tuesday , but state records show Yantes is 35 and has a birthday in late October .
Yantes remains at San Francisco General Hospital , where she is recovering from facial and skull injuries suffered in the crash .
A law enforcement source said Yantes had cried and expressed remorse for Caballero 's death .
" She was dealing with a lot of stuff , " said Major , of the Transgender , Gender Variant and Intersex Justice Project , which advocates for transgender inmates .
Yantes is a transgender person who identifies as a woman and goes by the name " Lala , " Major said .
She said Yantes ' best friend died about two weeks ago from a drug overdose .
" This is not something she 's going to live with quietly , " Major said of the fatal crash .
" It 's really going to eat her up . "
State records show Yantes has past felony convictions for receiving stolen property , burglary and forgery , and has been in and out of prison since 1999 .
She has a history of being sent back to prison for violating parole , and was most recently released July 2 .
The Department of Motor Vehicles said Yantes , while out of prison earlier this year , repeatedly failed to appear in court to deal with citations .
Records show she was ticketed for driving without a license and without proof of registration or insurance .
San Francisco police Inspector Matt Krimsky said he was awaiting test results of blood drawn from Yantes after Monday 's crash before concluding whether she had been intoxicated .
He said a gun that police found in the car turned out to be a plastic replica .
The victim in the crash , Caballero , worked at Cafe La Taza a block north of where the accident happened .
Cafe owner Noel Martinez said Caballero made sandwiches at the cafe and had been on his way to buy ingredients at a nearby market when he was struck .
Riots display human beings acting at their worst .
Usually the result of political or social turmoil , most riots rely on killing , raping , looting and widespread destruction to get their point across .
After examining the tolls that riots take on society , we have to wonder whether this is an effective way to bring about change .
Below are the accounts of the 25 worst riots of all time .
These stories may shock and appall you .
1. Brixton riot ( 1981 )
The riots that erupted in Brixton , London were some of the worst the UK has ever seen .
On the evening of April 12 , police arrived at the scene of a stabbing to question the young , black victim .
As they tried to get him into a car to take him to the hospital , civilians tried to intervene .
The police were attacked , but eventually managed to quell the situation .
Because of the incident , police increased their numbers patrolling the streets .
The very next day , angry citizens began to pelt police cars with bricks , and rioting broke up .
When all was said and done , 279 police and 45 civilians were injured , over one hundred cars were burned , 150 buildings were damaged and thirty were torched .
2. LA Riots
On April 29th , 1992 , a jury acquitted two white police officers for charges of the videotaped beating black motorist Rodney King .
As a result of this verdict , thousands of citizens rioted for six days .
Mass amounts of looting , murder , arson and assault took place , resulting in over a billion dollars in total damage , and the loss of 53 lives .
3. Detroit Riot of 1967
When police performed a raid on a Detroit after hours drinking club , they found 82 people holding a party for two returning Vietnam veterans .
The police arrested all of these people , and this resulted in widespread rioting .
The riots began in the northeast section and spread to the east over the course of five days .
Widespread looting , fires and murders took place , and the situation got so bad that the National Guard and the 82nd airborne division were mobilized to quell the violence .
When it was over , 43 people were dead , 1189 were injured and over 7000 people were arrested .
4. Watts Riots
In August of 1965 , police pulled over a motorcyclist believed to be intoxicated .
The driver , Marquette Frye failed to pass a sobriety test and was arrested .
As the police ordered to impound the cycle , a crowd slowly began to form .
Dozens grew to hundreds who began throwing rocks at the police .
Racial tensions grew over the course of the next couple days until a violent riot broke out claiming the lives of 34 people and injuring 1,032 .
5. 2007 Nairobi , Kenya Riots
Political unrest turned into deadly rioting in what has been called the biggest threat to East Africa ’s most stable democracy .
Citizens of Nairobi , Kenya believed that the reelection of Mwai Kibaki was a sham , and some of the most violent rioting in history ensued .
From Nairobi to the Coast , hundreds were killed and buildings were burned by machete wielding rioters .
Club carrying police officers tried to restore order by firing tear gas and live bullets into the immense crowds .
Crowds moved across villages , torching buildings , raping women and killing .
Hundreds fled in fear from this violent demonstration of human beings at their worst .
6. Gujarat Riots
In September of 2008 , a Muslim mob attacked and burned a train .
The mob also threw rocks onto the train to prevent passengers from escaping .
Riots resulted from the attack claiming the lives of thousands .
Most tragically , over 600 children were orphaned when all was said and done .
These figures do n’t take into account the 223 people reported missing and assumed dead .
7. 1981 Belfast Riots
Protests in Belfast , Ireland took a different form than what we have examined so far .
Irish republican prisoners felt that the prison guards had been unreasonably violent toward them and tried to carry out a “ dirty protest ” , refusing to wash and covering their walls in excrement .
Apparently this did not get the results they had hoped for , so they decided to try a hunger strike .
Ten people starved themselves to death over the course of the 53 - day strike until guards complied with their demands .
8. Serbia Riots
On Monday , October 13 , 2008 riots broke out over Serbia ’s decision to recognize Kosovo ’s independence .
The Serbs called the decision treasonous and proceeded to throw flares and other destructive objects at state buildings .
Police responded by firing tear gas into the crowds of thousands of angry rioters .
9. Tulsa Race Riot
In 1921 , America witnessed the worst example of racial violence in history .
When a white female elevator operator claimed that a black man has sexually assaulted her in the elevator , violence broke out .
The man fled the scene and a manhunt begun for his capture .
This precipitated a riot that claimed the lives of hundreds of people .
The rioting got so bad that the opposing sides of blacks and whites , many of whom were WWI veterans , began forming battle lines and digging trenches , waging a makeshift war against each other .
Overall , 35 city blocks were destroyed by fire , leaving 10,000 homeless and causing estimates of 1.8 million ( this would amount to 21 million in today ’s money ) .
10 . 1844 Philadelphia Nativist Riots
In May of 1844 , Nativist groups began spreading rumors that the Catholic Church was planning on removing the bible from schools .
This rumor fueled the anti-catholic tensions that were the result of the growing population of Irish immigrants .
The tension broke and riots erupted at a Nativist rally on May 6th .
The violence caused the destruction of two Catholic churches , the burning of many homes and buildings the deaths of fourteen people and the injury of 50 more .
11 . Hippodrome Revolt
Chariot Racing was a huge sport in the Roman Empire , and its spectators took team affiliation quite seriously .
When it came to be that two chariot racers ( one of them a member of the blue team and one a member of the green team ) were taking refuge from the law in a church , an angry mob surrounded the church .
Emperor Justinian was very nervous about the situation and had to postpone the race a couple of days .
On the day of the race the massive crowd of spectators began throwing insults at Justinian and chanting “ Win ! ” and “ Conquer ! ”
The crowd eventually turned violent and began tearing apart the palace .
This inevitably ended with the imperial troops taking the Hippodrome by storm and killing over 30,000 rioters .
This was the most violent riot that Constantinople had ever seen , and when it was over , half the city lay in burnt ruins .
12 . 2005 Civil Unrest in France
From October to November of 2005 , a series of riots and violent demonstrations raged throughout the streets of France .
When police were called to a construction site to investigate a possible break in , three teenagers fled , apparently thinking they were being chased .
The teens hid in a power station .
At some point that night , the boys were electrocuted and two of them were killed .
This broke pre-existing tensions over the supposed history of police brutality , and the riots began .
Cars were burned , buildings were set ablaze , hundreds were injured and one lay dead before order was restored .
Over - all property damage was estimated at just under 200 million dollars .
13 . The Boston Massacre
The incident started when a wigmaker ’s apprentice , Edward Gerrish , complained to local army British soldiers that a man named John Goldfinch had not paid his bill .
Goldfinch ignored these claims , but Gerrish returned later with a small crowd .
The tension grew .
The crowd grew , shouting insults at the soldiers , and as the evening grew later an estimated 300- 400 people surrounded the troops and pressed them into a tight circle .
The soldiers fired their muskets under duress and killed five colonists .
14 . The Plague Riot in Moscow , 1771
When the Bubonic Plague struck Russia , the government took extreme measures to try and contain the outbreak .
These measures included closing most public buildings including stores and schools , and a small food shortage .
Outraged , the citizens of Moscow planned a massive uprising .
On September 16th 1771 , a riot broke out and captured the Donskoy Monastery where Archbishop Ambrosius was hiding .
He was captured and killed .
15 . Bristol Bridge Riots
In 1793 , the government of Bristol England wanted to raise tolls for the Bristol Bridge and demolish several houses nearby to make room for more roads leading to it .
The citizens responded by forming a huge riot .
11 people were killed and 45 were injured .
The Bristol Bridge riot goes down as one of the worst riots of the 18th century .
16 . Bloody Monday
On August 6th of 1855 , riots broke out in Philadelphia spawned out of an intense rivalry between the Democrats and the Know - Nothing party .

When the riots were over an estimated 120 civilians were killed and property damage was estimated at about 1 million dollars .
18 . Chinese massacre of 1871
The Chinese massacre of 1871 was a racially charged riot that claimed the lives of between 18 - 23 Chinese residents of Los Angeles .

As with most riots , arson and theft were also prevalent .
20 . New Mexico Penitentiary Riot
The New Mexico Penitentiary riot was one of the most violent prison riots America has ever seen .

On February 2nd , 1980 , the prisoners began taking guards as hostages and rioting broke loose .
These guards were brutally beaten and raped by their captors .
By the morning of February 3rd all hell had broken loose .
Gangs were fighting rival gangs , dangerous criminals being held in solitary confinement had escaped and were exacting revenge on other criminals , and prisoners were being pulled from their cells to be beaten , raped , killed and burned .
The National Guard soon set up refugee tents outside the prison , which , due to deliberately set fires , began to burn down .
Many prisoners fled for safety to the camps and it was n’t long until the National Guard entered the prison to assess the damage and take a body count .
Over all , there were 33 confirmed deaths and 200 injuries .
21 . Louisville riots of 1968

The situation only got worse as rumors that SNCC speaker Stokely Carmichael ’s plane scheduled to arrive in Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites .
Bottles began to be thrown and , before long , rioting broke loose .

Ashwin Navin , former president and co-founder of BitTorrent Inc. has left the company after four years .
Thus far , the company has n't been a great success , but the BitTorrent protocol is more alive than ever .
Now he can talk more freely , we ask Ashwin about his view on the future of BitTorrent , piracy and online media .
Navin , who stays involved with BitTorrent as a board member , will start a new venture with a couple of friends including YouTube ’s Steve Chen .
Their goal is to support new tech startups in the San Fransisco area , and provide them with office space where they can work on their ideas .
His position as president of BitTorrent never held Navin back much .
With quotes such as “ iTunes DRM Inspires People to Pirate Content , ” he was very clear about his attitude towards digital rights management for example .
Still , he often found himself in an awkward position , where he had to please the average BitTorrent user , but also the big Hollywood studios .
Now Navin has quit his job at BitTorrent Inc , we decided to do an exit interview , hoping he can speak a little more freely .
“ My BitTorrent tenure certainly did n’t feel like four years , ” was the first thing Navin told TorrentFreak .
“ But time flies when working among good people , world - changing ideas , and great fun !
What attracted me to BitTorrent in the first place , and what is still inspiring to this day , is its ability to provide people true digital freedom . ”
Indeed , the BitTorrent protocol provides freedom , but that is also why the entertainment industry is hesitant to adopt it .
They do n’t want freedom for consumers , but they do want to maintain their cash flow .
Nevertheless , one way or another , BitTorrent provides the entertainment industry with a whole new set of tools , something with which Navin seems to agree .
“ For its direct and indirect benefits , I believe BitTorrent sits among the handful of important technology breakthroughs such as the printing press , broadcasting , and the Internet itself .
Why ?
Today ’s publishing technology – like blogs , BitTorrent , and video sharing sites for example – quite directly forge a level playing field for creativity , ” Navin said .
“ Indirectly , these tools force large media companies to realize that there is no longer scarcity or a stranglehold on distribution that locks people out of self - expression .
Anyone can speak to the world in any format , without filters .
Freedom of Speech has never been so available to the masses .
How these large corporations respond to this fundamental realization will benefit many many millions of people–creators and consumers alike . ”
Navin hits the nail on the head here .
BitTorrent is a great technology with a lot of potential .
The thing the entertainment industry has to do , is find a way to leverage it .
Listening to consumers instead of trying to shut them up would be a good place to start .
The Internet has put the consumer in control , and it ’s time for the copyright holders to realize this .
Or as Navin puts it :
“ The free flow of information and entertainment over the Internet does n’t diminish the relevance of high value , professional entertainment at all .
It does force the publishers to be more quality conscious ( make fewer flops , and more hits ) .
And the great cardinal sin in this era would be to withhold your content in exclusive deals or to be too precious with your creation .
Now ’s the time to be more promiscuous with your distribution strategy than before : be everywhere at once , wherever there are eyeballs you can count . ”
“ In the previous era , there was a lot of forgiveness when 3 or 4 companies owned every road to the consumer .
Publishers could produce a crap movie or TV show and get away with it .
But when there are millions of ways to get to the user , or in other words , millions of “ channels ” to choose from , the best entertainment presented in the most frictionless format always wins . ”
So , Navin argues that piracy leads to less crap .
The entertainment business now has to make stuff people actually want to listen to or watch .
Unfortunately for them , it is getting harder and harder to influence and direct consumers to see things the way they want to .
Information is more free than ever before and consumers have a choice now , and that will not go away .
It ’s up to Hollywood to take the next step , and compete with piracy .
lmfao never saw something so funny .

OSLO ( Reuters ) -
The world could eliminate fossil fuel use by 2090 by spending trillions of dollars on a renewable energy revolution , the European Renewable Energy Council ( EREC ) and environmental group Greenpeace said on Monday .
Raindrops are seen on a car windscreen as mist obscures power - lines and chimneys from the coal - burning Mount Piper Power station , located in the Central West region of New South Wales , around 150 kilometres ( 93 miles ) west of Sydney , May 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / David Gray
The 210 - page study is one of few reports -- even by lobby groups -- to look in detail at how energy use would have to be overhauled to meet the toughest scenarios for curbing greenhouse gases outlined by the U.N. Climate Panel .
“ Renewable energy could provide all global energy needs by 2090 , ” according to the study , entitled “ Energy ( R) evolution . ” EREC represents renewable energy industries and trade and research associations in Europe .
A more radical scenario could eliminate coal use by 2050 if new power generation plants shifted quickly to renewables .
Solar power , biomass such as biofuels or wood , geothermal energy and wind could be the leading energies by 2090 in a shift from fossil fuels blamed by the U.N. Climate Panel for stoking global warming .
Needed energy investments until 2030 , the main period studied , would total $ 14.7 trillion , according to the study .
By contrast , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , which advises rich nations , foresees energy investments of just $ 11.3 trillion to 2030 , with a bigger stress on fossil fuels and nuclear power .
Rajendra Pachauri , head of the U.N. Climate Panel which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with ex-U.S. Vice President Al Gore , called Monday ’s study “ comprehensive and rigorous . ”
DANGEROUS CHANGE
“ Even those who may not agree with the analysis presented would , perhaps , benefit from a deep study of the underlying assumptions , ” he wrote in a foreword to the report .
EREC and Greenpeace said a big energy shift was needed to avoid “ dangerous ” climate change , defined by the European Union and many environmental groups as a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) since before the Industrial Revolution .
The report urged measures such as a phase - out of subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy , “ cap and trade ” systems for greenhouse gas emissions , legally binging targets for renewable energies and tough efficiency standards for buildings and vehicles .
The report said renewable energy markets were booming with turnover almost doubling in 2007 from 2006 to more than $ 70 billion .
It said renewables could more than double their share of world energy supplies to 30 percent by 2030 and reach 50 percent by 2050 .
The projections are far more optimistic for renewables than the IEA , which foresees just 13 percent of energy from renewables in 2030 with fossil fuels staying dominant .
Sven Teske , Greenpeace ’s leading author of the report , said the recommendations would involve big job - creating investments that could help counter the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
“ The current unstable market situation is a strong argument for our energyevolution concept , ” he told Reuters in an e-mail .
He said investments would be repaid by savings in fuel costs .
“ We had a ‘ dot.com bubble ’ and a ‘ finance bubble ’ - but I ’m confident that we will not have a renewables bubble - as the need for energy is real - and growing especially in developing nations , ” he said .

An art lover bought the sketch , Boy with the Big Boots , and found the valuable Eardley painting of a boy hidden behind it
A Scots art buyer who paid £ 22,500 for a drawing by artist Joan Eardley has found a painting hidden inside the frame worth about four times as much .
The art lover sent the drawing , Boy with Big Boots , to be cleaned and when the frame was removed it revealed an oil painting depicting a young boy .
It is thought to show one of Eardley 's favourite models , Andrew Samson .
The new owner , who does not want to be identified , intends to keep both the 1950s works for his private collection .
Art consultant Iain Clark , who runs Artbank - which helps wealthy art lovers build up their collections , took the sketch to Brian McLaughlin , of the Painting & Restoration Studio .
Mr McLaughlin said as he took it out of the frame he noticed there was a signed painting on the back .
" It was astonishing , I was really surprised , " Mr McLaughlin said .
I do n't know who was the original recipient of the drawing , but I think [ Eardley 's ] expected them to get it reframed at some point and to have come across it as a gift
Iain Clark
Art consultant " The two of us just looked at each other open - mouthed for a good three or four seconds .
" Then the excitement hits you and you 're then - wow , we 've just found this and it 's been here for 50 - odd years and we 're the first two people to see it . "
Mr Clark said , although Eardley was renowned for discarding unwanted work , it was a mystery why it was there at all .
" Had it been a bad painting , or had it not been signed , or had it been cut down from something , I would have thought she 'd just used it as backing board , " he said .
" I do n't know who was the original recipient of the drawing , but I think she 's expected them to get it reframed at some point and to have come across it as a gift . "
He added : " Who knows - it 's very difficult to tell . "
The value of Eardley artwork increased recently following the first major exhibition of her work in almost 20 years , which was held at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh last year .
The artist was born in England and moved to Glasgow when she was 19 .
She became famous for her oil paintings of children who played in the streets - usually depicted against a chalk graffiti-ed working class backdrop .
In her later years , Eardley moved to Catterline , just south of Aberdeen , where she painted landscapes .
She died from breast cancer in 1963 at the age of 42 .

What you say in a conversation -- whether it's on a first date , a job interview or pitching an idea -- may be less important than how you say it .
But the cues that may decide the outcome can be so subtle that neither person in the conversation is consciously aware of them .
Whether or not you get the job , or the other person 's phone number , is very strongly influenced by unconscious factors such as the way one person 's speech patterns match the other 's , the level of physical activity as people talk , and the degree to which one person sets the tone -- literally -- of the conversation .
These subtle cues provide " honest signals " about what 's really going on and strongly predict the outcome , according to research by the MIT Media Lab's Alex ( Sandy ) Pentland and his colleagues .
" Honest Signals " is also the title of Pentland 's new book about the research , being published this month by MIT Press .
The research was based on tens of thousands of hours of data from devices about the size of a credit card that record movements and voices , which Pentland has dubbed " sociometers . "
Using just this data , with no knowledge of what was said , Pentland could predict the outcome -- whether a job offer , a second date , or investment in a business plan -- more accurately than by using any other single factor .
Pentland says that this technology is recording and quantifying something that most people already understand intuitively .
" All of this is sort of folk knowledge , " he says , " we all know it 's there , but we all ignore it . "
Pentland , with both a degree in psychology and experience in signal processing , zeroed in on " a few things that seem to come up again and again " in deciding what aspects of human communication to monitor with the new devices .
The features he found that are highly predictive of outcomes , he says , " match the literature in biology about signaling in animals . "
In fact , Pentland suggests , the non-linguistic channels of communication that are measured by the sociometers may have started among our ancestors long before the evolution of language itself , forming a deeper , more primal way of understanding intentions , coordinating activities and establishing power relationships within the group .
" Half of our decision - making seems to be predicted by this unconscious channel , " says Pentland , the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences .
" That 's exactly the channel that you see in apes " as they coordinate their activities without the use of language .
Pentland 's research so far on these non-linguistic signaling channels has been based on getting groups of people , such as attendees at a conference or employees of a company , to wear the sociometers over periods ranging from a day to a month or more .
The devices , which include a microphone for recording voices and accelerometers to measure a person 's movements , are a bit smaller than the name badges typically worn at conferences .
In future research , he says , the same functions could be monitored using specially programmed cellphones .
The data gathered from the devices can be used not only to predict the outcomes of specific interactions between people , but even the relative productivity of different teams within a company .
" This information is not in the organizational charts , " Pentland says .
" This human side is missing from all traditional measures " of how groups of people work together .
The strong correlations between unconscious forms of communication and the decisions that result strongly undermines people 's perception that they are making choices based on rational , conscious factors , Pentland says .
" My data shows that 's simply not true . "
By understanding and measuring factors that people are usually unaware of , he says , " I view it as putting human nature back into our social fabric . "
It may even help to predict the outcome of elections , he says .
For example , by watching for the movements that signal the factor Pentland calls " influence " -- the setting by one person of the tone and pace of a conversation -- in a presidential debate , it is possible to see which person is dominant , regardless of what is being said .
" The person who sets the tone , " he says , " is the one who wins , in every election since 1960 . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A former Republican congressional aide who worked with disgraced U.S. lobbyist Jack Abramoff was arrested on Monday on charges of public corruption and obstructing justice , the Justice Department said .

It said Kevin Ring , 37 , a former lobbyist who worked with Abramoff , was charged with 10 counts that accuse him of conspiring to corrupt congressional and Bush administration officials by giving them items of value for official action to benefit his clients .
Among those listed as conspirators were convicted former U.S. Rep.
Bob Ney , an Ohio Republican , employees of two other unidentified congressional representatives and unidentified officials of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Interior .
The items included all - expenses - paid domestic and international travel , fundraising assistance , meals , drinks , golf , tickets to professional sporting events , concerts and other events , and employment opportunities to spouses of congressional members and staff , an indictment said .
On Capitol Hill , Ring worked as an aide to Republican Rep. John Doolittle of California from 1993 to 1998 .
In 1998 , he worked for a Senate Judiciary subcommittee and in 1999 was executive director of a Republican caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives before joining Abramoff as a lobbyist .
Abramoff was sentenced last week to serve four years in prison in a corruption scandal that rocked Washington ’s power elite and helped Republicans lose control of Congress in 2006 .
He already is serving a nearly six - year term on unrelated charges .
Abramoff was sentenced as part of a plea deal with Justice Department prosecutors in which he cooperated with investigators who pursued corruption cases against lawmakers , former Bush administration officials and others , such as Ring .
Department officials said their investigation was continuing and that others could be charged .
According to the indictment , Ring as a lobbyist solicited and obtained business throughout the United States , including with Native American tribal governments operating and interested in operating gambling casinos .
The indictment charges that Ring made a number of false statements to obstruct grand jury and congressional investigations , lying about his knowledge of Abramoff ’s financial relationship with lobbyist Michael Scanlon , his own receipt of a $ 135,000 kickback and his knowledge of how Abramoff obtained a job for the wife of a congressman .
There are about two weeks left until the general election .
During that election , California will vote on Proposition 8 .
A proposition which would put an amendment into California ’s constitution stating that only marriage between and man and a woman would be recognized .
Recently , the majority of commercials saying , “ Yes on Prop 8 , ” are also saying that the reason to vote “ yes ” is because of our public schools .
One of the big reasons homosexuals should n’t be allowed to get married is because teachers in public schools might mention it .
I went through the California public school system , and I know how much they teach students about marriage – not much .
It is n’t a big part of the lesson plan .
It ’s just one of those things that is required to be taught , so teachers glance over it in a day or two in class .
Is that really going to destroy California ’s children ?
Is that a good reason to take away the rights of some human beings ?
Not only is this a weak argument , but it also blames public schools as a reason for why gay people ca n’t get married .
This is not the case .
It is n’t public schools trying to prevent gay marriage , it is a bunch of fanatical religious groups like the Knights of Columbus , a group who donated $ 1.3 million to support the proposition .
Supporters of prop 8 have more money invested than the people against it , and a lot of the biggest donations are coming from out - of - state .
For a proposition that ’s on California ’s ballot , it ’s strange to see that a lot of people that are n’t from here can try to control the outcome .
So how about letting Californians decide what ’s best for their state ?
And how about keeping religion out of it ?
It ’s tough to keep separation between church and state when the church does n’t try to play by the rules .
Both the church and state need to try to play ball and be separate , the state ca n’t do it by themselves .
This is incredible :
For the first time , ever , astronomers have captured an optical image of a planet orbiting a star like our own .
And that 's not all : we also have a second picture showing TWO planets orbiting a second star !
( Calm down .
Breathe , breathe . )
The first picture is from Hubble .
Ready ?
Here it is :
Do you see it ?
That tiny spark , that wee blip of light ?
It may not look like much , but it is in fact a normal planet orbiting a normal star , 250 trillion kilometers from Earth .
Holy Haleakala .
The picture as a whole needs some splainin ' .
The star in question is Fomalhaut , a star easily visible to the unaided eye ; it 's the brightest star in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus , the 18th brightest in the sky , and only 25 light years away .
It 's literally millions of times brighter than the planet , so the Hubble camera uses an occulting bar , a small piece of metal that blocks the brightest part of the star 's image .
The blacked - out area in the center of the picture is where Fomalhaut is ( also , the star 's image has been digitally subtracted using an image of another star as a template ; that further reduces the amount of unwanted light ) .
The radial lines are not real ; they are an optical effect of the very bright star .
The ring is real ; it 's dust leftover from the formation of the star and the planet .
In fact , the thinness of the ring was a big factor in assuming a planet was lurking there ; the planet 's gravity sculpts the ring , keeping it narrowly confined .
Also , the ring is off - center from the star , and a planet in an elliptical orbit would explain that nicely .
The planet itself is just that small dot , almost lost in the noise from the star and the light from the ring .
I 'll be honest ; had I been analyzing the image , I might have missed it at first .
But it 's there , and it 's real .
Images taken almost two years apart show that the planet is moving with the star , and is consistent with it orbiting Fomalhaut at a distance of about 18 billion km ( 11 billion miles ) .
That 's four times the distance of Neptune from the Sun .
It takes 872 years to make one complete orbit .
The mass is not easy to determine , and is estimated using its effect on the ring ; it 's likely to be about the same size and mass as Jupiter .
The planet is unnamed , and is simply called Fomalhaut b. I am reeling from this image .
Years ago , when I still worked on Hubble , I did some work on planetary debris rings like this , including seeing if we could directly see planets near stars .
The amount of work that goes into this type of discovery is phenomenal , and so I 'm stunned by the success of it .
This is huge news .
And it gets even huger .
Because there 's more :
That image is the first to directly show two planets orbiting another star !
It 's a near - infrared image using the giant Gemini North 8 meter telescope .
Like in the Hubble image , the star 's light has been blocked , allowing the two planets to be seen ( labeled b and c ) .
The star is called HR 8799 .
It 's a bit more massive ( 1.5 times ) and more luminous ( 5x ) than the Sun , and lies about 130 light years from Earth .
The planets in this picture orbit it at distances of 6 billion km ( 3.6 billion miles ) and 10.5 billion km ( 6.3 billion miles ) .
A third planet , not seen in this image but discovered later using the Keck 10 meter telescope , orbits the star closer in at a distance of 3.8 billion km ( 2.3 billion miles ) .
So there it is .
The first ever family portrait of a planetary system .
One thing that makes these particular planets a bit easier to find than usual is that they are young ; HR 8799 and its children are only about 60 million years old .
That means the planets are still glowing from the leftover heat of their formation , and that adds to their brightness .
Eventually ( in millions of years ) , as they cool , they will glow only by reflected light from the star , and be far harder to see .
Fomalhaut b , in the Hubble image , is much older ( 200 million years ) , and glows only by reflected light from Fomalhaut .
If it were much smaller or dimmer ( or closer to the blinding light of the star ) , we would n't have been able to see it at all .
These images were basically science fiction just a few years ago .
Now they are fact .
We have an optical picture of a planet orbiting another sun-like star , and a picture of two planets orbiting another star .
Wow .
Just wow .
OK , now that you have the news , a few caveats .
We now know of more than 300 planets orbiting other stars .
And a planet has been imaged before , but it was orbiting a brown dwarf , which is different than a normal star like the Sun .
Brown dwarfs are so - called " failed stars " , much smaller than the Sun .
Another possible planet orbiting a sun- like star has been imaged , but has not yet been confirmed .
So these images here really are firsts .
They are history .
I still can hardly believe it , and I worked on data like this !
Yet there they are , proof that our planetary system is not the only one in the Universe .
We knew this already ; indirect evidence confirms planets and even multiple planetary systems around many nearby stars .
But there 's nothing like a picture .
There , with your own eyes , you can see for yourself that other planets exist .
They are not Earthlike , not even a little ... they are massive , young , hot planets that are probably mostly gaseous and completely inhospitable .
But there they are .
In a few years , we 'll have more pictures like these .
And we 'll get better .
Our telescopes will get bigger , our equipment more sensitive , our techniques improved as we understand their capabilities .
And the pictures of other planets will roll in .
How long before we see the Holy Grail , the first image of a terrestrial planet , orbiting a star like the Sun at just the right distance for liquid water to bathe its surface ?
It may not be for a decade or two , but mark my words : that day will arrive .
And when it does , well , we 'll just have to rewrite the history books again , wo n't we ?
Even as they plot their paths to victory , Barack Obama and John McCain are thinking past election day , enlisting advisors to quietly vet potential Cabinet secretaries , devise a governing strategy and assemble the rudiments of a new White House .
Preparing for the presidency is something the two campaigns are loath to talk about .
Neither wants to appear presumptuous to voters who wo n’t pick a winner for two weeks .
But with the economy teetering and the nation at war , both sides are planning for a transition that students of the presidency say is the most consequential since 1861 , on the eve of the Civil War .
“ I do n’t mean to be hysterical , but this is the toughest transition faced by any president since [ Abraham ] Lincoln , ” said Paul Light , a professor at New York University ’s Wagner School of Public Service .
“ There is very little wiggle room .
There ’s the fiscal crisis , we are in a couple of wars and there is international tension . ”
Of the two candidates , Obama ’s preparations to take over Jan. 20 are further along .
People close to him say that a kind of Democratic government - in - exile is laying detailed plans to smoothly take control should he prevail .
Advertisement
McCain aides , echoing the candidate ’s criticism that Obama is already “ measuring the drapes ” in the Oval Office , said Obama ’s transition work is a sign of overconfidence .
Rick Davis , McCain ’s campaign manager , said the Illinois senator was making a “ public splash ” by planning for a future administration .
“ It ’s not in the nature of John McCain to tempt fate , ” he said .
The Arizona senator ’s effort is headed by John F. Lehman Jr. , a Navy secretary under President Reagan .
William Timmons Sr. , a prominent Washington lobbyist who helped plan Reagan ’s and President Bush ’s transitions , sent material about the mechanics of presidential transitions to the McCain campaign a month ago .
In an odd political twist , the Obama operation is dominated by alumni of the Clinton political machine , some of whom worked for Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries .

John Podesta , a chief of staff under President Clinton , has spent much of the election year helping 50 experienced Washington hands -- including a couple of Republicans -- compile a comprehensive transition blueprint , one that most thought would be used by Hillary Clinton .
An early outline showed it to have 50 chapters , written for the most part by Clinton veterans , with planning down to the sub -Cabinet level .
Now that project , soon to be published as a book , would help guide an Obama transition if he were to win .
Podesta , who declined to discuss the transition , is based at the Center for American Progress , a left - of - center Washington think tank set up by Clinton allies that has emerged as the unofficial headquarters of Obama ’s transition planning .
With no designated transition office , Podesta is coordinating much of the work from the center , trying to keep his two jobs separate .
Podesta has set up teams aligned with Cabinet agencies and government departments .
Leon E. Panetta , another former Clinton chief of staff and a onetime California congressman , is part of a group evaluating candidates for senior White House staff and high - level national security and economic policy positions .
Advertisement
“ They ’re collecting names of people and resumes , ” said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , an Obama supporter who also worked in the Clinton White House .
Prominent aides to Clinton , such as former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and former White House economic advisor Gene Sperling , are helping shape the economic ideas that would inform an Obama administration , a mission that is all the more urgent with financial markets in turmoil .
“ Definitely , the next president will have to face it immediately , ” said Jason Furman , a top economic advisor to Obama who noted that he would want swift passage of a plan aimed at the middle class .
Last week , Obama called for tax credits for businesses that created jobs and a 90 - day moratorium on home foreclosures .
On environmental matters , the Obama team is getting advice from Carol Browner , who headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton era .
Advertisement
Those close to Podesta say there are intentional parallels between a possible Obama transition and one widely heralded as a model : the carefully calibrated transfer of power that took place in 1980 when staff members working for Reagan collaborated with a relatively new Washington think tank , the Heritage Foundation .
One expert at the Center for American Progress advising Obama , defense analyst Lawrence Korb , played roles in the Reagan transition and the Reagan Defense Department .
In 1980 , Korb wrote a chapter on defense policy for the transition book prepared by the Heritage Foundation .
Now , Korb is writing a chapter on Iraq for the Center for American Progress ’ book .
No decisions seem to have been made about who would staff the highest levels of an Obama administration .
But names are floating about .
Tom Daschle , the former Senate Democratic leader , has been mentioned as a possible chief of staff .
Daschle is a senior fellow at the same think tank that is home to Podesta .
In an interview last week , Daschle did not rule out an appointment as chief of staff .
“ It ’s way too early to make any comments about it , ” he said .
“ It ’s always a possibility , but I ’ve not had any conversations with anybody about future positions and do n’t intend to . ”
Advertisement
A possible holdover from the Bush administration is Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates .
Senior national security advisors to Obama and McCain have acknowledged both are considering asking Gates to stay on to provide continuity in a time of war .
Gates has repeatedly said he intends to retire to his home near Seattle when Bush ’s term ends .
Asked Friday at a Pentagon news conference if his thinking had changed , Gates said : “ Well , let me just say that I ’m getting a lot more career advice and counseling than I might have anticipated .
I think I ’ll leave it at that . ”
Obama and McCain have asked the Bush administration to quickly grant security clearances to people who would play key roles in a transition .
Bush signed an executive order this month creating a special council empowered to arrange briefing material for political appointees .
With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks a vivid memory , the White House wants to give its successor the tools to cope with a national security crisis should one arise early on , experts said .
Advertisement
“ In this transition , the government has been doing more than it has in the past to start early , ” said Martha Joynt Kumar , a political science professor at Towson University and an expert on presidential transitions .
“ That ’s a result of 9/11 . ”
Already , infighting has broken out among people working on Obama ’s transition .
One sticking point involves nonprofit advocates anxious to ensure allies are chosen for offices that award grants .
“ People have transition fever now in the Obama camp , ” Light said .
“ It looks already like the classic transition fights over who gets which position .
Sometimes these disputes can become debilitating . ”

Check VW 's share price
Hedge funds have lost £ 18bn in two days of trading in Volkswagen ( VW ) shares that briefly saw the carmaker become the world 's most valuable company .
VW shares rose 348 % over Monday and Tuesday after it emerged that only about 5 % of its shares were available .
Funds that had bet on the shares falling desperately needed to buy the shares to close their positions .
But VW shares fell 45 % in trading on Wednesday as Porsche said it would help to solve the hedge funds ' problems .
" In order to avoid further market distortions and the resulting consequences for those involved , Porsche SE intends - depending on the state of the market - to settle hedging transactions in the amount of up to 5 % of the Volkswagen ordinary shares , " Porsche said in a statement .
Inevitably some traders and investors are calling foul
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog " This may result in an increase in the liquidity of the Volkswagen ordinary shares . "
Controlling stakes
On Sunday , Porsche announced it controlled more than 74 % of VW shares .
VW 's home state of Lower Saxony owns another 20 % .
The panic buying was caused by traders who had short - sold VW shares desperately trying to buy them back so they could close their positions .
Before Porsche 's announcement , many traders had been betting on VW 's shares falling .
They had borrowed VW shares and sold them in the market , planning to buy them back when the shares had fallen , return them to the lender and pocket the difference .
But what actually happened was that the shares rose as a result of Porsche 's effective takeover and the traders found themselves forced to buy the shares at any price .
" Each and any short - seller in the world is trying to close up their position and there is no way they can do it , except for trying to buy like mad , " said Heino Ruland , an analyst at FrankfurtFinanz .
What is upsetting the hedge funds is that if between 10 % and 15 % of VW shares were on loan to be shorted and only just over 5 % were available in the market , it is likely that many of the funds that shorted VW had borrowed the shares from Porsche .
It meant that because Porsche had not declared the proportion of VW shares it controlled , traders may have been indirectly and inadvertently borrowing shares from Porsche , selling them to Porsche , buying them back from Porsche and then returning them to Porsche .
None of this is currently outlawed by German authorities , but many commentators have described it as bringing German capital markets into disrepute .
The affair shows reform is needed in the way stock markets operate , according to Chris Day , chief executive of the hedge fund infrastructure providers PCE Investors .
" While there has been much talk that hedge funds should improve their transparency , perhaps the issue should be widened to include stock exchanges to help stop this sort of thing happening , " he said .
Bigger than Exxon VW 's shares peaked on Tuesday at 1,005 euros , valuing the company at 296bn euros ( $ 370bn ; £ 237bn ) , which is well over the $ 343bn value of Exxon Mobil - previously the world 's most valuable company .
Last Friday , VW 's shares closed below 200 euros .
On Wednesday they closed down 430 euros , at 514 euros .
As an indication of how extreme the market valuation is , last year Exxon made profits of $ 41bn on sales of $ 390bn while Volkswagen managed profits of about $ 8bn on sales of $ 136bn .

Mothers attack high heels for babies that turn infants into ' sex objects '
They come in pink satin , black , even leopard and zebra print - high heels designed for babies aged up to six months .
The U.S. manufacturer describes them as bringing ' fun , hilarity and glamour ' .
But horrified mothers see them as a new low in the campaign to sexualise infants not old enough to know what is happening to them .
' Ludicrous ' : A publicity shot for the Heelarious range of shoes for young babies
Priced at £ 19.99 , the Heelarious range are being sold in Britain by 36 - year - old Julia Taylor , from Bexley , Kent , who has struck an exclusive deal with the makers .
Mrs Taylor , whose daughter Bethany is 14 months old , discovered the shoes through friends who had spotted the website and thought they were ' fun ' .
She admitted the shoes were very ' American ' but feels there is a market in this country and is selling them through her website .
Its blurb reads : ' Your little one will look fabulous in these soft crib shoes designed to look like high heels !
' Each pair of Heelarious heels is packaged in a darling purse - shaped gift box , complete with a rhinestone closure . '
Mrs Taylor has already exhibited the collection at a London baby show but admits the feedback was ' mixed ' .
She added : ' There is the odd negative comment from mums who think the shoes are dangerous .
' Most change their mind though when they see that the heels are n't solid but soft and perfectly comfortable .
' Then there are the people who say heels are n't for babies but , at the end of the day , they 're just meant to be a bit of fun - a pretty finish to a party dress .
' If you think about it - some mums think it 's pretty to get their baby 's ears pierced and that can be painful .
' These shoes are nothing like that - they 're completely soft , comfortable and safe . '
Party wear :
The leopard print and pink vinyl high shoes for babies sell for £ 19.99
Mrs Taylor added : ' People who buy the heels are perfectly normal mums who are either interested in fashion or just recognise how fun the shoes are .'
Michele Elliot , founder of the children 's charity Kidscape , said the heels were ludicrous .
' High heels are meant to be sexy , and are definitely for adults not children .
' They are not cute or cuddly .
It is absolutely disgusting to market them for babies .
Parents should let babies be babies .
' It 's completely ludicrous for any parent to consider buying them for their children . '
Katharine Fey , 32 , mother of an eight - month - old baby , said : ' These shoes are completely inappropriate and unnecessary .
' Babies have very soft bones at that age and their feet are still growing .
They should n't be wearing shoes anyway , let alone something this overtly sexual . '
Claire Aldwood , 35 , and a mother of two , says the shoes make sexual objects of children .
' They 're making them look like little women - and loose little women at that .
Why do these designers want our children to grow up so quickly ?
' Not only are the heels distasteful - and no good for a child trying to pull themselves up or begin to toddle - but pink PVC and leopard print are not appropriate fabrics for a baby .
All that matters at that age is that they 're warm and loved . '
We 've been pretty underwhelmed by the Lenovo IdeaPad S10 thus far , and the news that this machine runs particularly hot ( and not in the good way ! ) is n't likely to win over too many , uh , fans .
The keyboard itself gets pretty warm , with temperatures measured between 38 and 42 °C ( 100.4 and 107.6 °F ) .
That slightly edges out tests performed on the Eee PC 900 ( 101 °F / 38°C ) , and leaves your Cloudbook ( 83 °F / 28 °C ) as cool as a cucumber .
There 's no word on the bottom side 's heat signature , but with keys like this we are n't expecting good things .
[ Thanks , Patrick ]
Four found guilty in citizen 's arrest of Rove RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email
This " A jury on Friday returned guilty verdicts against four people who attempted to arrest former White House adviser Karl Rove during a fundraising appearance earlier this year in Iowa , " AP reported Monday .
Guilty of trespassing were retired Methodist minister Chet Guinn , two members of the Des Moines Catholic Worker Community , Edward Bloomer and Mona Shaw , and onetime group member Kirk Brown .
" The four were cited after attempting a citizen 's arrest of Rove on July 25 at the Wakonda County Club in Des Moines , where he spoke at a Republican fundraiser , " AP noted .
" They were stopped at the country club 's entry gate . "
" I 'm surprised that there are six people in the United States who do n't believe Karl Rove should be suspected of committing felonies , " Shaw told AP after the verdict .
" In the citizens arrest complaint , the defendants accused Rove of felony murder , election fraud , conspiracy to commit offense or defraud the United States leading to the war in Iraq , as well as treason , sedition and subversive activities .
" It said Rove submitted and promoted false information leading to the war , the illegal detainment and torture of prisoners and " other fraudulent acts leading to the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. military personnel as well as approximately 300,000 Iraqi civilians . "
" Shaw said the defendants were each ordered to pay a $ 65 fine and court costs .
She said Brown refused to pay the fine Friday and was taken to jail for a day . "
To not partake in the use of a razor for the entire month of November .
This month has the effect of categorizing men , most of whom will have a girlfriend who disapproves and will counter by offering " No Sex November " as well .
The pussies will cave within the first week and shave .
The candidates will go the whole month without shaving .
But the real men among us will not only not shave but will have sex anyway , once again proving the theory that women are always wrong .

U.S. Rep. John W. Olver cruised to victory again Tuesday , defeating first - time challenger Nathan A. Bech , a Republican , throughout the 1st Congressional District that reaches from the Berkshires to Worcester and Middlesex counties .
Olver swept the cities and towns of the district , besting Bech even in his hometown of West Springfield where Olver , of Amherst , received 6,948 votes and Bech 4,907 .
Olver spoke to a gathering of supporters at the Hickory Ridge Country Club in Amherst Tuesday night .
" I 'm honored to be chosen to be the representative from the 1st Congressional District in the 111th Congress .
I am also very excited about the prospects for the 111th Congress .
If Barack Obama does win the White House , and the numbers so far look good , we have an historic opportunity to take the country in a new direction , " Olver said .
ELECTION 2008
Olver went on to praise Obama for connecting with voters , energizing traditional Democratic voting groups , and attracting moderates .
" He offered the change that so many Americans were looking for , and he put forth a vision to take our nation down pathways different from the ones we 've traveled for last eight years , " Olver said .
" If Obama is elected , I 'm eager to help with the policy changes and legislation needed to implement that vision for change . "
Putting the economy back on track , restoring the country 's financial markets , and enacting a new stimulus package are all priorities , Olver said .
Addressing health care coverage for Americans and environmental and energy concerns are also paramount , he said .
" The time has also come for us to put in place and execute a plan to safely disengage our troops from Iraq and bring our soldiers home .
That policy shift is long overdue , " he said .
Bech , 34 , conceded defeat shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday .
He called Olver to congratulate the incumbent , then spoke to reporters and supporters at his campaign headquarters on Elm Street in West Springfield .
" The pendulum swings back and forth , " Bech said .
This election , the Democrats have won , but the Republicans came back after the 1992 Democratic victory and won back seats in 1994 , Bech said .
" After two years of Democratic rule , I think the American people will be ready for a change again , " he said .
Bech said Olver 's superior fund - raising was a deciding factor in the race .
" I 've learned two things .
Campaigns are fun , and campaigns are expensive , " he said .
" I feel like I 've had a great experience . "
As proof of Bech being a credible threat to Olver keeping his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives , Bech said he noticed that Olver flooded television with political advertising as the race drew on .
" I got him nervous , " Bech said .
Bech said he is not certain what is next , but he did not rule another run for office .
" We 'll see , " he said .
Olver has held federal office since June 4 , 1991 , when he narrowly defeated Republican Steven Pierce in a special election called after Silvio Conte died .
In the September primary , Olver beat Stockbridge lawyer Robert A. Feuer with 79 percent of the total vote .
Intercontinental Anti- 2010 Olympics Movement Launched In Mexico
No Olympics on Stolen Land
Indigenous representatives attending an intercontinental Indigenous gathering in Vicam , Sonora Mexico have called for a boycott of the 2010 Olympics Games .

Intercontinental Anti- 2010 Olympics Movement Launched In Mexico
For Immediate Release October 18 , 2007
Coast Salish Territory ; Vancouver
Indigenous representatives attending an intercontinental Indigenous gathering in Vicam , Sonora Mexico have called for a boycott of the 2010 Olympics Games .
The meeting , which was attended by over 1500 delegates representing nations from the US , Canada , Mexico , Central America and South America , began on October 11th and ended on October 14th .
Indigenous people met to discuss 515 years of invasion and resistance to colonial occupation of Indigenous lands , with the Olympics a central theme .
Delegates agreed that the 2010 Games , to be held on the occupied Indigenous territories of Vancouver " BC " , will have an immense negative impact on Indigenous people 's lands and lives .
Reading from the proposed resolutions delivered at the gathering , Gord Hill , a Kwakwaka ' wakw delegate , stated that " Olympic related mega development on Indigenous lands have already disrupted hunting and fishing grounds and destroyed sacred sites " .
The resolutions also drew attention to the death of esteemed Elder Harriet Nahanee who died after she was imprisoned for protesting the expansion of the Sea to Sky highway  the primary artery to the main site of the 2010 winter Games .
In the final statement , adopted resolution number two states " We reject the 2010 Winter Olympics on sacred and stolen territory of Turtle Island -- Vancouver , Canada .
Angela Sterritt , Gitxsan participant , said " Not only are the 2010 Games destructive to the environment , but they will accelerate violence against Indigenous women .
Prostitution is being actively promoted and referred to as a " tourist attraction " for the games " .
The Gathering , held on Yaqui territory , followed a number of regional gatherings throughout Mexico .
The delegates representing Northern Turtle Island , also known as Canada , agreed that defense and protection of the land and unity were central to their effort towards self - determination and freedom .
The year 2010 in Vancouver marks a great threat to Indigenous people and to these goals .
Delegates from across the continent decided that resistance to the Olympics should be an international objective .
Given the Olympic massacre of over 300 students in Mexico in 1968 and the exploitation of Indigenous people in other countries that have hosted the Olympics , the Indigenous peoples in Vicam agreed that stopping the Olympics 2010 is imperative .
Hundreds if not thousands of Indigenous people now plan to attend the Olympic Games , not in celebration , but in resistance to the danger the Olympics poses to Indigenous lands , identity , culture , health , livelihoods , and to future generations .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congress could put together an economic stimulus package of several hundred billion dollars that should also contain tax cuts .
In a recorded interview with CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” that was aired on Sunday , Pelosi , a California Democrat , said the package should be aimed at creating jobs immediately and include investments for future growth .
Pelosi said several economists have called for a package in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
When asked if that would be the case for the stimulus package lawmakers are contemplating , Pelosi said : “ It could be , if it also contained a tax cut .
Something of several hundred billion would have to be some investment into the future , plus creating jobs immediately , and a tax cut . ” ( Reporting by Donna Smith and Randall Mikkelsen ; Editing by Doina Chiacu )

John McCain told the Des Moines Register that he always tells the truth .
100 percent , absolute truth ?
John McCain told the Des Moines Register this week that he always tells " 100 percent absolute truth , " even in campaign ads .
There 's one big problem with that bold statement : it 's just not true .
McCain has made a number of statements — in paid ads and on the campaign trail — that simply cannot be described as 100 percent accurate .
Some are n't even close .

Barack Obama is guilty , too .
He falsely accused McCain of wanting to slice Social Security benefits in half and grossly exaggerated his role in writing this year 's economic stimulus plan .
He also promised to accept public financing — and then proceeded to opt out when it was clear he could raise more money on his own .
But only McCain made this dare : Prove it , he told the Register .
The paper did not — Politico will .
With the help of the truth - squad crew over at the invaluable Politifact and factcheck.org , as well as other fact - checking websites , here is a list of some of McCain 's biggest whoppers :
1. On " The View , " McCain claimed Sarah Palin did not take or request earmarks as governor of Alaska .
" Not as governor , she did n't , " McCain said .
But in her first year in office , she requested $ 256 million in earmarks from the federal government .
2. Shortly after announcing Sarah Palin as his running mate , the McCain campaign ran an ad claiming , " She stopped the bridge to nowhere " — perhaps the most thoroughly debunked claim about the Alaska governor , who supported the bridge project before changing her position late in the game .
Asked about the bridge during her 2006 gubernatorial bid , Palin replied : " I 'm not going to stand in the way of progress . "
3 . At the Republican National Convention , McCain claimed Obama 's national health insurance plan would " force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages and force families into a government - run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor . "
But according to factcheck.org , Obama 's plan does not place burdens on small business , and people would have the option of keeping their existing insurance plans .
4 . In a campaign ad , " Dome , " McCain claimed Obama 's election would result in " painful income taxes , skyrocketing taxes on life savings , electricity and home heating oil , " the clear implication being that Obama wants to hike these tax rates .
But factcheck.org says Obama has n't proposed a tax on electricity or home heating oil and would n't raise taxes on investments for individuals earning less than $ 200,000 a year .
It 's possible Obama 's election would result in these tax rates increasing .
But this McCain - Palin claim is a little like the Obama camp 's misleading attack on McCain 's Social Security plan , tagging his opponent with the most undesirable , unintended and far from certain consequences of his policy proposals .
5. McCain has repeatedly accused Obama of supporting higher taxes on people making as little as $ 42,000 a year .
" Two times , on March 14 , 2008 and June 4 , 2008 , in the Democratic budget resolution , he voted to raise taxes on people making just $ 42,000 per year , " McCain said this week .
But this is a misleading claim : Obama 's votes were for nonbinding resolutions , which supported allowing certain Bush administration tax cuts to expire but did n't actually have the effect of raising taxes .
6 . In a July visit to Colorado , McCain told voters : " I want to look you in the eye : I will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase .
I will not do it . "
Last Sunday , however , McCain acknowledged to ABC's George Stephanopoulos that his health care plan could lead to some people paying taxes on employer - provided health insurance .
" It depends on what plan they have , " McCain said .
" But that 's usually the wealthiest people . "
7. McCain 's campaign claimed adviser Rick Davis had taken a leave of absence from his firm , Davis Manafort , and vigorously attacked a New York Times story suggesting that Davis had profited from Davis Manafort 's relationship with mortgage lender Freddie Mac .
" Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006 , " wrote McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb , who called the Times story " demonstrably false . "
" Mr. Davis has never — never — been a lobbyist for either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac . "
But Davis Manafort was receiving $ 15,000 monthly payments from Freddie Mac as recently as August , and while the payments did n't go to Davis personally he still stands to gain from the success of his firm .
8. McCain has boasted of never requesting a single earmark , saying in January : " I have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork - barrel project for my state . "
But he has requested federal funding for special projects back home , including $ 10 million for a center at the University of Arizona , $ 5 million for a home - state water project and spending authority to purchase land around Arizona 's Luke Air Force Base .
Politifact says it 's a matter of debate whether these projects constitute pork - barrel spending — but clearly McCain has searched for federal help in his own backyard .
9 . In last Friday 's debate , McCain accused Obama of " voting to cut off funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
But Obama has consistently voted in favor of war funding bills , including an earlier version of the bill McCain was discussing .
The Illinois senator voted against this particular proposal because it did not push the Bush administration toward a timetable for withdrawal .
McCain 's comment was technically defensible — but rather too sly to be called " absolute truth . "
10 .
In July , McCain accused Obama of skipping his visit to a military hospital in Germany because he was told he could n't bring reporters and video cameras .
McCain ran an ad saying : " Seems the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . "
But when pressed to provide evidence that Obama had canceled the visit for this reason , McCain 's campaign could not support their claim — and media reports found no evidence that Obama had ever planned to bring media with him .
You will laugh .
You will scoff .
You will be befuddled .
But I have finally figured out why Obama is so familiar .
At first I thought it might just be his politics .
In my day job as a political philosopher , I recognize deep similarities between Obama ’s political orientation and a tradition of American progressivism that had its heyday in the early 20th century .
This form of progressivism had roots in the Midwest and was linked to the Social Gospel Movement .
In some ways Obama is reviving this tradition .
But there was something more familiar about Obama , and about how his campaign has managed to galvanize so many young people .
Well , maybe it was simply a flash from the past , the political organizing that many of us engaged in to stop the Vietnam War and for Civil Rights .
He is leading a movement in which people of color and whites are linked once again .
Perhaps this was the source of the deep familiarity .
Yes , certainly , his campaign has brought back memories .
But it somehow did n’t get to another level of familiarity .
And then it hit me .
Obama is Mr. Spock and his campaign the Star Ship Enterprise , that is , if you allow for the vicarious presence of millions of fans aboard the ship .
Consider Spock and Obama : cool , logical , trustworthy , a great deal of presence of mind , etc. Further , Leonard Nimoy , the actor who plays Spock , is Jewish .
Obama went to Harvard Law and taught at the University of Chicago Law School , which makes him an honorary Jew .
( Being Jewish , I can say this . )
And what have we heard about Obama ’s blood pressure , 90/60 ; not that of an ordinary mortal , just like Spock .
But do n’t consider character traits , or arguments , gaze on their images .
We must broaden our horizons .
It is not merely the similarity to Spock .
Star
Trek ran during a war that most of us could do little to stop .
Here we are , once again .
( And there is a Texan in the White House , again .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I lived in Texas .
I am fond of Texans .
I married one .
But let ’s just keep them out of the White House for the Next Generation . )
Star Trek was a fantasy refuge , before the Internet .
But Star Trek was going to be canceled by NBC .
What saved it ?
According to William Shatner , Captain Kirk , in Chapter
Three of his book , Up Till Now ( do n’t ask how I know this ) , a letter writing campaign was launched to save the show .
Here is what Shatner tells us about the campaign .
“ As a result of this campaign , NBC received , trumpets blare here , more than 1,000,000 letters urging the network not to cancel the show … .
[ It was not cancelled ]
Perhaps more important the people who wrote the letters suddenly had an emotional attachment to a television program unlike any viewers ever before .
They had actually influenced a network ’s programming decision .
They had ownership .
Star Trek really had become their show .
This marked the beginning of the most unusual relationship between viewers and a TV series in history . ” [ emphasis added ]
Okay , you will accuse me of trivializing one of the most important recent movements in American politics .
But Obama the community organizer would understand the connection .
Star Trek was a collective experience mediated by a visual medium .
It also expressed utopian ideals at a time when young people felt impotent about changing the course of a war and the world .
( Star Trek began before the full impact of demonstrations against the war became apparent . )
Obama and his people have harnessed the Internet to allow people to feel that they are not mere bystanders but full participants .
They have provided a sense of “ ownership ” ( although I am not crazy about the term ) .
Most importantly , and here the analogy begins to break down , Obama and his team are providing not only a fantasy utopian moment , but the possibility of actually changing things .
Live Long and Prosper .
P.S. Leonard Nimoy is an Obama supporter .

A woman votes with the help of her daughter at a polling center in Saxman , Alaska , Nov. 4 . Despite Gov. Sarah Palin's spot on the Republican ticket , turnout among Alaskans for this year 's presidential election is not expected to eclipse the state 's 66 percent turnout from 2004 .
( Hall Anderson / AP )
Alaskans are different .
Very different .
Elections officials , party leaders and voters are wondering what happened this Tuesday in the Last Frontier , where turnout was surprisingly low and two lawmakers who have been the focus of FBI corruption investigations appear to have been reelected despite polling suggesting they would be ousted .
The final voter turnout numbers wo n't be available until absentee ballots are counted , which could take at least another week .
But this year 's total is not expected to eclipse Alaska 's 66 percent turnout in 2004 or its 60 percent clip in 2000 .
( This is especially odd given that Alaska 's Board of Elections saw a 12.4 percent hike in turnout for the August primaries , before Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was selected as the Republican Party 's vice presidential nominee . )
Alaska returns ( without the uncounted absentee and contested ballots ) show the McCain - Palin ticket garnering 136,348 votes .
In 2004 , President Bush got 190,889 votes , a " significant disparity " , the Anchorage Press reported .
" These numbers only add to the oddity of this election in Alaska ; in the run-up to Tuesday , Alaskan voters seemed energized to vote for a ticket with our governor on it , despite the barrage of criticism Palin faced . "
Couple the dip in support for McCain - Palin with surprising victories for longtime Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens , who was found guilty Oct. 27 on seven felony charges , and Rep. Don Young , who is under investigation by the FBI , and a lot of pollsters and voters were left stumped .
Pollster Del Ali of the Maryland firm Research 2000 , which tracked the House and Senate races in Alaska , said he was " not happy " how the races -- and dead wrong polling numbers -- turned out .
Research 2000 had reported in the days before the election that Democratic challenger Mark Begich , an Anchorage attorney , was leading the 84 - year - old Stevens by 22 percentage points ( Daily Kos apparently paid for the polls ) .
Other pollsters did n't fare much better .
Anchorage pollster and Republican political consultant David Dittman , a Stevens supporter , predicted a " solid Begich win . "
The national polling firm , Rasmussen Reports , accurately predicted every Senate race in the country within the margin of error in their most recent polls -- except Alaska .
Alaska pollsters Ivan Moore , Craciun Research Group and Hays Research Group all also had Stevens and Young trailing in the lead - up to the election .
Some observers pointed to Sen .
John McCain 's early concession speech as a possible reason for the low turnout -- McCain acknowledged Sen. Barack Obama 's win at 7:15 p.m. Alaska time , well before polls closed in the state .
An Alaska Republican Party leader told the Fairbanks News - Miner that some voters might have stayed home after hearing Obama had captured the presidency .
But other pundits and political science professors dismissed that theory , saying the high - profile races for Stevens 's and Young 's seats would not have dissuaded voters from showing up at the polls .
Other pollsters thought Palin drew new Republican voters to the polls early on , and that voting largely subsided after Obama claimed victory .
As the head - scratching continues , we 'll be watching to see how Stevens 's fellow senators decide to deal with his felony conviction conundrum .
What is the Moon Dust DNA Watch ?
Ever wondered what a watch that costs $ 450,000 looks like ?
You'd think it would be loaded with diamonds or other fancy rare jewels .
What this watch contains is extremely rare , however nothing like you 've ever seen on this earth ; this watch contains dust from the moon .
While the most expensive version will be upwards of $ 450,000 USD , there will be cheaper versions with less moon dust that will be as cheap as $ 15,000 USD .
Take a peak at this beautiful little time piece !
The watch was designed and built by famous Geneva watchmaker Romain Jerome .
The Moon dust watch was built to celebrate and take advantage of the 40 year anniversary since Apollo 11 landed on the moon with Neil Armstrong and the gang .
To do so , they will release just 1969 ( the year they landed on the moon ) limited copies of the watch .
The casing is made from melted pieces of the Apollo 11 , the first manned craft to land on the moon .
If that is n't enough , the watch face is coated with rock dust combed from the surface of the moon itself .
Some of the limited edition watches even have threads from space suits worked into the wrist bands ; talk about recycling !
Of people earning more than $ 250,000 a year — the income level that would pay higher taxes in a Barack Obama presidency — 52 percent voted for Obama , and 46 percent for John McCain , exit polls showed .

TNRI EXCLUSIVE
First Look at Google Chrome For Mac
Exclusive Screenshots
Manyusers were understandably peeved when 's revolutionary new web browser , Google Chrome , was released as a Windows - only .
The tech giant was awfully mum on when to expectandversions of Chrome ; admitting that the lack of a Mac version was " embarrassing , " Google co-foundersaid it could be " months " before one is released .
So what 's the hold up ?
Well , no word yet on the Linux version , but a top - secret source tells me things are n't going so well over in the Mac division at Google HQ .
Some of the killer features of the Windows version of Chrome , such as the " omnibar " and the new tab page , had to be ditched entirely because they were just " too hard " to implement on the Mac platform .
Despite these setbacks , Google 's Mac engineers are determined to make Google Chrome the best it can be and are diligently working around the clock to bring the cloud computing operating system of the future to the Macintosh .
I managed to score an exclusive sneak preview of the current beta of Google Chrome for Mac .
My source warned me it was a work - in - progress and that there are still some bugs to be worked out .
Boy , he was n't kidding .
Design - wise , Google Chrome for Mac is going in a completely new direction from Google Chrome for Windows .
All I 've got to say is , Google is definitely " thinking different " when it comes to the modern browser .
Some exclusive screenshots of the yet - to - be - released browser after the jump .
Google 's homepage looks pretty good in this Google - made browser , as should be expected .
Google 's billion - dollar purchase , however , is n't looking too hot here .
Could Google be leveraging its power to make its competitors ' sites look bad ?
" Do n't be evil , " indeed .
Yahoo - owned social bookmarking site Delicious barely even renders ...
... while popular music - aggregating site last .fm does n't render at all .
The new Facebook is bound to cause even more user outrage when Chrome for Mac is released .
Digg looks like shitt .
TechCrunch looks like TechCrap .
First impression : not bad , but certainly not replacing Firefox or Safari anytime soon .
Bad news for developers , who will have to spend long hours making their sites look decent in yet another browser .
Here 's hoping Google can iron out these bugs soon .
I have never had time for privileged people in safe countries who announce that they cannot see the difference between democracy and dictatorship .
I gave up on Amnesty International when it said that Guantanamo Bay , in which the guards killed no one , was the modern equivalent of Stalin 's Gulag , through which the secret police killed millions .
Tory writers strike me as hitting similar peaks of vacuity and delirium when they claim that New Labour is ' Zanu Nu- Lab ' .
Can we agree that Britain is not Zimbabwe and then say : ' So what ? '
The unelected Robert Mugabe is worse than the unelected Gordon Brown , but that does not excuse the assaults on the rights of Parliament and the freedom of the press .
Indeed , the descent into hyperbole plays into Brown 's hands and allows him to dismiss valid criticisms as hysteria .
We should learn from the great Zimbabwean journalist Trevor Ncube , who argued that the defining feature of Zanu - PF leaders was the secret knowledge that they were political bankrupts .
It produced a desperate anger , he said .
' And in their desperation , they are trying to find scapegoats ; they 're hitting out at anybody . '
The rage of frustrated rulers unites Britain and Zimbabwe rather than political methods .
The state went for Damian Green , not because there were serious allegations of corruption against him , as there were against Labour officials , but because the Conservatives had made serious accusations of incompetence against the Home Office .
The outrage that followed has been heartening - did David Normington , the Home Office 's Permanent Secretary , and Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick of the Met not know that Charles I lost his head after sending troops into Parliament ?
But it missed a wider threat .
On the same day anti-terrorist officers deigned to release a leading opposition politician from nine hours of house arrest , Mr Justice Southwell threw out the police case against Sally Murrer , a journalist on the Milton Keynes Citizen - a fine local newspaper , but not one which ever expected to be on the front line of the battle for British liberty .
Like Green , they went after her for exercising freedoms previous generations took for granted .
Like Green , they accused her of ' aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office ' , the catch - all the Crown Prosecution Service has invented to get round statutory protections for whistleblowers who bring news Parliament and the public need to hear .
Unlike Green , however , her prosecution makes no sense .
The government 's critics think they have a rational explanation for the behaviour of Normington and Quick .
A source in the Home Office had told Green that officials had cleared illegal immigrants to work as guards at government buildings .
Admittedly , when anti-terrorist officers arrested him , it was the first time they had held a suspect for trying to protect national security .
But their motive was clear .
Green had embarrassed the Home Secretary and made Home Office civil servants look idle fools .
He and his source had to pay .
The accusations against Sally Murrer , on the other hand , were incomprehensibly trivial .
The state said that Mark Kearney , a police officer and Murrer 's co-defendant , had given her the story that Thames Valley Police did not intend to prosecute the star striker of the MK Dons after a fight in a hotel .
It also alleged he had passed on a tip that a man who had been murdered in the town had a conviction for drug dealing .
Journalists in free countries receive similar steers every day .
Yet the police bugged her phones , ransacked her home and office , confiscated her computers , interrogated her , humiliated her with a strip search , separated her from her daughters and handicapped son and left her with the threat of a prison sentence hanging over her for 18 months .
She has a conspiracy theory for the mayhem they brought to her quiet life that also touches on the rights of Parliament .
She is convinced that the police and CPS were trying to intimidate Kearney into silence because he had protested about his superiors ordering him to bug conversations between Sadiq Khan , the Labour MP and lawyer , and a jailed terrorist suspect .
I find the alternative as grim .
It may be that Labour ministers , police and prosecutors regard the release of any unauthorised information , however inconsequential , as a crime and are determined to persecute sources and the politicians and journalists they speak to .
The state wants potential trouble - makers to ask themselves once , twice , 100 times if taking on the government is worth the trouble .
Optimists will point out that the judge stopped the trial .
But Southwell did so on a technicality and with evident reluctance .
He grumbled about being ' forced ' to release the accused because he was ' effectively bound ' by European law .
Then , for no understandable reason , he banned the press from reporting what he had done for three days .
As I have said before , the judiciary is no longer a guarantor of liberty .
One of the first acts of President Obama will be to sign a bill from Congress that prevents the verdicts of British libel judges being enforced in the States .
American politicians and writers of all political persuasions have been outraged by the behaviour of Mr Justice Eady , who merrily agrees to the banning of books that have never been published in this country and orders the fining of foreign authors .
So , too , has the United Nations .
Yet the unprecedented spectacle of America , a fellow democracy whose legal system has roots in the English common law , deciding that Britain is no friend to freedom of speech , has passed without comment from officialdom here .
Such silences are becoming an ominous feature of bureaucratic life .
Listen as hard you like , but you will never hear a Law Lord tell Eady that he cannot censor writers at the behest of plutocrats , or New Scotland Yard and the Home Office tell Quick that he cannot arrest opposition MPs , or the CPS tell Thames Valley detectives that they cannot harass an innocent reporter .
No one in authority ever seems to say to the bewigged authoritarian or uniformed goon : ' This is n't Zimbabwe , you know .
This is Britain and you just can't do that here . '
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel , who presided over the case that killed off original Napster , proposed a bold plan Monday to reform copyright for the digital age bycreating a new public / private organization with authority over thelicensing and enforcement of copyright .
" There needs to be a comprehensiverevision of the provisions that relate to the administration ofcopyright licensing , royalties and enforcement , " Patel said in a speech at her Fordham Law alma mater .
" I propose that a joint public / private administrative body made upof representatives of all competing interest , including the public , beestablished and authorized to , among other powers , issue licenses ;
negotiate , set and administer royalties ; and adopt rules andregulations to carry out these purposes . "
While Utopian in nature – and with no discernible constituency beyond Patel – the proposal is hardly on anyone 's docket right now .
But anyone looking for a diplomatic way forward that would protect rights holders without punishing their customers could do much worse that heed the advice of this particular jurist .
Patel has had seven years to think about what 's wrong with the music business and the digital landscape she helped create with her landmark Napster decision , in which she ruled that the peer - to - peer service '' knowingly encourage[ed ] and assist[ed ] '' the exchange of copyrighted music to the economic detriment of the record industry , a finding which ultimately spelled its doom as a free and free - wheeling service .
Part of the problem just wo n't go away , like the ease with which any recording can be digitized and shared with an infinite number of others – like Patel 's speech , which I bootlegged and saved as an MP3 .
" It was not surprising that the notion of free music caught on , " Patel said at Fordham .
" What is surprising is how the industry seemed to be caught so short .
While it was fumbling the new ways to distribute digital music at aprofit in the new age , savvy innovators were moving full speed ahead .
Sadly , it is the artists and composers who have been the most neglectedin this matter . "
But legislation is not the answer , she has concluded .
" Our copyright laws have become a patchwork ofamendments that are adopted as emergencies arise " and as lobbyistsrepresenting various interests push legislation .
Simply put , the systemis too complex and does n't properly address music 's present –
let alone its future .
Judge Patel 's recommendations :
The new body needs to be a mix of public and private entities with all parties represented .
It can not be a purely governmental body because that is not likely to instill confidence in the public .
All copyrighted music would be part of this system and subject to acompulsory license , with possible opt - out provisions for certain rightsholders .
Congress should abolish all current compulsory licenses andadopt a blanket licensing system .
( Such a system may have allowed Napster to continue operating , assuming it could afford to pay labelsunder the compulsory licensing scheme . )
The body would administer all royalty payments and would replace all current systems for doing so .
An independent arm would arbitrate royalty disputesusing music databases that allow arbitration to be done withspeed and precision lacking in the current system .
Manufacturers and developers would need approval from this bodybefore introducing an application or device capable of recording ,
distributing or copying music to consumers .
The body would include technology experts to aid in making thosedecisions quickly – Patel described this as " sort of like the FDA , butmuch faster . "
That last item could be cause for concern .
Developers and manufacturerswon't cotton to an administrative body deliberating overtheir feature sets .
On the other hand , it sure beats getting sued bythe RIAA , as XM Radio found out last year when it tried to sell a portable satellite radio receiver with a song - saving feature .
Patel was n't all business on Monday night .
In addition to these bold recommendations , she also revealed that during the Napster trial she joined the Napster network under the user name " Ima Judge . "
The audience also learned that Judge Patel likes to entertain colleagues at judicial conferences with her rendition of " Momma " from the hit musical Chicago .

The question of the next decade is :
How can we find what we want — the perfect job , just the right pair of shoes , exactly the news that ’s important to us — amidst the maelstrom of information that ’s available on the Web ?
Google , of course , is the de facto answer , it ’s algorithms generating a ballpark guess at what we want when we type in a few search terms .
But the burgeoning mass of data on the Internet is threatening to outmode such robotic tools .
So a growing number of start - ups is putting forward another strategy for filtering the Web : Use human judgment first , computer power second .
Of course , human judgment is unreliable , inefficient , expensive and difficult to scale .
It ’s also a relatively scarce resource compared to data , which grows online at an exponential rate .
Here are four people - powered sites , and how they plan to keep their people - powered business models durable as the Web shifts and swells .
This Next is a “ product discovery tool ” that lets users take recommendations on products they did n’t even know existed .
Founded in 2006 , the site attracts about 1.4 million users per month , many of whom know they want something new — a lamp , rug , table — but whose queries are too broad to return useful results on other comparison shopping sites .
Sites like Amazon have been taking buyer reviews for years , but on ThisNext , user opinions do n’t all carry the same clout .
If you ’re an inveterate product - suggester and people follow your personal recommendations ( and therefore , your personal style ) , you achieve “ Maven ” status , a high - profile position that gives your opinions increasingly more visibility .
Mavens do n’t get paid , but they do earn what CEO Gordon Gould calls “ social capital . ”
And social capital , Gould says , “ is becoming an increasingly valuable asset in the Web 2.0 universe . ”
TheLadders is a career site for finding and listing jobs that pay more than $ 100,000 .
To ensure that every listing and every user meets that standard , TheLadders employs 45 full - time in - house screeners .
( Sites like HotJobs and Monster have none . )
As of mid-2008 , those screeners are approving about 10,000 job listings per week .
Marc Cenedella , CEO of the 5 - year - old company , says the model scales well — up to a point .
If the site grew to , say , 30 times its current size , “ you could n’t keep the community together , ” he says .
“ It really has to be a human - sized group .
At over 1,000 people , you could n’t have the elbow - to - elbow passing of knowledge .
That shared judgement pool is essential . ”
Wigix is a household goods marketplace that ’s part online auction site , part stock market .
Users put up “ portfolios ” of objects they would sell if the right offer arose .
Unlike auctions on eBay , Wigix portfolios do n’t expire .
Would - be buyers place specific limit orders — for example , a 32 - inch Sony KDL - 32M4000 HDTV for $ 700 .
If that order finds a match in a seller ’s portfolio , Wigix executes the sale .
Investors in the U.S. stock market have lost more than $ 9 trillion since the peak a year ago .
But in industries at the center of the crisis , some executives managed to emerge with substantial fortunes .
A study by The Wall Street Journal analyzed the cash compensation and net proceeds from stock sales of top executives at financial and home - building companies , over a five - year period .
The list includes executives at companies that have performed relatively well , in addition to poor performers .

The Mediterranean Diet is now being touted as the basis for a flat belly .
The premise for this weight loss plan is that the mono- unsaturated fats ( MUFA ’s ) that are so rich in the traditional Mediterranean foods are fantastic for eliminating abdominal fat and increasing the pleasant feeling of fullness at the end of a meal .
This diet offers a wide variety of healthy foods , incorporates the basic Mediterranean eating habits , along with calorie counting .
Best of all , those who like to indulge in dark chocolate are able to do so .
Sound too good to be true ?
Who is suited to the diet :
* those looking for a healthy weight loss plan that promotes fat loss .
* those seeking a wide variety of health giving foods in their diet plan .
* those looking to lose their muffin tops , spare tyres , bloating , or middle age spread .
* those who are happy to count calories .
* those who love Mediterranean cuisine .
* those who cannot give up their chocolate fix .
* those who do not want to give themselves kidney failure .
What you can eat :
Basically , each calorie counted meal will have a food from one of the MUFA categories .
The MUFA categories are :
* dark chocolate .
* avocado .
* olives .
* seeds and nuts including pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , sesame seeds , including tahini , almonds , cashews , Brazil nuts , hazelnuts , macadamias , pine - nuts , pecans , peanuts , peanut butter , and walnuts .
* oils preferably olive ( extra virgin is best ) , flax seed , canola , pesto , peanut oil , walnut oil , safflower , sunflower , and sesame oils .
Salt is to be avoided .
Lemon juice and fresh herbs should be used as taste enhancers .
One jug of Amrita is to be consumed daily .
( Recipe at bottom . )
3 meals and 1 snack daily ensuring that each meal contains 1 MUFA group .
The balance of the meal plan works along the Mediterranean concept : plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables , whole grains , and a restricted amount of red meat .
How the diet works :
MUFA ’s increase your sense of satiety after a meal , leaving you feeling fuller for longer .
The better the satiety content of a food group , the less hungry you become , and the less you feel like you are being deprived .
The fuller you feel , the less likely you will cheat , and the more successful your diet will be .
MUFA ’s are supposed to be good at aiding in eliminating excess tummy fat .
Reduced calorie intake .
Calories are reduced to 1,600 , or 6,700 kilojoules , daily .
The 4 day drastic version limits calories further , down to 1,250 , or 5,000 kilojoules daily .

NEW YORK , Nov 12 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar fell to a fresh two - week low below 96 against the yen on Wednesday as stocks on Wall Street sank to session lows on comments from Treasury Secretary Paulson .
The dollar fell as low as 95.33 yen , the lowest since Oct. 28 .
It last traded down 2.2 percent at 95.57 yen JPY = .
Paulson said the purchase of mortgage asset is not the most effective way to use funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
“ Treasury has dropped the idea of buying troubled mortgage assets and is focusing on supporting consumer credit , ” said Brian Dolan , chief currency strategist , at Forex.com in Bedminster in New Jersey .
“ The initial shock of abandoning TARP is hitting stocks , but the support for consumer - level lending may be a silver lining as it goes to the root of what ’s ailing the economy , namely personal consumption , ” he added .

Half of the Zimbabwe population faces starvation
By Barry Mason
5 November 2008
Aid charities and the United Nations estimate that 5 million people in Zimbabwe , half the population , face starvation .
A USAID Famine Early Warning System Network ( FEWSNET ) alert issued September 24 warned of insufficient cereal imports .
It stated , " Zimbabwe could face a critical shortage or exhaustion of cereals as early as the first week of November ...
The current in - country supply of agricultural inputs for the upcoming planting season is insufficient ...
Late planting could aggravate the impact of forecast below - normal rainfall in the second half of the season ( January - March 2009 ) in the country 's main crop producing regions , increasing the potential for a poor harvest and the continued need for imports in 2009 . "
A Christian Aid press release on October 14 emphasised the stark social conditions facing millions in Zimbabwe .
The dire statistics indicate that " over 85 percent of the population is unemployed , 90 percent are living on less than £ 1 a day and 15 percent of adults are living with HIV with some 3,500 dying every week of related diseases ... ( Zimbabwe ) has the lowest life expectancy in the world : 34 years for men and 32 years for women . "
Speaking to the BBC News web site at the beginning of October , John Holmes , the United Nations humanitarian chief , described the situation as grave and deteriorating :
" Planting season for the next harvest starts in five or six weeks ' time , at least for maize , and there is a massive shortage of seeds and fertilizers in the country because of the economic situation ...
" We 're looking to see whether we can accelerate even at this late stage and get some of those seeds and fertilizers and other imports into the hands of small farmers . "
An October 17 Africa Confidential newsletter quoted a senior UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) official describing the situation as " very , very bad , " noting that the next harvest was six months away .
Africa Confidential continued , " The WFP reckons that 28 percent of children under five are malnourished and vulnerable to disease .
Many rural families get one meal a day — typically sadza , maize - meal with no protein ...
The hungriest fill their stomachs with umtopi , baobab ( tree ) roots pounded into a paste . "
The article noted research by Professor Ian Scoones of Sussex University who showed that whilst it is small farmers on communal land who provide most of the food in rural areas , their productivity has been greatly reduced following several successive droughts and their inability to afford fertiliser , etc. , to improve their land .
An October 24 article in the Times of London reported on the eastern province of Manicaland .
The reporter said she found " a country whose reserves of food are exhausted and where the diseases of hunger — kwashiorkor , marasmus and pellagra — are appearing to a degree never seen in the country before . "
The Times described emaciated children dying in hospital .
Greg Powell , chairman of the Zimbabwe Child Protection Society , said , " In the 32 years I have worked in Zimbabwe as a paediatrician I have never known a more serious situation .
We can predict an exponential increase in cases of kwashiorkor and malnutrition over the next six months . "
Geoff Foster , a paediatrician at Mutare hospital , said , " Malnutrition is a silent emergency that affects young children ...
There is a famine situation prevailing and it is desperate . "
The threat of a cholera epidemic is also mounting .
A UN IRIN news report carried by Reuters on October 20 stated there have been 120 deaths so far due to cholera , with most being in the Mashonaland Central province .
The report blamed the collapse of health and municipal services , lack of potable water and no rubbish collection or proper sanitation system .
People had to resort to digging shallow wells to obtain water , but these often became polluted by sewerage spills .
The report added : " The state - owned Zimbabwe National Water Authority ( ZINWA ) has pumped raw sewerage into Lake Chivero , one of the reservoirs providing Harare with water ; residents with access to piped water often have to contend with a smelly greenish discharge from their taps . "
An Inter Press Service article carried on AllAfrica.com October 16 quoted a statement released by the Combined Harare Residents Association ( CHRA ) .
It said : " The water and sewer management problems have seen some residential areas going for years , months and weeks without water and unattended sewer bursts respectively .
The shortage of water dictates that residents fetch water from unprotected sources , thus diseases like cholera breed easily .
CHRA has so far received countless cases of cholera and diarrhoea . "
A US GMA television news report of October 30 reported one person in Harare has died from cholera and 20 other people had succumbed to the disease .
It quoted one resident of Eastern Harare who said that his neighbourhood had been without piped water for a year and described how the smell and smoke from the burning of uncollected rubbish was making people ill .
People had to resort to digging their own wells , but he was concerned that " When the rains come all the filth will flow into our well . "
The dire social and economic situation is being exacerbated by the ongoing deadlock over the power - sharing agreement between President Robert Mugabe 's ZANU - PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change .
Mugabe is intent on controlling the important ministries , thus sidelining the MDC .
The talks have been brokered by Thabo Mbeki , but his loss of the South African presidency has rendered him politically impotent .
The Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) has called for a larger regional summit to try to reach a deal .
The Federal Government owns more than half of Oregon , Utah , Nevada , Idaho and Alaska and it owns nearly half of California , Arizona , New Mexico and Wyoming .
See the map for more .
It is time for a sale .
Selling even some western land could raise hundreds of billions of dollars – perhaps trillions of dollars – for the Federal government at a time when the funds are badly needed and no one want to raise taxes .
At the same time , a sale of western land would improve the efficiency of land allocation .
Does a sale of western lands mean reducing national parkland ?
No , first much of the land is n’t parkland .
Second , I propose a deal .
The government should sell some of its most valuable land in the west and use some of the proceeds to buy low - price land in the Great Plains .
The western Great Plains are emptying of people .
Some 322 of the 443 Plains counties have lost population since 1930 and a majority have lost population since 1990 .
Now is the time for the Federal government to sell high - priced land in the West , use some of the proceeds to deal with current problems and use some of the proceeds to buy low - priced land in the Plains creating the world ’s largest nature park , The Buffalo Commons .

S.F. cop sues Antioch , police in Taser incident ANTIOCH
A San Francisco police inspector has filed a federal civil rights suit against the city of Antioch , saying a police officer shocked her with a Taser during a confrontation in her home where she was trying to evict a tenant .
Inspector Marvetia Lynn Richardson , 41 , a 14 - year San Francisco police veteran who is now on unpaid leave from her job , said Antioch officers broke down her door last year , stunned her with a Taser and then took her to jail when she demanded to write " Tasered " on a citation for resisting arrest .
Richardson , who is black , said the incident was an outgrowth of Antioch police efforts to enter homes without warrants to harass and drive African American tenants out of federally subsidized housing .
Richardson owns her home and did not receive housing assistance .
Antioch police referred to Richardson during the incident as the " alleged homeowner " and " this so - called SFPD lady , " the suit said .
The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , names the city of Antioch , Police Chief James Hyde , Sgt. Thomas Fuhrmann and Officers Santiago Martinez Jr. , Jason Vanderpool and Jason Joannides .
It seeks unspecified damages for emotional distress , lost wages and medical expenses .
The city has denied any wrongdoing , saying officers acted appropriately while investigating reports of threats of violence against residents at the home .
The incident occurred about midnight June 7 , 2007 , at Richardson 's home on Mokelumne Drive .
Richardson had invited two friends over , as well as their children and the children 's friends .
A tenant , Bridget Reed , called police to complain about the noise .
Reed had been served with a 30 - day eviction notice a week earlier for failing to pay rent , and earlier that day there had been a dispute involving Reed that prompted Richardson to call the police , the suit said .
Vanderpool and Martinez arrived at the home .
Martinez " acted rudely , " telling Richardson , " You wish you owned this home , " the suit said .
Richardson says she told Martinez that she was a San Francisco police inspector and that he was acting like a security guard .
She told the officers to leave and bring a search warrant if they wished to return , the suit said .
The officers left , but while still outside " heard loud noises , screams and what sounded like a struggle or fight coming from the home , " the city 's attorney , James Fitzgerald , wrote in court documents .
Reed and her daughter apparently told police that they had been threatened by Richardson 's guests , including a remark by a teenage girl that someone could be shot , the suit said .
Fuhrmann told Vanderpool , Martinez and Joannides to break down the door after they got no answer , and Martinez stunned Richardson with a Taser for no reason , the suit said .
Richardson refused to sign a citation for resisting arrest and tried to write " Tasered " on it .
An officer ripped the citation out of her hand and she was taken to jail , the suit said .
Judge Charles Treat of Contra Costa County Superior Court dismissed the resisting - arrest charge in June , saying the police entry into Richardson 's house was illegal .
Furious agreement
Back when I was a high school debater , my team once had to take the negative position on the topic ‘ Australian democracy is dying ’ .
With the Vietnam war at its worst , conscription of 18 - year olds ( old enough to die , but in those days too young to vote ) a big issue , and a conservative government that had been in office since before my classmates and I were born , it did n’t seem likely that we were going to carry the audience with Panglossian rhetoric .
So , we decided to argue instead that Australian democracy could n’t be dying because it was already dead .
The resulting debate was somewhat farcical , as we rushed to agree with every piece of gloomy evidence raised by the affirmative side , and pile on with our own .
We won easily , but I gave up debating not too long after that .
I ’m reminded of this episode by a piece by Robert Kagan , criticising the idea that American power is declining .
In effect , Kagan argues that , while things might seem bad for American power just now , they ’ve actually been terrible for decades .
Unchallenged economic dominance had already been lost by 1960 , when the US share of the world economy ( around half in the immediate aftermath of WWII ) had fallen to 24 per cent .
The international image of the US was trashed by Vietnam and other disasters of the 1960s .
Military failures are nothing new .
So , those who , decade after decade , proclaim that America is in decline have simply forgotten how bad things were in the past .
The idea that the US effectively dominated the world for decades after WWII is an illusion .
As Kagan says :
between 1945 and 1965 the United States actually suffered one calamity after another .
The “ loss ” of China to communism ; the North Korean invasion of South Korea ; the Soviet testing of a hydrogen bomb ; the stirrings of postcolonial nationalism in Indochina — each proved a strategic setback of the first order .
And each was beyond America ’s power to control or even to manage successfully .
Kagan is spot on here , and the implications are obvious .
Ever since MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel in 1950 , US governments have shown a chronic tendency to over - reach themselves , and to squander blood , treasure and international respect as a result .
The Vietnam disaster reined in this tendency for a while .
But then neoconservatives invented the term ‘ Vietnam syndrome ’ to describe the perfectly sensible lessons most people learned from the US defeat .
In the end , it took the Iraq fiasco to provide a remedial lesson for the slower learners .
There ’s no need to postulate a decline in American power and influence to explain why an aggressive and unilateralist policy is a foolish one .
As Kagan says , there was never a time when the US , or any other country ‘ could dominate , dictate and always have its way ’ .
Every state that has tried to do this has failed .
I share Kagan ’s hope that President Obama will not regard a sensible recognition of the limits of power and of the need for international co-operation as a confession of national decline .

ANCHORAGE  Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska fired back Friday at the unnamed McCain campaign aides who have been maligning her in recent days , saying that their criticism was “ cruel and it ’s mean - spirited , it ’s immature , it ’s unprofessional , and those guys are jerks . ”
Ms. Palin spoke out upon her return to the governor ’s office here , defending herself from a barrage of criticism that has been aimed at her from unnamed McCain aides ever since the McCain - Palin ticket was defeated Tuesday .
The McCain campaign aides complained about the $ 150,000 that the Republican National Committee had spent on Ms. Palin ’s clothes , the way a Canadian comedian was able to embarrass the campaign by calling her and pretending to be the president of France , and the political ambitions she seemed to harbor beyond 2008 .
By the end of the week , their complaints had escalated considerably , with Fox News quoting unnamed McCain campaign officials as saying that Ms. Palin had not known that Africa was a continent , not a country , and claiming that she did not know which countries were covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement .

The man who created a coral farm ... in a fishtank at his London home
These stunning corals look like they belong in the tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef or in the azure seas of the Caribbean .
But a closer inspection of these living rocks reveals they are actually residing in the colder climate of southern England .
Bred by ' Reef Farmer ' Clayton Smith , they are part of the home - grown coral farm craze that is catching on in the UK .
Marine biologist Clayton Smith with his tank of coral which has taken him 10 years to grow
Grown in the garden shed of Mr Smith 's London home , his revolutionary coral farming techniques have made it possible to own a small piece of the tropics .
' Coral is an incredible pet to own , ' the marine biologist said .
' The growth in coral farms and farmers is similar to the boom in tropical fish in the 60's and 70's .
' Except corals are just that little bit more spectacular in their appearance than some of the fish that people keep . '
Cut from sustainable coral that exists in the wild , Mr Smith has spent the past ten years and more than £ 2,500 perfecting his growth techniques .
He grows more than 120 different species in his intensive back garden lab in Bromley , south London , catering for the estimated 600,000 or so coral enthusiasts in the UK and worldwide .
Mr Smith has travelled to places including Australia 's Great Barrier reef to perfect his coral growing technique
' People generally have a personal taste for their aquariums and they might want soft corals , which are wavy , or they might want the large polyp stone corals which are big and fleshy .
' However , the really popular corals amongst first time farmers are the corals which glow in the dark .
They definitely have the wow factor , especially if your coral tank is displayed well . '
Obsessed with the sea since he received his first fish tank at seven years old , Mr Smith has spent most of his adult life in conservation and marine study .
His work has taken him to Australia to work for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and to the endangered reefs of the Philippines .
Mr Smith grows more than 120 different species in his intensive lab
Mr Smith advises that anyone wanting to take on a coral farm must realise how difficult it is to care for as well as the moral implications that come from taking on a living creature .
' Keeping corals is becoming a lot easier , because the industry has come along so much in the past five years , ' he said .
' However , corals need perfect conditions and total dedication in terms of the right algae as food , nutrients in the water and temperature .'.
A start - up kit for a coral farm costs as little as £ 13 for one two inch piece of coral , but that piece given time will blossom .
Intricate and complicated to grow and care for , coral farms require the care and attention of a bonsai tree .
Mr Smith has become so skilled at his hobby that he now sells his farmed coral and breeds a diverse range of rare and endangered species
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Government brokers responsible for collecting billions of dollars in federal oil royalties operated in a " culture of substance abuse and promiscuity " that included having sex with energy company employees , accepting lavish gifts and rigging contracts to favored firms , investigators said Wednesday .
The alleged transgressions involve 13 former and current Interior Department employees in Denver and Washington .
Their alleged improprieties include influencing contracts , working part - time as private oil consultants and having sexual relationships with — and accepting golf and ski trips , snowboarding lessons and concert tickets from — oil company employees , according to three reports released Wednesday by the Interior Department 's inspector general .
The investigations expose a small group of individuals " wholly lacking in acceptance of or adherence to government ethical standards , " wrote Inspector General Earl E. Devaney , whose office spent more than two years and $ 5.3 million on the investigation .
" Sexual relationships with prohibited sources cannot , by definition , be arms - length , " Devaney said .
The reports describe a fraternity house atmosphere inside the Denver Minerals Management Service office responsible for marketing oil and natural gas that energy companies barter to the government in lieu of cash royalty payments for drilling on federal lands .
The government received $ 4.3 billion in such royalty - in - kind ( RIK ) payments last year .
The oil and gas is then resold to energy companies or put in the nation 's emergency stockpile .
" During the course of our investigation , we learned that some RIK employees frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions , had used cocaine and marijuana , and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives , " the report said .
Two government employees who had to spend the night after a daytime industry function because they were too intoxicated to drive home were commonly referred to by energy traders as the " MMS Chicks . "
Between 2002 and 2006 , 19 oil marketers — nearly a third of the 55 - person staff in the Denver office — received gifts and gratuities from oil and gas companies , including Chevron , Shell , Hess and Denver - based Gary - Williams Energy , the investigators found .
The investigation focuses on nine employees — all but one of whom received ethics training — who attended meals , parties , paintball games and concerts whose value exceeded the $ 20 - per - gift limit or $ 50 - a - year thresholds on outside gifts .
In the case of two marketers , gifts were accepted on at least 135 occasions .
The report identifies eight of the employees by name and a ninth only by job description .
One worker admitted having a one - night - stand with a Shell employee .
That same individual allegedly passed out business cards for her sex toy business , Passion Parties , at work , and bragged that her income from that business exceeded her salary at the Interior Department .
The employee was authorized to conduct such outside employment , and denied to investigators that she advertised for it during work hours , the report said .
She admitted selling products to several of her subordinates .
Devaney said the investigations took so long because Chevron refused to cooperate .
An Interior Department official said Chevron would not allow investigators to interview its employees .
Don Campbell , a Chevron spokesman , said Wednesday that the company " produced all of the documents that the government requested months ago . "
A Shell spokeswoman said it would be premature for the company to comment on the report until it had time to review it .
Maripat Sexton , a spokeswoman for Hess , said the company 's investigations " indicated no wrongdoing on our employee 's part . "
" We do not believe we are the focus of the investigation , " she said .
One of the reports claims that the former head of the Denver royalty - in - kind office , Gregory W. Smith , purchased cocaine from a co-worker , and one occasion had it delivered to the office .
He also allegedly had oral sex with subordinates .
The report also said Smith steered government contracts to Geomatrix Consultants Inc. and used government databases and e-mail accounts to conduct business for the company , which paid him $ 30,000 for his work from April 2002 through June 2003 .
Smith retired from the office in May 2007 .
Smith 's attorney , Steve Peters , called the claims " sheer fantasy . "
" Greg Smith was a loyal , dedicated employee of the federal government for more than 28 years , " Peters said Wednesday .
" His efforts in running the royalty - in - kind program resulted in one of the most profitable government programs in American history . "
MMS Director Randall Luthi , in an interview , said the agency was taking the report " extremely seriously " and would review the allegations and weigh taking appropriate action in coming months .
Luthi said four of the employees were transferred to other departments last year .
The inspector general is recommending that current employees implicated be fired and be barred for life from working within the royalty program .
House Natural Resources Chairman Nick Rahall , D - W.Va. , said " this whole IG report reads like a script from a television miniseries and one that cannot air during family viewing time .
It is no wonder that the office was doing such a lousy job of overseeing the RIK program ; clearly the employees had ' other ' priorities in that office . "
One of the employees named in the investigation , Jimmy Mayberry , already has pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Washington to violations of conflict - of - interest laws .
The Justice Department declined to prosecute Smith and former Associate Director of the Minerals Revenue Management program Lucy Querques Denett , who the report says manipulated contracts to ensure they were awarded to former Interior employees .
The findings are the latest sign of trouble at the Minerals Management Service , which already has been accused of mismanaging the collection of fees from oil companies and writing faulty contracts for drilling on government land and offshore .
The charges also come as Congress and both presidential candidates are debating whether to open up more federal offshore waters to oil and natural gas drilling .
" This all shows the oil industry holds shocking sway over the administration and even key federal employees , " said Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla .
" This is why we must not allow Big Oil 's agenda to be jammed through Congress . "
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , urged Democrats to reopen a House investigation of the Minerals Management Service that was initiated in 2006 by House Republicans .
" Looking into and fixing these problems would have meant highlighting the enormous revenues that domestic oil and natural gas production contributes to our treasury .
This just did n't fit into their anti-drilling campaign , " he said .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , announced late Wednesday that he would hold a hearing on the investigations next week .
While most government royalties for drilling on federal lands are paid in cash , the government in recent years has been receiving a greater share of its oil and gas royalties in the actual product .
More of that oil is also being sold on the open market , versus being deposited in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , the nation 's emergency oil stockpile .
Congress earlier this year passed a law halting deposits of oil to the reserve to help alleviate high gasoline prices .
The investigation was prompted by a 2006 phone call from an employee in the Denver office who reported ethical lapses .

Some useful Python tidbits I ’ve recently picked up that I feel I ought to have known much earlier :
Using the dict constructor instead of the literal syntax :
# awkward {' cht ' : 'lc ' , ' chs ' : ' 500x600'} # nice dict ( cht='lc ' , chs= '500x600 ' )
This is mentioned in the tutorial .
Bad code monk .
( Ah , this is that new fangled Python 2.3 ; that explains why I previously did n’t know it .
Basically I learnt the vast majority of my working Python when lambda was new and « from __future__ import nested_scopes » was necessary )
When I met Raymond Hettinger at PyCon UK ( I was doing a “ Code Clinic ” with him ) one of the first questions I asked him was “ when are we going to get unzip “ ; when he replied “ zip is also unzip , you can just use zip ( * l ) ” I had one of those forehead slapping moments ( quite literally I think ) .
I course I knew that “ zip ( * l ) ” transposed a matrix ( see Norvig ’s IAQ ) , but I was n’t used to thinking of a list of pairs , say , as being a matrix that I could transpose to get a pair of lists .
Kick !
Punch !
It ’s all in the mind .
Using split instead of literal lists :
# awkward [ ' F ' , ' PD ' , ' AD ' , ' D ' , ' TD ' , ' ED ' , ' ABO ' ] # nice 'F PD AD D TD ED ABO'.split ( )
This is n’t so much a new trick , but I was always a bit embarrassed about it .
But now I ’ve seen other Python programmers do it too , so I know it ’s more socially acceptable .
Now one that I do n’t actually use so much , nicked from Thomas Guest ’s blog :
" chd=s : %( xs )s , %( ys ) s " % locals ( )
Can you see what ’s going on ?
The variables xs and ys are local variables whose values are spread into the string using « % locals ( ) » as a sort of “ interpolate from local variables ” operator .
I ’m not a great fan , but I can see that it is useful .
I ’m not such a fan because it uses locals which is very cool , but could interfere with a compiler ’s optimisations .
Though in this case , with a constant string on the left of the % operator , the compiler has enough information to do a good analysis .
Speaking of Python string formatting , I was disappointed to learn that the optimisation of compiling format strings , which is routine in the Lisp world , is not generally done in Python .
The optimisation I am talking about is one where « ” some constant string ” % stuff » gets converted into « some_function ( stuff ) » where some_function is a compiled function that does the formatting .
It ’s just one of the signs of how immature whole Python thing is .
And one specially for Pythonistas doing Google charts :
>>> d = dict ( cht='lc ' , chs = '500x600 ') #
The dict from above >>> '&'.join( map ('='.join , d.items ( ) ) ) ' chs=500x600&cht=lc '
An earlier version of this example involved a lambda : «’&’.join(map( lambda item : ‘=’.join ( item ) , d.items ( ) ) ) » , but then just as I was pasting it into this article I realised I could drop the lambda altogether .
Bound methods rule !
What Python have you learnt recently ?

Twenty - nine per cent of teachers believe that creationism and intelligent design should be taught as science , according to an online survey of attitudes to teaching evolution in the UK .
Nearly 50 % of the respondents said they believed that excluding alternatives to evolution was counter - productive and would alienate pupils from science .
The survey , by the website and TV station Teachers TV , also found strong support for the views of Prof Michael Reiss , the former director of education at the Royal Society , who resigned in September over comments about including creationism in science lessons .
Nearly nine in 10 respondents agreed with Reiss that teachers should engage with pupils who raise creationism or intelligent design in science lessons .
Reiss said at the time that creationism was not science and he did not advocate giving it equal time alongside evolution , but he was forced to step down after furious reactions to his comments in the media from some Royal Society fellows .
" This poll data confirms that the debate on whether there is a place for the teaching of creationism in the classroom is still fierce , " said Andrew Bethell , chief executive of Teachers TV .
Teachers TV emailed 10,600 education professionals , of which 1,210 responded .
Because the sample is self - selecting , only those teachers with the strongest views might have replied .
Most controversially , 29 % said they either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the government 's guidelines on teaching evolution which states that " creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science national curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science " .
Fifty - three per cent agreed or strongly agreed with the statement .
Thirty - one per cent of respondents and 18 % of the 248 science teachers in the sample said they thought creationism or intelligent design should be given the same status as evolution in the classroom , although this question did not specify whether it was referring to science lessons or the curriculum in general .
Twenty - two respondents said they had been pressured to teach creationism or intelligent design by their school .
In September Reiss advocated a pragmatic approach to tackling creationism in science classes .
" I feel that creationism is best seen by science teachers not as a misconception but as a world view . "
He said that teachers should not dismiss pupils with creationist views , but engage with them .
But senior Royal Society fellows disagreed with his position .
" I think it is outrageous that this man is suggesting creationism should be discussed in a science classroom , " said Sir Richard Roberts , winner of the 1993 Nobel prize for Medicine .
Back on November 7th , I posted a story on how Bloomberg News was compelled to sue the Federal Reserve under the Freedom of Information
Act in order to find out what type of assets the Federal Reserve was accepting as collateral for loans to banks .
Bloomberg has provided the latest update in that saga and it is not good .
The Fed continues to stonewall and it seems apparent that it will only reveal how U.S. taxpayer money is being spent if forced to do so by law .
You can be sure that this site will be following the procedings and updating you as more information becomes available .
The suit in question is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 08 - CV-9595 , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
The Federal Reserve is refusing to identify the recipients of almost $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would comply with congressional demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
Two months later , as the Fed lends far more than that in separate rescue programs that did n’t require approval by Congress , Americans have no idea where their money is going or what securities the banks are pledging in return .
“ The collateral is not being adequately disclosed , and that ’s a big problem , ” said Dan Fuss , vice chairman of Boston - based Loomis Sayles & Co. , where he co-manages $ 17 billion in bonds .
“ In a liquid market , this would n’t matter , but we ’re not .
The market is very nervous and very thin . ”
Bloomberg News has requested details of the Fed lending under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and filed a federal lawsuit Nov. 7 seeking to force disclosure .
The Fed made the loans under terms of 11 programs , eight of them created in the past 15 months , in the midst of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
“ It ’s your money ; it ’s not the Fed ’s money , ” said billionaire Ted Forstmann , senior partner of Forstmann Little & Co. in New York .
“ Of course there should be transparency . ”
Treasury , Fed , Obama
Federal Reserve spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment on the loans or the Bloomberg lawsuit .
Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis did n’t respond to a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment .
President - elect Barack Obama ’s economic adviser , Jason Furman , also did n’t respond to an e-mail and a phone call seeking comment from Obama .
In a Sept. 22 campaign speech , Obama promised to “ make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people ’s business . ”
The Fed ’s lending is significant because the central bank has stepped into a rescue role that was also the purpose of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , bailout plan — without safeguards put into the TARP legislation by Congress .
Total Fed lending topped $ 2 trillion for the first time last week and has risen by 140 percent , or $ 1.172 trillion , in the seven weeks since Fed governors relaxed the collateral standards on Sept. 14 .
The difference includes a $ 788 billion increase in loans to banks through the Fed and $ 474 billion in other lending , mostly through the central bank ’s purchase of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds .
Sept. 14 Decision
Before Sept. 14 , the Fed accepted mostly top-rated government and asset - backed securities as collateral .
After that date , the central bank widened standards to accept other kinds of securities , some with lower ratings .
The Fed collects interest on all its loans .
The plan to purchase distressed securities through TARP called for buying at the “ lowest price that the secretary ( of the Treasury ) determines to be consistent with the purposes of this Act , ” according to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , the law that covers TARP .
The legislation did n’t require any specific method for the purchases beyond saying mechanisms such as auctions or reverse auctions should be used “ when appropriate . ”
In a reverse auction , bidders offer to sell securities at successively lower prices , helping to ensure that the Fed would pay less .
The measure also included a five - member oversight board that includes Paulson and Bernanke .
At a Sept. 23 Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington , Paulson called for transparency in the purchase of distressed assets under the TARP program .
` We Need Transparency ’
“ We need oversight , ” Paulson told lawmakers .
“ We need protection .
We need transparency .
I want it .
We all want it . ”
At a joint House - Senate hearing the next day , Bernanke also stressed the importance of openness in the program .
“ Transparency is a big issue , ” he said .
The Fed lent cash and government bonds to banks , which gave the Fed collateral in the form of equities and debt , including subprime and structured securities such as collateralized debt obligations , according to the Fed Web site .
The borrowers have included the now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co .
Banks oppose any release of information because it might signal weakness and spur short - selling or a run by depositors , said Scott Talbott , senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable , a Washington trade group .
Frank Backs Fed
“ You have to balance the need for transparency with protecting the public interest , ” Talbott said .
“ Taxpayers have a right to know where their tax dollars are going , but one piece of information standing alone could undermine public confidence in the system . ”
The nation ’s biggest banks , Citigroup , Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley , declined to comment on whether they have borrowed money from the Fed .
They received $ 120 billion in capital from the TARP , which was signed into law Oct.
3 .
In an interview Nov. 6 , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said the Fed ’s disclosure is sufficient and that the risk the central bank is taking on is appropriate in the current economic climate .
Frank said he has discussed the program with Timothy F. Geithner , president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a possible candidate to succeed Paulson as Treasury secretary .
“ I talk to Geithner and he was pretty sure that they ’re OK , ” said Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat .
“ If the risk is that the Fed takes a little bit of a haircut , well that ’s regrettable . ”
Such losses would be acceptable , he said , if the program helps revive the economy .
` Unclog the Market ’
Frank said the Fed should n’t reveal the assets it holds or how it values them because of “ delicacy with respect to pricing . ”
He said such disclosure would “ give people clues to what your pricing is and what they might be able to sell us and what your estimates are . ”
He would n’t say why he thought that information would be problematic .
Revealing how the Fed values collateral could help thaw frozen credit markets , said Ron D’Vari , chief executive officer of NewOak Capital LLC in New York and the former head of structured finance at BlackRock Inc .
“ I ’d love to hear the methodology , how the Fed priced the assets , ” D’Vari said .
“ That would unclog the market very quickly . ”
TARP ’s $ 700 billion so far is being used to buy preferred shares in banks to shore up their capital .
The program was originally intended to hold banks ’ troubled assets while markets were frozen .
AIG Lending
The Bloomberg lawsuit argues that the collateral lists “ are central to understanding and assessing the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression . ”
The Fed has lent at least $ 81 billion to American International Group Inc. , the world ’s largest insurer , so that it can pay obligations to banks .
AIG today said it received an expanded government rescue package valued at more than $ 150 billion .
The central bank is also responsible for losses on a $ 26.8 billion portfolio guaranteed after Bear Stearns Cos. was bought by JPMorgan .
“ As a taxpayer , it is absolutely important that we know how they ’re lending money and who they ’re lending it to , ” said Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Arlington , Virginia - based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
Ratings Cuts
Ultimately , the Fed will have to remove some securities held as collateral from some programs because the central bank ’s rules call for instruments rated below investment grade to be taken back by the borrower and marked down in value .
Losses on those assets could then be written off , partly through the capital recently injected into those banks by the Treasury .
Moody ’s Investors Service alone has cut its ratings on 926 mortgage - backed securities worth $ 42 billion to junk from investment grade since Sept. 14 , making them ineligible for collateral on some Fed loans .
The Fed ’s collateral “ absolutely should be made public , ” said Mark Cuban , an activist investor , the owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and the creator of the Web site BailoutSleuth.com , which focuses on the secrecy shrouding the Fed ’s moves .
The Bloomberg lawsuit is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 08 - CV-9595 , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
Over the past decade , it has become increasingly clear that many aspects of aging are conserved across species .
For example : the sirtuins , first discovered in yeast , control lifespan and age - related phenotypes in metazoans .
Likewise , the IGF - 1 pathway , originally revealed in the worm in studies of the daf - 2 mutation , appears to play a significant role in mammalian aging .
But how much do these model systems reveal about what ’s going on in human beings ?
Even the rodents — the laboratory organisms most closely related to us — have very different life histories and have adapted to very different niches over the course of evolution ; therefore it would not be surprising if their response to e.g. calorie restriction ( CR ) were quite different from ours .
Indeed , a study from Fontana et al. argues that this is the case for the IGF - 1 pathway :
Long - term effects of calorie or protein restriction on serum IGF - 1 and IGFBP - 3 concentration in humans Reduced function mutations in the insulin / IGF - I signaling pathway increase maximal lifespan and health span in many species .
Calorie restriction ( CR ) decreases serum IGF - 1 concentration by ~ 40 % , protects against cancer and slows aging in rodents .
However , the long - term effects of CR with adequate nutrition on circulating IGF - 1 levels in humans are unknown .
Here we report data from two long - term CR studies ( 1 and 6 years ) showing that severe CR without malnutrition did not change IGF - 1 and IGF - 1 : IGFBP - 3 ratio levels in humans .
In contrast , total and free IGF - 1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately protein - restricted individuals .
Reducing protein intake from an average of 1.67 g kg−1 of body weight per day to 0.95 g kg−1 of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing CR resulted in a reduction in serum IGF - 1 from 194 ng mL−1 to 152 ng mL−1 .
These findings demonstrate that , unlike in rodents , long - term severe CR does not reduce serum IGF - 1 concentration and IGF - 1 : IGFBP - 3 ratio in humans .
In addition , our data provide evidence that protein intake is a key determinant of circulating IGF - 1 levels in humans , and suggest that reduced protein intake may become an important component of anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions .
To understand why this is significant and somewhat surprising , let ’s go through the logic : Decreased IGF - 1 levels are associated with increased lifespan .
Calorie restriction is also associated with increased lifespan .
In rodents , CR is associated with decreased IGF - 1 levels , leading to the ( still unproven ) hypothesis that the effects of CR are mediated by modulation of the IGF - 1 axis .
In humans , however , the situation is slightly different :
As in rodents , the human IGF - 1 pathway contains several genes that appear to regulate longevity .
The longevity benefits of CR are still under study , but it does appear that certain types of fasting regimens have protective effects against e.g. tumor growth .
According to this new study , however , CR has no effect on the levels of functional , circulating IGF - 1 — so while IGF - 1 may regulate longevity and CR may protect against cancer and other age - related maladies , it does n’t appear that CR mediates its effects via IGF - 1 .
And this is true even in the model system that biogerontologists consider to be the best compromise between experimental tractability and evolutionary proximity .
The moral ?
Just that we ca n’t ever assume that a result obtained in rodents will hold true in humans : animal model results are n’t clinical facts , just hypothesis generators for studies that will ultimately have to be performed in Our Favorite Species .
The devil , as always , is in the details .
Did the great violin maker use a special primer or varnish , did he treat the woods he used with minerals , or was it a fungus that gave the wood its special tone characteristics ?
Ever since , violin makers have tried to find the reason behind the differences in tones and paid careful attention to the quality of the wood used .
But only ten years ago , scientists have become interested in the resonance properties of spruce fir , which is the most commonly used wood in violin and piano construction .
Wood  a material with many faces Christoph Buksnowitz of the Agricultural University in Vienna , explained to about 150 participants of the forum , that spruce wood is used in tone instruments since it contributes a lot to the development of sounds and because it was available in large quantities in close proximity to the early factories of musical instruments .
Spruce fir used in violin making must have certain physical characteristics .
Thus , for example , the diameter of the tree trunk must be at least 40 centimeters in order to allow for the size of boards needed in violin making .
Tree rings must be spaced evenly about 5 millimeters apart in order to allow for perfect propagation of sound .
Therefore , growth conditions play an important role , noted Busnowitz .
Only wood from those spruce trees growing at their typical range and at heights of about 1,000 meters are therefore suitable .
Too much light or wind from one side cause uneven growth and therefore the wood is of lower quality .
In order to remove tensions in the wood , the trees must be dried naturally for some years .
All these factors influence the formation and shaping of the most common cells of the spruce fir , the tracheids .
When the cell walls of these tracheids become thin then wood density is reduced , and the wood becomes less heavy .
Such a result is wished for in the making of violins because it allows for better resonance properties and sound radiation .
However , this kind of wood is at the same time also less firm and this may negatively impact the stability of the violin .
It appears then that the acoustic of a musical instrument is influenced by the cell structure of the wood .
Experienced violin makers recognize the tone quality of the wood by its color .
Thus , for example , the yearly formation of growth rings or a fungal decay of a tree will change the color .
One may be tempted to ask therefore , why violins are still made out of so complicated a material as resonant wood and not out of a less variable material such as carbon fibers .
Dr. Busnowitz thinks that « a lot of tradition is tied in with the resonance wood of the spruce tree , which is unique and individual in its form and tone features » .

Earlier this month , a guest took the pulpit at Open Bible Fellowship in Morrison , Ill. , a 350 - member church surrounded by cornfields .
The speaker was an insurance salesman from Colorado named Ted Haggard .
The former superstar pastor , disgraced two years ago in a sex - and - drugs scandal , had returned — this time as a Christian businessman preaching a message that was equal parts contrition and defiance .
Haggard linked his fall to being molested in second grade and apologized again .
His two sermons were posted , fleetingly , on Haggard 's Web site under one word : " Alive ! "
While his exact plans remain unclear , Haggard is unmistakably making himself a public figure again , nine months after his former church said he walked away from an oversight process meant to restore him .
Public figures get public scrutiny there Ted .

That memorial was the triumph of politics at the expense of the personal .
At the expense of what makes you human .
This is what I feel you have to think about .
You can make your life sick and small , you can fill it with poison , when you turn everything into politics .
And what makes me sad is not that you used my death to get out the vote .
It 's not that you were cold .
It 's that the only way you could show any warmth was through politics .
Here , I think , is the reason : a dulling of the senses , a kind of despair that has led you to let politics completely take over your lives .
That 's the reason you treated a reflective and loving occasion as . . . well , as a big vulgar whomp - ' em - stomp - 'em rally with jeers and cheers and my casket as the stump from which you lambasted the foe .

Once you " know " that -- that human life is not so special after all -- then everything is possible , and none of it is good .
When a society comes to believe that human life is not inherently worth living , it is a slippery slope to the gas chamber .
You wind up on a low road that twists past Columbine and leads toward Auschwitz .
Today that road runs through Pinellas Park , Fla .
Our children have been reared in the age of abortion , and are coming of age in a time when seemingly respectable people are enthusiastic for euthanasia .
It can not be good for our children , and the world they will make , that they are given this new lesson that human life is not precious , not touched by the divine , not of infinite value .
And those who are still learning -- our children - - oh , what terrible lessons they 're learning .
What terrible stories are shaping them .
They 're witnessing the Schiavo drama on television and hearing it on radio .
They are seeing a society -- their society , their people -- on the verge of famously accepting , even embracing , the idea that a damaged life is a throwaway life .
Are the Obamas , at bottom , snobs ?
Do they understand America ?
Are they of it ?
Did anyone at their Ivy League universities school them in why one should love America ?
Do they confuse patriotism with nationalism , or nativism ?
Are they more inspired by abstractions like " international justice " than by old visions of America as the city on a hill , which is how John Winthrop saw it , and Ronald Reagan and JFK spoke of it ?
Have they been , throughout their adulthood , so pampered and praised -- so raised in the liberal cocoon -- that they are essentially unaware of what and how normal Americans think ?
And are they , in this , like those cosseted yuppies , the Clintons ?
Why is all this actually not a distraction but a real issue ?
Because Americans have common sense and are bottom line .
They think like this .
If the president and his first lady are not loyal first to America and its interests , who will be ?
The president of France ?
But it 's his job to love France , and protect its interests .
If America 's leaders do n't love America tenderly , who will ?
And there is a context .
So many Americans right now fear they are losing their country , that the old America is slipping away and being replaced by something worse , something formless and hollowed out .
They can see we are giving up our sovereignty , that our leaders will not control our borders , that we do n't teach the young the old - fashioned love of America , that the government has taken to itself such power , and made things so complex , and at the end of the day when they count up sales tax , property tax , state tax , federal tax they are paying a lot of money to lose the place they loved .
And if you feel you 're losing America , you really do n't want a couple in the White House whose rope of affection to the country seems lightly held , casual , provisional .
America is backing Barack at the moment , so America is good .
When it becomes angry with President Barack , will that mean America is bad ?

Russian firm ElcomSoft has applied GPU acceleration technology to its password recovery tool to allow PCs or servers running supported NVIDIA video cards to break Wi -Fi encryption up to 100 times faster than is possible by using conventional microprocessors .
Recovery times for Wi-Fi keys are increased by a factor between 10 to 15 in the use of Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery in combination with a regular laptop featuring NVIDIA GeForce 8800 M or 9800 M series GPUs .
By running the same software on a desktop with two or more NVIDIA GTX 280 boards installed , this figure increases to a factor of 100 .
We 've known for years that the previous generation of wireless encryption , WEP , was vulnerable to brute force attack .
The infamous compromise of TJX , which resulted in the compromise of at least 45.7 m credit card records , has been traced back to a hack in a weak security retail network with older point of sale terminals running WEP .
Elcomsoft advance makes WPA and WPA2 encryption open to attack .
In fact , the software is specifically designed to support " passport recovery " on Wi-Fi networks running either WPA or the newer WPA2 encryption .
The software needs to intercept only a few packets in order to perform a brute force attack , where a huge number of possible passwords are tried in an attempt to stumble upon the correct code .
ElcomSoft positions the tool as a means of auditing corporate Wi-Fi networks for inappropriately weak passwords .
The firm is also marketing its technology to forensic and government agencies , as well as data and password recovery services .
The raw horsepower of graphics chips , normally used as 3D graphic accelerators by gamers , can also be applied for a variety of other number - crunching password - breaking uses beyond uncovering WiFi passwords .
Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery can also be used to recover Windows startup passwords , crack MD5 hashes , and unlock password - protected documents created by Microsoft Office or PDF files created by Adobe Acrobat , according to ElcomSoft .
More about Elcomsoft 's tool can be found here .
Security agencies have demonstrated the use of plasma TV components in password cracking .
High performance FPGA ( Field Programmable Gate Array ) chips were applied to crack standard GSM transmissions in as little as 30 seconds , during a demonstration by security researchers Steve Mueller and David Hulton at Black Hat in Washington back in February .
Although government agencies have probably applied similar approaches for some time the programming of FPGA is a tricky process , involving getting to grips with a specialist hardware programming language .
Elcomsoft 's approach by contrast relies on off - the - shelf software and readily available components .
Security consultancy Global Secure Systems said that the development means Wi -Fi networks - even those running the latest encryption algorithm - can no longer be considered to be secure .
" This breakthrough in brute force decryption of Wi-Fi signals by Elcomsoft confirms our observations that firms can no longer rely on standards - based security to protect their data , " said GSS managing director David Hobson .
" As a result , we now advise clients using Wi-Fi in their offices to move on up to a VPN encryption system as well .
" Brute force decryption of the WPA and WPA2 systems using parallel processing has been on the theoretical possibilities horizon for some time - and presumably employed by relevant government agencies in extreme situations - but the use of the latest NVidia cards to speedup decryption on a standard PC is worrying . "
Hobson added that the development could spur a step back from wireless to wired network connection in sensitive installation , such as financial services organisations , particularly concerned about data privacy . ®

For all its sophistication and power , your brain is built from unreliable components – one neuron can successfully provoke a signal in another only 40 % of the time .
This lack of efficiency frustrates neuroengineers trying to build networks of brain cells to interface with electronics or repair damaged nervous systems .
Our brains combine neurons into heavily connected groups to unite their 40 % reliability into a much more reliable whole .

Now human engineers working with neurons in the lab have achieved the same trick : building reliable digital logic gates that perform like those inside electronics .
Built from scratch
Elisha Moses at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , and his students Ofer Feinerman and Assaf Rotem have developed a way to control the growth pattern of neurons to build reliable circuits that use neurons rather than wires .
The starting point is a glass plate coated with cell - repellent material .
The desired circuit pattern is scratched into this coating and then coated with a cell - friendly adhesive .
Unable to gain purchase on most of the plate , the cells are forced to grow in the scratched areas .
The scratched paths are thin enough to force the neurons to grow along them in one direction only , forming straight wire - like connections around the circuit .
Using this method the researchers built a device that acts like an AND logic gate , producing an output only when it receives two inputs .
Better together
The gate is made from a network of neurons in a square shape approximately 900 micrometres on a side .
Three of the sides form a “ horseshoe ” 150 - micrometres wide , and packed with neurons .
On the fourth side an isolated neuron island is linked to the other sides by two thinner bridges ( see image , top right ) .
Neurons send their wire - like extensions that carry signals – axons – across those narrow bridges to the neuron island .
When stimulated with a small dose of a drug , the neurons send signals around the circuit .
An ion blocker is used in the centre of the horseshoe to electrically isolate one side from the other .
By changing the width of the bridges , the researchers are able to control how many axons link to the neuron island , and tune their device to behave like an AND gate .
The neurons on the island only produce an output after receiving signals through both of the thin bridges .
Like a natural system , the device transcends the performance of individual neurons – achieving 95 % reliability from a collection of 40 % reliable components .
Brain interface
Rotem thinks that this provides a useful model for real brain function .
“ The existence of a threshold level for activation plays a central role in neuronal computation , ” he says .
In his logic gates and real brains alike , many neurons contribute to generate a signal strong enough to excite another group of neurons , he says .
Charles Stevens at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , is not so sure , pointing out that real brain “ circuits ” do not resemble logic gates .
But achieving reliable performance from lab - grown neurons is still impressive , he adds .
“ There is a sort of fascination with neural networks grown in culture , and this paper improves on the usual random networks , ” he says .
Rotem says that brain - cell logic circuits could serve as intermediaries between computers and the nervous system .
“ It ’s difficult to physically interface [ neural prosthetics ] with live neurons , ” he says .
Brain implants can allow the paralysed to control robot arms or learn to talk again , but suffer a drop - off in performance when scar tissue coats their electrodes .
“ An intermediate layer of in vitro neurons interfacing between man and machine could be advantageous , ” he says .

You may have noticed that things have been less responsive than usual on stackoverflow.com .
The culprit is SQL Server 2008 full - text search .
I ’ll let Brent explain :
Before 2008 , full text search was n’t inside the database – it was n’t subject to things like transactions .
Heck , it was more like Lucene where it lived outside on its own .
Now , it ’s stored inside data files and it ’s subject to transactions .
From what I ’m hearing , blocking and locking is a completely new issue in 2008 FTS .
There ’s a big overhead involved with making it subject to transactions .
In most environments , you do n’t see full text being used for transactions .
At StackOverflow , you ’re doing heavy transactional activity on the same fields that you ’re doing analytical , many - record selects .
If you do a full text search on Revisions and you include a common keyword like , say , SQL , you ’re going to match tens of thousands of records .
When I look at the query plans for these , I ’m seeing 50 - 100 k reads .
Doing that inside a table that ’s also getting heavy inserts – boom , transactional disaster .
We rely heavily on full - text search on stackoverflow.com , which worked amazingly well for us under SQL Server 2005 .
Looks like that ’s no longer the case for SQL Server 2008 , unfortunately .
Brent is following up with the SQL Server team on this , and they have a copy of our database to test against .
( Brent has given so incredibly generously of his time on the database front that I ’m adding him to the stackoverflow.com virtual team — he ’ll get a place on the About page with the rest of the team . )
Based on the stunningly poor SQL Server 2008 full text results so far , and the apparent architecture changes , I ’m pessimistic that the SQL team will be able to do anything for us .
We had always planned to move to lucene .
net in the future ; looks like we ’ll need to move that timetable up aggressively .
I ’ll see what I can do over the weekend to make that happen .

Distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks will be criminal acts from now on , thanks to changes to the Computer Misuse Act that have come into effect .
The changes have been in the offing for six years , reported Outlaw.com .
They were held up because of concerns that some of the phrasing could stop anti-cybercrime researchers from developing , owning or sharing malware for research .
Outlaw.com said the changes make it a criminal offence to conduct DDoS attacks .
The original legislation included offences of unauthorised access to computer material and of unauthorised modification of computer material .
" There is now a new offence of doing anything without authorisation with intent to impair , or with recklessness as to impairing , the operation of a computer , " said the report .
Offenders face up to 10 years in jail and a fine , up from five years .
The maximum penalty for unauthorised access to computer material rises from six months ' imprisonment and a fine to two years ' imprisonment and a fine .
The act also makes it an offence to make , adapt , supply or offer to supply any article which is " likely to be used to commit , or to assist in the commission of , [ a hacking or unauthorised modification or DoS ] offence " , Outlaw.com said .
It is also an offence to supply an article , such as program or data , " believing that it is likely " to be used to commit such an offence .
The penalty here is up to two years ' in jail .

Iran is the second largest Opec oil producer and already feeling the pain of declining prices more than any other in the Middle East .
Its " rainy day " oil stabilisation fund , used to release profits when revenues decline , is reportedly badly depleted as a result of mismanagement by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government .
The precise figure is a state secret , but a member of parliament revealed recently it was $ 7bn - just enough to cover one year of imported petrol .
Ahmadinejad has seen two central bank governors resign and faces daily criticism of his policies .
A strike by the powerful " bazaari " class over a new VAT tax - which would have aggravated inflation already at nearly 30 % - was seen as a warning .
Iran is especially vulnerable because 80 % of its revenue comes from oil .
The IMF calculated recently that for Iran to balance its budget , the price of crude oil must not fall below $ 95 a barrel .
With prices now below $ 50 the shortfall could be staggering .
The effect of declining oil prices will be felt both domestically and internationally .
Ahmadinejad is expected to stand for a second presidential term next June but the lack of cash will restrict his plans to replace subsidies with direct cash payments - widely seen as a vote - buying tactic .
US and UN sanctions imposed over the nuclear issue are already limiting Iran 's ability to issue letters of credit and thus increasing its cost of trade .
Saudi Arabia has been happy to use high Opec production levels and low prices to contain Tehran 's plans for regional hegemony .
US experts and lobbyists now talk openly of exploiting the drop in oil prices to make the sanctions more effective .
Obama vows to create 2.5 m new jobs in two years Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 22 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US president - elect Barack Obama announced Saturday that he had ordered his economic advisers to produce an economic recovery plan to create 2.5 million new jobs over the next two years .
" We 'll be working out the details in the weeks ahead , but it will be a two - year , nationwide effort to jumpstart job creation in America and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy , " Obama said in his weekly radio address .
Obama , who has vowed to make the economy his priority when he takes office from President George W. Bush in January , said the effort should produce 2.5 million new jobs by January of 2011 and lay the foundation of the country 's economic recovery .
His announcement came two days after government data showed that new jobless claims had surged to a 16 - year high , in a new sign that the world 's largest economy appeared to be sliding into a deep recession .
This year , the US economy has shed 1.2 million jobs , and the president - elect warned millions more could be lost next year without urgent action .
The Federal Reserve has warned the jobless rate could climb to 7.6 percent in 2009 as the economy struggles with a sharp downturn and a global financial crisis .
Obama said he intended to put people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges , modernizing schools , building wind farms , solar panels and fuel - efficient cars .
He also plans to develop alternative energy technologies that he says can free the United States from its dependence on foreign oil and keep the US economy competitive in the years ahead .
" These are n't just steps to pull ourselves out of this immediate crisis , " he said .
" These are the long - term investments in our economic future that have been ignored for far too long . "
Obama said his economic recovery plan represented " an early downpayment " on the type of reform his administration will bring to Washington .
He said he wanted to form a government " that spends wisely , focuses on what works , and puts the public interest ahead of the same special interests that have come to dominate our politics . "
The announcement came amid media reports that the Illinois Democrat had picked New York central banker Timothy Geithner to be his treasury secretary .
Geithner , 47 , is well known to Wall Street from his role as New York Federal Reserve chief and was a career official at the Treasury Department from 1988 to 2001 , serving under three administrations and rising to undersecretary for international affairs .
As the successor to Republican Henry Paulson , Geithner would become the overseer of a 700 - billion - dollar bailout package for distressed banks at a time when the world 's largest economy is staring at recession .
" Tim is a great choice because he brings to the job intelligence , a wealth of experience in crisis management , deep knowledge of everything that has been going on in the last year , and an ability to listen and learn , " Alan Blinder , a former Fed vice - chairman and now a Princeton University economist , told McClatchy Newspapers .
The reports of Geithner 's selection appeared to have reassured investors , resulting in the Dow Jones industrial stock index jumping nearly 500 points on Friday .
Former treasury secretary Larry Summers and ex-Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker are likely to play key roles as economic advisors to the new president .
It was not immediately clear , though , if Summers and Volker would participate in drafting the recovery plan .
The president - elect predicted in his address that ensuring passage of his plan by Congress would not be easy and he would need the support of both Democrats and Republicans .
" But what is not negotiable is the need for immediate action , " he said .
" Right now , there are millions of mothers and fathers who are lying awake at night wondering if next week 's paycheck will cover next month 's bills . "

“ I could go over to the Hill and put pressure on people above me and get something done , ” Mr. Cantrell explained about his success in Washington .
“ With the Army , as long as the senator is not calling over and complaining , everything is O.K .
And the senator will not call over and complain unless the contractor you ’re working with does not get his money .
So you just have to keep the players happy and it works . ”
The national missile defense program has cost the United States more than $ 110 billion since President Ronald Reagan unveiled his Star Wars plan 25 years ago .
Today , the missile defense effort is the Pentagon ’s single biggest procurement program .
The Army declined to discuss the Cantrell case , other than to say it had taken steps to try to prevent similar crimes from happening again .
But some current and former Defense Department officials say the exploiting of the system that preceded Mr. Cantrell ’s kickback scheme has had a damaging impact , slowing progress toward building a viable missile defense system by diverting money to unnecessary or wasteful endeavors .
That pattern of larding up the defense budget with pet projects pushed by lawmakers and lobbyists is a familiar one .
“ What they did may have been a scandal , ” said Walter E. Braswell , Mr. Ennis ’s lawyer , referring to the actions of his client and Mr. Cantrell .
“ But even more grotesque is the way defense procurement has disintegrated into an incestuous relationship between the military , politicians and contractors . ”
Dr. J. Richard Fisher , one of Mr. Cantrell ’s former bosses , said : “ The system needs to change .
But it is not likely to do that .
There is just too much inertia  and too much self - interest . ”

Global warning :
We are actually heading towards a new Ice Age , claim scientists
It has plagued scientists and politicians for decades , but scientists now say global warming is not the problem .
We are actually heading for the next Ice Age , they claim .
British and Canadian experts warned the big freeze could bury the east of Britain in 6,000 ft of ice .
A taste of the future : Plunging temperatures around Britain created dramatic 2 - ft icicles over Sleightholme River in County Durham
Most of Scotland , Northern Ireland and England could be covered in 3,000 ft - thick ice fields .
The expanses could reach 6,000 ft from Aberdeen to Kent – towering above Ben Nevis , Britain ’s tallest mountain .
And what 's more , the experts blame the global change on falling - rather than climbing - levels of greenhouse gases .
Lead author Thomas Crowley from the University of Edinburgh and Canadian colleague William Hyde say that currently vilified greenhouse gases – such as carbon dioxide – could actually be the key to averting the chill .
The warning , published in the authoritative journal Nature , is based on records of tiny marine fossils and the earth ’s shifting orbit .
The Big chill : Experts warn that 3,000 ft ice sheets could cover most of Britain
The Earth has seen dramatic climate fluctuations – veering between cold and warm extremes - over the past three million years , the researchers say .
And changes in the Earth ’s orbit and slowly falling levels of carbon dioxide are the cause .
The team says we are approaching a turning point , in the next 10,000 to 100,000 years , which will lead to the new ice sheets smothering much of Europe , Asia and South America .
The theory , which is based on computer models , suggests ice sheets will also slash sea levels by up to 300 m , so Russia and Alaska will be connected by land .
The North Sea will become part of a huge glacier stretching from Holland and Scandinavia to the Russian Far East .
Stark : Computer modelling suggests ' a rapid transition into the glacial state , ' the researchers say
Professor Crowley said the stark findings do not mean we should stop fighting warming .
But he urged : ‘ Do n’t push the panic button . ’
‘ There ’s no excuse for saying “ we ’ve got to keep pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , ” ’ he told Reuters .
‘ Geologically it ’s tomorrow , but we have lots of time to argue about the appropriate level of greenhouse gases . ’

Nearly 90 % of NH votes are counted IN SECRET by a private corporation with a criminal history , criminal personnel , and partisan ties .
The State of NH has approved the outsourcing of our elections , in clear violation of the NH Constitution , which states that vote counting must be observable , and in violation of the concept of " non-delegable governmental functions .
This legally binding principle is outlined in the Office of Budget and Management Policy Letter 92 - 1 , as quoted below the video at bottom of this article .
The State , and other defenders of these violations , makes the claim that privatizing the vote count on election night is okay because NH allows for manual recounts of its paper ballots .
This argument is flawed on so many levels it would take a policy paper to lay it out for you .
Suffice to say that the NH Constitution mandates open vote counting for elections .
Period .
It makes no reference to recounts .
And the principle of non-delegable governmental functions similarly offers no loophole for privatization of critical functions as long as you have a public back up plan .
And lastly , and most importantly , NH has virtually no secure and publicly observable chain of ballot custody to guarantee the integrity of the vote count in a recount .
So a fraudulent privatized vote count on election day can easily be backed up by a fraudulent vote count in a recount .
In fact , the NH recount is so flawed that the Department of State takes measures to intimidate citizen observers and to ensure the chain of ballot custody is kept under the cover of darkness using police dogs to keep the public at bay .
Why do NH citizens put up with this ?
Take a look at the 2008 NH recount , replete with police dogs :

OMB POLICY LETTER 92-1
US president - elect Barack Obama is trying to work out how he can hang on to his beloved BlackBerry once he moved into to the Oval Office next year .
In an interview with Barbara Walters to air in the US on Wednesday , Obama also said he was trying to keep his BlackBerry or find another way to " break through the isolation and the bubble that exists around the president " .
Obama talked about a range of topics in Tuesday 's interview , including the adjustment of moving into the White House with his wife , Michelle , and their two daughters .
NEW YORK  Joe Girardi said this week he'd enjoy showing free agents around the new Yankee Stadium .
CC Sabathia is one of the players the New York manager has in mind for a tour of the spacious clubhouse , players lounge , indoor batting cage and underground hot tub .
Free -agent season opened Friday with the Yankees planning to give Sabathia a record offer for a pitcher .
Yankees co-chairman Hank Steinbrenner confirmed Friday night at the team 's spring training complex in Tampa , that an offer was made to Sabathia , and that proposals will be forthcoming for pitchers A.J. Burnett and Derek Lowe .
" Yes , " Steinbrenner said when asked if an offer was made to Sabathia .
" And we 're prepared to make offers to Burnett and Lowe . "
The Yankees formulated a proposal to the big lefty that would exceed Johan Santana 's $ 137.5 million , six - year contract with the New York Mets both in total and average , a baseball official familiar with the negotiations said .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to divulge details .
Steinbrenner declined to give details about the Sabathia offer .
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and Greg Genske , one of Sabathia 's agents , did not return telephone calls seeking comment .
Steinbrenner said he felt the Yankees will be successful in the free - agent market .
" I 'm starting to become very optimistic , " Steinbrenner said .
" I think it 's going to be mutually beneficial to us and for these particular players that we 're after for them to join the Yankees . "
Sabathia went a combined 17 - 10 for Cleveland and Milwaukee this year after winning the 2007 AL Cy Young Award , and is considered the best starting pitcher in this year 's free - agent class .
On Friday morning , the Yankees gave a media tour of the new ballpark , scheduled to be substantially completed by Feb. 17 .
The oval clubhouse has wide lockers , with a replica of the stadium frieze above them , and the Yankees hope one will be Sabathia's .
Other top free - agent starters are likely will wait for Sabathia to set the price for pitchers .
" The signing of CC is going to create probably a truer market for a number of the pitchers , mainly because the clubs that are bidding on CC did n't get him , and the demand for the other pitchers will be greater , " said agent Scott Boras , who represents free agents Oliver Perez and Lowe .
The 171 players who filed for free agency after the World Series could start negotiating money with all teams starting at 12:01 a.m. ET Friday .
Boras , based in California , said his phone was ringing repeatedly late Thursday night .
" I got eight phone calls .
They did n't wait till the business day .
You 're talking about owners , your talking about general managers , people taking very aggressive stances with particular players , " said Boras , who also represents outfielder Manny Ramirez and first baseman Mark Teixeira , among the top free - agent sluggers .
" They wanted to make sure they were on the board making offers , " Boras said .
Francisco Rodriguez tops the available relief pitchers , a group that also includes Brian Fuentes and Kerry Wood .
Agent Paul Kinzer said he had received inquiries from four teams about K - Rod , who saved a record 62 games for the Los Angeles Angels .
" I just think we 've got to be patient .
We 'll know when the fit 's right , " Kinzer said .
" When we get closer , we 'll probably meet with the people , maybe check out the area , living arrangements , that type thing , and then make a decision . "
He also reported an aggressive market for another client , shortstop Rafael Furcal .
" There 's been about five or six serious teams already on him today , and I expect that to even go up because there 's been at least eight or more that have been in contact , " Kinzer said .
Commissioner Bud Selig repeatedly cautions teams to be careful in their spending , but the economic downtown does n't appear likely to depress salaries for top players .
" We think that the time of free agents will still be recession - proof , " said Lew Wolff , owner of the low - revenue Oakland Athletics .
" We think the second tier will present some opportunities . "
Other high - profile free agents include pitchers Ryan Dempster and Trevor Hoffman ; first baseman Jason Giambi ; outfielders Garret Anderson , Bobby Abreu , Milton Bradley , Pat Burrell , Adam Dunn and Ken Griffey Jr. ; catchers Jason Varitek and Ivan Rodriguez ; and third baseman Casey Blake .
" A lot of the owners want to sit down and have a meeting with some of the players , " Boras said .
" There 's a couple players in this market that pay for themselves , in Teixeira and Ramirez , and they know that . "
It 's rare that a player spends his entire career with one team .
Wood wanted to stay with the Cubs , who instead acquired Kevin Gregg as a less costly alternative .
" It will be tough sitting on the other side , " Wood said .

The more we learn about Mars , it seems , the icier the Red Planet appears to be .
The recently departed Phoenix lander dug up water ice and even spotted falling snow from its position in the northern polar plains .
And now data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter point to vast glaciers buried beneath thin layers of crustal debris , much closer to the equator .
The findings , published today in Science , come from the spacecraft 's shallow radar , or SHARAD , which is able to penetrate the surface and examine what lies beneath .
In this case , SHARAD indicated that two long - visible mid-latitude features , one of which is roughly three times the size of Los Angeles , are almost completely composed of water ice .
( The suspect glaciers are covered by debris that obscures them but also insulates the ice from sublimating into water vapor , much as street grit forms an opaque , protective blanket over roadside snowbanks . )
Some researchers had believed the features , which are plentiful at Martian mid-latitudes , were primarily rock , lubricated by a relatively small amount of ice , says study co-author Roger Phillips , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
But the SHARAD results suggest a generally homogeneous glacier largely lacking in internal rock fragments .
" I was surprised that the ice appears so clean in the radar data and that the surface layer is so thin , " says lead author Jack Holt , a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin .
Victor Baker , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who did not contribute to the study , says the evidence for water ice glaciers is compelling .
" It 's still an indirect measurement , but I 'm totally convinced that it 's ice , " he says .
" It 's a physical measurement that you can't really interpret in any way other than the presence of ice . "
Baker says that studies of Mars 's surface indicate a history of glacial features in the planet 's distant past .
" Now what 's a little bit surprising in some ways , " he adds , " is that the ice is still there . "
Indeed , Mars 's climate is not hospitable to ice formation so close to the planet 's equator .
( The researchers focused on the latitude band stretching from 30 to 60 degrees south latitude — on Earth , Porto Alegre , Brazil , is roughly 30 degrees south of the equator . )
" Ice should not accumulate , nor can it exist , at [ the ] surface at these latitudes under the current climate of Mars , " Holt says .
" So in addition to a protective layer , it requires regional glaciations in the past . "
Without a sizable moon to stabilize it , the authors point out , Mars 's axial tilt is much less stable than that of Earth , causing fluctuations in its climate over time .
It 's unclear how much ice is in these formations , but one of the features surveyed appears to be roughly a half mile ( 0.8 kilometer ) thick .
Phillips notes that SHARAD is not finished peering into glaciers .
" We have n't surveyed the entire mid-latitudes region yet , " he says .
( The current study focuses on the southern hemisphere alone but notes that similar features exist north of the equator , as well . )
With more time and more sweeps of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter subsurface radar , the researchers say , they will be able to better estimate the ice 's volume .
But taken together , the glaciers could constitute the largest stores of water on Mars outside its polar regions .
Those stores , Baker says , would be key to potential human exploration of Mars .
" Ice is the critical resource , " he says , noting that solar energy — which is more abundant at lower latitudes — can be harnessed to yield hydrogen and oxygen .
" Mars does n't have much free oxygen , and people need that to breathe .
And hydrogen is a great fuel for getting back from Mars . "
Numerous users of the latest version of the Firefox web browser ( 3.0.4 released yesterday ) are reporting memory issues causing the browser to freeze up or crash .
Firefox 2 was plagued with memory management issues , but users had thought Mozilla had put these behind them with Firefox 3 .
In my own case , Firefox 3.0.4 has become nearly unusable .
The first couple of Firefox 3 releases were fine , and after years of complaining about the product , I could n’t have been happier .
Firefox 3.0.3 seemed a little more unstable , and although there were no clear memory leaks , I went from Firefox never crashing , to Firefox crashing maybe a couple of times a week .
Now with Firefox 3.0.4 , its a multi-day occurrence .
The issue in the new release would appear to be memory related , with memory on my machine spiking over 100 % for Firefox with only a handful of tabs open .
Now before Firefox fanboys do their usual trick and whine “ it ’s your plugins that are doing it ” ( which is the usual response , because it ’s NEVER Firefox ’s fault ) , I ’ve tested the latest version of Firefox on three different Macs .
My Quad Core Mac
Pro with 4GB ram has a number of plugins installed , and I get the memory issue .
My Macbook Pro with 2GB ram with 1 plugin installed has the memory issue .
My wifes 6 month old Macbook with 1gb and ZERO plugins and really nothing else installed except Leopard HAS THE MEMORY ISSUE .
Here ’s some comments on my original mention of the problem from both FriendFeed and Twitter
Its been crashing on me , a dozen times today , at least .
– Dave Winer crashing here too , and I ’ve seen it eat all the memory as well :( – Richard Walker
I ’ve continually found FF to be the most constantly crashing browser I have , ever since ver 3 .
Barring using it ’s add - ons for web development , have switched almost entirely to Chrome .
– Robin Cannon Crashed on both machines here in completing their auto update feature .
FAIL – Paul W. Swansen
It ’s become a crashing bore .
Does Chrome work on Macs yet ?
– Abby Martin
Same problem here , and it ’s driving me crazy .
I want to use it for the addons , but I ’ll go back to using Chrome if I need to .
i have no complaints with chrome , except it does n’t support my favorite addons yet .
Does anyone know when that we will see a lot of addons for Chrome ?
– Michael Fidler
I number of users said they were n’t having issues , although the difference seems to be that the issue may be related primarily to the Mac version , although Inquisitr columnist Steve Hodson who does n’t own a Mac has the same problem as well : details here on Winextra .
I ’ve threatened before to dump Firefox over this issue , yet I ’m still using it .
Safari does n’t offer the plugins which are the only reason I stick with it .
I guess what saddens me more than anything , as a previous donor to Mozilla ( so I ’m not just a whining user ) is that they never seem to learn .
If only someone would come out with a Webkit based browser that supported Firefox plugins natively …..

The conservative era has ended with “ a resounding , bone - rattling crash , ” said Rod Dreher in The Dallas Morning News , and “ now the scattered and demoralized armies of the right will turn on each other . ”
This is a new era , and conservatives have to face the " failure of ideology " that produced this defeat .
" The duration of conservatism 's exile from power depends on how long its civil war lasts — and who wins it . "
The first thing Republicans need to do is disown " Comrade George W. Bush , " said Deroy Murdock in National Review Online , and the Republican congressional leaders who helped him betray conservatives by spearheading " the most aggressive federal expansion since Franklin Delano Roosevelt . "
The GOP is supposed to be the party of small government and free markets !
It ca n't " regain America 's confidence — nor should it — until the guilty parties have been cast into the nearest volcano . "
Accusing Bush of betraying the " true faith " is an increasingly popular conservative refrain , said Jonathan Chait in The New Republic .
But that just shows how poorly Republicans understand why voters rejected them .
And the fact that so many GOP stalwarts remain smitten with Sarah Palin , " the most Bush - like figure conceivable , " just shows that the future of the Republican Party will look a lot like the present .
The Hyperion Power Module Neighborhood Nuclear Reactor is the size of a hot tub and could provide power for your whole neighborhood !
At least , that 's what their website claims .
Bill Christensen over at Technovelgy points out that other companies have claimed this before , and it came to nothing .
But the desire for neighborhood nukes keeps coming back , probably because we 've seen them in scifi before - most notably in Heinlein 's Friday , where small " shipstones " provide enough energy for a whole space vessel .

Utilities Testing Solar Thermal Tech at Traditional Power Plants
November 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The Electric Power Research Institute announced yesterday that two utility companies ( Dynasty Inc and NV Energy ) will test out the addition of solar thermal energy to natural gas plants in Arizona and Nevada .
The EPRI is conducting the project to determine if using solar thermal at fossil fuel plants will reduce fuel costs and plant emissions .
The natural gas plants will add steam created by solar thermal fields to the conventional natural gas - powered steam cycle .
Ultimately , EPRI plans to add solar thermal technology to coal - powered plants as well .
In addition to reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions , EPRI believes that solar thermal technology could also boost coal and natural gas power enough in existing plants to eliminate the need for new infrastructure .
And since fossil fuel plants are n’t going anywhere , giving them renewable energy capabilities makes a great deal of sense .

These are times when you just feel like yelling at the people who write the news , particular the business press .
They are happy to report , word for word , what the Fed and Treasury Department , and their message is always the same : hey , it ’s not our fault ; in fact , we are fixing the problem !
We are told that the economy has tanked because foreigners invested too much in the US , that foreigners saved too much money , that we all lived beyond our means , that greedy capitalists fed our materialist instincts until we popped , or any combination of the above .
Or maybe business cycles are just like weather , cold one season and hot the next .
Regardless is the government that must come to the rescue with the usual combination of cockamamie schemes .
Discovering the Austrian business cycle theory , then , is a revelation , because through it , you learn how the whole business traces to loose money and credit generated by the Fed .
The money is pumped into the capital - goods fashion of the day , in this case housing .
The whole sector becomes overbuilt and unsustainable and it turns , tanking many other affected sectors .
The only answer the problem is not more of the poison that caused the problem but a real liquidation .
This time around , the theory is more in circulation than ever before — thanks to the Mises Institute — but you still do n’t see evidence of consciousness on the part of “ establishment ” journalists .
It turns out that this was also true at the onset of the Great Depression .
The cause of the crash of 1929 and its effects was not unknown that generation either .
There were people saying the right things .
It ’s just that the press and the establishment ignored them .
Here ’s the evidence : A Bubble that Broke the World , by Garet Garrett , published in 1932 .
Here he lays it all out .
“ This is a delusion about credit .
And whereas from the nature of credit it is to be expected that a certain line will divide the view between creditor and debtor , the irrational fact in this case is that for more than ten years debtors and creditors together have pursued the same deceptions .
In many ways , as will appear , the folly of the lender has exceeded the extravagance of the borrower . ”
He goes on to explain how the debt overhang of the first world war is the root cause ; how society came to accept the idea that if people can’t immediately afford stuff , government should provide it ; how government came to operate on a bankrupt system ; how we came to believe that prosperity came from credit rather than savings ; and how the Federal Reserve working with government is the root source of the problem .
Beautiful .
Magnificently written , as only Garrett can .
How could anyone have missed it ?
He was n’t exactly obscure .
He wrote for the Saturday Evening Post .
Incredibly , he chronicled the New Deal blow by blow in the Saturday Evening Post , every rotten law , every goofy plan , every attack on liberty , property , and economic sanity .
There was no mystery here .
The proof : Salvos Against the New Deal , an assembly of his best work from this period .
In other words , the cause , the effects , the folly , the power grabs — it ’s all here , and all eerily similar to what we are experiencing today .
We call it the Great Depression .
But had the politicians not intervened , it would have been known at the 1929 crash , and it might have been as memorable as many other crashes in American history .
The difference this time was the application of “ modern economic methods ” to cure the thing , methods which only ended up prolonging human suffering .
Let ’s talk of two other cases in which the error was pointed out .
Lord Lionel Robbins wrote in 1934 .
His book called The Great Depression , much more technical and scholarly than Garrett ’s own , presents the Austrian theory in a very precise way , and documents how the Fed and the Bank of England inflated the money supply and loosened credit in the latter half of the 1920s , leading to the bust .
His is a cautious treatise in some way .
After all , he was blaming the central bank — not exactly a position that was politically wise — and we are n’t just talking about the equivalent of a blogger today .
He was Lionel Robbins , the most influential economist in Britain until Lord Keynes stole the show with his whiz - bang policy ideas .
And why ?
Robbins counseled letting the bad investments wash out of the system .
Keynes thought you could use the state to rev the bad back to life .
By the way , this is the first edition , and so it is replete with citations to the Austrians such as Mises and Menger .
A later second edition was gutted and replaced with Keynesian and classical citations , and this was before he later caved in to the Keynesian consensus and repudiated the book altogether .
The pressure was on !
As another example , and really the definitive one , Ludwig von Mises himself was writing all throughout the late twenties and early thirties about the business cycle .
He nails it all in essay after essay : the credit expansion , the malinvestment , the folly of counter - cyclical policy , the dangers of protectionism and reflation , and so much more .
These essays could all be written today , and what is also impressive is Mises ’s focus on theory .
He never makes empirical claims that are n’t backed up by an attempt to explain the theoretical apparatus behind the analysis .
What ’s tragic is that his work on business cycle theory — which inspired Hayek ’s own — was not translated to English until the 1980s and , even then , not distributed in a form that elicited much attention .
This is why The Causes of the Economic Crisis is such an important book .
It collects all of Mises ’s essays in a single book that is beautifully edited and bound .
It shows who precisely was the great master of economics in the 20th century .
All of this leads up to Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression , the book that is often cited as the one to show that the episode was caused not by the market but by the central bank .
It is getting all new attention today .
But if you follow his citations , they lead right back to Garrett , Robbins , and Mises — three of the observers of the time who saw precisely what was happening .
They had to be ignored by the New Dealers , for they utterly demolish the case for stabilization policy .

The Best of Jeffrey Tucker
Shawn Adolf and his cousin Tharin Gartrell fancied that 28 August , 2008 would be a good day for the next president of the United States to die .
They had the guns – Gartrell was later caught with a Ruger Model M77 Mark II bolt - action rifle with an attached scope and bipod , and a Remington Model 721 , also with a scope .
They were believers in a radical white supremacist ideology that gave them the motivation they needed to risk their own lives , if necessary , to prevent a black man from entering the Oval Office .
( Or , as a friend reported Adolf as saying : " No nigger should ever live in the White House . " )
And they had at least the outlines of a plan .
They checked into the downtown Denver hotel where they believed Barack Obama was staying , and talked about the ways they could try to gun down the Democratic nominee on the day he was due to accept his party 's nomination at an outdoor sports arena before an adoring crowd of more than 70,000 people .
Like many assassins before them , both the successful ones and the idle fantasists , Adolf and Gartrell took their inspiration from popular culture .
They considered hiding a rifle inside a hollowed out television camera – an idea they borrowed from the Kevin Costner - Whitney Houston vehicle The Bodyguard .
( It is also similar to the way al - Qa'eda operatives posing as a news crew assassinated Ahmad Shah Massoud , the leader of Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance , on 9 September , 2001 , but it is far from clear whether Adolf and Gartrell had any notion of this . )
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
They toyed with the idea of hitting Obama from as far away as 750 yards , using one of their high - powered rifles ; according to their friend Nathan Johnson , who may or may not have been part of the plot , they had in mind the conspiracy theory that President Kennedy was not shot by Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building , but rather by professional assassins stationed on the " grassy knoll " above Dallas 's Dealey Plaza .
None of these plans was ever remotely realistic , however .
Adolf and Gartrell may have had some fearsome weaponry , and a vague affiliation with a white supremacist biker gang called the Sons of Silence , which disavowed them the moment they were arrested .
But they were also rank amateurs living in a crystal methamphetamine - induced haze of paranoia and race hatred .
( One ca n't help thinking Adolf 's name went to his head , at least a little , as he fingered the swastika ring on his finger . )
They had no clue how to circumvent the security surrounding Obama – prosecutors who examined their plans laughed them off as ludicrously naïve .
And they could n't even figure out what every half - interested member of the press corps knew , that Obama was not staying at the Hyatt Regency , the temporary HQ of the Democratic National Committee , but at a different hotel altogether .
Four days before Obama 's acceptance speech , Gartrell was pulled over for drunk - driving in the Denver suburb ' of Aurora after a patrol officer spotted his rented Dodge Ram truck swerving erratically , and the whole plot , such as it was , fell apart almost instantly .
Certainly , the officer found plenty inside the truck to sound alarm bells – the two high - powered rifles , a silencer , a bulletproof vest , camouflage clothing , and three fake identification cards .
But it was also clear that Gartrell was high on meth as well as drunk .
The truck contained enough drug - making equipment to be considered a mobile meth lab .
Gartrell ratted out Johnson and Adolf almost as soon as he was taken in and photographed for his singularly striking mugshot .
( With his bleached blonde hair , heavy silver earrings and pierced lip , he looks like the neo - Nazi from central casting . )
Johnson was in the room at the Hyatt Regency , and wasted no time in talking himself – insisting he had no idea about any assassination plot while almost simultaneously telling the world Adolf was planning to " go down in a blaze of glory " and take Obama with him .
Adolf was a tougher proposition , the only one of the three with a serious criminal record , including burglary , forgery , drugs and weapons raps .
At the time of his arrest he was wanted on eight outstanding charges and had recently skipped out on a $ 1 million bail payment .
He was staying at a different hotel in the Denver suburbs .
When the police arrived , he jumped out of his sixth - floor room on to the roof of the hotel kitchen four floors below , then jumped again to the ground , breaking his ankle as he landed .
He did n't make it far .
He , too , was found to be high on meth .
When asked why he was wearing a bulletproof vest , he said he was convinced someone wanted to kill him .
We will no doubt learn more colourful details about the trio of would - be assassins when their trial begins this week .
Intriguingly , though , they are being prosecuted on drugs and weapons charges only .
Their prosecutor , Troy Eid , has said he is absolutely confident the " meth heads " , as he calls them , never posed a risk to Obama or anyone else .
Not everyone is happy with this decision .
After all , marginal people have hatched assassination plots before , and sometimes succeeded – one thinks of John Hinckley hitting President Reagan in 1981 .
And Barack Obama was never just another presidential contender ; as the first African American to come even close to the highest political office on the planet , in a country whose history is spattered with the blood of racial animus , he is , by common consent , a target several orders of magnitude more tempting than the average for an extremist fringe of kooks , crazies , anti-government militia types , Ku Klux Klan members and other white race warriors , all of whom tend to be unforgiving in their ideological fervour , not to mention armed to the teeth .

He was granted 24 - hour Secret Service protection just a few months into his campaign , in May 2007 , after his friend and fellow Illinois senator , Dick Durbin , raised the alarm on his behalf .
( Usually candidates receive that protection far later in the election cycle , after they have their party primaries sewn up . )
We do n't know exactly how hard the Secret Service has had to work on his behalf , although we do know that two men from the old confederate South – one from North Carolina , the other from Florida – were arrested and charged with making threatening statements against him in July .
We know that effigies of Obama being lynched , or sliced through the head with a hatchet , have popped up periodically around the country – one on the campus of the University of Kentucky , another in Orange County , California in the run-up to Halloween .
We also know that Obama 's supporters have been almost maniacal in their desire to prevent him sharing the tragic fate of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King .
On a couple of occasions during primary season , when security ' guards at Obama campaign events stopped searching people 's bags because of the backlog of people trying to get in , sympathetic reporters , bloggers and ordinary members of the public complained as loudly as they knew how .
Likewise , when someone at a Sarah Palin rally in Clearwater , Florida in early October reacted to a mention of Obama 's name by shouting " kill him ! " , there was such a clamour on the internet that the Secret Service made a rare public announcement saying it was launching an official investigation .
How much of a risk of assassination does Obama face ?
The most immediate , comfortable answer to that is : not much .
The Secret Service has vastly improved its procedures and protocols since the spate of political assassinations of the 1960s and early 1970s .
No president would now be allowed to drive at a snail 's pace in an open - top car through the centre of a major city , as John Kennedy did in Dallas on 22 November , 1963 .
The sheer numbers of Secret Service members assigned to presidential protection has increased dramatically since the attempt on Reagan 's life – we do n't have exact figures on how much , but we do know that when one unhinged man toyed with the idea of tossing a grenade at President Bush in Atlanta in 2005 , he never got remotely close enough to give it a real try .
The more worrying answer is that Obama will almost certainly inspire a large number of assassination plots because of the colour of his skin , and that it only takes one of them to be blessed with luck , proper organisation and a little official incompetence to pose a serious threat .
When asked how much of a risk he faces , he has acknowledged that the color of his skin will be a problem for some people .
And he knows that Colin Powell , the only other African American of significant stature in recent times to consider a run at the White House , decided not to pursue the presidency in part because his wife , Alma , feared for his safety .
" There 's not any question he 's under more threat than most politicians , " said Mark Potok , one of America 's leading researchers into hate groups who edits a monthly Intelligence Report for the Alabama - based Southern Poverty Law Center .
" I think we are seeing a kind of perfect storm of conditions that might well help white supremacist movements grow , and grow rapidly .
" We have changing demographics , and the Census Bureau projection that whites will lose their majority status in America by 2040 .
We have the tanking economy , and now ... a black man in the White House .
This makes some Americans feel they are losing their world – the sense that the country their forefathers built is slipping away from them . "
The number of racist hate groups tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Centre has grown by almost 50 per cent during the Bush administration years , from about 600 in 2000 to almost 900 now .
In contrast to the 1990s , when the " angry white man " phenomenon fuelled the militia movement and led to the white - supremacist inspired Oklahoma City bombing , much of this new growth has been triggered by virulent hostility to immigrants pouring in from Mexico .
It is entirely possible , though , that the emphasis will change now that Obama is about to enter the White House .
Certainly , the neo - Nazi movement senses an opportunity : to judge by the endless chatter on far - right websites , they see a President Obama as the best recruiting tool they 've had in years .
" Obama will be a signal , a clear signal for millions of our people , " the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klan leader and erstwhile candidate for governor , David Duke , wrote earlier this year in an essay he called A Black Flag for White America .
" Obama is like that new big dark spot on your arm that finally sends you to the doctor for some real medicine .
... Obama is the pain that let 's [ sic ] your body know that something is dreadfully wrong ...
Millions of European Americans will inevitably react with new awareness of their heritage and the need for them to defend and advance it . "
That logic suggests the far right is not , in fact , itching to pull the trigger on Obama .
Except that we are hardly dealing with rational people .
The neo - Nazi magazine National Socialist wrote a cover story in September purporting to debunk the " myth " that Obama might be assassinated .
But the cover also showed a photograph of the candidate in the crosshairs of a rifle ( altered to look like a swastika ) under the headline : " Kill this NIGGER ? "
And the piece went on to suggest that Obama , backed by Communists and Jews , planned to commit genocide against working white people .
Likewise , the " imperial wizard " of the Ku Klux Klan , an Indiana railway worker who calls himself Ray Larsen , denied any intent to attack Obama when interviewed on television a few months ago .
But he added : " If that man is elected president , he 'll be shot sure as hell . "
If that does n't have the Secret Service worried , it should .
Some security experts have already started drafting memos with ideas on how to keep Obama better protected using state - of - the - art technology – for example , hand - held TeraHertz scanners that would - be assassins could not spot .
Martin Dudziak , a Virginia - based security specialist who has worked on counter - terrorism issues , pointed out glumly that it is unusually difficult to profile would - be attackers .
As he put it in a memo drafted in October : " There are frankly and very unfortunately , a lot of people in the USA who have deep - rooted ' phobic ' hatred of an African American ... being president .
We should not try to deny this sombre reality . "
If the inept Denver plot was not warning enough , news of another planned anti-Obama assault broke at the end of last month with the arrest of two White Power advocates in Tennessee .
Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman did n't appear to be any more competent than Adolf and Gartrell .
They had grand schemes to kill more than 100 African Americans , and fantasised about killing Obama dressed in white dinner jackets and top hats , but they could n't so much as rob a house – they gave up on their intended target after spotting a guard dog out back and got picked up after shooting out the windows in a church .
Still , they had some serious weapons : a sawn - off shotgun , high - powered rifles and a couple of handguns .
And Cowart appears to have been a founding member of a hate group called the Supreme White Alliance .
While their dreams of killing Obama might have been fanciful , some of their other plans might not .
" They might well have shot up a black high school , or hurt a group of black children , " Potok said .
And it is entirely conceivable that other , more competent criminals will follow them .
Obama may not have appeared remotely daunted when he delivered his victory speech in Chicago 's Grant Park on election night , but it is worth remembering that he was also speaking behind a bulletproof glass shield .
Such precautions , one suspects , will be the rule rather than the exception over the next four or eight years .
" There is a boiling rage just beneath the surface , " Potok added .
" We 're talking about a minority , clearly , of whites .
It 's hard to say how large that group of people is .
But I think this represents the beginning of a real white backlash in a certain quarter of the population . "

Common genetic polymorphisms induce major differentiations in the metabolic make - up of the human population , according to a paper published November 28 in the open- access journal PLoS Genetics .
An international team of researchers , led by Karsten Suhre , has conducted a genome - wide association study with metabolomics , identifying genetic variants in genes involved in the breakdown of fats .
The resulting differences in metabolic capacity can affect individuals ' susceptibility to complex diseases such as diabetes and hyperactivity .
In the rapidly evolving field of metabolomics , scientists aim to measure all endogenous metabolites in a cell or body fluid .
These measurements provide a functional readout of the physiological state of the human body .
Investigation into these so - called " genetically determined metabotypes " in their biochemical context may help determine the pathogenesis of common diseases and gene - environment interactions .
The team identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) located in genes coding for well - characterized enzymes of the lipid metabolism .
Individuals with different genotypes in these genes have significantly different metabolic capacities with respect to the synthesis of some polyunsaturated fatty acids , the beta-oxidation of short - and medium - chain fatty acids and the breakdown of triglycerides .
By simultaneous measurements of both SNPs and serum concentrations of endogenous metabolites , the researchers determined the metabolome of several hundred healthy individuals and compared it to their genetic inheritance .
The results suggest that most individuals carry one or more risk alleles in their genetic inheritance that may determine a certain medical phenotype , the response to a given drug treatment , or the reaction to a nutritional intervention or environmental challenge .
These findings may lead to more targeted approaches to health care based on a combination of genotyping and metabolic characterization .
To achieve this goal , it will be necessary to identify the major genetically determined metabotypes and their association to complex diseases .

The terms " Keating Five , " " Keating Economics , " " Charles Keating , " and " McCain Keating , " hovered among several of the top search terms on Google Monday , as Barack Obama 's campaign launched a new 13 - minute online video that portrays McCain as someone who has n't learned from his past bad judgments during critical financial crises .
The term " Keating Five " was the seventh - most searched for term on Google Monday afternoon , right after searches for voter registration information in Texas and Florida , and right before the term " Vote For Change . "
" Keating Economics " was the 17th most searched for term , and keatingeconomics.com was the 18th most popular term during that same window of time .
In contrast , searches for terms related to Obama and Sixties radical William Ayers barely made an appearance among the top 100 online searches on Monday – even as Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin continued to slam Obama during a Florida campaign rally for his " ties " to Ayers , who is now a college professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Ayers was a member of the violent protest group The Weather Underground , which was active in the 1960s .
But as commentators have pointed out , Obama was eight years old when the Weather Underground carried out its bombings .
The online searches suggest that the Obama campaign 's strategy of focusing voters ' attention on McCain 's history in the late 1980s savings and loan crisis is gaining traction .
The Obama campaign 's 13 - minute video was released online Monday , and features damning testimony from former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp .'s Deputy Director Bill Black , who was one of the key participants in the meetings with McCain at the time .
Obama 's Keating Economics micro-site buttresses its case by providing downloads of some of the original letters that McCain sent to regulators that express his concerns about a proposed rule that would have crimped Keating 's business .
The McCain campaign held a conference call Monday with Akin Gump partner John Dowd , who was McCain 's lawyer during the late 1980s crisis .
On Monday , Dowd defended McCain by pointing out that " John had not violated any rule of the senate , or the law of the United States , " and that Keating 's company American Continental Corp. was a major employer of 2,000 people in Arizona at the time .
Dowd also noted that McCain had resisted Keating 's requests to influence regulators ' investigation into the company .
Dowd characterized the Obama 's campaign 's highlighting of the issue as a " classic political smear job . "
Oddly or prophetically a few weeks ago , I made my own YouTube.com feed addressed to ‘ Joe the Plumber ’ stating that if we had a time machine available to all of us it would be to go back in time and live all over again the Clinton years .
While I realize that is not feasibly possible , in my feed directed at Joe , I stated I wanted for all of us to live as if we were living through the Clinton years all over again .
Little did I realize we would be reminded all over again how it was during the Clinton years as former President Bill Clinton joined forces with Senator Barack Obama down in Kissimmee , Florida for a late night rally after Obama ’s half - hour address to the nation .
Which was simply breath taking .
Call me a mush when it comes to certain political presentations , but I did weep throughout it all .
Not tears of sadness , but tears of what can still be in this great country of ours .
Quite frankly , I am sick and tired of these past eight years which have mainly been negative and detrimental to us all .
I do not have to lay out the specifics since Barack Obama can do so with more force and eloquence .
But , these past eight years have felt as if a force of darkness surrounded us and I along with many want hope for our shared future .
In listening to McCain and Palin during this short campaign which started after both the Democratic and Republican conventions , their tone has been one of negativity which is toxic to we the people .
Their messages of hate , divisiveness , fear and attacking Barack Obama without offering we the people any hope is as if a nuclear bomb was set off .
Due to all of those tactics , I feel as if we have all been living through a nuclear fallout .
A little inspiration coming from their campaign would help , but none has come and quite frankly it is too late for them to change tactics when they have changed tactics too many times that it is hard to keep score .
One day the McCain / Palin ticket have one message and then on a subsequent day they have another and you have to wonder where do they want to take us .
The only symbolism I can think of is a roller - coaster ride .
Have n’t we had enough of that ?
As the McCain / Palin ticket try and scare America of a government led by Democrats , let us truly think of what the first six years of a Republican government was all about .
They just do not get it that many of us are thirsting for a change and all they have given us is a cup filled with sawdust .
Barack Obama has been a good provider for his family as one saw the clips within his address to the nation .
He is raising two amazing little girls along with a woman he loves do deeply whose name is Michelle .
His life has not been an easy one while growing up , but instead of asking for pity , he went on to help others as a community organizer , a state senator in Illinois and a U.S. Senator .
I can think of no one finer to be our next president than Senator Barack Obama .
Senator Obama has given us a closing summation and now it is time to help not only him , but ourselves and make sure that we get out the vote for Barack Obama and make him our next president .
Let us bank on hope instead of fear .
We must keep the Obama / Biden campaign motto in our minds and hearts and that is , “ Yes , we can ! ”

" It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority . " -- Benjamin Franklin
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Colorado Springs is what Sarah Palin would call one of the “ pro-American areas of the nation . ”
This mile - high city in the shadow of Pike ’s Peak is home to several key military sites , including the US Air Force Academy and North American Aerospace Defense Command ’s operations center .
And with its huge concentration of conservative Christian megachurches and organizations , it ’s become known as the “ Evangelical Vatican . ”
The latter element was recently out in force during a Sarah Palin rally and a National Day of Prayer Summit hosted by James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family .
The summit was timed to take place “ just days before our national and local elections ” because , its organizers say , “ as we look over our country , we see a land in need of the Savior , Jesus Christ , ” and they want the faithful to “ pray and intercede with fellow believers for this critical hour in which we live . ”
This past Sunday morning , I visited the expansive campus of New Life Church , probably the most famous megachurch in America , and historically the most influential :
Its founder and former pastor , Ted Haggard , headed the National Association of Evangelicals and reportedly had a direct line to the Bush White House — right up to the moment he was caught buying meth and having a dalliance with a male prostitute in 2006 .
The cavernous “ Worship Center ” seats 7,500 , and looks more like a high - tech concert hall than a church , with elaborate sound systems , TV cameras , screens scrolling biblical texts , and a backdrop that changes from light blue to crimson to a simulacrum of a traditional church , stained glass and all .
Two armed city cops stood guard at the door , and for good reason : Last December , a young man who had been bounced out of a missionary training program near Denver opened fire at the end of a service , killing two and wounding three others before taking his own life .
The boisterous parade of people flowing into the hall looked more like the crowd at a football game :
Young women with low - cut blouses , men in shorts , their bellies bursting out of T - shirts , a Vietnam vet in a motorcycle jacket with the word “ Sniper ” boldly etched on it .
There were very few suits .
As the service began , the nine - piece Desperation Band laid down the Christian beat , a choir of some 70 people swayed in unison , and most members of the audience were on their feet , hands stretched upward in the Pentecostal reach toward God .
When the music finally stopped and they collapsed into their seats , a preacher appeared and asked everyone to take their minds off their financial problems and apply a magnifying glass to God — and fork over some money to the church .
Men with white plastic buckets made their way through the aisles .
Some people threw in change or bills , but a surprising number gave nothing .
The elections are very much on people ’s minds here .
But things have changed at New Life since the last presidential race .
In 2004 , Haggard , who had been a guest at the White House and regularly spoke with Bush on the phone , rallied his congregation around the president , and an associate pastor at the church told a reporter , “ We ’re in regular contact with Karl Rove . ”
Congregants campaigned for Bush in “ Values Vans ” wearing “ I ’m a Values Voter ” buttons .
The pastor who replaced the disgraced Haggard , Brady Boyd , still urges his flock to “ be a good citizen ” and vote : “ If you do n’t vote , you ’re worse than a puppy kicker , ” he said at last Sunday ’s service .
But in a recent interview , he cited the economy , not social “ values ” issues , as “ point number one ” in the election .
Even more surprisingly , he declared , “ The only advice I give is pray , fast and vote , and that can be for any political party …
What ’s happening to us is less allegiance to the Republican Party , and more to our core principles . ”
These core values may include “ protecting ” heterosexual marriage and unborn fetuses , but they also should prompt Christians , Boyd said in a recent sermon , “ to pay our neighbors ’ house notes , to provide food . ”
There are plenty on the Christian right who remain steadfastly in the GOP ’s corner .
But even on the core issues that usually unite evangelicals , there has been dissension in the ranks here in Colorado .
Last year saw the beginning of highly public infighting when Colorado Right to Life , Operation Rescue , and several other organizations attacked Focus on the Family ’s James Dobson for being insufficiently zealous and absolute in his anti-abortion stance .
Colorado Right to Life and Operation Rescue are key supporters of a Colorado ballot measure , Amendment 48 , that would define the term “ person ” to grant full constitutional rights from the “ moment of fertilization . ”
But many usually reliable anti-choice allies have opposed the so - called Personhood Amendment .
The Colorado Catholic Conference of bishops , for one , has cited doubts about both the measure ’s “ timing and content ” and the groups behind it , and even National Right to Life wo n’t endorse it .
Despite all this , there was undeniable excitement at places like New Life about the impending visit of Sarah Palin to Colorado Springs .
As I left the church grounds on Sunday , a group of men handed me a fistful of tickets for the next morning ’s rally .
I was there at 6 a.m. for the 8 a.m. rally , joining Palin ’s supporters lined up in the predawn darkness , many of them dressed in red to demonstrate fealty to their party .
Two hours later they had filled the center of the 8,500 - seat stadium ( though there were still empty seats in the stands ) and were kept stamping their feet in the damp cold — first to a Christian rock group and then to Hank Williams Jr. , who opened with a tune tailored to the current election .
In the original version of his song “ Family Tradition , ” Williams defended his hereditary penchant for drinking Jim Beam and smoking dope .
But rewritten as “ McCain - Palin Tradition , ” the song encourages voters to ignore the “ left - wing liberal media ” and support the Republican ticket “ cuz they ’re just like you and ol ’ Hank . ”
I could n’t make out all the words , but according to others who have transcribed the lyrics , they include such gems as “ John and Sarah tell you just what they think , and they ’re not gonna blink , / And they do n’t have terrorist friends to whom their careers are linked . ”
Williams even goes on to explain the causes of the financial crisis :
“ The bankers did n’t want to make all those bad loans , / But Bill Clinton said , ‘ You got to !’
Now they want to bail out , what I ’m talking about / Is a Democrat liberal hoodoo ! ”
Then Palin appeared , sporting a red leather jacket and producing a roar from her followers .
Palin has pulled back from her riff about Barack Obama not being “ a man who sees America like you and I see America , ” after accusations of coded racism from the media and shouted death threats from her crowds .
Now she instead offered up another American bogeyman : The Red Menace .
Obama ’s tax plan , Palin warned her audience , would drive the country into the socialist camp : “ Obama calls it spreading the wealth , ” she said .
“ Now is not the time to experiment with socialism .
Distributing the wealth will stifle entrepreneurial spirit . ”
While the crowd at the rally was totally behind their lady in red , it was easy for an outsider to wonder if this was also something of a goodbye rally for the woman who just months ago had so energized social conservatives .
Pressing a blue “ Country First ” placard into my hands , a middle - aged woman with intense sparkling eyes told me that despite the recent bad poll numbers for McCain and Palin she thought there was still a chance .
She did n’t seem all that convinced herself , but she pointed a finger toward heaven and smiled resolutely .
The decision , she said , is in the hands of God .
“ But what if you lose ? ” I asked .
“ We will just have to wait until he decides , ” she said , again nodding toward heaven .
“ That might be a pretty long wait , ” I said .
She laughed and agreed .
Perhaps there are some here who also sense that what ’s being lost is more than just a single election .
The fact that the GOP ticket is trailing behind despite the addition of Palin clearly proves that while conservative Christians may be a formidable force in American politics , they ca n’t elect a president by themselves .
The right - wing evangelicals won in previous years because they joined a Republican coalition that also included hawkish neocons , working - class “ Reagan Democrats , ” libertarians , and old - fashioned fiscal conservatives .
And some of those groups have clearly had enough .
They are departing the flock in disgust with the Republican Party , which could leave the GOP ever more dependent on the Christian right .

Finding a slim vector
Academic researchers have found an exploitable hole in a popular form of wireless networking encryption .
The hole is in a part of 802.11 i that forms the basis of WiFi Protected Access ( WPA ) , so it could affect routers worldwide .
German graduate student Erik Tews will present a paper at next week 's PacSec in Tokyo coauthored with fellow student and aircrack - ng team member Martin Beck that reveals how remnants of WPA 's predecessor allow them to slip a knife into a crack in the encryption scheme and send bogus data to an unsuspecting WiFi client .
In an interview from Germany , where he is a PhD candidate studying encryption at the Technical University of Darmstadt , Tews explained that an existing attack on Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) was modified to provide a slim vector for sending arbitrary data to networks that use the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP ) .
( Tews ' collaborator Beck is a student at the Technical University of Dresden ; Tews credits Beck with the discovery , after which they jointly developed the paper that Tews will present at PacSec . )
With the Tews / Beck method , an attacker sniffs a packet , makes minor modifications to affect the checksum , and checks the results by sending the packet back to the access point .
" It 's not a key recovery attack , " Tews said , " It just allows you to do the decryption of individual packets . "
This approach works only with short packets , but could allow ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol ) poisoning and possibly DNS ( Domain Name Service ) spoofing or poisoning .
The paper , Practical Attacks against WEP and WPA , is now available for download .
A history of encryption weakness
The 802.11b specification from the IEEE engineering standards group came with a basic encryption mechanism built in to assuage worries that data would simply be sent in the clear .
Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) had as its goal a simple baseline : be as secure as an Ethernet jack .
It quickly failed .
Cracks were seen in 2001 , and it was thoroughly broken as early as 2004 .
Some researchers claim to be able to recover a WEP key in under a minute from an active network .
( Most corporations relied on virtual private network connections , which were tunneled through access points located outside a strong firewall , to allow WiFi use without compromising the network . )
The 802.11i task group was formed to replace WEP with something stronger , and they came up with two separate solutions : one looking backwards , the other forwards .
Looking back , 802.11i encompassed all WiFi devices ever shipped — starting in 1999 — with TKIP .
TKIP could be retrofitted to work with older cards through firmware and driver updates .
The TKIP work was done first , and incorporated into a branded standard called WPA by the Wi-Fi Alliance , the organization that certifies WiFi gear for interoperability .
( You can make 802.11 devices til the cows come home , but you have to be a member of the trade group and pay testing fees — and pass the tests — to label a device with the WiFi moniker . )
WEP : not all that secure
The 802.11i group also added Advanced Encryption System ( AES ) support — the AES - 128 flavor — which uses , take a breath , the Counter Mode with CBC - MAC ( Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code ) Protocol or CCMP .
This flavor of AES both encrypts data and ensures its integrity .
The flaw discovered by Tews and Beck cannot work against AES .
When 802.11i started winding down , the Wi-Fi Alliance updated its WPA standard to WPA2 .
WPA includes a requirement for just TKIP encryption ; WPA2 requires support for both TKIP and AES .
Almost all gear shipped starting in late 2002 could be upgraded to work with AES — all 802.11g silicon was prepared knowing that AES was coming along — and the Wi-Fi Alliance added mandatory WPA2 support for WiFi certified devices starting in March 2006 .
The backwards - looking part of 802.11i is where the standard gets into trouble , according to Tews and Beck 's research .
By making the WPA algorithm compatible with hardware that could handle the broken WEP algorithm , the WiFi alliance left a tiny gap that the researchers could exploit .
Crack that WEP : chop , chop !
The flaw in TKIP has to do with checksums , which are used to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data .
Checksums work by taking a sequence of numbers that are to be transmitted , applying a transformation to produce a short result , and appending that result to the transmission .
For instance , an ISBN that starts with 978 is 13 digits long , 12 of which represent a unique book number .
The 13th is a base 10 number derived from alternately multiplying successive digits by 1 or 3 , adding the results , and taking the modulo of 10 .
If you type in an ISBN incorrectly , a system that recalculates the checksum can determine in many cases if digits are swapped or wrong digits are entered .
With wireless transmission , the odds of missing a bit or getting it wrong are relatively high , and checksums are used both to determine whether there was an error in reception and to ensure the integrity of a packet .
If the payload changes and the checksum does not , then a receiver can tell that the packet was tampered with .
This fell apart in WEP , because the checksum was so weak that techniques were developed to allow the data in a packet to be changed and a new checksum calculated .
Tews mentioned the tool chopchop , which allows individual packets to be decrypted without cracking a WEP key .
This program served as part of the wedge for the exploit .
A fragmentation attack
Chopchop works by " chopping " out one byte of data at a time and substituting different values for that byte while calculating a new potential checksum .
Chopchop sends each modified packet to an access point , and the AP rejects packets for which the decrypted checksum is invalid .
WEP does n't prevent endless testing in this manner — there 's no flood control or other protection .
TKIP added a second layer of integrity through Message Integrity Code ( MIC ) , nicknamed Michael .
Michael performs a better - designed checksum that 's also encrypted .
To prevent the simplicity of chopchop , a client will respond after it receives two bad Michael checksums within 60 seconds : the client shuts down for 60 seconds and then requests a new key exchange with the AP .
An AP , faced with the same situation , also shuts down for 60 seconds , then rekeys every client .
( 802.11 i allows new master keys to be created on demand without changing the starting passphrase or network key . )
Here 's where Tews said his colleague Beck got extremely clever : because both the WEP and TKIP mechanisms are used one after another , and because the Michael code is contained within the packet that 's checksummed by the weaker WEP method , an attempt to crack a packet can first use chopchop without triggering the Michael countermeasures .
President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off for the first time on Tuesday in what could be the most consequential debate of the 2020 ...

As punctuated by General Motors ’ second quarter ( 6/30/08 ) loss of $ 15.5 billion , General Motors is a company in financial distress .
In its attempt to survive the current economic milieu , management has been looking to throw excess weight overboard to keep the company afloat .
GM is trying to ditch its declining Hummer brand , and it has been rumored that Pontiac and Buick may be fire - sale material . [ 1 ]
The company has been offering massive rebates on its trucks , along with 72 - month , 0 % financing in an attempt to unload its weighty inventory .
In spite of this , along with sagging car sales , [ 2 ] a tightening credit market , junk - rated bonds , a doomed balance sheet , massive production cuts , [ 3 ] substantial layoffs , zooming gas prices , and eroding cash flow , Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy had maintained a u201 Cbuyu201D on GM with a target of $ 28 per share .
Let ’s step backwards a bit .
On June 25 , 2007 , Wall Street powerhouse Morgan Stanley put out a u201 Cbuyu201D recommendation with respect to General Motors ’ common stock .
Robert Barry , Morgan Stanley ’s star analyst , proclaimed a 52 - week target price of $ 42 per share .
Less than five months later , on November 7 , 2007 , Wall Street analysts were stunned by General Motors ’ staggering third - quarter ( 9/30/07 ) loss of $ 39 billion — one of the largest bookkeeping losses in history , which was mostly related to the writedown of deferred tax assets .
Fifty - three weeks after Morgan Stanley ’s buy recommendation , GM ’s stock hit a 54 - year low of $ 9.98 per share — on July 2 , 2008 , after Merrill Lynch ’s recommendation had gone from a u201 Cbuyu201D to u201Cunderperformu201D ( i.e. , sell ) on that day .
In one sweeping move overnight , Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy cut his target price on GM by a whopping 75 % , reducing the target price from $ 28 to $ 7 .
So how is it that GM suddenly went from respectability to mediocrity — in one analyst ’s mind — overnight ?
In fact , why did it take until July 2008 to concede that GM was on life support ?
Wall Street , belatedly , is willing to acknowledge the fact that General Motors is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy .
Accordingly , key questions come to the forefront .
How did any stock analyst , worth his salt , get blindsided by the aforementioned $ 38.3 billion writedown of deferred tax assets ?
Are Wall Street ’s Ivy League - educated MBAs able to comprehend advanced accounting and finance ?
Has rigorous security analysis , on Wall Street , been supplanted by self - serving cheerleading and inane platitudes with the objective of transferring wealth from the masses to the Wall Street elites ?
As Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd so eloquently stated in their classic 1934 book Security Analysis , u201CThe correct calculation of the asset values and their relationship to securities or creditors claims depends on the purposes of the analyst.u201D
Therefore , to answer the above - posed questions is simple .
Wall Street has little to do with disseminating competent securities analysis and advice to average u201 Cinvestors , u201D and has much to do with transferring wealth from Main Street to Wall Street — and , for the most powerful Wall Street brokerage houses , doing the bidding of the government ’s Plunge Protection Team .
For Wall Street analysts to claim u201Csurpriseu201D at GM ’s massive deferred tax asset writedown , during fiscal year 2007 , and to finally discuss ( in mid-2008 ) General Motors ’ financial condition in terms of a possible bankruptcy , indicate that low - level fluff is easily passed on to Main Street u201 Cinvestorsu201D under the guise of serious analysis .
At the very least , earnest auto industry analysts should have been sounding the negative - outlook alarm after General Motors published its December 31 , 2006 annual report — yet Wall Street was shouting u201Cbuy , buy , buy .
u201D
One must wonder , again , if any of Wall Street ’s analysts are even capable of reading a financial statement .
If the answer is affirmative , then honest analysts would have drawn the same conclusion as Eric Englund did in his July 9 , 2007 essay .
Here is an excerpt :
To analyze General Motors ’
12/31/06 FYE financial statement is to understand that this once great company is likely heading towards bankruptcy .
Here are the gruesome details :
GM ’s " as stated " net worth is negative $ 5.4 billion
$ 5.4 billion
By fully discounting intangible assets , which includes deferred tax assets , GM ’s net worth is arguably negative $ 48.5 billion ( refer to Note 13 of GM ’s 12/31/06 financial statement )
$ 48.5 billion ( refer to Note 13 of GM ’s 12/31/06 financial statement ) GM ’s as stated working capital is negative $ 3.7 billion
$ 3.7 billion
By fully discounting current deferred tax assets , GM ’s working capital drops to negative $ 14 billion
$ 14 billion General Motors ’ total liabilities amount to a staggering $ 190.4 billion
GM ’s net loss , in 2006 , was nearly $ 2 billion
With GM ’s September 30 , 2007 third - quarter writedown of $ 38.3 billion in deferred tax assets , GM ’s financial condition — at fiscal year - end December 31 , 2007 — validates Eric ’s above - shown analysis .
Accordingly , GM’s 12/31/07 as stated working capital and net worth positions stood at negative $ 10.2 billion and negative $ 37.1 billion , respectively .
Then , at March 31 , 2008 ( GM ’s most recent filing ) , the company ’s financials reveal a negative net worth of $ 41 billion .
To compound this company ’s downward spiral , with the latest quarterly loss of $ 15.5 billion , GM ’s net worth arguably stands at negative $ 56.5 billion .
These are the financial indices of a company on the verge of bankruptcy .
To put things into perspective , GM ’s market capitalization stands at under $ 7.5 billion , which is among the lowest of the 30 firms in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
On the surface , it appears that Graham and Dodd ’s invaluable book Security Analysis is unfamiliar to most securities analysts .
If a financial analyst understood the nature of a deferred tax asset , and that such an asset is properly deemed an u201 Cintangible u201D asset , then the course of action to take is quite elementary .
As Graham and Dodd stated , u201CIt is customary to eliminate intangibles in the computation of the net asset value , or equity , per share of common stock .
u201D
In the case of General Motors , a competent analyst would not have been surprised by the massive writedown of deferred tax assets .
After all , such an analyst would have already fully discounted the intangibles in order to derive a conservative financial condition .
The fact that General Motors eventually wrote down these intangible assets merely reflects the financial picture that a principled financial analyst previously would have drawn .
The point here is that GM is so unprofitable that its top - level management realized they had to come clean and write down the value of its deferred tax assets because it became completely unpredictable as to when the company would actually return to making a profit , and thus use that tax asset against any future tax liability it incurs .
Essentially , GM is uncertain about its ability to generate profits in the near future , and correspondingly , its use of its tax shield is in doubt .
According to accounting rules , GM must recognize the impairment of the tax asset , hence the write - off .
This is a huge indicator of management ’s pessimism about the coming years .
GM , in writing down its tax assets as it did , made a negative judgment about the uncertainty of future economic events and their outcome .
In view of that , this is a company heading toward bankruptcy , and executive management is fully aware of how close they are to being unable to prolong the dog - and - pony show .
So , just how savvy are some of Wall Street ’s best and brightest analysts ?
Nine days before GM ’s deferred tax asset writedown bombshell , UBS upgraded its rating of GM to a u201 Cbuy .
u201D
On September 13 , 2007 , Citigroup initiated coverage and issued a buy recommendation .
Other Wall Street heavyweights , in 2007 , that had weighed in with u201Cupgraded u201D opinions of GM included Banc of America Securities , Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan , Lehman Brothers , and Deutsche Securities .
One must heed Graham and Dodd ’s words as to what purpose is behind a securities analyst ’s recommendation .
But then again , Wall Street analysts long ago abandoned their roles of providing independent expertise , and instead turned to selling their firm ’s investment banking services .
Mark Reutter writes :
Stock analysts have long been fixtures at investment banks that both broker ( that is , sell ) stocks and bonds to the public and underwrite new security issues for companies .
With deregulation of brokerage commissions in 1975 , which ended the practice of fixed - rate minimum commissions , investment banks found their brokerage business drying up , undercut by Charles Schwab & Co. and other discount brokerages .
Trading fees plummeted and analyst reports no longer paid for themselves .
As a result , the role of the analyst shifted from providing relatively impartial information for brokers and their clients to boosterish tie-ins with corporate clients , such as using the research reports to hype a company ’s prospects and promoting initial public offerings ( IPOs ) on investor " road shows . "
So now , with the two services — investment banking and stock analysis — conveniently commingled , and thus creating a huge conflict of interest , a dealmaker ’s sales literature is passed off as serious and useful analysis of the financial markets , leading Main Street investors — who tend to follow these recommendations — seriously astray .
Also ignored by Wall Street analysts was the banking community ’s loss of confidence in General Motors .
A strong indicator as to how nervous GM ’s bankers were , pertaining to this automaker ’s viability , emerged when General Motors ’ banking syndicate amended GM ’s line of credit on July 20 , 2006 .
This borrowing facility went from a $ 5.6 billion unsecured line of credit down to a $ 4.6 billion line of credit , of which $ 4.48 billion was secured .
This 97 % - secured bank line had a termination date of 2011 .
This arrangement was described as being a " positive action toward additional financial flexibility . "
Positive for whom ?
This meant that the holders of the new loans , which were secured by collateral , had priority over GM ’s unsecured bonds .
A default on the loans before the bonds are paid off would mean that bondholders would be left high and dry .
This caused another credit - rating cut to GM ’s bonds , which were already junk .
As of March 31 , 2008 , GM ’s borrowing facility remained substantially the same .
Nonetheless , this still begs the question as to whether or not Wall Street analysts read 10 - Qs anymore ?
But the agony does not end there .
Adding to GM ’s plentiful wounds , S&P announced that effective after the close of trading on July 17 , 2008 , General Motors would be dropped from its flagship S&P 100 index .
A vital component of the Index of Leading Indicators , there has been no comment from S&P as to why the purge occurred .
Though a drop from the S&P is not unique , in an historical sense , the most important index of large - cap US stocks must not see an enduring future for General Motors .
In addition to that news , market participants have little confidence in General Motors .
The credit derivatives market has priced in a 75 % probability that GM will default on its loans within the next five years , and a 25 % chance that it will default within one year .
Perhaps the next buzzword that journalists and Wall Street prophets of profit will swoon over will be " going concern . "
In financial accounting , " going concern " means that a company must be financially sound enough to continue operating as a business entity .
A company ’s value , as conveyed by its balance sheet , must reflect the value of the company in the long - term ( beyond one year ) .
Management has a duty to act on the principles of going concern when preparing financial statements .
They must assess whether or not there are any material items that create uncertainty about an entity ’s ability to continue as a going concern for and beyond the foreseeable future .
Material items that bring forth doubt about an entity ’s viability must be disclosed in the financial statements .
A company facing bankruptcy due to financial items that give rise to material uncertainties is not a going concern .
Auditors who form an opinion on financial statements are not required to devise and conduct specific audit procedures to validate the going concern assumption .
However , they are required to evaluate conditions and events that indicate the potential for going - concern problems .
In 2001 , when 257 publicly - traded companies went bankrupt , a survey of 202 of these companies revealed that only 48 % of them had audit reports that included the auditor ’s explanatory paragraph expressing doubts about the company being a " going concern . "
This must be considered a mammoth failure for the audit - accounting industry as a whole .
Considering all the significant factors driving GM ’s financial deterioration , the buzz on the Internet contains occasional references about whether or not a u201 Cgoing concernu201D qualification should or will be issued to General Motors .
Certainly , that is highly unlikely , since no public accounting firm is likely to accelerate the downfall of its premier client . [ 4 ]
Considering GM ’s shrinking profit margins , mounting debt load , and onerous legacy obligations , [ 5 ] there is not enough cash from operations [ 6 ] to pay the rising cost of its debt expense or invest in future operations .
Thus we have continued to write about General Motors and the fact that it operates on the verge of insolvency .
The trend for GM has been the build - up of negative equity , negative working capital , insurmountable losses , and previously , its only profits were coming from its finance arm until it sold a majority stake in GMAC .
In a world of $ 4 + gasoline , GM is now caught with an impractical product mix dominated by pickup trucks and SUVs .
A well - capitalized automaker could see its way through these difficult economic conditions and take the appropriate time and steps to develop a more suitable lineup of automobiles .
However , General Motors ’ fragile balance sheet will not see this automaker through to better times .
GM will have to declare bankruptcy and Wall Street , as usual , will absolve itself of such a self - serving clustering of buy recommendations pertaining to General Motors ’ common stock .
You can be certain that the big brokerage houses were offloading their own GM stock ( and for those well - connected clients ) to the poor saps on Main Street who trusted Wall Street ’s analysts .
And thus the deception and the wealth transfer continue .

Advertisement India has successfully launched its first mission to the Moon .
The unmanned Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft blasted off smoothly from a launch pad in southern Andhra Pradesh to embark on a two - year mission of exploration .
The robotic probe will orbit the Moon , compiling a 3 - D atlas of the lunar surface and mapping the distribution of elements and minerals .
The launch is regarded as a major step for India as it seeks to keep pace with other space - faring nations in Asia .
Indian PM Manmohan
Singh hailed the launch as the " first step " in a historic milestone in the country 's space programme .
People on the streets give their reaction to India 's moon mission .
In pictures
" Our scientific community has once again done the country proud and the entire nation salutes them , " Mr Singh said in a message .
The launch was greeted with applause by scientists gathered at the site .
The chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) , Madhavan Nair , said it was a " historic moment " for the country .
" Today what we have charted is a remarkable journey for an Indian spacecraft to go to the moon and try to unravel the mysteries of the Earth 's closest celestial body and its only natural satellite , " Mr Nair said .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says there has been a lot of excitement about the event , which was broadcast live on national TV .
Competitive mission
An Indian - built launcher carrying the one - and - a - half - tonne satellite blasted off from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota , an island off the coast of Andhra Pradesh , at about 0620 local time ( 0050 GMT ) .

This is a commendable achievement that every Indian should be proud of Suresh , Bangalore , India
One key objective will be to search for surface or sub - surface water - ice on the Moon , especially at the poles .
Another will be to detect Helium 3 , an isotope which is rare on Earth , but is sought to power nuclear fusion and could be a valuable source of energy in future .
Powered by a single solar panel generating about 700 Watts , the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) probe carries five Indian - built instruments and six constructed in other countries , including the US , Britain and Germany .
The mission is expected to cost 3.8 bn rupees ( £ 45 m ; $ 78 m ) , considerably less than Japanese and Chinese probes sent to the Moon last year .
The Indian experiments include a 30kg probe that will be released from the mothership to slam into the lunar surface .
The Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) will record video footage on the way down and measure the composition of the Moon 's tenuous atmosphere .
CHANDRAYAAN 1 1 - Chandrayaan Energetic Neutral Analyzer ( CENA ) 2 - Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) 3 - Radiation Dose Monitor ( RADOM ) 4 - Terrain Mapping Camera ( TMC ) 5 - Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) 6 - Chandrayaan 1 X-ray Spectrometer ( C1XS ) 7 - Solar Panel

It will also drop the Indian flag on the surface of the Moon .
The country 's tricolour is painted on the side of the probe and , if successful , India will become the fourth country after the US , Russia and Japan to place its national flag on the lunar surface .
Professor David Southwood , director of science and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency congratulated India 's space agency on the launch .
He added : " While the exploration of space calls for new challenges to be overcome , joining forces is becoming more and more a key to future successes . "
Barry Kellett , project scientist on the C1XS instrument , which was built at the Rutherford - Appleton Laboratory in the UK , said : " Chandrayaan has a very competitive set of instruments ... it will certainly do good science . "
C1XS will map the abundance of different elements in the lunar crust to help answer key questions about the origin and evolution of Earth 's only natural satellite .
Researchers say the relative abundances of magnesium and iron in lunar rocks could help confirm whether the Moon was covered by a molten , magma ocean early on in its history .
" The iron should have sunk [ in the magma ocean ] , whereas the magnesium should have floated , " Mr Kellett told BBC News .
" The ratio of magnesium to iron for the whole Moon tells you to what extent the Moon melted and what it did after it formed . "
The instrument will look for more unusual elements on the Moon 's surface , such as titanium .
This metallic element has been found in lunar meteorites , but scientists know little about its distribution in the lunar crust .
Chandrayaan ( the Sanskrit word for " moon craft " ) will also investigate the differences between the Moon 's near side and its far side .
The far side is both more heavily cratered and different in composition to the one facing Earth .
The spacecraft will take about eight days the reach the Moon .
During its lunar encounter , Chandrayaan fires its engine to slow its velocity - allowing it to be captured by the Moon 's gravity .

More from Today programme Chandrayaan will then slip into a near - circular orbit at an altitude of 1,000 km .
After a number of health checks , the probe will drop its altitude until it is orbiting just 100 km above the lunar surface .
India , China , Japan and South Korea all have eyes on a share of the commercial satellite launch business and see their space programmes as an important symbol of international stature and economic development .
Last month , China became only the third country in the world to independently carry out a spacewalk .
But the Indian government 's space efforts have not been welcomed by all .
Some critics regard the space programme as a waste of resources in a country where millions still lack basic services .

Women who have exceeded previous caffeine guidelines " should not panic " Pregnant women should cut their caffeine intake and drink no more than two cups of coffee or four cups of tea a day , a government agency has advised .
The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) has lowered its recommended levels of the stimulant from a maximum of 300 mg a day to 200 mg - a reduction of a third .
It follows research by Leicester and Leeds universities linking caffeine to babies born with low birth weight .
The study will be published in the British Medical Journal this week .
Children born with a low birth weight are more likely to suffer health problems like heart disease and diabetes .
I want to reassure women that if you 're pregnant and have been following the previous advice , the risk is likely to be small
Andrew Wadge
FSA chief scientist
The advice means women should stick to a maximum of two average - sized cups of coffee per day - although those who have been drinking three cups have been told not to panic .
The FSA 's chief scientist Andrew Wadge said : " This is new advice but these are not new risks .
" I want to reassure women that if you 're pregnant and have been following the previous advice , the risk is likely to be small . "
The FSA guidance means women should limit themselves to three or four cups of tea a day and watch their intake of cola , chocolate and energy drinks .
Drinks bought from coffee shops may be far higher than the FSA estimates for the average - sized home - made cup .
The university study which prompted the revised guidance involved 2,500 pregnant women .
The new guidance follows another study suggesting drinking alcohol lightly during pregnancy cut the risk of problem behaviour and hyperactivity in boys .
The University College London report found boys born to light drinkers did better on vocabulary tests than those born to mothers who abstained completely during pregnancy .
Current medical advice is that women should avoid alcohol while pregnant or trying to conceive .
The British Coffee Association said it would be revising its guidance to healthcare professionals and consumers in line with these recommendations with immediate effect .

Harsh GOP robo - call hits Ayers
A harsh new robocall ( above ) — at least the third in a series — attacks Obama for having " worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers " whose group " killed Americans . "
Robocalls are a relatively inexpensive way to deliver a negative message , and used to be seen as an under - the - radar way to do it , though that 's no longer really true .
The ad comes just hours after McCain dismissed the issue : " I do n't care about an old , washed - up terrorist , " he said .
The script :
Hello .
I 'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers , whose organization bombed the U.S. capitol , the Pentagon , a judge 's home and killed Americans .
And Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington .
Barack Obama and his Democratic allies lack the judgment to lead our country .
This call was paid for by McCain - Palin 2008 and the Republican National Committee at 202-863-8500 .
I spoke to women who got the call in Wisconsin and New Mexico , and a Democratic official said they 'd also had reports of it in Northern Virginia , Maine , Florida , Missouri , and North Carolina .
Other readers report getting the call in Ohio and Indiana .
Shaun Dakin has a report from Pennsylvania .
Greg Sargent has reported on two earlier calls .
Bank lending in the second quarter saw its sharpest fall since 2001
International lending by banks fell by $ 1.1 trillion ( £ 613 bn ; 780bn euros ) , or 3 % , in the second quarter of 2008 , an international banking body has said .
It marks the sharpest quarterly drop since records began in 1977 , the provisional Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) data showed .
Lending to the US and the UK slowed markedly during the three months .
The figures covers all lending , including money lent between banks , as well as for individuals .
Banks have been increasingly reluctant about lending to each other , after reporting rising levels of bad debt .
With finance firms nervous about lending to each other , it has caused credit markets to seize up , making it far harder for both businesses and individuals to gain access to loans .
In the first quarter of the year , lending between banks ' offices in different countries had " sustained " international banking activity , BIS said .
While banks reduced how they much they lent in the second quarter , the amount withdrawn by customers increased .
Banks ' cross - border liabilities fell by $ 1 trillion , largely because of withdrawals made mostly by residents based in the US , UK and Switzerland .
Final figures for the quarter are set to be published on 8 December .
Exactly who is that mysterious figure in a garish waistcoat , in the Doctor Who Christmas special , " The Next Doctor " ?
Is the episode 's title just plain misleading , a huge hint , or a clever trick ?
Some new promo pics have come out , and they raise an interesting possibility .
Potentially huge spoilers ahead .

Just what is that pocket watch the two Doctors ( David Tennant and David Morrissey ) are looking at ?
Is it a special pocket watch ?
Fansite Whovian Galaxy says it might be , but Planet Gallifrey has blown up the picture to maximum magnification and does n't see any Time Lord -y markings .
( For what it 's worth , Planet Gallifrey 's blown - up pic is so blurry , I can't see one way or the other . )
Of course , all we know about Morrissey 's character is that he 's a brash man who claims to be a Time Lord named the Doctor .
So how exactly would that square with him being a Time Lord who 's turned himself into a human ?
( Maybe he lost most of his Time Lord memories , but got confused by the ones that remained ?
Maybe he 's a different Time Lord who 's stuck as a human , and now thinks he 's the Doctor ?
Could he be .... Romana ? )
For what it 's worth , I think the watch is a red herring .
But you never know .

Before the U.S. House of Representatives , November 21 , 1979
Although I was not in Congress when either the Lockheed or the New York City bailouts were enacted , I would have opposed both of those actions , as well as the proposed action regarding Chrysler , for many of the same reasons .
Let me explain those reasons .
In a nation that is sinking in a sea of debt , it is irresponsible for this Congress to be considering a measure that would add billions to that debt .
The expansion of credit is one of the primary forms of inflation .
It is not merely inflationary in its effects ; it is inflation itself .
If this $ 1.5 billion is created by the federal government , it will ripple and percolate through our banking system , and because of our fractional reserve system , the ultimate growth in the money supply will be far more than $ 1.5 billion .
The standard multiplier is six ; that means an infusion of $ 1.5 billion will eventually result in a $ 9 billion increase in the money supply .
In his testimony before the House Banking Committee , the former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , Alan Greenspan , stated that
Loan guarantees , insofar as the issue of inflation is concerned , are virtually indistinguishable from on - budget financing , and that the major cause of inflation into this country has been an excessive amount of credit preemption , largely in the area of guarantees , which . . . has created excessive monetary growth and is the base of inflation in the system .
A vote for the Chrysler bailout is , simply put , a vote for further inflation .
Some may argue that the inflation is necessary in order to avoid unemployment , echoing the now repudiated idea of A.W. Phillips , that less inflation means more unemployment and vice versa .
The past few years of our experience with inflation and unemployment should convince everyone that high inflation and high unemployment can exist side - by - side .
I believe the connection is even closer : Inflation causes unemployment — perhaps not immediately , but in the longer run — and we are now in the longer run of our past inflationary policies .
It follows that a vote for aid to Chrysler , because it is a vote for inflation , is also a vote for more unemployment .
Such unemployment may not be obvious , but it will nonetheless be real .
One of the things that bothers me most about this entire discussion is that it centers around only what is obvious .
Saving 100,000 jobs at Chrysler is obvious ; losing 100,000 jobs , one by one around the country is not obvious , but they will nonetheless be lost , should aid to Chrysler pass .
Let me explain why I believe this to be so .
If this aid takes the form of loan guarantees rather than direct loans ( and , I add parenthetically , that over $ 1 billion of the New York City loan guarantees has been converted into direct federal loans by the Federal Financing Bank ) it will be tantamount to an allocation of credit to Chrysler .
That means that Chrysler will get capital that would have gone to other more efficient and more profitable businesses .
Because this capital will be diverted by these loan guarantees to a less efficient business , it is highly probable that more jobs will be lost through invisible unemployment than would be were Chrysler to fail .
I hasten to point out that this will result in all the increased costs to the government that the proponents of the bailout so loudly declare they wish to avoid .
Of course , the costs will not all be centered in Michigan ; unemployment checks , welfare checks , food stamp benefits will increase nationwide , in big and small towns , urban centers and rural America .
Rather than a few localities suffering noticeably ; many will suffer almost invisibly .
Workers who have nothing to do with Chrysler will lose their jobs or pay the taxes and higher prices caused by this bailout .
The average industrial worker earns half of what the average Chrysler workers earns , and under the UAW contract , the Chrysler workers will be receiving a $ 500 million pay and benefits rise over the next three years .
I have always thought that businesses in trouble cut costs ; the Chrysler workers will receive far more in wage increases alone over the next ten years than this bailout amounts to .
That ( and other facts ) would indicate to me that the Chrysler workers have not made any sacrifices and that they hope , through federal aid , to maintain their relatively high wages at the expense of the lower - paid workers in this country .
We are being asked to shift the burden from the relatively well - off workers at Chrysler to the relatively worse - off workers throughout America .
A Chrysler bailout will be a shifting of burdens that should be borne by those involved .
Do we in Congress have the authority , either moral or constitutional , to cause this suffering ?
I can find no provision in the Constitution authorizing Congress to make loans or loan guarantees to anyone , let alone to major corporations .
Nor have I yet seen a valid moral argument concluding that we , as representatives of all the people , have the right to tax the American people — most of whom receive less in wages and benefits than Chrysler workers — to support a multibillion - dollar corporation .
What right have we — and I pose a serious question that deserves an answer — what right have we to force the American taxpayers to risk their money in a business venture which private investors dealing in their own funds have judged to be too risky ?
Chrysler paper is now classified ; that means that any private investor who is handling funds for his depositors , shareholders , or clients may be judged as violating his fiduciary responsibilities should he invest in Chrysler .
Do n’t we have a trust equally important from the American people ?
Are we not betraying their trust by voting for a Chrysler bailout ?
I believe so .
Rather than supporting this patchwork and temporary " solution , " we should be addressing those factors , over which we have control and for which we are responsible , that have brought Chrysler to the brink of bankruptcy .
In his testimony before the House Banking Committee , President Iacocca listed three factors that caused the troubles at Chrysler : ( 1 ) government regulations ; ( 2 ) inflation ; and ( 3 ) the gasoline allocation system that caused last spring ’s gasoline shortages .
Please note that all three factors are the responsibility of the Congress .
We wrote the regulations or gave some bureaucrats a blank check to write the regulations .
We are responsible for inflation through our mismanagement of the monetary system .
And we empowered the Department of Energy to create a gasoline allocation system that brilliantly achieved what I had heretofore thought impossible : gasoline shortages in Houston , the oil capital of the United States .
It is our responsibility to diagnose the Chrysler disease accurately .
Instead , we are acting like political quacks , prescribing potions to treat symptoms , while the cause of those symptoms rages on unabated .
Chrysler is not unique ; it is merely the prototype , the harbinger , of crises to come .
Dr. Greenspan testified that the most likely sequence of events , in his view , would be federal loan guarantees followed by a Chrysler failure anyway .
Unless the disease is correctly diagnosed , the potions we prescribe will kill the patient .
I would urge this Committee and the whole Senate to act with more deliberation than the House has acted .
This form of welfare for corporations must end .
Just because it was extended to Lockheed does not mean that it should be extended to Chrysler .
Bad precedents should not be followed , and these precedents are particularly bad .
Because Lockheed , a large corporation , New York City , the largest city , and now Chrysler , the tenth largest corporation in the country , are the three institutions to which aid has been or will be extended , one can conclude that there is an obvious pattern of discrimination in the action of this Congress .
Last year there were 200,000 bankruptcies in this country , according to U.S. News & World Report .
Yet we have selected only the largest for our aid .
This is discrimination of the crassest sort .
We ignore the smaller victims of this government ’s policies simply because they are small .
Only the largest , those with the most clout , the most pull , get our attention .
This aristocracy of pull is morally indefensible .
What answer can be given to the small businessman driven into bankruptcy by government regulations when he asks : " You bailed out Chrysler , why not me ? "
No justification can be given for this discrimination between the powerful and the powerless , the big and the small .
It is an axiom of our legal system that all citizens are to enjoy the equal protection of the laws .
That axiom is violated daily by our tax laws , and now by this proposed corporate welfare plan for Chrysler .
Apparently some citizens are more equal than others .
That is a notion I reject , and I hope you do , too .
I urge you to reject this proposal for all the reasons I have stated .

With the economy collapsing and the ranks of the unemployed growing , the last thing this country needs is a shortage of cheap entertainment .
Perhaps that 's why the Senate , unable to agree on plans for another economic stimulus package or a bailout for U.S. automakers , managed to approve a bill that would help consumers keep their televisions on after local stations turn off their analog channels on Feb. 17 , 2009 .
When those transmissions end , consumers who rely on over - the - air TV and do n't have a digital tuner or converter box will be left with nothing but a blank screen .
A trial run of the cutoff in Wilmington , N.C. , in September went about as well as possible , yet numerous viewers were still caught unprepared .
With 10 million or more consumers across the country relying on rabbit ears , chances are that thousands wo n't be ready for the shift even if the vast majority of Americans know it 's coming .
That 's why the Senate gave speedy passage to S 3663 , by Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) .
The bill , like a more prescriptive measure awaiting action in the House ( HR 7013 , by Santa Barbara Democrat Lois Capps ) , calls for the Federal Communications Commission to let stations temporarily continue broadcasting on their analog channels .
The broadcasts would be limited to emergency messages and instructions for how to get help making the switch to digital , including a phone number to call and an URL to visit .
The measure makes sense , but it would n't address what 's likely to be the biggest problem for the transition to digital .
As the Wilmington experience demonstrated , a non-trivial percentage of TV viewers simply can't take all the steps needed to prepare an analog TV for digital broadcasts .
( The easiest solution is to hook your TV up to cable or satellite service , but if you do n't already have pay TV , that 's an expensive way to go . )
These folks might be able to buy a converter box , but they need help from family members , friends or volunteers to hook it up , program the remote and scan for digital signals .
It 's not rocket science , but it 's not as easy as plugging a toaster into the wall and turning it on , either .
That 's why local governments and community groups need to start lining up volunteers now to help the elderly , the disabled and -- yes -- the clueless buy and hook up their digital converter boxes before their free TV gets lost in the digital transition .

The Daily Show's Jon Stewart tried to warn him in 2006 , but John McCain did n't listen .
Battered by all sides over his embrace of End Times Pastor John Hagee , John McCain is finally experiencing the blowback from his pandering visits to " crazy base world . "
Two years before he shared a San Antonio stage with John Hagee , John McCain in the spring of 2006 sought to jump - start his GOP presidential bid by repairing his frayed relationship with the religious right .
On April 2 , 2006 , McCain appeared on Meet the Press and retracted his famous 2000 claim that the late Reverend Jerry Falwell was an " agent of intolerance . "
On May 13 , 2006 , McCain delivered the commencement address at Falwell 's Libery University .
There , the two men walked on stage together , where Falwell then praised his former foe , " the ilk of John McCain is very scarce , very small . "
But weeks before McCain journeyed to Lynchburg , Virginia to deliver that speech , he traveled to New York to appear on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
There , Stewart jokingly warned McCain about the risks in pandering to evangelical GOP voters through his looming rapprochement with Falwell :
STEWART : You 're killin' me here .
I feel like it's a condoning of Falwell 's kind of crazymaking to some extent to have you go down there , and it strikes me as something you would n't normally do .
Am I wrong about that ?
MCCAIN : Jon , I 've spoken at a lot of schools , I 've spoken to schools whose specific policies I may disagree with - Ivy League schools do n't allow military recruiters , I do n't agree with that .
I 'm going there to speak to the students at his invitation , and I can assure you that the message will be the same that I give everywhere .
STEWART : You do n't think that it helps to sort of reassert Falwell as the voice for a certain group of people , say evangelicals or the Christian Right ?
Is n't it the kind of thing that maybe if you do n't go there , it helps to keep marginalizing guys like that , or do I misunderstand politics ?
No ?
Maybe I misunderstand things .
MCCAIN : Jon , I try to , as I said -- STEWART :
Why do I feel like I 'm about to get grounded ?
MCCAIN : Listen , I love coming on your show .
Young people all over America watch it .
I love to travel around the country and speak at colleges and universities .
Look - they 're all parts of the Republican Party .
I respect them ; I may disagree , and I 'm sure that I 've had disagreements with them .
I 'm not going to change - STEWART : You 're not freaking out on us ?
Are you freaking out on us ?
Because if you 're freaking out and you 're going into the crazy base world - are you going into crazy base world ?
MCCAIN : I 'm afraid so .
STEWART : All right , sir .
You know we have great regard for you here , and I hope you know what you 're doing there , I trust that you do .
When you see Falwell , do you feel nervous , do you have vomit in the back of your throat - what does it feel like ?
MCCAIN : No , but I 'll give him your love .
( The video of the exchange is available here . )
Fast forward two years and John McCain no doubt is feeling the bile rising .
Under attack for embracing Hagee , an anti-Semitic , anti-Catholic advocate of accelerating the Second Coming of Christ by triggering Armageddon in a death struggle with Iran , John McCain today could offer only the Sgt. Schultz defense .
McCain played dumb regarding the most recent statements about the divinely mandated role of Adolf Hitler from Hagee , a man whose endorsement he aggressively sought , " I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee 's endorsement , and I feel I must reject his endorsement . "
As Jon Stewart warned him , this is what happens when John McCain goes to crazy base world .

DUNN , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama raised more than $ 150 million for his campaign in September , breaking the record he set the previous month , his campaign said on Sunday .

Obama ’s prodigious fundraising has been a key in the race against Republican John McCain , allowing Obama to blanket the air waves with advertisements in the run-up to the November 4 election .
The Obama campaign said it had 632,000 new donors in September to bring its total to 3.1 million .
It said the average donation for the month was less than $ 100 .
With over $ 150 million in September , Obama more than doubled the $ 66 million he brought in for August , which had been a record .
Unlike McCain , Obama , an Illinois senator , chose not to accept public funding for his campaign , freeing him to raise millions privately .
Obama ’s campaign has purchased a half - hour television slot at prime - time on October 29 , six days before the election , to make a closing argument to the American people .
McCain , because he accepted public financing , is limited to spending $ 84 million in his campaign .
The Arizona senator again chided Obama for not living up to his pledge to accept public funds and warned of the damages of unlimited spending .
“ I ’m saying that history shows us where unlimited amounts of money are in political campaigns , it leads to scandal , ” he said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
When asked whether Obama was buying the election as his campaign spokesman claimed , McCain said , “ I think you could make that argument . ”
Obama , who was in North Carolina on Sunday to appear at a “ Change We Need ” rally , has shattered all records for campaign fundraising , in part due to his Internet presence .
Big donors also have been an important source of cash for his campaign .
Last week , he spoke at a large fundraiser in New York that featured performances by rock legends Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel .
Obama raked in $ 9 million last month at a pair of glitzy Hollywood fundraisers for him and the Democratic Party , including one where singer - actress Barbra Streisand performed .
David Broder , who has always had a soft spot for John McCain , writing in tomorrow ’s Washington Post .
Shorter Broder : Fork him .
This week , those voters are part of a mass movement to Obama , driven by much greater familiarity with the Illinois senator ’s views and by a pronounced distaste for McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin .
The striking shift in Montgomery County , often a bellwether , makes McCain ’s task of recapturing Pennsylvania from the Democrats look almost like Mission Impossible .
Robert Stutz , a recently retired hospital administrator , was , like many of his neighbors , skeptical of both the eventual nominees when they were on the primary ballot , “ so I was mostly listening to Hillary at that point . ”
But he ’s been impressed with Obama ’s health - care plan and says that McCain virtually disqualified himself with his vice presidential choice .
“ I ca n’t imagine putting Sarah Palin in a position to be president of the United States , ” he said … .
Ann Marie Cutler , another Clinton primary voter , admits that she still has “ some doubts about Obama in terms of experience , ” but she is reassured by the fact that “ he ’s very bright . ”
She watched the vice presidential debate and was “ sorely disappointed ” with Palin .
She “ drops her g’s constantly , ” Cutler said .
Said Marjorie Lukens , a registered Republican : “ The thought of Sarah Palin being a heartbeat away is terrifying . ”
…. She likes McCain as a person , but “ I ca n’t understand why he keeps talking about this Ayers guy ” — William Ayers , the 1960s radical who became an occasional colleague and supporter of Obama in Chicago .
“ He should be focusing on the economy and real terrorists ; that ’s what people worry about , ” she said … .
It ’s hard to see how John McCain can overcome these odds in Pennsylvania .
It is a realisation that may be dawning at last : the importance of the little things that rule the world .
The great American biologist , E O Wilson , said insects were world - rulers , but although they play a central role in maintaining ecosystems and the whole web of life , most insects have long been viewed with distaste or even revulsion as creepie - crawlies ( apart from butterflies , which have been viewed as something akin to honorary mini-birds ) .
But the recent alarms in Britain , Europe and America about the fate of the honey bee – colonies have been crashing in increasing numbers – have started to open people 's eyes to insects ' importance in a more general way , says Matt Shardlow , director of Buglife , the Invertebrate Conservation Trust .
But it is only the beginning of an understanding , he says , and much more is needed if we are to take the action necessary to preserve our populations of insects and other invertebrates , the creatures without backbones which make up the majority of animal life , including snails , worms and spiders ( spiders being arachnids , not insects ) .

The population declines among invertebrates in general and insects in particular are now greater than among any other group of living things , greater than declines in mammals , birds and plants .
Yet although people get excited about endangered pandas , or eagles , or orchids , endangered insects generally remain below the level of their perception , Mr Shardlow says .
" There was a book published in the early 1990s called Insect Conservation , a Neglected Green Issue , and it remains the case that levels of awareness of what 's happening with the small things , such as insects , are much lower than with what 's happening with big things , such as trees , or birds , or whales , " he says .
" The bigger you are , the bigger the bit of wildlife , the greater the chance that people will be paying attention to what 's happening to you .
" There are more extinctions among invertebrates than in any other groups , and a greater proportion of the species are in decline , and the decline is steeper , than in plants , birds and mammals , wherever there is data . "
There is clear evidence of the sharp decline in Britain 's insects , one being the disappearance of the " moth snowstorm " .
Anyone over 40 will probably remember that during a car journey at night in midsummer , the moths in the headlights were so numerous that they looked like snow , and the windscreen would become so coated with colliding moths that by the end of the journey it would have to be washed .
Not any more .
Moth snowstorms are today moth showers , if that : the phenomenon has all but disappeared , and this is robustly backed up by the figures .
Two - thirds of Britain 's individual moth species have declined in the past 40 years , some by enormous amounts , and moths as a whole have lost about a third of their abundance in that period .
We know this because , since 1968 the agricultural research station at Rothamsted in Hertfordshire has maintained a substantial network of moth traps around the country ( at about 80 sites ) to which the insects are attracted at night by a light - bulb .
Types and numbers caught are carefully noted , and with long - term records for no fewer than 337 species of larger moths over four decades , this is one of the biggest sets of animal population data in the world .
Analysis in 2003 showed more than 200 species had declined , and nearly 70 by more than 50 per cent .
Species once well - known and abundant were tumbling : the magpie moth had declined by 69 per cent , the cinnabar moth by 83 per cent and the strikingly handsome garden tiger moth by no less than 89 per cent .
Yet it is the same story with butterflies .
Thanks to another impeccably - kept set of long - term data , from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme run by the charity Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology , we know that seven out of 10 of Britain 's 58 species have declined in the past 30 years , some by amounts so large they are on the road to extinction .
Widespread and formerly common species such as the grayling and the wall brown have dropped in numbers by 40 per cent and more , vanishing from large areas , while others have suffered catastrophic losses .
The duke of burgundy has fallen by 52 per cent , the pearl - bordered fritillary by 61 per cent , the wood white by 65 per cent and the high brown fritillary , Britain 's most endangered butterly , by 79 per cent .
Now there is another concern for an insect which a generation ago was the most familiar " pretty " butterfly , the small tortoiseshell .
Hit hard by a parasitic fly which has come in from southern Europe , its population across Britain has dropped by 52 per cent since 1990 , but in the South - east it has gone down by no less than 82 per cent over the period .
These declines are parallelled in bumblebees .
Of the 25 species traditionally native to Britain , three have gone extinct , the apple bumblebee , Cullum 's bumblebee and most recently , the short - haired bumblebee , and four more are designated " UK Biodiversity Action Plan species " in recognition of their precarious situation , the great yellow bumblebee , the brown - banded carder bee , the shrill carder bee and the ruderal bumblebee .
Several more species , such as the bilberry bumblebee and the moss carder bee , have undergone major population contractions .
There is simply no accurate population trend data for many other groups of insects but there are ominous signs that they too are plunging .
Mayflies , the river flies on which flyfishermen base their artificial imitations , appear to have dropped in abundance by about two - thirds in the past 50 years , a widespread survey of fishermen in 2000 showed .
Britain's 46 species of ladybirds may now be widely at risk from an Asian invader , the harlequin ladybird , which arrived in Britain in 2004 , and not only outcompetes other ladybirds for food , but eats them directly .
As for beetles , there may be more than 4,000 species in Britain , but an indication of their decline is the fact that at least 250 of them have not been seen since 1970 .
Buglife revealed this two years ago , judging that some were merely hard to find , but others were rapidly heading for extinction .
Four vividly - named species which are on the Government 's Biodiversity Action Plan priority list have already disappeared : the Pashford pot beetle , the four - signed ground beetle , the Sussex diving beetle and the familiar sunshiner .
" A very severe problem is that many invertebrates are highly specialised in what they require , " Matt Shardlow says .
" They can't just live anywhere , they need a specific habitat feature , and often these habitat features are now highly fragmented and isolated , such as fenlands , or ancient woodland .
" Take dead wood ; the decayed stumps and fallen trees which used to be seen throughout the countryside have now largely been tidied away , and we 've lost all this connectivity in terms of dead wood .
Some species may now be found only on two to three to four sites , which maybe hundreds of miles apart
" The violet click beetle would be a classic one .
It is an internationally protected species found only in Windsor Great Park and on Bredon Hill in Worcestershire .
If it goes extinct in the one place , it wo n't be able to recolonise it from the other ; the sites are just too far apart .
That 's an extreme example , but at a smaller level , that 's happening with hundreds of species in the UK . "
Mr Shardlow does think that the recent scares about honey bees and the catastrophic damage their disappearance would do to the process of plant pollination have had an affect on people 's awareness .
" People are just starting to twig that insects are quite symbolic , " he said .
" They 're twigging about pollinators , and noticing about honey bees .
" But they have n't yet twigged that pollination needs more than just honeybees .
There are a whole set of different species , including beetles and flies , which are also undertaking unique and different pollination roles .
You can't fix pollination by saving one species .
You have to save the full gamut of invertebrate diversity .
Insects are fundamental to the fabric of life , and if we start to tear that fabric apart , the consequences for all of the services that are provided from ecosystems will be severe . "
Garden tiger moth
Arctia caja
One of the most attractive of all British insects , once well - known for its hairy " woolly bear " caterpillars , the garden tiger moth has declined spectacularly , falling in numbers by 89 per cent in the past 30 years
Violet click beetle
Limoniscus violaceus
So called from its habit of springing up , with a click if it falls on its back , this is now one of our rarest creatures , found only in Windsor Great Park in Berkshire and Bredon Hill in Worcestershire
Cinnabar moth
Tyria jacobaeae
The yellow and black caterpillars of the cinnabar used to be a familiar sight feeding on ragwort , but not any more .
Numbers of this handsome black and red moth have tumbled in the past 30 years , by 83 per cent
Mayfly
Ephemera danica
This is the largest and most beautiful of Britain 's 50 or so species of upwing flies , found on rivers and famously food for trout , all of which are declining , perhaps by as much as two - thirds in recent decades
High brown fritillary
Argynnis adippe
Since the 1950s , the high brown fritillary has undergone a dramatic decline of nearly 80 per cent .
It is now confined to about 50 sites , where conservationists are working to save it from extinction
Brown - banded carder bee
Bombus humilis
Tawny - coloured with a brown band on the upper abdomen , it is one of the most endangered of Britain 's 24 species of bumblebee .
Once widespread , it is now very local
Small tortoiseshell
Aglais urticae
Even 20 years ago this was the commonest " pretty " butterfly but it is now crashing in numbers , perhaps because of a pararsitic fly from Europe .
Abundance down by more than half
Ruderal bumblebee
Bombus ruderatus
The ruderal or large garden bumble - bee was common in southern England a century ago , but is now only in East Anglia .
Black with two yellow bands on the thorax , a single yellow band on the abdomen , and a white tail

Scientists Discover Method to Mass Produce Graphene , Major Boost for Renewable Energy
November 11th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
US Scientists have figured out a way to mass produce the nanomaterial graphene , opening the door to significant advances in the storage of hydrogen , as well as the electricity produced by solar and wind energy .
Graphene , produced by reducing graphite down to a sheet only one atom thick , is one of the strongest materials known to man .
It has been shown to have huge potential for hydrogen and renewable energy storage , but up until now has been held back by a lack of supply .
Now the team , based at the California NanoSystems Institute ( CNSI ) at UCLA , have discovered a method of producing graphene sheets in large quantities .
The research team , led by UCLA professors Yang Yang and Henry Samueli , developed a process where graphite oxide paper is placed in a pure hydrazine solution , reducing the paper into single - layer graphene .
According to co-researcher Vincent Tung , “ We have discovered a route toward solution processing of large - scale graphene sheets …by far the largest produced .
These breakthroughs represent the future of graphene nanoelectronic research . ”
More information on the team ’s findings are available in a study published online on Nov. 9 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .

WASHINGTON 
In the beginning , Senator Barack Obama was not entirely sold on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. And Mr. Biden told friends that he was pessimistic of his chances of becoming Mr. Obama ’s Democratic running mate .
Over the course of two months , as the dynamics of the presidential campaign and world events shifted quickly , Mr. Biden ’s stock rose through one of the most rigorous vice - presidential vetting processes that Democrats could recall .
It was a process in which Mr. Obama applied intense secrecy , careful pragmatism and political input from a team of internal and external advisers that have guided his campaign from the start .
And it ended Thursday with a phone call from Mr. Obama , who reached Mr. Biden as he was at a dentist ’s office where he had taken his wife to have a root canal .
On Saturday , as the two men embraced before a crowd in Illinois , the new Democratic partnership made its debut .
Yet in a moment that could have showcased Mr. Obama ’s decision - making , his top advisers made a concerted effort not to disclose how he made his choice , instead choosing to showcase the life stories of the two men on the ticket and to present Mr. Biden as a forceful new critic of Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona .
“ It ’s a very personal decision , ” said David Axelrod , the campaign ’s chief strategist , in a brief interview Saturday .
“ He approached it in a very serious , sober and reasoned way . ”
Raw Story
In anticipation of Thursday ’s vice presidential debate , Countdown takes a look back at all of Sarah Palin ’s greatest moments during what little access the McCain campaign has granted the media so far .
Now we know why Sarah Palin does n’t read newspapers .
She learns stuff from her Starbucks cup :
Palin regaled the cheering crowd with a story about how she was reading her Starbucks mocha cup yesterday , which featured a quotation from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
“ Now she said it , I did n’t , ” Palin said of Albright .
“ She said , ‘ There ’s a place in Hell reserved for women who do n’t support other women . ’”
The crowd roared its approval , but according to several sources , Albright actually said , “ there ’s a place in Hell reserved for women who do n’t help other women . ”
If Sarah is going to make a big deal about quoting her Starbucks cup , she should at least get the quote right .
In fact , as CBS notes , she got the quote wrong .
Madeleine Albright was n’t amused .
She wants Palin to know just how wrong she got it ( no link , got it via email from Albright ’s office ) :
“ Though I am flattered that Governor Palin has chosen to cite me as a source of wisdom , what I said had nothing to do with politics .
This is yet another example of McCain and Palin distorting the truth , and all the more reason to remember that this campaign is not about gender , it is about which candidate has an agenda that will improve the lives of all Americans , including women .
The truth is , if you care about the status of women in our society and in our troubled economy , the best choice by far is Obama - Biden . ”
Someone would type this up and put it on Palin ’s next Starbucks mocha cup so she ’ll be sure to see it .
Not that it would matter .
Palin will say anything , even if it ’s patently false or blatantly wrong .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama took time out from piecing together his leadership team Tuesday to honor the country 's fallen veterans .
Barack Obama and veteran Tammy Duckworth place a wreath at a memorial Tuesday in Chicago , Illinois .
Obama laid a wreath in Chicago , Illinois , and Vice President - elect Joe Biden spoke at a Veterans Day event in New Castle , Delaware .
Obama called on Americans to " rededicate ourselves to keep a sacred trust with all who have worn the uniform of the United States of America : that America will serve you as well as you have served your country . "
" As your next commander in chief , I promise to work every single day to keep that sacred trust with all who have served , " he said in a statement .
Watch Obama honor veterans »
Biden thanked the veterans present for their service and reiterated the Democratic campaign 's promise to care for those coming back from foreign battlefields " in this war that we ignore in everyday life . "
John Podesta , the co-chairman of the Obama - Biden transition team , provided an update on the presidential transition Tuesday afternoon .
iReport.com : Who do you think Obama should pick for his cabinet ?
Podesta laid out the ethics rules for the transition , but he did not make any key staff announcements .
Under ethics guidelines , Podesta said , federal lobbyists are banned from contributing money to transition and they cannot lobby during their work with the transition , among other things .
No Cabinet appointments were expected this week , but Obama 's transition team could make some key staff announcements .
With the transition process under way , President Bush welcomed the president - elect to the White House on Monday .
The two had a " relaxed " and " friendly " meeting , a White House spokesman said .
Watch more on the challenges Obama faces »
Bush said Tuesday that he and Obama had a " good conversation . "
Bush said he called former President Clinton before the meeting and told him that he hoped he could be as gracious to President - elect Obama as Clinton was to him .
In addition to policy discussion , the president said Obama seemed particularly interested in how his daughters would like the White House .
" I know his girls are on his mind and he wants to make sure first and foremost he 's going to be a good dad , and I think that 's going to be an important part of this presidency , " Bush said .
Bush also gave Obama a tour of the White House 's living quarters , including the Lincoln Bedroom .
Bush and Obama held a private meeting in the Oval Office while Laura Bush gave incoming first lady Michelle Obama a tour of the residence .
Bush and Obama " had a broad discussion about the importance of working together throughout the transition of government in light of the nation 's many critical economic and security challenges , " said Stephanie Cutter , spokeswoman for Obama 's transition team .
Watch what happened at the White House meeting »
As the president and president - elect met in the Oval Office , White House press secretary Dana Perino gave Robert Gibbs a tour of the White House press office .
Gibbs was the communications director for Obama 's presidential campaign .
He has not been named the incoming press secretary , but he is widely considered the top contender .
iReport.com : Share your top picks for Obama's Cabinet
There 's also been speculation that Obama will name David Axelrod as a senior adviser .
A source with the Obama transition team said last week that the plan is " in the works . "
Axelrod was the chief strategist in the presidential campaign .
Obama has announced one senior staff appointment so far .
Two days after the election , he picked Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois to be White House chief of staff .
A lot of names have emerged for potential Cabinet posts , including Sen. John Kerry for secretary of state .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska also have been mentioned for that position .
Health care is another priority , and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota is a possibility for secretary of health and human services .
See who the top contenders are »
Democratic sources also have said Howard Dean , a doctor who had a strong run as the Democratic National Committee chairman , is hungry for the HHS job .
Speculation about Obama 's Treasury secretary has centered on Lawrence Summers .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker 's name also has been floated .
Democrats said there 's also serious talk of Obama briefly keeping Robert Gates , Bush 's defense secretary .
CNN 's Ed Henry contributed to this report .
All About Barack Obama • George W. Bush
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Thousands of followers of anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr took to the streets on Saturday in a demonstration against a pact that would allow U.S. forces to stay in Iraq for three more years .
Iraq ’s foreign minister said a draft of the agreement hammered out after months of negotiations was now final and being reviewed by political leaders .
Parliament would be given a chance to vote for or against it , but not to make changes .
The agreement “ has been presented as a final text by the two negotiating teams .
The time now is time for a decision , ” Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told a news conference .
“ I believe the next few days will be crucial for the Iraqi leaders to make a political decision and a judgment on this agreement . ”
At the demonstration across town , marchers waved Iraqi flags and chanted “ Yes , yes Iraq !
No , no to the occupation ! ”
A white - turbaned cleric read out what he described as a letter from Sadr calling on parliament to vote down the pact .
“ I reject and condemn the continuation of the presence of the occupation force , and its bases on our beloved land , ” the letter said , calling the pact “ shameful for Iraq . ”
Marchers set fire to a U.S. flag , but the atmosphere appeared mostly calm .
“ It is a peaceful demonstration , demanding that the occupier leave and the government not sign the pact , ” Ahmed al - Masoudi , a Sadrist member of parliament , told Reuters .
Iraqi authorities said the demonstration was authorized and security had been increased to protect the protesters , who were marching from Sadr ’s stronghold of Sadr City in the east of the capital to a nearby public square at a university .
“ They have permission from the prime minister and the interior minister to hold a peaceful demonstration , ” the government ’s Baghdad security spokesman Qassim Moussawi said .
“ It is a part of democracy that people can protest freely . ”
The show of strength was a reminder of public hostility to the pact , which would give the U.S. troops a mandate directly from Iraq ’s elected leaders for the first time , replacing a U.N. Security Council resolution enacted after the invasion in 2003 .
SUPPORT NOT ASSURED
Support for the accord in Iraq ’s fractious parliament is far from assured , even though Iraq won important concessions from Washington over the course of months of negotiations .
U.S. officials have yet to explain the pact in public , but Iraqi leaders disclosed its contents this week .

The pact commits the United States to end patrols of Iraqi streets by mid-2009 and withdraw fully from the country by the end of 2011 unless Iraq asks them to stay , an apparent reversal for a U.S. administration long opposed to deadlines .
“ This is a temporary agreement .
It is not binding .
It does n’t establish permanent bases for the U.S. military here in the country , ” Zebari said .
“ We are talking about three years , and it is subject to annual review also . ”
The pact describes certain conditions under which Iraq would have the right to try U.S. service members in its courts for serious crimes committed while off duty , an element that was crucial to winning Iraqi political support .

In Washington , officials in the administration of President George W. Bush briefed members of Congress about the pact on Friday and sought to reassure them that it protects U.S. troops .
“ I think there is not reason to be concerned , ” Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters , adding that top military brass were happy with the legal protections in the accord .
The administration says it does not need congressional approval for the pact , but has nonetheless sought political support .
Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice briefed the two U.S. presidential candidates on the pact on Friday .
The $ 200 billion bail - out for predator banks and Spitzer charges are intimately linked
While New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was paying an escort $ 4,300 in a hotel room in Washington , just down the road , George Bush ’s new Federal Reserve Board Chairman , Ben Bernanke , was secretly handing over $ 200 billion in a tryst with mortgage bank industry speculators .
Both acts were wanton , wicked and lewd .
But there ’s a BIG difference .
The Governor was using his own checkbook .
Bush ’s man Bernanke was using ours .
This week , Bernanke ’s Fed , for the first time in its history , loaned a selected coterie of banks one - fifth of a trillion dollars to guarantee these banks mortgage - backed junk bonds .
The deluge of public loot was an eye - popping windfall to the very banking predators who have brought two million families to the brink of foreclosure .
Up until Wednesday , there was one single , lonely politician who stood in the way of this creepy little assignation at the bankers bordello : Eliot Spitzer .
Who are they kidding ?
Spitzer ’s lynching and the bankers ’ enriching are intimately tied .
How ?
Follow the money .
The press has swallowed Wall Street ’s line that millions of US families are about to lose their homes because they bought homes they could n’t afford or took loans too big for their wallets .
Ba-LON -ey .
That ’s blaming the victim .
Here ’s what happened .
Since the Bush regime came to power , a new species of loan became the norm , the sub - prime mortgage and its variants including loans with teeny “ introductory ” interest rates .
From out of nowhere , a company called Countrywide became America ’s top mortgage lender , accounting for one in five home loans , a large chunk of these sub -prime .
Here ’s how it worked :
The Grinning Family , with US average household income , gets a $ 200,000 mortgage at 4 % for two years .
Their $ 955 monthly payment is 25 % of their income .
No problem .
Their banker promises them a new mortgage , again at the cheap rate , in two years .
But in two years , the promise ai n’t worth a can of spam and the Grinnings are told to scram – because their house is now worth less than the mortgage .
Now , the mortgage hits 9 % or $ 1,609 plus fees to recover the “ discount ” they had for two years .
Suddenly , payments equal 42 % to 50 % of pre-tax income .
The Grinnings move into their Toyota .
Now , what kind of American is sub-prime .
Guess .
No peeking .
Here ’s a hint : 73 % of HIGH INCOME Black and Hispanic borrowers were given sub - prime loans versus 17 % of similar - income Whites .
Dark - skinned borrowers are n’t stupid hey had no choice .
They were steered as it ’s called in the mortgage sharking business .
Steering , sub - prime loans with usurious kickers , fake inducements to over - borrow , called fraudulent conveyance or predatory lending under US law , were almost completely forbidden in the olden days ( Clinton Administration and earlier ) by federal regulators and state laws as nothing more than fancy loan - sharking .
But when the Bush regime took over , Countrywide and its banking brethren were told to party hearty – it was OK now to steer ’m , fake ’m , charge ’m and take’m .
But there was this annoying party - pooper .
The Attorney General of New York , Eliot Spitzer , who sued these guys to a fare - thee - well .
Or tried to .
Instead of regulating the banks that had run amok , Bush ’s regulators went on the warpath against Spitzer and states attempting to stop predatory practices .
Making an unprecedented use of the legal power of “ federal pre-emption , ” Bush - bots ordered the states to NOT enforce their consumer protection laws .
Indeed , the feds actually filed a lawsuit to block Spitzer ’s investigation of ugly racial mortgage steering .
Bush ’s banking buddies were especially steamed that Spitzer hammered bank practices across the nation using New York State laws .
Spitzer not only took on Countrywide , he took on their predatory enablers in the investment banking community .
Behind Countrywide was the Mother Shark , its funder and now owner , Bank of America .
Others joined the sharkfest : Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Citigroup ’s Citibank made mortgage usury their major profit centers .
They did this through a bit of financial legerdemain called “ securitization . ”
What that means is that they took a bunch of junk mortgages , like the Grinning 's , loans about to go down the toilet and re-packaged them into “ tranches ” of bonds which were stamped “ AAA ” – top grade – by bond rating agencies .
These gold - painted turds were sold as sparkling safe investments to US school district pension funds and town governments in Finland ( really ) .
When the housing bubble burst and the paint flaked off , investors were left with the poop and the bankers were left with bonuses .
Countrywide ’s top man , Angelo Mozilo , will earn ’ a $ 77 million buy - out bonus this year on top of the $ 656 million – over half a billion dollars – he pulled in from 1998 through 2007 .
But there were rumblings that the party would soon be over .
Angry regulators , burned investors and the weight of millions of homes about to be boarded up were causing the sharks to sink .
Countrywide ’s stock was down 50 % , and Citigroup was off 38 % , not pleasing to the Gulf sheiks who now control its biggest share blocks .
Then , on Wednesday of this week , the unthinkable happened .
Carlyle Capital went bankrupt .
Who ?
That ’s Carlyle as in Carlyle Group .
James Baker , Senior Counsel .
Notable partners , former and past : George Bush , the Bin Laden family and more dictators , potentates , pirates and presidents than you can count .
The Fed had to act .
Bernanke opened the vault and dumped $ 200 billion on the poor little suffering bankers .
They got the public treasure – and got to keep the Grinning ’s house .
There was no quid of a foreclosure moratorium for the pro quo of public bailout .
Not one family was saved – but not one banker was left behind .
Every mortgage sharking operation shot up in value .
Mozilo ’s Countrywide stock rose 17 % in one day .
The Citi sheiks saw their company ’s stock rise $ 10 billion in an afternoon .
And that very same day the bail - out was decided – what a coinkydink !
– the man called , The Sheriff of Wall Street was cuffed .
Spitzer was silenced .
Do I believe the banks called Justice and said , “ Take him down today ! ”
Now , that ’s not how the system works .
But the big players knew that unless Spitzer was taken out , he would create enough ruckus to spoil the party .
Headlines in the financial press – one was “ Wall Street Declares War on Spitzer ” – made clear to Bush ’s enforcers at Justice who their number one target should be .
And it was n’t Bin Laden .
It was the night of February 13 when Spitzer made the bone - headed choice to order take - out in his Washington Hotel room .
He had just finished signing these words for the Washington Post about predatory loans :
“ Not only did the Bush administration do nothing to protect consumers , it embarked on an aggressive and unprecedented campaign to prevent states from protecting their residents from the very problems to which the federal government was turning a blind eye . ”
Bush , Spitzer said right in the headline , was the “ Predator Lenders ’ Partner in Crime . ”
The President , said Spitzer , was a fugitive from justice .
And Spitzer was in Washington to launch a campaign to take on the Bush regime and the biggest financial powers on the planet .
Spitzer wrote , “ When history tells the story of the subprime lending crisis and recounts its devastating effects on the lives of so many innocent homeowners the Bush administration will not be judged favorably . ”
But now , the Administration can rest assured that this love story – of Bush and his bankers – will not be told by history at all – now that the Sheriff of Wall Street has fallen on his own gun .
A note on “ Prosecutorial Indiscretion . ”
Back in the day when I was an investigator of racketeers for government , the federal prosecutor I was assisting was deciding whether to launch a case based on his negotiations for airtime with 60 Minutes .
I ’m not allowed to tell you the prosecutor ’s name , but I want to mention he was recently seen shouting , “ Florida is Rudi country !
Florida is Rudi country ! ”
Not all crimes lead to federal bust or even public exposure .
It ’s up to something called “ prosecutorial discretion . ”
Funny thing , this discretion .
For example , Senator David Vitter , Republican of Louisiana , paid Washington DC prostitutes to put him in diapers ( ewww ! ) , yet the Senator was not exposed by the US prosecutors busting the pimp-ring that pampered him .
Naming and shaming and ruining Spitzer rarely done in these cases – was made at the discretion of Bush ’s Justice Department .
Or maybe we should say , ‘ indiscretion . '

Greg Palast , former investigator of financial fraud , is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Armed Madhouse and The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .
So how much has the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve spent to bail out our economy ?
Chris Carey at BailoutSleuth says it 's a lot more than $ 700 billion .
" Adding together the $ 170 billion that the Treasury Department has currently agreed to provide banks in additional capital , the $ 150 billion that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are providing to AIG and the $ 2 trillion that the Federal Reserve has provided banks in emergency loans brings the total assistance to $ 2.32 trillion .
If the estimated savings from the new tax breaks are included , the assistance would climb to $ 2.46 trillion .
That total does not include other measures not focused directly on banks , such as Treasury Department 's $ 200 billion in support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the Federal Housing Administration 's $ 300 billion HOPE for Homeowners program . "
Add in another $ 50 billion for automakers , and that 's how you get to $ 3 trillion .
Music Lovers live longer !
Some say that laughter is the best medicine , and research seems to back this up – studies show that laughing has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system .
As it turns out , music might be an even better medicine than laughter .
Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have consucted a study which concludes that listening to your favorite music may be good for your cardiovascular system :
Music that causes you joy has a positive effect on blood vessel functions .
In the study , participants were allowed to select music which made them feel good and brought them joy .
Researchers found a healthy response that matches the response found by an earlier study on laugher .
The music caused tissue in the inner lining of blood vessels to or expand which increased blood flow .
Conversely , listening to music that was perceived as stressful caused their blood vessels to narrow , producing a potentially unhealthy response that reduces blood flow .
It ’s what I ’ve been saying all along : listening to good music gives you life , listening to bad music will kill you .
Compared to a control group , the average blood vessel diameter in the arm increased 26 percent after the joyful music phase , while listening to music that caused anxiety narrowed blood vessels by six percent .
I was impressed with the highly significant differences both before and after listening to joyful music as well as between joyful and anxious music , said principal investigator Michael Miller , M.D. , director of preventive cardiology at the University of Maryland Medical Center .
During the 2005 phase of the study , a 19 percent increase in dilation was seens .
The relaxation phase increased dilation by 11 percent on average ; a number that the investigators determined was not statistically significant .
That physiological impact may also affect the activity of endorphins in the brain .
The emotional component may be an endorphin - mediated effect ,  says Dr. Miller .
The active listening to music evokes such raw positive emotions likely in part due to the release of endorphins , part of that mind - heart connection that we yearn to learn so much more about .
Needless to say , these results were music to my ears because they signal another preventive strategy that we may incorporate in our daily lives to promote heart health .
The results were presented presented at the Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association on November 11 , 2008 , in New Orleans .
So there you have it .
Next time you see someone clutching at their chest , forget the defibrillator & throw on some Jimi Hendrix .
1.3 Million Reasons The GOP Created ACORN Scandal
By the way , in case you 're wondering , this is the real reason --- about 1.3 million of them , actually --- for the GOP 's desperate ACORN " voter fraud " scam ...
Any questions ?
If so , first see this and then this , and then read the following list of ACORN FACTS before getting back to me with any of your questions , as I 'm happy to help straighten you --- or any of the clueless and lazy media folks who have fallen for the GOP 's " voter fraud " fraud --- out , as needed .
The following FACT list is from a recent press release from ACORN , pointing out their success in registering hundreds of thousands of low - income voters who few others care to go out and register , and the fact that in almost every instance where there have been concerns about registrations turned in by the group ( by law , they must turn in all registration forms they collect , problematic ones or not ) it has been ACORN themselves who have first notified officials about the potentially fraudulent or incomplete applications .
The following FACTS need to be read by everybody ( apparently ) , even those who believe they are progressives , yet have fallen for the GOP 's Dixie - Chicking of ACORN ...
Fact : ACORN has implemented the most sophisticated quality - control system in the voter engagement field but in almost every state we are required to turn in ALL completed applications , even the ones we know to be problematic .
Fact : ACORN flags in writing incomplete , problem , or suspicious cards when we turn them in , .
Unfortunately , some of these same officials then come back weeks or months later and accuse us of deliberately turning in phony cards .
In many cases , we can actually prove that these are the same cards we called to their attention .
Fact :
Our canvassers are paid by the hour , not by the card .
ACORN has a zero - tolerance policy for deliberately falsifying registrations , and in the cases where our internal quality controls have identified this happening we have fired the workers involved and turned them in to election officials and law - enforcement .
Fact :
No criminal charges related to voter registration have ever been brought against ACORN or partner organizations .
Convictions against individual former ACORN workers have been accomplished with our full cooperation , using the evidence obtained through our quality control and verification processes - evidence which in most cases WE called to the attention of authorities
Fact :
Most election officials have recognized ACORN 's good work and praised our quality control systems .
Even in the cities where election officials have complained about ACORN , the applications in question represent less than 1 % of the thousands and thousands of registrations ACORN has collected .
Fact :
Our accusers not only fail to provide any evidence , they fail to suggest a motive : there is virtually no chance anyone would be able to vote fraudulently , so there is no reason to deliberately submit phony registrations .
ACORN is committed to ensuring that the greatest possible numbers of people are registered
ACORN will not be intimidated , we will not be provoked , and in this important moment in history we will not allow anyone to distract us from these vital efforts to empower our constituencies and our communities to speak for themselves .
Thank you , ACORN , for both the tireless work in support of democracy , and for not being intimidated by those who hate it , and who realize that if it exists , they can not win elections .

AUSTIN , Texas -- A Texas Longhorns team leader Monday praised the way coaches handled the dismissal of a player who posted a racial slur on his Facebook page about President - elect Barack Obama .
Backup center Buck Burnette left No. 3
Texas on Wednesday for what was announced as an unspecified violation of team rules .
Burnette , a sophomore , played in seven games this season .
In a statement to The Associated Press , Burnette apologized and said he made a " terrible decision " to post a text message he received about Obama 's victory that contained a racial slur .
Senior defensive end Brian Orakpo said he considered the dismissal " appropriate . "
" I thought the coaches did a good job on handling the situation , " Orakpo said .
" My prayers are for him , but we 've got to move on .
Guys got to make better decisions for their future . "
Orakpo said players should know their personal Web pages such as MySpace and Facebook can be sources of controversy .
" With the way the media and the Internet is evolving , everything you say can get you in trouble , " Orakpo said .
Quarterback Colt McCoy , who counted Burnette among his good friends on the team , said it was an emotional decision for the coaches .
" I do n't really want to talk about it that much but I feel super sorry for him and I think the team does , too , " McCoy said .
" I just told him to keep his head up .
Things will blow over , things will get better .
That 's a situation that 's tough . "
Coach Mack Brown said his players are told to be careful about what they post on personal Web pages .
Brown would prefer his players did n't have personal Web pages , but says he can't ban them .
" It 's a public right they have as students , " Brown said .
" We 've told them we 'd rather they not have them , and we 've told them they need to obviously not be putting anything their mom would n't want to see . "
The coach cut off questions about the matter when asked if he feared the racial slur could divide his team .
" Folks , I 'm not going there .
At all .
I 'm through , " he said .
" We played well . "
Obama 's election prompted at least one visible but low - key celebration by a Texas player .
Senior defensive end Henry Melton wrote " Obama " on the black patches he wore under his eyes during Texas ' 45 - 21 win over Baylor on Saturday .
Texas ( 9 - 1 , 5 - 1 Big 12 ) is still in contention for the conference and national championships .
McCoy said the Longhorns moved on soon after Brown told them what happened and Burnette sent a letter of apology to the team .
McCoy called the apology " extremely sincere . "
" I did not think for a second this would be a distraction , " McCoy said .
" Everybody knows Buck .
With this team 's chemistry , we 're all so close .
It 's a tough deal for everybody . "
MOSCOW  Russia on Friday received new proposals from the United States to reduce nuclear arms and provide greater access to the Bush administration ’s planned missile defense system , as leaders in Washington moved to calm tensions between the two nations .
Russia has long protested the plans for a missile defense system , which would station radar equipment and 10 interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic .
American officials say the system in designed to counter an attack from Iran , and would not be used against Russian forces
But the missile defense plan was a central topic of Russian President Dmitri A. Medvedev ’s state of the nation speech this week .
Mr. Medvedev announced that if Washington proceeded with the plan , Russia would respond by stationing short - range missiles and jamming equipment at its western border .
The new American proposals , reported earlier in the Wall Street Journal , would allow Russian military officials to inspect the American installations .
Washington has also proposed reducing stockpiles of nuclear warheads in both countries , as well as long - range nuclear weapons .

FEC Examines McCain ’s Excessive Donors
Created : October 06 , 2008 16:45 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
With a Republican National Committee lawyer calling on the Federal Elections Commission to investigate the Obama campaign for accepting contributions in excess of federal limits , the FEC is looking into dozens of excessive donations to the McCain campaign as well , reports The Washington Post .
Following a Newsweek report that the commission flagged some donors to Sen.
Barack Obama for exceeding contribution limits with numerous small donations using fake names , Sean Cairncross , RNC chief counsel , yesterday accused the Obama campaign of “ looking the other way ” on excessive contributions .
Newsweek reported the Obama campaign has since returned the donations in question .
From the Post :
The FEC sent a letter to Sen .
John McCain ’s campaign treasurer Sept. 30 demanding the candidate turn over more information about “ contributions that appear to exceed the limits . ”
The letter is accompanied by a nine - page list showing scores of overages from [ Sen. John ]
McCain ’s August campaign finance report , including nearly $ 13,000 from Texas rancher Ray R. Barrett Jr. ; $ 9,200 from an Iraqi security consultant , H. Carter Andress ; and $ 5,000 from Joseph F. Davolio , an executive at a major national liquor , beer , and wine distributor .
“ Please inform the Commission of your corrective action immediately in writing and provide photocopies of any refund checks and / or letters reattributing or redesignating the contributions in question , ” the letter from the FEC ’s senior campaign finance analyst , Leah S. Palmer , says .
“ The acceptance of excessive contributions is a serious problem . ”
It appears that the Newsweek article comes at a very convenient time for the McCain campaign — it lent a little political cover to lessen the blow from a potentially embarrassing revelation .
However , there seems to be a pattern developing here :
Remember McCain ’s attacks on Obama for being beholden to Fannie Mae — while several of McCain ’s closest advisers and staff members lobbied on behalf of Freddie Mac and the mortgage industry ?
Perhaps it is true that the surest sign that the McCain campaign is guilty of something is if it accuses the Obama camp of the same deed .
Thousands of passengers and 160 train services were delayed on Saturday
French police have arrested at least 10 people in connection with a series of attacks on France 's rail network .
Police say those arrested were probably involved in sabotaging overhead power cables that disrupted national rail and Eurostar services over the weekend .
It is believed they belong to a far - left anarchist group protesting against trains transporting nuclear waste .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy congratulated investigators for their " rapid and promising progress " .
The French interior ministry says suspects from the " anarcho - autonomous " movement were arrested in three cities , including Paris , after a months - long investigation .
It is understood that 20 people were originally detained but only 10 now remain in custody , where they are being questioned about several acts of sabotage on French railway lines .
On Saturday , metal rods were jammed against overhead power cables , taking out trains on lines north , east and south of the capital , causing chaos to the national network .
Eurostar trains to Brussels and London and services to northern Europe were also seriously disrupted .
On Sunday another high speed train was stopped after protestors placed concrete blocks on the line .
Railway officials say the attacks were probably part of the same well organised campaign .
They said it did not threaten the safety of passengers .
Investigators are now examining a link between the group and the German far left , which has already claimed responsibility for actions against trains carrying nuclear waste .

Eight - armed animal preceded dinosaurs
Scientists have discovered what they believe is an eight - armed creature , which colonised a large section of the world 's oceans over 300 million years before the first dinosaurs emerged .
The findings represent the first comparable animal fossils from the Ediacaran Period , 635 to 541 million years ago , which appear in two drastically different preservation environments - black shale of South China and quartz rock of South Australia .
" According to palaeogeographic reconstructions , South China and South Australia were close to each other at the time , belonging to a supercontinent called Gondwana , " says lead author Dr Maoyan Zhu .
Zhu , a scientist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , first helped to make the China - Australia connection two years ago during a Beijing conference .
He showed a photo of the unusual eight - armed creature , called Eoandromeda octobrachiata , to co-author Dr James Gehling of the South Australia Museum .
" He was so surprised and immediately opened his laptop and showed me images of new fossils uncovered from a new locality at the Flinders Ranges of South Australia , " says Zhu .
" We wondered if these were the same fossils . "
Zhu , Gehling and their colleagues collected eight compressions of the animals from the Doushantuo Formation at Wenghui , China .
They then traveled to Flinders Ranges , Australia , and collected seven specimens , leaving 31 others on two excavated and reassembled beds .
The findings are published in the November issue of Geology .
There is no question the creature , believed to represent one type of animal , had a lot of arms .
Simple and symmetrical
The eight arms are clearly preserved in our specimens , " says Zhu , adding that the arms were tubular and in close contact with each other , but not joined .
He and his colleagues believe the animal was a soft - bodied , dome - shaped organism that lived on seabeds and fed by absorbing dissolved nutrients from the ambient environment .
Before the latest fossils were found , some researchers identified the creatures as lichens or fungus - like organisms , but Zhu and his team suspect that at least some Ediacara fossils represent now - extinct diploblastic animals , or creatures that possess only two cellular layers separated by a jelly - type substance .
" Diploblastic animals are common creatures on present day earth , " he said , mentioning that jellyfish , corals and sea anemones belong to the group .
" These animals ( display ) radial symmetry but lack complex organs , as shown by E. octobrachiata , " he adds .
The multi-armed creature , and several other early life forms , went extinct around 542 million years ago , which Zhu says , " left empty niches for the subsequent Cambrian explosion of complex animals . "
Representatives of nearly all existent animals emerged at this time , when a rapid increase in oxygen made respiration and metabolism possible .
Bridging the gap
In a separate paper , Professor Shuhai Xiao , a researcher in the Department of Geosciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University , and colleague Dr Marc Laflamme provide an overview of Ediacara fossils .
In the paper , which has been accepted for publication in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution , Xiao and Laflamme agree that , " Ediacara biota bridges the cryptic evolution of multicellular life in the early Ediacaran and the extraordinary radiation of animals in the Cambrian period . "
In addition to the eight - armed creature , they describe other early living things that looked like leaves , shells , stars and something almost akin to a peace symbol .
Xiao and Laflamme hope that as the Ediacara fossil database grows ever larger , more mysteries about these very early organisms will be solved .
The engineers of the economic collapse are n’t finished with you yet .
There is still a lot of work that needs to be done to scare you into agreeing to more outright theft of your sovereignty , freedom and wealth .
The first milestones have been reached .
As Congress was warned in March , the economic collapse gained steam in September – right on schedule .
The federal government has successfully created over $ 3 trillion , with MUCH more to come , in order to ensure the coming hyper - inflationary nail in the coffin .
With that , they managed to nationalize banks and insurance companies and rescued other incompetent partners - in - crime on Wall Street and it is only beginning .
Now for what is coming next :
It was predicted at the end of October that the U.S. Dollar would collapse within 30 days .
The dollar collapse will be accelerated by a COMEX default beginning on November 28th .
More on what this will look like here .
on November 28th .
More on what this will look like here .
Colin Powell has warned of a “ crisis ” that will happen on January 21st or 22nd , 2009 .
It remains to be seen whether this staged event will be financial in nature .
The U.S. government is expected to go bankrupt / default in February 2009 .
Make no mistake , none of this is happening by accident .
Nor is it happening as a result of “ bad ” policy , not enough regulation etc .
On the contrary , what is unfolding has been planned for decades .
Preposterous you say ?
Read this , this , this and this .
Stocks will likely rally next week .
Do n’t let it fool you .
Good luck .
Mormon Baptismal Font : plenty of room for everybody .
Statement of the Grand Inquisitor :
We have to admire the sheer chutzpah of the Mormons .
Whereas we struggle with faulty humankind , inquisiting people , torturing them , trying to shove them toward the true faith , the Mormons have worked out a way to avoid so much heavy lifting .
They take care of things after death .
Dead people , y’see , are so agreeable .
No backtalk .
If you tell a dead guy he ’s now a by - god upstanding member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , you wo n’t get any argument .
Of course , such a bold approach to gathering souls is bound to involve a lot of blowback from the older religions .
Especially the Jews — you know how they are .
For decades now Jewish leaders have been trying to get the Mormons to stop baptizing their dead relatives , especially the victims of the Holocaust .
As Ernest Michel , honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors , points out in The New York Times , “ They suffered enough . ”
The suspicion is that , in spite of a 1995 agreement to lay off the six million Jews killed by the Nazis , the Mormons might be continuing their all - inclusive practice of baptizing the dead by proxy .
“ Might be continuing … ? ”
Of course they are ; they ’re Mormons .
Bizarre secret rituals are their dish .
Rest assured they ’ve already baptized your dead grandmother .
They ’re baptizing dead people right now , this minute , in a big pot standing on the backs of twelve sculpted cows ( see photo ) .
What did you think all that geneology was about ?
It ’s not just a hobby for the Mormons .
They ’re taking names , assigning them live proxies , and dunking them in the cow - pot .
Devout Jew or devout Catholic or devout Holy Roller , Hindu , Muslim , Buddhist , atheist , does n’t matter — everybody into the pot .
They ’ve done Einstein ; they ’ve done Hitler ; they ’ve done the popes even after the Vatican declared all such baptisms invalid .
They ’ll get around to you eventually .
The rationale is that they ’re helping all the heretics who are going to show up on the Other Side and get a nasty shock when they see it ’s Mormonland over there .
If you ’re not a Mormon you ca n’t get into heaven , or rather , into any one of the hierarchical heavens they ’ve set up .
But if somebody baptizes you by proxy back on earth , you can at least start training for one of the lower heavens .
See ?
All pretty straightforward when you look into it .
For those who are offended at the idea of their dead grandparents getting baptized by a bunch of oddballs they never met and probably would n’t like , the Mormon party line is , “ Well , if you do n’t believe in the power of our rituals anyway , what does it matter ? ”
Pretty effective line .
Like I said , chutzpah .
They ’ll get right up in your face , Mormons will .
Statement of the Defense : But by that logic , the power of their rituals is vulnerable to all sorts of counter - spells .
For example , on the Salamandar Society website , the self - identified “ ex- Mormon Petros ” makes this modest proposal for de-hexing the deceased :
Fine .
I will institute a ritual ( inspired by God of course ) of anti-baptism , by which any baptisms by proxy can be immediately nullified and rendered void .
This sacred rite ( for which I shall have a special temple constructed from donations ) shall be first applied to all Mormons who have died before it is applied to anyone else .
Thus , they will be given the opportunity in the afterlife to repent of having followed the false doctrines of Mormonism while alive .
Of course , they still have the free will to decline this special benefit if they choose to remain damned .
I will be happy to extend this great blessing to all of your deceased ancestors if you will simply send me their names and birth dates .
( Wait a minute , revelation coming in . . . okay , God says I will not need any names or birthdates in order to perform this sacred work .
What a great blessing from the Lord !
He ’s just made my work far easier .
Thank you Heavenly Father ! )
Consider your ancestors anti-baptized by proxy .
And on the same site , Enoch Ipsen conjures up an even more deleterious counter - spell called “ Buggery for the Dead ” :
I have heard many of my Mormon co-workers and acquaintances shrug off the proxy baptisms of Jewish Holocost [ sic ] victims by the LDS church .
The prevailing attitude seems to be , “ If you do n’t believe it , then it should n’t make any difference . ” I agree .
This should n’t be at all offensive to anyone , even if their family members may have died for their own religious beliefs .
I ’d like to send out a certificate to families of recently deceased Mormons .
The following example would be sent to the family member of a son who dies while serving a mission .
Now , remember , if you do n’t believe it , it should n’t be offensive : ‘ Dear Brother and Sister Smith : ‘ We send our sincere condolences in this difficult and trying time .
Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and that there is a special ray of light and hope for you and your family .
‘ We are pleased to announce that your son , Nephi , is now a homosexual .
He was posthumously inducted into our organization along with Spencer W. Kimball , in a sacred initiatory ritual known as “ Buggery for the Dead . ”
‘ You will be excited to know that Nephi won the coin toss and was allowed to be the top in the posthumous pairing and Spencer was the bottom .
In case you are not aware , top and bottom mean , respectively , buggerer and buggeree .
They are sacred terms in Librachese , the ancient homosexual code revealed to us by a Friend of Dorothy … . ’
Verdict : Hmm .
Yeah , I see how it could get complicated .
Expression of admiration withdrawn .
Chutzpah ai n’t everything .

Microsoft said Tuesday that it will discontinue its OneCare PC protection offering next June , replacing it with a thinner , free offering focused solely on anti-malware protection .
Code - named " Morro , " the new protection service will not cost consumers anything , but will also cut out some of the " non-security " features that were bundled with the subscription , including printer sharing and automated PC tune - up features .
Morro will provide users " antivirus , antispyware and antimalware protection , " Microsoft said .
Morro will not include a firewall , but will check and notify the user if the Windows Firewall is not turned on , a Microsoft spokesman said .
Retail sales of OneCare , meanwhile , will be halted on June 30 , 2009 .
A corollary " Equipt " offering will also be pulled .
" The new core antimalware solution will be built to address market changes and consumer needs , and will include real - time antivirus , antispyware , and core antimalware functionality while utilizing fewer computing resources , " a Microsoft spokesman said .
" The new solution will not offer or support multi-PC ' circle ' management , printer sharing , performance enhancing tools such as disk defragmenting , or any of the backup and restore capabilities that make up the OneCare suite . "
Microsoft said that the thinner Morro footprint , which will consume less memory , will be ideal for inexpensive PCs and PCs in emeerging markets , which might not be configured with as much memory .
Streamlined anti-malware suites have also become the trend du jour , with , among others , making a .

may reveal why Microsoft made its decision , however : while the anti-malware capabilities in OneCare dramatically improved , PC Magazine was less impressed with the tune - up , back - up , and other features , calling many " still a long way from being fully baked " .
OneCare subscriptions will continue to be offered through June 30 , Microsoft said , and the company recommends that users continue them , even if they expire before the June expiration date .
Subscriptions will continue to be honored for their full year , even if they extend into the period when the OneCare services wo n't be offered to new subscribers .

He quotes from a widely circulated Blanchard paper that summarized the state of macro and concluded it was “ good . ”
Kling merely paraphrases Blanchard ’s observations ( fairly , too–i.e. Kling is n’t putting words into Blanchard ’s mouth ) , and then points out that one might easily have concluded that mainstream macro is in the toilet .
Here ’s Kling :
So , the state of macro is this : 1 . We have a workhorse model , with no capital or financial markets .
2 . We have some work on asymmetric information and financial markets that is not really integrated into the workhorse model , but which suggests that when “ shocks ” occur , their effects may be amplified relative to the workhorse model .
3. Real - world data have interesting patterns that either are unexplained by or contradict the most widely - used models .
4. Papers follow a “ haiku - like ” ritual in order to be published .
And this is “ good . ”
I agree with all four propositions , but I disagree with the conclusion .
Then in another angry post , Kling says :
I am shocked at the behavior of my fellow economists during this crisis .
They are claiming to know much more than they do about causes and solutions .
Rather than trying to understand and explain what is going on , they are engaged in a fierce battle over narrative .
Later on he has this quotable quote :
I have always thought that the issue of the relationship between financial markets and the “ real economy ” was really deep .
I thought that it was a critical part of macroeconomic theory that was poorly developed .
But the economics profession for the past thirty years instead focused on producing stochastic calculus porn to satisfy young men ’s urge for mathematical masturbation .
I did n’t know Kling was so feisty !
He ’s bald so I bet he worries about everything like I do , too !

San Francisco - Reporters , bloggers , and voters across the country can monitor problems at the polls on Election Day on OurVoteLive.org , a project built and hosted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) on behalf of Election Protection , the nation 's largest nonpartisan voter protection coalition , and its toll - free voter - assistance hotline , 866 - OUR - VOTE .
OurVoteLive.org collects and analyzes reports from calls to the 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline , which is staffed by hundreds of volunteers across the country .
Tested during the presidential primaries , the site is already documenting over a thousand examples per day of voters needing information or reporting problems such as registration and identification issues , difficulties with voting machines , and polling place accessibility issues .
Over 200,000 calls are expected to come into the hotline and be documented on OurVoteLive.org through Election Day .
" Improved transparency in all aspects of the electoral process is critical to ensuring accurate results as well as diagnosing systemic problems and helping voters , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman .
" OurVoteLive.org is helping the Election Protection Coalition make that possible . "
In addition to call incident data , OurVoteLive.org also features maps , nationwide trend information , and an active election issues blog that will highlight important election incidents as they develop .
" OurVoteLive.org will allow us to help more voters more effectively , " said Jonah Goldman , director of the National Campaign for Fair Elections at the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , which leads Election Protection .
" We -- along with election officials and the media -- will be able track trends and identify problem areas quickly so that we can remove any barriers that voters face as they cast their ballots . "
Election Protection has more than 100 partners at the national , state and local level and is providing live voter protection services now through Election Day across all 50 states .
On November 4 , Election Protection will mobilize tens of thousands of volunteers , including 10,000 legal volunteers to monitor polling places , educate voters , facilitate a dialogue with local and state officials , provide legal support to poll monitors , and answer the 1 - 866 - OUR - VOTE voter services hotline -- a monumental undertaking designed to ensure smooth voting in November .

Enlarge By Charles Dharapak , AP President - elect Barack Obama stands with former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , chairman - designate of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board , at a news conference in Chicago on Wednesday .
PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION
Send your questions to : politics@usatoday.com CHICAGO ( AP )  Soon - to - be president Barack Obama said he is not worried about his own security , despite a higher level of threats against him than any other president - elect in history .
Since Obama 's election , law enforcement officials have seen potential threatening writings , racist Internet postings and other troubling activity popping up .
But Obama said in an interview with Barbara Walters that he never thinks about his safety .
" Part of it because I 've got this pretty terrific crew of Secret Service guys that follow me everywhere I go , but also because I have a deep religious faith and faith in people that carries me through the day , " he said .
" And my job is just to make sure I 'm doing my job , and if I do , I can't worry about that kind of stuff . "
IN COURT : Men accused in Obama plot plead not guilty
In all the stress of the transition , Obama said he 's trying to eat healthy food , work out regularly and refrain from smoking now that the campaign is over , but he did not say he has quit cigarettes entirely .
Obama , a smoker who has quit but admitted occasional relapses , said in the interview that he fell " off the wagon during the campaign " a few times .
He did not directly answer her question about whether he is sneaking an occasional cigarette now amid the intense pressure of building his administration and the countdown to his swearing - in on Jan. 20 .
" Part of what I think comes with this role as president is that you 're not perfect but hopefully you 're trying to set a good example for people , and that starts with my two kids , " Obama said in the interview that aired Wednesday on ABC - TV .
ECONOMY : Obama says ' Help is on the way '
He said he 's been trying to stay healthy since the days of burgers on the campaign trail .
The president - elect works out nearly every day , and says he 's watching his diet too .
" I 've been trying to stay fit , " he said .
Obama 's doctor said last spring that he was in excellent health at the time of his last checkup the previous year , but he has a family history of cancer .

Scale your file system with Parallel NFS
Read and write hundreds of gigabytes per second
Through NFS , which consists of server and client software and protocols running among them , a computer can share its physical file system with many other computers connected to the same network .
NFS masks the implementation and type of the server 's file system .
To applications running on an NFS client , the shared file system appears as if it 's local , native storage .
Figure 1 illustrates a common deployment of NFS within a network of heterogeneous operating systems , including Linux® , Mac OS X , and Windows® , all of which support the NFS standard .
( NFS is the sole file system standard supported by the Internet Engineering Task Force . )
Figure 1 . A simple NFS configuration
In Figure 1 , the Linux machine is the NFS server ; it shares or exports ( in NFS parlance ) one or more of its physical , attached file systems .
The Mac OS X and Windows machines are NFS clients .
Each consumes , or mounts , the shared file system .
Indeed , mounting an NFS file system yields the same result as mounting a local drive partition — when mounted , applications simply read and write files , subject to access control , oblivious to the machinations required to persist data .
In the case of a file system shared through NFS , Read and Write operations traverse — represented by the blue shadow — through the client ( in this case , the Windows machine ) to the server , which ultimately fulfills requests to retrieve or persist data or alter file metadata , such as permissions and last modified time .
NFS is quite capable , as evidenced by its widespread use as Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) .
It runs over both Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) and is ( relatively ) easy to administer .
Furthermore , NFS version 4 , the most recent , ratified version of the standard , improves security , furthers interoperability between Windows and UNIX® - like systems , and provides better exclusivity through lock leases .
( NFS v4 was ratified in 2003 . )
NFS infrastructure is also inexpensive , because it typically runs well on common Ethernet hardware .
NFS suits most problem domains .
However , one domain not traditionally well served by NFS is high - performance computing ( HPC ) , where data files are very large , sometimes huge , and the number of NFS clients can reach into the thousands .
( Think of a compute cluster or grid composed of thousands of commodity computing nodes . )
Here , NFS is a liability , because the limits of the NFS server — be it bandwidth , storage capacity , or processor speed — throttle the overall performance of the computation .
NFS is a bottleneck .
Or , at least it was .
The next revision of NFS , version 4.1 , includes an extension called Parallel NFS ( pNFS ) that combines the advantages of stock NFS with the massive transfer rates proffered by parallelized input and output ( I/ O ) .
Using pNFS , file systems are shared from server to clients as before , but data does not pass through the NFS server .
Instead , client systems and the data storage system connect directly , providing numerous parallelized , high - speed data paths for massive data transfers .
After a bit of initialization and handshaking , the pNFS server is left " out of the loop , " and it no longer hinders transfer rates .
Figure 2 shows a pNFS configuration .
At the top are the nodes of a compute cluster , such as a large pool of inexpensive , Linux - powered blades .
At the left is the NFSv4.1 server .
( For this discussion , let 's just call it a pNFS server . )
At the bottom is a large parallel file system .
Figure 2 .
The conceptual organization of pNFS
Like NFS , the pNFS server exports file systems and retains and maintains the canonical metadata describing each and every file in the data store .
As with NFS , a pNFS client — here a node in a cluster — mounts the server 's exported file systems .
Like NFS , each node treats the file system as if it were local and physically attached .
Changes to metadata propagate through the network back to the pNFS server .
Unlike NFS , however , a Read or Write of data managed with pNFS is a direct operation between a node and the storage system itself , pictured at the bottom in Figure 2 .
The pNFS server is removed from data transactions , giving pNFS a definite performance advantage .
Thus , pNFS retains all the niceties and conveniences of NFS and improves performance and scalability .
The number of clients can be expanded to provide more computing power , while the size of the storage system can expand with little impact on client configuration .
All you need to do is keep the pNFS catalog and storage system in sync .
The nuts and bolts of pNFS
So , how does it work ?
As shown in Figure 3 , pNFS is implemented as a collection of three protocols .
Figure 3 .
The triad of pNFS protocols
The pNFS protocol transfers file metadata ( formally known as a layout ) between the pNFS server and a client node .
You can think of a layout as a map , describing how a file is distributed across the data store , such as how it is striped across multiple spindles .
Additionally , a layout contains permissions and other file attributes .
With metadata captured in a layout and persisted in the pNFS server , the storage system simply performs I/O .
The storage access protocol specifies how a client accesses data from the data store .
As you might guess , each storage access protocol defines its own form of layout , because the access protocol and the organization of the data must be concordant .
The control protocol synchronizes state between the metadata server and the data servers .
Synchronization , such as reorganizing files on media , is hidden from clients .
Further , the control protocol is not specified in NFSv4.1 ; it can take many forms , allowing vendors the flexibility to compete on performance , cost , and features .
Given those protocols , you can follow the client - access process :
The client requests a layout for the file at hand .
The client obtains access rights by opening the file on the metadata server .
When authorized and given the layout , the client is free to access information from the data servers directly .
Access proceeds according to the storage access protocol required for the type of store .
( More on this below . )
If the client alters the file , the client 's instance of the layout is duly modified , and all modifications are committed back to the metadata server .
When the client no longer needs the file , it commits any remaining changes , returns its copy of the layout to the metadata server , and closes the file .
More specifically , a Read operation is a series of protocol operations :
The client sends a LOOKUP +OPEN request to the pNFS server .
The server returns a file handle and state information .
The client requests a layout from the server through the LAYOUTGET command .
The server returns the file layout .
The client issues a READ request to the storage devices , which initiates multiple Read operations in parallel .
When the client is finished reading , it expresses the end of the operation with LAYOUTRETURN .
If the layout shared with clients is ever obsolete because of separate activity , the server issues a CB_LAYOUTRECALL to indicate that the layout is no longer valid and must be purged and / or refetched .
A Write operation is similar , except that the client must issue a LAYOUTCOMMIT before LAYOUTRETURN to " publish " the changes to the file to the pNFS server .
Layouts can be cached in each client , further enhancing speed , and a client can voluntarily relinquish a layout from the server if it 's no longer of use .
A server can also restrict the byte range of a Write layout to avoid quota limits or to reduce allocation overhead , among other reasons .
To prevent stale caches , the metadata server recalls layouts that have become inaccurate .
Following a recall , every affected client must cease I/O and either fetch the layout anew or access the file through plain NFS .
Recalls are mandatory before the server attempts any file administration , such as migration or re-striping .
It 's location , location , location
As mentioned above , each storage access protocol defines a type of layout , and new access protocols and layouts can be added freely .
To bootstrap the use of pNFS , the vendors and researchers shaping pNFS have already defined three storage techniques : file , block , and object stores :
File storage is commonly implemented with traditional NFS servers , such as those produced by Network Appliance .
The storage farm is realized as a collection of NFS servers , and each file is striped across ( a subset or all of ) the servers so that clients can retrieve portions of the file simultaneously .
Here , the layout enumerates the servers that hold the pieces of the file , the size of the stripe on each server , and the NFS file handle of each segment .
Block storage is most often implemented with a storage - area network ( SAN ) composed of many disks or RAID arrays .
Many vendors , including IBM and EMC , offer SAN solutions .
With block storage , a file is divided into blocks , and the blocks are dispersed among the drives .
The block storage layout maps the file blocks to physical storage blocks .
The storage access protocol is the SCSI block command set .
Object storage is similar to file storage , except that file handles are replaced by object IDs and striping tends to be more varied , complex , and capable .
No matter the type of layout , pNFS uses a common scheme to refer to servers .
Instead of hostname or volume name , servers are referred to by a unique ID .
This ID is mapped to the access protocol - specific server reference .
Which of these storage techniques is better ?
The answer is , " It depends . "
Budget , speed , scale , simplicity , and other factors are all part of the equation .
The state of pNFS
Before you break out your checkbook , let 's look at the state of pNFS .
As of this writing in November 2008 , the draft Request for Comments ( RFC ) for NFSv4.1 is entering " last call , " a two - month period set aside to collect and consider comments before the RFC is published and opened to industry - wide scrutiny .
When published , the formal RFC review period often lasts a year .
In addition to providing broad exposure , the draft proposed standard captured in the RFC lays a firm foundation for actual product development .
As only minor changes to the standard are expected during the forthcoming review period , vendors can design and build workable , marketable solutions now .
Products from multiple vendors will be available some time next year .
In the immediate term , open source prototype implementations of pNFS on Linux are available from a git repository located at the University of Michigan ( see Related topics for a link ) .
IBM , Panasas , Netapp , and the University of Michigan Center for Information Technology Integration ( CITI ) are leading the development of NFSv4.1 and pNFS for Linux .
The potential for pNFS as an open - source parallel file system client is enormous .
The fastest supercomputer in the world ( as ranked by the Top500 survey ) and the first computer to reach a petaflop uses the parallel file system built by Panasas ( a supporter of the pNFS object - based implementation ) .
( A petaflop is one thousand trillion operations per second . )
Dubbed Roadrunner , located at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and pictured in Figure 4 , the gargantuan system has 12,960 processors , runs Linux , and is the first supercomputer to be constructed using heterogeneous processor types .
Both AMD Opteron X64 processors and IBM's Cell Broadband Engine™ drive computation .
In 2006 , Roadrunner demonstrated a peak 1.6 gigabytes - per- second transfer rate using an early version of Panasas 's parallel file system .
In 2008 , the Roadrunner parallel storage system can sustain hundreds of gigabytes per second .
In comparison , traditional NFS typically peaks at hundreds of megabytes per second .
Figure 4 . Roadrunner , the world 's first petaflop supercomputer
The entire NFSv4.1 standard and pNFS are substantive improvements to the NFS standard and represent the most radical changes made to a twenty - something - year - old technology that originated with Sun Microsystems ' Bill Joy in the 1980s .
Five years in development , NFSv4.1 and pNFS now ( or imminently ) stands ready to provide super - storage speeds to super - computing machines .
We have seen the future , and it is parallel storage .

LOMA LINDA , California ( CNN ) -- Anthony Acevedo thumbs through the worn , yellowed pages of his diary emblazoned with the words " A Wartime Log " on its cover .
It 's a catalog of deaths and atrocities he says were carried out on U.S. soldiers held by Nazis at a slave labor camp during World War II -- a largely forgotten legacy of the war .
Anthony Acevedo served as a medic during World War II .
He was captured and sent into a Nazi forced labor camp .

Acevedo pauses when he comes across a soldier with the last name of Vogel .
" He died in my arms .
He would n't eat .
He did n't want to eat , " says Acevedo , now 84 years old .
" He said , ' I want to die !
I want to die !
I want to die ! ' "
The memories are still fresh , some 60 years later .
Acevedo keeps reading his entries , scrawled on the pages with a Sheaffer fountain pen he held dear .
See inside Acevedo's diary »
He was one of 350 U.S. soldiers held at Berga an der Elster , a satellite camp of the Nazis ' notorious Buchenwald concentration camp .
The soldiers , working 12 - hour days , were used by the German army to dig tunnels and hide equipment in the final weeks of the war .
Less than half of the soldiers survived their captivity and a subsequent death march , he says .
Acevedo shows few emotions as he scans the pages of his diary .
But when he gets to one of his final entries , the decades of pent - up pain , the horror witnessed by a 20 - year - old medic , are too much .
" We were liberated today , April the 23 , 1945 , " he reads .
His body shakes , and he begins sobbing .
" Sorry , " he says , tears rolling down his face .
" I 'm sorry . "
Watch Acevedo's emotional account of being freed »
Acevedo's story is one that was never supposed to be told .
" We had to sign an affidavit ... [ saying ] we never went through what we went through .
We were n't supposed to say a word , " he says .
The U.S. Army Center of Military History provided CNN a copy of the document signed by soldiers at the camp before they were sent back home .
" You must be particularly on your guard with persons representing the press , " it says .
" You must give no account of your experience in books , newspapers , periodicals , or in broadcasts or in lectures . "
The document ends with : " I understand that disclosure to anyone else will make me liable to disciplinary action . "
Watch diary of a POW at slave camp »
The information was kept secret " to protect escape and evasion techniques and the names of personnel who helped POW escapees , " said Frank Shirer , the chief archivist at the U.S. Army Center for Military History .
Acevedo sees it differently .
For a soldier who survived one of the worst atrocities of mankind , the military 's reaction is still painful to accept .
" My stomach turned to acid , and the government did n't care .
They did n't give a hullabaloo . "
It took more than 50 years , he says , before he received 100 percent disability benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .
Despite everything Acevedo endured during the war , little had prepared him for his own father 's attitude toward his capture .
" My dad told me I was a coward , " he says .
" I turned around and got my duffel bag , my luggage , and said , ' This is it , Father .
I 'm not coming back . '
So I took the train the following day , and I did n't see my parents for years , because I did n't want to see them .
I felt belittled . "
For decades , Acevedo followed the rules and kept his mouth shut .
His four children did n't know the extent of his war experience .
He says he felt stymied because of the document he signed .
" You never gave it a thought because of that paper . "
Now , he says it 's too important to be forgotten .
In recent years , he 's attended local high schools to tell his story to today 's generation .
" Let it be known , " he says .
" People have to know what happened . "
Born July 31 , 1924 , in San Bernardino , California , Anthony C. Acevedo is what is known in today 's parlance as a " citizen child " -- one who was born in the United States to parents from Mexico .
iReport :
Tell us your war stories
A Mexican - American , he was schooled in Pasadena , California , but could n't attend the same classes as his white peers .
" We could n't mix with white people , " he says .
Both of his parents were deported to Mexico in 1937 , and he went with them .
Acevedo returned to the States when he was 17 , he says , because he wanted to enlist in the U.S. Army .
He received medical training in Illinois before being sent to the European theater .
A corporal , he served as a medic for the 275th Infantry Regiment of the 70th Infantry Division .
Acevedo was captured at the Battle of the Bulge after days of brutal firefights with Nazis who surrounded them .
He recalls seeing another medic , Murray Pruzan , being gunned down .
" When I saw him stretched out there in the snow , frozen , " Acevedo says , shaking his head .
" God , that 's the only time I cried when I saw him .
He was stretched out , just massacred by a machine gun with his Red Cross band . "
He pauses .
" You see all of them dying out there in the fields .
You have to build a thick wall . "
Acevedo was initially taken to a prison camp known as Stalag IX - B in Bad Orb , Germany , where thousands of American , French , Italian and Russian soldiers were held as prisoners of war .
Acevedo's diary entry reads simply : " Was captured the 6th of January 1945 . "
For the next several months , he would be known by the Germans only as Prisoner Number 27016 .
One day while in Stalag IX - B , he says , a German commander gathered American soldiers and asked all Jews " to take one step forward . "
Few willingly did so .
Watch Acevedo describe being selected as an " undesirable " »
Jewish soldiers wearing Star of David necklaces began yanking them off , he says .
About 90 Jewish soldiers and another 260 U.S. soldiers deemed " undesirables " -- those who " looked like Jews " -- were selected .
Acevedo , who is not Jewish , was among them .
They were told they were being sent to " a beautiful camp " with a theater and live shows .
" It turned out to be the opposite , " he says .
" They put us on a train , and we traveled six days and six nights .
It was a boxcar that would fit heads of cattle .
They had us 80 to a boxcar .
You could n't squat .
And there was little tiny windows that you could barely see through . "
It was February 8 , 1945 , when they arrived .
The new camp was known as Berga an der Elster , a subcamp of Buchenwald , the Nazi concentration camp where tens of thousands of Jews and other political prisoners were killed under Adolf Hitler 's regime .
See the horrors of Buchenwald »
Acevedo says he was one of six medics among the 350 U.S. soldiers at Berga .
Political prisoners from other countries were held at Berga separate from the Americans .
" We did n't mingle with them at all , " he says , adding that the U.S. soldiers worked in the same tunnels as the other political prisoners .
" We were all just thin as a rail . "
The U.S. prisoners , Acevedo says , were given 100 grams of bread per week made of redwood sawdust , ground glass and barley .
Soup was made from cats and rats , he says .
Eating dandelion leaves was considered a " gourmet meal . "
If soldiers tried to escape , they would be shot and killed .
If they were captured alive , they would be executed with gunshots to their foreheads , Acevedo says .
Wooden bullets , he says , were used to shatter the inside of their brains .
Medics were always asked to fill the execution holes with wax , he says .
" Prisoners were being murdered and tortured by the Nazis .
Many of our men died , and I tried keeping track of who they were and how they died . "
The soldiers were forced to sleep naked , two to a bunk , with no blankets .
As the days and weeks progressed , his diary catalogs it all .
The names , prisoner numbers and causes of death are listed by the dozens in his diary .
He felt it was his duty as a medic to keep track of everyone .
" I 'm glad I did it , " he says .
As a medic , he says , he heard of other more horrific atrocities committed by the Nazis at camps around them .
" We heard about experiments that they were doing -- peeling the skins of people , humans , political prisoners , making lampshades . "
Watch Acevedo talk about Nazi atrocities »
He and the other soldiers were once taken to what Acevedo believes was the main camp of Buchenwald , about 30 miles ( 48 kilometers ) from Berga .
They noticed large pipes coming from one building .
" We thought we were going to be gassed when we were told to take our clothes off , " he says .
" We were scared .
We were stripped . "
" Rumors were around that this was where the political prisoners would be suffocated with gas . "
It turned out to be a shower , the only time during their captivity they were allowed to bathe .
The main Buchenwald camp was officially liberated on April 11 , 1945 .
But the camp and its subcamps were emptied of tens of thousands of prisoners as American troops neared .
The U.S. troops held at the Berga compound were no exception .
" Very definite that we are moving away from here and on foot .
This is n't very good for our sick men .
No drinking water and no latrines , " Acevedo wrote in his diary on April 4 , 1945 .
He says they began a death march of 217 miles ( 349 kilometers ) that would last three weeks .
More than 300 U.S. soldiers were alive at the start of the march , he says ; about 165 were left by the end , when they were finally liberated .
Lines of political prisoners in front of them during the march caught the full brunt of angry Nazi soldiers .
" We saw massacres of people being slaughtered off the highway .
Women , children , " he says .
" You could see people of all ages , hanging on barbed wire . "
One of his diary entries exemplifies an extraordinary patriotism among soldiers , even as they were being marched to their deaths .
" Bad news for us .
President Roosevelt 's death .
We all felt bad about it .
We held a prayer service for the repose of his soul , " Acevedo wrote on April 13 , 1945 .
It adds , " Burdeski died today . "
To this day , Acevedo still remembers that soldier .
He wanted to perform a tracheotomy using his diary pen to save Burdeski , a 41 - year - old father of six children .
A German commander struck Acevedo in the jaw with a rifle when he asked .
" I 'll never forget , " he says .
On a recent day , about a dozen prisoners of war held during World War II and their liberators gathered at the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center in Loma Linda , California .
Many applauded Acevedo for his heroics .
" Those of us in combat have our own heroes , and those are the medics .
And that 's Antonio .
Thank you , Antonio , " one of the men said .
The men gathered there nodded their heads .
Two stood to shake Acevedo's hand .
" The people that are in this room really are an endangered species , " another man said .
" When they 're gone , they 're gone .
...
That is why they should be honored and put in history for generations to come , because there are not that many of them left . "
Donald George sat next to Acevedo .
The two were captured about a half - mile apart during the Battle of the Bulge .
" It 's hard to explain how it is to be sitting with a bunch of people that you know they 've been through the same thing you 've been through , " George said .
" Some of us want to talk about it , and some of us do n't .
Some of us want to cry about it once in a while , and some of us wo n't .
But it 's all there , " he said .
" We still like to come and be together a couple times a month , " George added , before Acevedo finished his sentence : " To exchange what you are holding back inside . "
Acevedo says the world must never forget the atrocities of World War II and that for killing 6 million Jews , Hitler was the worst terrorist of all time .
He does n't want the world to ever slide backward .
His message on this Veterans Day , he says , is never to hold animosity toward anybody .
" You only live once .
Let 's keep trucking .
If we do n't do that , who 's going to do it for us ?
We have to be happy .
Why hate ? " he says .
" The world is full of hate , and yet they do n't know what they want . "

( Natural News ) Drinking green tea may help prevent heart disease and stroke , according to a study conducted by researchers from the Athens Medical School in Greece and published in the " A couple of cups a day would probably be a good dose for people , " researcher Charalambos Vlachopoulos said .
" This is the first study to show these effects for green tea .
" Prior research has indicated that black tea can improve cardiovascular health , leading researchers suspect that green tea might even more effective .
Many of the beneficial health effects of tea are attributed to its high content of antioxidant polyphenols , especially flavonoids .
Most of these polyphenols are destroyed , however , by the fermentation process that makes tea black .
This is why green tea has a water - extractable polyphenol content of between 30 and 40 percent , while the content in black tea is only 3 to 10 percent .
Oolong tea , which is partially fermented , has a polyphenol content between that of green and black tea .
In the current study , researchers had 14 volunteers drink three different beverages , on three separate occasions : 6 grams of green tea , 125 milligrams of caffeine ( the amount found in 6 grams of green tea ) and a cup of hot water .
They measured the flow - mediated dilation ( FMD ) of the participants ' blood vessels at 30 , 90 and 120 minutes after consumption .
FMD is a widely used measure of blood vessel health .
The participants ' FMD improved by an average of 3.9 percent within 30 minutes of drinking green tea .
It did not change at all in those who drank either the caffeine or hot water .
" Green tea is consumed less in the Western world than black tea , but it could be more beneficial because of the way it seems to improve [ circulatory ] function , " Vlachopoulos said .
He also noted that a number of studies have linked green tea to various cancer - fighting effects .

The pelican that tried to eat the dog who stole his supper
Ever heard the one about the dog and the pelican ?
In one of the most unlikely power struggles of the animal kingdom , these extraordinary images show the moment when a one - year - old exotic bird bit off more than it could chew .
Captured by Roland Adam at his exotic bird farm in Germany , they show how Petri the pelican and Katijina the Rhodesian Ridgeback played out an improbable contest for a free meal .
Suppertime : Petri takes a nip at Katjinga 's face as she searches for her stolen meal
' I was preparing food for the birds in our outdoor kitchen , when I noticed Petri at my side looking for a snack , ' explained 38 - year - old Roland .
' I decided to feed her one of the chicks I had been preparing when Katjinga raced in , caught the frozen bird mid-air and gobbled up Petri 's dinner . '
Confused and slightly miffed at losing out on a free meal , Petri decided to search every inch of Katjinga in search of the discarded chick .
Open wide : Petri peers closely inside Katjinga 's mouth for any trace of her meal
' It was hilarious , ' laughs Roland .
' We have so many animals on the farm that they are very tame and at ease with each other .
' Katijinga is no different and she was more than happy to allow Petri to come in for closer inspection . '
Roland , who runs an exotic bird farm in Hoerstel near Osnabrueck , which houses everything from ostriches to flamingos , said : " You see a lot of things on my farm but I have never seen anything like this before and I just had to get my camera to prove it was real , ' he says .
' But I suppose when it came down to it , Katijinga was just too quick ! '
While the iPhone 3G is selling and people are waiting to for the iPhone 3G Unlock , there are other iPhone or iPod Designs that could be seen as actual art .
Yes , there is Apple Mac Art , iPhone wannabe Microsoft Zune Phone and even certain Apple fans will call the actual touchscreen itself a piece of art , but here we are talking about different iPhone and iPod Creations .
Below you will find a collection of different iPhone and iPod Designs such as cakes , coasters , covers , buildings and much more iPhone love .
We would be happy to hear of more , so please comment on others you came across .
1 iPhone Cakes
The different iPhone design cakes below come in different sizes and different iPhone applications .
The ones from GarrettDimon and TUAW also make sure to mark the AT&T carrier on top … hoping no one would think they actually have an unlocked iPhone cake .
The third from icruise_flickr is the rebel but hopefully wo n’t brick .
2 iPhone App Coasters
While certain iPhone parodies once mentioned the iPhone could be used as a coaster , this useful iPhone design seen at Technabob seems much better .
Different coasters were designed based on separate iPhone apps to provide a colorful solution for your coffee table .
3 iPod Shuffle and Nano Covers
Gizmodo presented these two cool covers for the iPod Shuffle and older iPod Nano .
Both are really cute and give a sense of Nostalgia : one by the colorful Apple Logo and the other with the Monstrous Godzilla .
4 iPad Building
I first saw this iPhone ( or iPod ) resembling building at LuxuryLaunches .
It may not be exactly like an iPhone but there is something about it that makes it look like it has been at least inspired by the iPhone .
True , it also resembles a Tetris Building , but the lights , proportional size and futuristic look reminds of the Apple cellphone .
5 Giant Macbook Powered iPhone
So this giant iPhone is not independent but still has a beautiful screen .
As TechEBlog mentioned , at least it is not causing an embarassment by using a Windows system and staying true to the Apple seeds .
6 Warped iPod
Better than having your iPod warp from the sun or car heat , this art piece seen at Engadget is a warped iPod all together .
We are told that while this special iPod may look a little odd , it is still fully functional .
I still prefer a pocket size .
7 Cupcake Apps
Which app will you choose ?
These amazing cupcakes found at Neatorama make the iPhone apps even more attractive ; they are sweet , bite - size , and extremely colorful .
8 iBone
What would you rather have your Dog chew on , your iPhone 3G or an iPhone look - alike chew toy from NerdApproved ?
With the iBone , the answer is pretty easy , so you do n’t really need to think about it .
9 Retro iPod Cover
Remember the Sony Walkman ?
Well , here an iPod Cassette Cover resembles the old cassette players .
We ca n’t let go of these old tapes and must give tribute to them .
Another example is the Cassette Closet .
10 iPhone R.I.P
While there is a Steve Jobs Tombstone , this iPhone Coffin is just for the Apple cellphone .
Even when pondering its demise , the iPhone retain its clean and bright color , along with the many applications .
11 DJ iPod
Two iPods were connected and using the scroll wheel , becoming a small iPod DJ station .
12 Needle Felted
It is not like Mike Tyson Craft but Steve Job ’s craft is just the same .
This needle felted iPhone found at Geekologie is cute , warm and fuzzy .
13 iPod Nano Package Speakers
A while back , a kit was created to make an iPod Nano Package Speaker Case .
The Nano changed a lot since , but the package should still be possible to convert .
14 iPhone T - Shirt
Just last month , there were a lot of creative Halloween Craft DIY ideas , different Pumpkin Faces Carvings , and also some costume creations .
Make presented the iPhone T Shirt to make you into a human size walking iPhone .
There was more war than there was peace on the McCain - Palin ticket , American voters are starting to learn , especially in the last few weeks of the presidential election as top lieutenants serving the senator from Arizona became increasingly appalled by the freelancing ways of the very well - dressed governor from Alaska .
Mr McCain barely knew Ms Palin when he chose her .
And aside from those few rallies when they appeared together , for instance in Hershey , Pennsylvania , one week before polling day , they barely spoke to each on the trail , especially towards the end .
The recriminations will be flowing both ways .
Ms Palin , who has returned to Alaska after commenting briefly on the tensions in Arizona on Wednesday , has more reason to manage the post - poll gossip - trading to her advantage than does Mr McCain .
He is returning to his Senate job and his ambitions beyond are of the golfing variety .
Not so Ms Palin , whom some see as a future leader of her party .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" There is absolutely no diva in me , " she told reporters in Phoenix .
If she meant it to be good - humoured , the context was much more brittle .
Diva was the pejorative term applied to Ms Palin in the dying days of the campaign by an unidentified source in the McCain circle .
On the day she and Mr McCain appeared together in Hershey , a writer for the Politico website reported a McCain aide calling her a " whack job " .
That Ms Palin was at times disinclined to listen too closely to the guidance being offered by Mr McCain 's advisers and had the capacity sometimes to head off in her own direction was on display even late on Tuesday , when ballot returns were painting the full extent of the ticket 's disaster .
As Mr McCain was preparing to give his concession speech in Phoenix , she announced she wanted to say some words too .
In fact , Ms Palin approached Mr McCain on Tuesday about speaking before him at the Biltmore Hotel and said she even had the speech prepared and in her pocket .
Two of the senator 's top aides had to step forward and tell her " No " .
Traditionally , running mates never take the microphone on polling day .
While the governor 's concern now is protecting her reputation and her paths to higher office in the future , the priority of some staffers that were around Mr McCain is slightly different .
They badly need scapegoats for everything that went wrong and Ms Palin comes to their minds faster than a moth to light .
Thus , with her barely back in the picture - windowed living room of her lakeside house in Wasilla , stories of incompetence , disrespect and general waywardness are spewing forth .
Good heavens , who knew that she once received McCain aides in her hotel room dressed only in a towel ?
Or that she confidently imagined that Africa was a country ( nowhere near Alaska or her bedroom ) and not a continent ?
While Mr McCain reportedly harboured some lingering admiration for Ms Palin and her talents , particularly as a campaigner , his top advisers reportedly lost patience with her very quickly indeed .
We can assume that some of the stories emerging now are a little larded .
But clearly something went awry , whether we are talking about awful television interviews or outrageous shopping sprees .
" I have absolutely no intention in engaging in any of the negativity because this has been all positive for me , " Ms Palin said in Arizona .
( Never mind that she has also taken time since Tuesday to explain how negative her feelings are about the media and its alleged unfair treatment of her . )

She would not , she said , " let the pettiness or maybe internal workings of a campaign erode any of the recognition of this historic moment . "
She was referring not to the McCain loss , but the Obama victory .
Even the reliably conservative Fox News channel may be turning against Governor Palin , however , being the first this week to report the consternation experienced by the McCain team on discovering that the governor really did think Africa was a country .
Allegedly she also could not name the three countries of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
They would be Canada , the US and Mexico .
We are also learning of the dismay in the McCain team after news broke last weekend of Ms Palin taking a prank call from a Canadian radio comedian claiming to be President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , during which she remarked she could be America 's leader " maybe in eight years " .
It seems that no one from the Palin side told the McCain side that a call with M. Sarkozy ( or not Sarkozy ) was even on her schedule .
The wardrobe debacle is already the stuff of legend .
It now seems Ms Palin was encouraged by a senior McCain aide to perhaps purchase three suits for the party convention in St Paul in early September and maybe three more for the campaign trail thereafter .
When word surfaced that the Republican National Committee had splurged $ 150,000 on clothes for the governor , the McCain circle was beyond apoplectic .
Some reports this week now say the amount may even have been tens of thousands higher than that .
What may have really cooked Ms Palin – the last polls before voting depicted her not as an asset to the ticket but as a drag – were her media appearances .
We know that she was prepped intensely for her first big TV interview with Charlie Gibson of ABC and it went reasonably well .
There was nowhere near so much preparation for her encounters afterwards with Katie Couric of CBS , however .
Some in the McCain orbit have asserted that Ms Palin refused pre-Couric prepping .
Other sources have said the Alaskan governor did n't have the time or " bandwidth " for it .
The conversations were recorded while Ms Palin was in New York meeting world leaders at the United Nations .
In any event , the interview was an absolute disaster , pure and simple .
Garbled responses on the economic bail - out and , most famously , on Russia and its proximity to her lawn , gave rise to a second Palin – the one as played by Tina Fey on Saturday Night Live .
Both may now disappear for a while .
Some will miss them , but not those still loyal to Senator McCain .

Lightning induced to study high - speed particle emissions
15:54:51 2003 02 03 - mab - from meteorology
Prospects for success in the world 's struggle to combat global warming have been transformed at a stroke after US President - elect Barack Obama made it clear that America would play its full part in renewing the Kyoto Protocol climate - change treaty .
His words , in effect , brought an end to eight years of wilful climate obstructionism by the administration of George Bush , who withdrew the US from Kyoto in March 2001 , thus doing incalculable damage to the efforts of the international community to construct a unified response to the threat .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Bush withdrawal set back the international effort by nearly a decade – years in which it became increasingly clear that the warming of the atmosphere being caused by greenhouse gas emissions was proceeding much faster than UN scientists thought it would .
Although Mr Bush and the oilman - caucus in his government justified their Kyoto withdrawal by casting doubt on whether climate change was happening , or was caused by human actions , by last year the scientific consensus on both propositions was so great that Bush aides had to reluctantly accept both were true .
But Mr Bush 's diplomatic stance hardly changed .
In contrast , the President - elect 's remarks , in a video address to a global warming summit in California attended by US governors and representatives from other nations , instantly injected a new mood of optimism among negotiators preparing for the conference at which Kyoto will be renewed and extended , due to take place in Copenhagen in December 2009 .
" This is an incredibly welcome statement about the need not to delay , and it will send a very positive message around the world , especially to the developing countries , " said a British source involved with negotiations .
The Obama message was clearly timed to influence the interim negotiating meeting being held in Poznan , Poland , next month , which Mr Obama reminded his audience he could not attend , " because the United States has only one president at a time " .
Mr Bush remains president until the Obama inauguration on 20 January .
But if he will not be present in Poland personally , his latest pronouncement made it clear he will be very much there in spirit .
" Once I take office , you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations , and help lead the world toward a new era of global co-operation on climate change , " he said .
And he went on to make the key pledge that the US would once again accept targets to reduce its own emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions , which – alongside China 's – are the highest in the world .
" We will establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them by an additional 80 percent by 2050 , " he said .
Mr Obama had made his support for action clear as a presidential candidate , but he has now spelled out new yearly targets .
It signals that the US is at last coming in from the cold – and that is the essential prerequisite for success at Copenhagen , which will try to map out a way for the world to hold global temperature rises to two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level – regarded as the maximum the earth and its human communities can safely sustain .
The trick will be to balance the burden - sharing – in essence , to get the US and China to act together , when each has been concerned about the other trying to get a free ride .
It has to be the US that takes the lead and Mr Obama recognised that explicitly .
" My presidency will mark a new chapter in America 's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process , " he said .
His words were instantly applauded as " fantastic " by California 's Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , a leading force for environmental changes in the face of White House obstinacy .
" These were inspirational words from Obama , " said Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch .
" He basically said that , even though the world economy is less than healthy , global warming remains an absolutely top priority .
It means the United States is now ready to take on a leadership role in combating climate change . "
Behind Mr Obama 's words is the big idea that energy - hogging is at the root of US economic problems at home and security problems abroad .
America 's gluttonous oil consumption is unsustainable , damaging the environment and making the country dependent on unstable parts of the world for its energy which , in the end , has become a threat to its national security .
Mr Obama says he is committed to pumping $ 150bn into transforming the economy to cut oil consumption dramatically and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
He wants to start with US car manufacturers – which already need rescuing – to ensure they make hybrid or petrol - sipping cars .
From the begging bowl to the bread basket : in just two years , Malawi has gone from famine to food surplus - according to national statistics .
Smallholder farmers are being given access to new crop breeds ; fertilisers ; irrigation systems ; and new techniques in crop rotation and soil management .
Agro-science is helping families to cope with climate change and helping Malawi to buck the trend in neighbouring African countries .
BBC science and environment reporter James Morgan has gone into the field to meet the families who are sowing the seeds of what is being hailed as " a uniquely African green revolution " .
TUESDAY 07 OCTOBER - RISING FROM THE ASHES
The dance traditionally celebrates a successful harvest
The women of Mnduka village are pounding their drums .
Under the shade of a mango tree , a crowd is gathering around a masked man , who is twisting , thrashing , throwing himself at the dust , over and over again .
He appears possessed - demonic , even .
But everyone is cheering him .
This is n't an exorcism , it 's a celebration .
" Gule Wamkulu " - literally the " Big Dance " - traditionally marks the end of a successful harvest .
The masked figure is either a spirit , an animal , or a ghost - everyone I ask spins me a different spooky yarn .
But what they all agree on , is that he has risen from the graveyard , " and he is very , very happy " .
Happy as everyone here in Mnduka village has been at harvest time , I am told , since the fertiliser subsidy programme began .
I came to Mnduka to find out whether Malawi's much trumpeted " green revolution " is science fact or romantic fiction .
Despite claims of a " food surplus " , a national newspaper today carries a front page story warning of impending food shortages in six regions , affecting 1.5 m Malawians - about one tenth of the population .
Pump priming - irrigation drastically improves crop yields
Three years ago , Mnduka was a dustbowl too .
The drought of 2005 was as harsh here as anywhere in Malawi .
Among the farmers , a quick show of hands reveals the vast majority were already growing high yielding varieties of hybrid maize .
But without access to affordable fertiliser , their family stockpiles ran out in three months .
" Every day , we had to look for work just to eat that night , says Esther Chirwa , 28 , who supports a household of five .
" We were living from hand to mouth . "
" I travelled far and wide just to find food , " says Nixon , 58 , who harvested only 10 bags , which had to feed a family of six for a year .
" When you are away for so long , your family suffers . "
Today , as we are led between the maize fields , the place has the feel of an African fairytale .
Down by the murky brown stream , the local farmers take turns to sweat it out on the irrigation pedal foot pump - mercifully shaded by bushes .
The field alongside - once scrubland - is now blossoming into a small oasis of peppers and maize - " the garden " they call it .
The idea is simple - one village garden will train a hundred farmers how to irrigate .
The foot pump and simple water piping were funded by an NGO , but across Malawi , it is the government which has taken the lead irrigation , with an ambitious program to create a " green belt " stretching along the shores of Lake Malawi .
Lost in the maize - a girl shows off crops grown with help of irrigation " Remember - with irrigation , you can harvest three maize crops a year , " says Phyness Thembulembu from US - based NGO Citizens Network for Foreign Affair ( CNFA ) .
Meanwhile , over on the hillside , the farmers are teaching each other how to plant cassava - a drought resistant alternative to maize .
" The crop is common in other areas of the country , but back in 2005 , very few here were growing it , " says Phyness .
" After the drought , they had to think again " .
But the centrepiece of the village model is the agrodealer .
A local shopkeeper has been given grants and technical training to advise farmers on fertilisers and hybrid seeds .
The shop is one of several thousand in a national a program funded by AGRA , and implemented here in Mnduka by CNFA .
" In the past , the farmers had to travel 18 km to access the high yielding varieties ( CNFA has a target of 5 km ) - an expensive and time consuming trip , when you are struggling to support a household of six or seven , " says Matthews Matale , an agrodealer from a neighbouring town .
Now the seeds are on their doorstep .
With support from CNFA , the agrodealer holds annual crop demonstrations and the farmers choose the seed variety they favour .
" The most popular in my shop , " says Dinah Kapizan , " are the maize seeds that come in animal varieties - monkeys , elephants and lions .
" Monkeys are the quickest to maturity , the elephants next , and then the longest , but with the greatest yields , are the lions . "
A clever marketing ploy , but it 's simpler than remembering the difference between MH18 and DK8A31 .
I for one , am grateful .
A bag of monkey or elephant ?
Seed varieties get easy to remember names Esther , too is grateful for the seeds , the shorter travelling distance to the agrodealer , and most importantly , the subsidies .
" It 's clear we are having bigger harvests now , with the fertiliser .
I am able to sell some .
The only thing I fear for is what happens if they take the subsidy away . "
The dependency cannot be underestimated .
The biggest round of applause under the mango tree was not for the wild ghost - man dancing , but for the local headman - when he called for fertiliser to be stocked here in the village , like the seeds .
" My worry though , is can this really be sustainable in the long term ? " , says France Gondwe , of Malawi's World Agroforestry Centre ( ICRAF ) .
" The Nitrogen fertiliser is a quick fix - but without it , the harvest is low , because the soils are suffering from years of [ monoculture ] .
Even with the fertiliser , they are not performing to their full potential .
" There are alternatives to fertiliser - crop rotation , manure , agroforestry .
But with the food shortages , the government is trapped .
And so the people are trapped too . "
Back under the mango tree , the mysterious masked man takes a bow and races off through the crowd , and over the hill in the direction of the graveyard .
Mnduka too has risen from the graveyard - but the dancing goes on , for now at least .
MONDAY 06 OCTOBER - MAIZE EVERYWHERE
Piled 19 bags high ; when I say bags , I 'm talking about the kind of sacks you can dam rivers with .
I tried lifting one .
At 50kg , that was a big mistake .
I left that to the army of youngsters with Popeye biceps , who were loading Malawi 's mammoth maize harvest onto lorries , bound for government sales depots around the country .
" If you came here just a few years ago , you would find this storage depot totally empty , " says Feckson Kantonga , operations manager for the government - sponsored Agriculture Development and Marketing Corporation ( Admarc ) .
The locals made carrying 50kg bags of maize look easy Feckson is standing at the foot of a pile of maize as tall a house .
He has put his best suit on to welcome a Kenyan film crew , who had come from Nairobi to find out the secret of Malawi 's success .
How exactly can it be , they are wondering , that their prosperous nation has come to depend on little old Malawi ( the 13th poorest nation in the world ) to supply its staple food crop ?
" Malawi ? " asks Peter , a business journalist .
" We Kenyans know nothing of Malawi .
I had to look the place up on Google to find out what the heck was going on here . "
The answer is hidden inside the sacks .
They are fat - packed with new hybrid corn varieties - strains that were unheard of in Malawi a decade ago .
Bred by multinationals in Malawi , or crop centres in Zimbabwe and Sudan , the plants are high - yielding and fast - growing - plants with bigger cobs and shorter maturation periods .
With global warming , it is essential the plants make the most of any rains while they last - " a crop for every drop " , to quote the motto of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( Agra ) .
The high - yield crops have a large appetite for fertiliser
But the most popular hybrid varieties are those that remain " poundable " .
That is , the grains can still be beaten into flour in the traditional way .
" Are you telling me you have you never pounded maize , James ? " smiles Cathy , a Kenyan journalist , with a cheeky wink .
" You know in Kenya , a woman is not considered fit enough to be a bride until she can pound a bag of maize .
And a boy is not a man until he can build a house . "
Where does that leave me ?
Still out of breath from lifting the maize sack .
And it is not only maize .
There are hybrids for every local crop - cassava , sweet potato , soya , ground nuts and legumes .
But the most remarkable thing about these " miracle seeds " is that many are not new at all .
" They have been with us for decades , but they never made it to the fields , " says Agra 's Fred Muhhuku , an expert on agronomics in East Africa .
" Traditionally , farmers have either been too poor or too afraid to take a chance on these new varieties , even though they can triple their yields , " he explained .
" If they plant their hardy traditional strains , they know that come drought or flood , some crop will survive to harvest .
The harvest will be tiny - maybe 800 kg per hectare - but it is guaranteed , so they take no chances . "
Farmers sell their surplus and buy animals with the proceeds
The result was six successive years of food shortage in Malawi - beginning in 2000 .
" And there was no lack of rains , I can tell you , " says Dr Jeffrey Luhanga , technical co-ordinator at the Ministry for Agriculture .
" I experienced the famine in 2005 ; there were lines of people queuing for food aid .
" The thing you have to remember is that these were the ones who were still strong enough to walk to the depots .
The hungriest - the ones who really needed the food - they were stuck at home , starving .
" Now look around Malawi , you see only healthy faces .
Yes , this is a green revolution .
And it is being driven by science . "
He reels off a list of programmes - irrigation , agronomy , planting patterns , science - based economic practices .
" These technologies have been in our research institutes for years , but they went nowhere .
Now , for the first time , the technology is in the farmers ' hands . "
Seeds of hope ?
It begins with the seeds .
The hybrid maize varieties are high yielding - around 2,500 kg / hectare or more .
" I grew 80 bags this year , in the land just around my house .
Eighty bags ! " says Mitengo Gamr , one of Admarc 's regional managers .
" My family no longer queues to buy food . "
But they come with a catch - they are addicted to costly nitrogen fertiliser .
" But it is worth the investment , " explains Muhhuku , " because the extra maize you grow , you can sell to pay for the fertiliser , buy an animal for your farm and diversify .
You can build security . "
And what if the rains fail ?
" Then you have enough left over from your big harvest last year , " he smiles .
Other African nations are looking at Malawi's maize boom with interest " It 's true , it 's a different way of farming and it takes some convincing . "
The other drawback is what is known as post - harvest management .
The hybrids yield more flour , but the grains are less resistant to worms and weevils .
" In some places , you lose 40 % of your storage , " says Muhhuku .
The answer , inevitably , is pesticides , another expensive input .
The margins are still favourable , but what if you can't afford to invest in the first place ?
This is where the Malawian government has stepped in .
A month or two from now , 1.5 m of the poorest subsistence farmers will begin arriving at Admarc 's depots , clutching four coupons : one for seeds , two for fertilisers and another for legumes .
This year , for the first time , pesticides will be subsidised too .
It 's an enormous cost burden for a developing economy to bear - which is why the past , African governments have preferred to rely on private investment and foreign aid .
Malawi has gambled - and last year , the reward was millions of dollars of maize export revenues .
" I am just back from New York , from a UN conference , where they had an entire session dedicated to Malawi , " beams Dr Luhanga .
" Other African countries - they want to know if they can follow our example .
Kenya , Tanzania , Swaziland - they are thinking of introducing subsidies .
This green revolution - it is truly for the whole of Africa . "
Where is the catch ?
Certainly , the revolution has not stopped the market price of maize from doubling in a year - from 30 kwachas ( £ 0.12 ) per kilogram to 60 kwachas .
The government , controversially , has passed a law capping the price at 52 kwachas - an emergency measure .
But utter the words " technological dependency " to Muhhuku , and he simply shakes his head .
" We hear this accusation from western development workers .
We are told ' why make farmers buy seeds every year ?
Why let the companies trap you ? '
But this is based on a misunderstanding .
Storing the hybrid seeds - it takes a lot of technical knowledge .
" The farmers can stick to their traditional ways .
But the yields are not worth their sweat . "
Tomorrow , I will meet the farmers and ask them myself .
SUNDAY 05 OCTOBER - SIZING UP MALAWI'S MIRACLE
Although there is plenty it does not come cheaply " If [ environmentalists ] lived for just one month among the misery of the developing world , as I have for 50 years , they'd be crying out for tractors and fertiliser and irrigation canals . "
So said Norman Borlaug , one of the founding fathers of the original Green Revolution - credited with wiping out starvation in Asia .
But can technology really be the saviour of Africa 's struggling farmers ?
It has become a terribly unfashionable opinion in the UK , where " green " campaigners are no longer content to denounce GM crop trials .
They simply rip them up .
" Responsible biotechnology is not the enemy , " said Borlaug .
" Starvation is . "
I have decided to take Norm up on his wager , by coming to Malawi to see for myself .
Because no matter how many UN reports I 've ploughed through , grasping the root cause of the current " food crisis " in Africa is anything but straightforward .
And neither is my journey to Malawi - a sweaty overnight haul which takes me via Kenya , Zambia , and several re-runs of Indiana Jones films .
But for heroic inspiration , I look instead to a speech by Kofi Annan , the new chairman of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( Agra ) - a $ 200 m , pan-African programme , funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates and Rockefeller foundations .
" Let us generate a uniquely African Green revolution , " says Annan , cutting a heroic pose on my crumpled transcript .
" There is nothing more important than this . "
It is difficult to argue .
Over the last 50 years , African farmers have laboured in the heat , while countries like Mexico , India and the Philippines have undergone a green revolution - applying novel fertilisers and pesticides to churn out bumper harvests of new high - yield varieties of wheat and rice .
Empowering farmers Meanwhile , Africa has been cultivating greater and greater poverty statistics .
Sub -Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where per capita food production has steadily declined .
The harvests have been great , but still the food prices in Malawi are still rocketing
Malcolm Fleming
One third of Africans are malnourished .
Soils are among the most depleted on Earth .
Farmers do not have access to productive seed varieties and those that do have neither the knowledge nor the tools to reap the harvest .
Slash and burn still reigns .
Climate change is forecasting ever more variable rainfalls , and more frequent droughts .
Add in soaring fuel prices and the scourge of HIV / Aids , and the average African finds himself surrounded in the kind of perilous predicament which from which even Harrison Ford would struggle to escape .
But it is this very challenge that has drawn the world 's crop scientists and agro-economists to Malawi .
They hope to pioneer novel farming systems that propel Africa towards a new era of food security .
It has already been dubbed by members of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) as " a greener revolution " .
" Greener " because it works with ecosystems , not against them .
A revolution that is " pro-poor and pro-environment " , in the words of Mr Annan .
The talk around the conference tables is of " empowering " subsistence farmers to find their own , local solutions - farming techniques which are sustainable , affordable and tailored to local soils , markets and eating preferences .
Over the next week , I 'll be taking a look at these projects first hand - catching fish in the desert , planting strange trees in the middle of maize crops .
I 'm wondering how women and men , who have been sowing the same maize seeds for generations , really feel about the new hybrid varieties of seeds which are more nutritious , but also more hungry for expensive pesticide and fertiliser .
' Against the grain '
Most of all , I 'm curious to find out whether the " miracle " we have read about here in Malawi is bona fide or illusory .
Is the revolution underway , or a simple matter of better rainfall ?
The facts are these .
During the last decade , Malawi suffered six successive years of food shortage , culminating in 2005 .
One third of the population - 4.5 million people - went hungry .
Step forward two years , and Malawi is exporting more than one million metric tonnes of maize , its staple crop .
High food prices have n't dampened their joy yet The government , against the advice of the IMF and the World Bank , has handed out vouchers to 1.5 m of the country 's poorest farmers , enabling them to buy " inputs " - seeds , fertiliser and pesticides .
Meanwhile , yields have mushroomed .
Malawians are selling maize to Kenya and giving food aid to Zimbabwe .
The success was hailed last year with Oxfam 's Malcolm Fleming describing to the BBC how Malawi was going against the grain of African agriculture .
So when I bump into Malcolm , a well - kent face in my native Scotland , on the flight to Lilongwe , I do n't hesitate to offer a warm handshake of congratulations .
" I 'm afraid that things have moved on since then , " he sighs .
" The harvests have been great , but still the food prices in Malawi are still rocketing . "
Why ?
" That 's the question , " he continues .
" The closer I look , the more complicated it becomes .
But from what I gather , the maize is being sold abroad at greater prices , and that keeps the prices up in Malawi . "
Malcolm is here doing research in the lead up to World Food Day on 16 October .
Helping him to raise awareness is another familiar Scottish face , but I 'm afraid I am sworn to secrecy .
All will be revealed in due course .
" Rising food prices might not be much of a problem for me or you , " says Mr Fleming , " but if you spend 80 % of your household income on food , and then the price doubles ... "
It is a welcome serving of realism pie to chew on as I step out of Lilongwe airport .
The pavements are covered in a blanket of purple blossom - it looks like a fairytale .
And the boys cartwheeling down the red dirt roads seem full of beans .
But the lumps in their bellies tell a different story .

US Covers Up their Murders and Sexual Abuses in Iraq
Why does the US occupation and the Iraqi government cover up such incidents ?
How many such incidents have the governments cover up ?
Why did they decrease the number of victims in their reports ?
Omar Abdullah Tawfiq is an Iraqi soldier .
One month ago , on October 11 , 2008 , he opened fire at a number of U.S. troops during a nightly raid carried out jointly by the Iraqi army and U.S. Soldiers in sites in Al - Mosul which were suspected locations of the so - called “ Al Qaeda ” ( civilians ) .
Omar killed four American soldiers and injured two .
Iraqi military sources declared that the soldier Omar Abdullah Tawfiq lost control of himself when he saw US marines sexually harassing an Iraqi girl of 17 in a house owned by an old man , her father .
The Iraqi soldier Omar was shot from behind by the other marines .
For unknown reasons both the Iraqi government and the occupational government of US in Iraq covered up to the killing the four American soldiers .
They announced the incident on the night of November 11 , 2008 , after they claimed that the incident came as a reaction because the Iraqi soldier had “ received a splat in the face by a U.S. soldier ” who was supposed to join the same raid against Iraqi civilians and their houses in Al - Mosul .
They also decreased the number of killed soldiers .
The shameful Interior Ministry of Iraq said that an Iraqi soldier on joint patrol with U.S. troops opened fire on his U.S. comrades in the northern city of Al - Mosul Wednesday , killing two of them and wounding others .
U.S. military spokeswoman Major Margaret Kageleiry said “ two U.S. soldiers have been killed today in Mosul .
I ca n’t make further comment ” .
Nobody ever refers to members of Congress as “ lions of the House , ” but Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) has as thick a mane as any ( figuratively speaking , of course ) .
The longest - serving current member , Dingell was writing legislation before Barack Obama was born , and has been at the forefront of congressional efforts to improve consumers ’ access to healthcare and protect them from harmful drugs .
Yet his unceremonious dumping last week as chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee might be the best news we ’ve heard since Obama ’s elevation to the White House .
At the risk of sounding ageist , which Obama was accused of when he said the same thing about John McCain , Dingell just does n’t get it .
The 82 - year - old lawmaker has been a mettlesome roadblock on the path toward greater energy independence and solutions to climate change for years .
He has consistently ( and until last year , successfully ) defended Detroit automakers against congressional attempts to improve fuel efficiency standards -- a stance that not only contributed to soaring oil prices but ultimately harmed the car makers themselves , because it left them unprepared for a shift in consumer taste toward smaller vehicles .
He is also at the center of a vast web of K Street interests , wielding his substantial fundraising powers to buy influence among fellow members of Congress and repaying his big donors , such as the mining industry , by weakening efforts to rein in pollution and greenhouse gases .
His replacement , Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , needs little introduction here in his hometown .
One of the House ’s canniest crafters of legislation , Waxman is a tireless proponent of clean energy , environmental protection and progressive healthcare policies .
There is no doubt that he will pursue Obama ’s top objectives , such as expanding health insurance coverage and renewable power , much more quickly than Dingell .
The only question is whether he will be able to do it as effectively ; widely disliked by conservatives and business interests , Waxman might have a tough time reaching consensus with the other side of the aisle .
Waxman ’s new post means that like - minded Californians now control the panels in both houses that will oversee climate change issues next year ; Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer heads the Senate ’s Environment and Public Works Committee .
Given that this state leads the nation in climate regulation and the development of clean technology , nothing could be more fitting .

One of the biggest frustrations facing journalists is being unable to get through to people on the phone .
But as Mary Harper discovered , contacting the Somali pirates on the Sirius Star turned out to be child 's play .
The pirates on the Sirius Star put the phone down on the BBC
It was a cold , dark , wet and miserable Sunday afternoon .
I was in my car , driving my 12 - year - old daughter and her friend back from a birthday party .
I was tired and fed up from being in the car .
" Mummy , mummy , " trilled a voice from the back .
" I want to phone the pirates . "
My daughter had heard me repeatedly trying to get through to the Somali pirates on board the Sirius Star .
They usually picked up the phone but put it down again when I said I was from the BBC .
My obsession with getting through to them had reached the point that I had even saved their number on my mobile phone .
" Mummy , mummy , please can I phone the pirates for you ? "
" No . " " Pleeeeez . "
By this time , with rain battering my windscreen and cars jamming the road , I was at the end of my tether .
" OK " , I said , tossing the phone into the back of the car .
" They are under P for pirates . "
Giggling with pirates " Hello .
Please can I talk to the pirates , " said my daughter in her obviously childish voice .
I could hear someone replying and a bizarre conversation ensued which eventually ended when my daughter collapsed in giggles .
Our last resource is the sea , and foreign trawlers are plundering our fish
Daybad , Somali priate
This was a breakthrough .
Dialogue had been established .
The next day , I went to the crowded office in Bush House in London where the BBC Somali Service is based .
I told them the story .
" Let 's try now , " said producer Said Musa , who , dare I say it , looks a bit like a pirate himself .
He has a wild look about him with flashing eyes and a swashbuckling saunter .
He dialled the number .
A pirate answered .
" I 'm sorry , " he barked in Somali , " the boss pirate is sleeping .
He was very busy last night keeping watch for possible attackers , night time , you know , is the busiest time for us .
Call back in two hours . "
Calm hostage A pirate , who called himself Daybad , spoke in Somali , calmly and confidently .
He said Somalis were left with no choice but to take to the high seas .
" We 've had no government for 18 years .
We have no life .
Our last resource is the sea , and foreign trawlers are plundering our fish . "
The pirate said the crew was being treated well .
" They can move from place to place .
They can sleep in their own beds , they even have their own keys .
The only thing they 're missing is their freedom to leave the ship . "
Suddenly I heard a voice speaking English .
" Hello .
This is the captain of the Sirius Star speaking . "
The captain , a Polish man called Marek Nishky , sounded surprisingly composed for a hostage .
He said he had no reason to complain , everybody was OK , and the pirates had allowed the crew to speak to their families .
As my questions became more challenging , he became more nervous .
I could almost see the pirates standing around him .
He said we would have to finish our conversation , and politely thanked me for my concern .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The phone line went dead .
But we had it , recordings of the pirate and the captain , and the interviews were broadcast all over the BBC .
Gun law The Somali Service at Bush House is behind most of the stories you hear about Somalia on the BBC .
It consists of a tiny group of people , far away from home , from a country torn to shreds after nearly two decades without a functioning central government .
That means no proper hospitals , no schools and no safety .
The gun means everything in Somalia .
The Somali Service enjoyed a real scoop with our interviews but who knows if it would have happened if my daughter had not persisted and pressed P for Pirates
One member of the team showed me photos of the concrete bench outside his house where his mother used to sit to make tea .
It was splattered with blood .
The house had been hit by a shell the day after his family left for the relative safety of the north .
Neighbours had been killed .
Who knows whether the property was targeted because of its BBC connection .
Despite their concerns about what may be happening back at home , the people in the Somali Service are the most hilarious , irreverent bunch of people in the building .
They smoke like chimneys , and laugh uproariously at the most unsuitable jokes .
They tease me mercilessly .
I was worth dozens of camels when I first arrived at the BBC as a fresh - faced young woman , they say , while now I may only be worth one or two camels , or maybe just a half .
The Somali Service enjoyed a real scoop with our interviews .
But who knows if it would have happened if my daughter had not persisted and pressed P for Pirates ?

On Friday November 21 , the world came within a hair 's breadth of the most colossal financial collapse in history according to bankers on the inside of events with whom we have contact .
The trigger was the bank which only two years ago was America 's largest , Citigroup .
The size of the US Government de facto nationalization of the $ 2 trillion banking institution is an indication of shocks yet to come in other major US and perhaps European banks thought to be ' too big to fail . '
The clumsy way in which US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , himself not a banker but a Wall Street ' investment banker ' , whose experience has been in the quite different world of buying and selling stocks or bonds or underwriting and selling same , has handled the unfolding crisis has been worse than incompetent .
It has made a grave situation into a globally alarming one .
' Spitting into the wind ' A case in point is the secretive manner in which Paulson has used the $ 700 billion in taxpayer funds voted him by a labile Congress in September .
Early on , Paulson put $ 125 billion in the nine largest banks , including $ 10 billion for his old firm , Goldman Sachs .
However , if we compare the value of the equity share that $ 125 billion bought with the market price of those banks ' stock , US taxpayers have paid $ 125 billion for bank stock that a private investor could have bought for $ 62.5 billion , according to a detailed analysis from Ron W. Bloom , economist with the US United Steelworkers union , whose members as well as pension fund face devastating losses were GM to fail .
That means half of the public 's money was a gift to Paulson 's Wall Street cronies .
Now , only weeks later , the Treasury is forced to intervene to de facto nationalize Citigroup .
It wo n't be the last .
Paulson demanded , and got from a labile US Congress , Democrat as well as Republican , sole discretion over how and where he can invest the $ 700 billion , to date with no effective oversight .
It amounts to the Treasury Secretary in effect ' spitting into the wind ' in terms of resolving the fundamental crisis .
It should be clear to any serious analyst by now that the September decision by Paulson to defer to rigid financial ideology and let the fourth largest US investment bank , Lehman Brothers fail , was the proximate trigger for the present global crisis .
Lehman Bros. ' surprise collapse triggered the current global crisis of confidence .
It was simply not clear to the rest of the banking world which US financial institution bank might be saved and which not , after the Government had earlier saved the far smaller Bear Stearns , while letting the larger , far more strategic Lehman Bros. fail .
Some Citigroup details
The most alarming aspect of the crisis is the fact that we are in an inter-regnum period when the next President has been elected but cannot act on the situation until after January 20 , 2009 when he is sworn in .
Consider the details of the latest Citigroup government de facto nationalization ( for ideological reasons Paulson and the Bush Administration hysterically avoid admitting they are in the process of nationalizing key banks ) .
Citigroup has more than $ 2 trillion of assets , dwarfing companies such as American International Group Inc. that got some $ 150 billion in US taxpayer funds in the past two months .
Ironically , only eight weeks before , the Government had designated Citigroup to take over the failing Wachovia Bank .
Normally authorities have an ailing bank absorbed by a stronger one .
In this instance the opposite seems to have been the case .
Now it is clear that the Citigroup was in deeper trouble than Wachovia .
In a matter of hours in the week before the US Government nationalization was announced , the stock value of Citibank plunged to $ 3.77 in New York , giving the company a market value of about $ 21 billion .
The market value of Citigroup stock in December 2006 had been $ 247 billion .
Two days before the bank nationalization the CEO , Vikram Pandit had announced a huge 52,000 job slashing plan .
It did nothing to stop the slide .
The scale of the hidden losses of perhaps the twenty largest US banks is so enormous that if not before , the first Presidential decree of President Barack Obama will likely have to be declaration of a US ' Bank Holiday ' and the full nationalization of the major banks , taking on the toxic assets and losses until the economy can again function with credit flowing to industry once more .
Citigroup and the government have identified a pool of about $ 306 billion in troubled assets .
Citigroup will absorb the first $ 29 billion in losses .
After that , remaining losses will be split between Citigroup and the government , with the bank absorbing 10 % and the government absorbing 90 % .
The US Treasury Department will use its $ 700 billion TARP or Troubled Asset Recovery Program bailout fund , to assume up to $ 5 billion of losses .
If necessary , the Government 's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) will bear the next $ 10 billion of losses .
Beyond that , the Federal Reserve will guarantee any additional losses .
The measures are without precedent in US financial history .
It 's by no means certain they will salvage the dollar system .
The situation is so intertwined , with six US major banks holding the vast bulk of worldwide financial derivatives exposure , that the failure of a single major US financial institution could result in losses to the OTC derivatives market of $ 300 - $ 400 billion , a new IMF working paper finds .
What 's more , since such a failure would likely cause cascading failures of other institutions .
Total global financial system losses could exceed another $ 1,500 billion according to an IMF study by Singh and Segoviano .
The madness over a Detroit GM rescue deal
The health of Citigroup is not the only gripping crisis that must be dealt with .
At this point , political and ideological bickering in the US Congress has so far prevented a simple emergency $ 25 billion loan extension to General Motors and other of the US Big Three automakers - Ford and Chrysler .
The absurd spectacle of US Congressmen attacking the chairmen of the Big Three for flying to the emergency Congressional hearings on a rescue loan in their private company jets while largely ignoring the issue of consequences to the economy of a GM failure underscores the utter lack of touch with reality that has overwhelmed Washington in recent years .
For GM to go into bankruptcy risks a disaster of colossal proportions .
Although Lehman Bros. , the biggest bankruptcy in US history , appears to have had an orderly settlement of its credit defaults swaps , the disruption occurred before - hand , as protection writers had to post additional collateral prior to settlement .
That was a major factor in the dramatic global market selloff in October .
GM is bigger by far , meaning bigger collateral damage , and this would take place when the financial system is even weaker than when Lehman failed .
In addition , a second , and potentially far more damaging issue , has been largely ignored .
The advocates of letting GM go bankrupt argue that it can go into Chapter 11 just like other big companies that get themselves in trouble .
That may not happen however , and a Chapter 7 or liquidation of GM that would then result would be a tectonic event .
The problem is that under Chapter 11 US law , it takes time for the company to get the protection of a bankruptcy court .
Until that time , which may be weeks or months , the company would need urgently ' bridge financing ' to continue operating .
This is known as ' Debtor - in - Possession or DIP financing .
DIP is essential for most Chapter 11 bankruptcies , as it takes time to get the plan of reorganization approved by creditors and the courts .
Most companies , like GM today , go to bankruptcy court when they are at the end of their liquidity .
DIP is specifically for companies in , or on the verge of bankruptcy , and the debt is generally senior to other outstanding creditor claims .
So it is actually very low risk , as the amount spent is usually not large , relatively speaking .
But DIP lending is being severely curtailed right now , just when it is most needed , as healthier banks drastically cut loans in the severe credit crunch situation .
Without access to DIP bridge financing , GM would be forced into a partial , or even a full liquidation .
The ramifications are horrendous .
Aside from loss of 100,000 jobs at GM itself , GM is critical to keep many US auto suppliers in business .
If GM failed soon most , possibly even all of the US and even foreign auto suppliers will go under .
Those parts suppliers are important to other auto makers .
Many foreign car factories would be forced to close due to loss of suppliers .
Some analysts put 2009 job losses from a GM failure as high as 2.5 million jobs due to the follow - on effects .
If the impact of that 2.5 million job loss is seen in terms of the overall losses to the economy of non-auto jobs such as services , home foreclosures caused and such , some estimate total impact would be more than 15 million jobs .
So far in the face of this staggering prospect , the members of the US Congress have chosen to focus on the fact the GM chief , Rick Wagoner , flew in his private company jet to Washington .
The Congressional charade conjures up the image of Nero playing his fiddle as Rome goes up in flames .
It should not be surprising that at the recent EU - Asian Summit in Beijing , Chinese officials mooted the idea of trading between the EU and Asian nations such as China in Euro , Renminbi , Yen or other national currencies other than the dollar .
The Citigroup bailout and GM debacle has confirmed the death of the post - 1944 Bretton Woods Dollar System .
The real truth behind Citigroup bailout What neither Paulson nor anyone in Washington is willing to reveal is the real truth behind the Citigroup bailout .
By his and the Republican Bush Administration 's adamant earlier refusal to take an initial resolute action to immediately nationalize the nine or so largest troubled banks , he has created the present debacle .
By refusing on ideological grounds to instead reorganize the banks ' assets into some form of ' good bank ' and ' bad bank , ' similar to what the Government of Sweden did with what it called Securum , during its banking crisis in the early 1990's , Paulson and company have created a global financial structure on the brink .
A Securum or similar temporary nationalization would have allowed the healthy banks to continue lending to the real economy so the economy could continue operating , while the State merely sat on the undervalued real estate assets of the Swedish banks for some months until the recovering economy made the assets again marketable to the private sector .
Instead , Paulson and his ' crony capitalists ' in Washington have turned a bad situation into a globally catastrophic one .
His apparent realization of the error of his initial refusal to nationalize came too late .
When Paulson reversed policy on September 19 and presented the nine largest banks with an ultimatum to accept partial Government equity ownership , abandoning his original bizarre plan to merely buy up the toxic waste asset - backed securities of the banks with his $ 700 billion TARP taxpayer money , he never revealed why .
Under the original Paulson Plan , as Dimitri B. Papadimitriou and L. Randall Wray of the Jerome Levy Institute at Bard College in New York point out , Paulson sought to create a situation in which the US ' Treasury would become an owner of troubled financial institutions in exchange for a capital injection - but without exercising any ownership rights , such as replacing the management that created the mess .
The bailout would be used as an opportunity to consolidate control of the nation 's financial system in the hands of a few large ( Wall Street ) banks , with government funds subsidizing purchases of troubled banks by " healthy " ones . '
Paulson soon realized the scale of crisis , largely triggered by his inept handling of the Lehman Brothers case , had created an impossible situation .
Were Paulson to use the $ 700 billion to buy up toxic waste ABS assets from the select banks at today 's market price , the $ 700 billion would be far too little to take an estimated $ 2 trillion ( $ 2,000 billion ) in Asset Backed Securities off the books of the banks .
The Levy Economics Institute economists state , ' It is probable that many and perhaps most financial institutions are insolvent today -- with a black hole of negative net worth that would swallow Paulson 's entire $ 700 billion in one gulp . '
That reality is the real reason Paulson was forced to abandon his original ' crony bailout '
TARP plan and opt to use some of his money to buy equity shares in the nine largest banks .
That scheme as well is ' dead on arrival ' as the latest Citigroup nationalization scheme underscores .
The dilemma Paulson has created with his inept handling of the crisis is simple :
If the US Government paid the true value for these nearly worthless assets , the banks would have to write down huge losses , and , as Levy economists put it , ' announce to the world that they are insolvent . '
On the other hand , if Paulson raised the toxic waste purchase price high enough to protect the banks from losses , $ 700 billion ' will buy only a tiny fraction of the ' troubled ' assets . '
That is what the latest nationalization of Citigroup is about .
It is only the beginning .
The 2009 year will be one of titanic shocks and changes to the global order of a scale perhaps not experienced in the past five centuries .
This is why we should speak of the end of the American Century and its Dollar System .
How destructive that process will be to the citizens of the United States who are the prime victims of Paulson 's crony capitalists , as well as to the rest of the world depends now on the urgency and resoluteness with which heads of national Governments in Germany , the EU , China , Russia and the rest of the non-US world react .
It is no time for ideological sentimentality and nostalgia of the postwar old order .
That collapsed this past September along with Lehman Brothers and the Republican Presidency .
Waiting for a ' miracle ' from an Obama Presidency is no longer an option for the rest of the world .

Globalist enthusiasts and architects of the financial meltdown do NOT represent change
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Thursday , Nov 6 , 2008
All of the leading candidates for the position of Treasury Secretary under president elect Barack Obama directly represent the old guard of the corporate elite system that has used the American economy as it ’s engine to drive their march toward a global empire for decades .
Under the banner of “ change ” whichever of these candidates is appointed to the Treasury will continue to rapidly expand the empowerment of the Federal Reserve monetary system and institute the very policies that have led us to the brink of financial ruin to move the economies of the world toward a centralized global banking system .
The Leading candidate for Obama ’s Treasury Secretary is current Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Tim Geithner .
In 2001 , after leaving Bill Clinton ’s Treasury , Geithner joined the Council on Foreign Relations as a Senior Fellow in the International Economics department .
He then worked for the International Monetary Fund as the director of the Policy Development and Review Department until moving to the Fed in October 2003 .
In 2006 he became a member of the influential Washington - based financial advisory body , Group of Thirty , which was founded in 1978 at the initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation .
Back in June of this year after attending the annual Bilderberg power brokers conference in Virginia , Geithner penned an article in the Financial Times in which he called for a worldwide financial overhaul and the implementation of a globalized banking system .
Geithner stated that the US Federal Reserve should play a “ central role ” in the new regulatory framework , working closely with supervisors in the US and round the world .
“ At present the Fed has broad responsibility for financial stability not matched by direct authority and the consequences of the actions we have taken in this crisis make it more important that we close that gap , ” Geithner wrote .
How can Geithner represent real change when he is a long time servant of the very entities that created the conditions for and perpetuated financial meltdown for years ?
Geithner represents an entrenched central banking system that has killed the free market , built up a power monopoly over the money and credit system , consistently followed an intrinsically detrimental path of ceaseless borrowing and presided over the fundamentally damaging process of printing of money out of thin air , leading to the devaluation of the US dollar which now has a global reputation on a par with if not worse than that of George W. Bush .
Geithner represents a critically bloated bastard entity of government and private wealth that has manipulated interest rates and falsely inflated bubbles that have fostered an economy of moral hazard and driven the world straight into a financial black hole .
In what way does this man offer any possibility of “ change ” ?
He now advocates the implementation of measures of predatory globalism to solve the very crisis those policies have created .
And he will have the tools to do it after the recent bailout bill passed granting the Treasury virtual dictatorial powers over economic policy .
Geithner is likely to get the nod as Treasury Secretary because he best fits the appearance of change , even though he does not represent any significant change .
Consider the following from a recent New York Times article :
[ … ] one senior adviser said it would be important to send a message of change at a time of economic crisis .
“ You can expect a fresh face instead of a recycled face ” at the Treasury , the adviser said .
He said that would include the boyish - looking Mr. Geithner , 47 , who worked at the Treasury under Mr. Clinton and his Republican predecessors and has generally gotten high marks for his role in shaping the government response to the current crisis .
These traits symbolize Obama ’s presidency to the tee , he appears to offer change on the surface , but underneath he offers as little real change from the entrenched elitist system in Washington as a McCain presidency would have or if George W. Bush had simply announced he was going to serve a third term .
( Article continues below )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The other candidates for Treasury secretary are likely to pursue exactly the same path as Geithner .
Those candidates are :
Paul A. Volcker
The former Federal Reserve chief was a key figure in the decision to suspend gold convertibility in 1971 , which resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods system .
Volcker ’s policies and continued high interest rates contributed to the significant recession the US economy experienced in the early 1980s , which included the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression .
After leaving the Fed he became chairman of J. Rothschild , Wolfensohn & Co , the prominent New York investment banking firm run by former president of the World Bank and prominent Bilderberger James D. Wolfensohn .
Volcker was also a founding member of the Trilateral Commission along with David Rockefeller , whom he has also worked with at Chase Bank and through membership of the Trust Committee of Rockefeller Group , Inc .
As of October 2006 , he is the current Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Rockerfeller - founded Group of Thirty .
Robert E. Rubin
Former Treasury Secretary during the first and second Clinton administrations .
Rubin is as much to blame for the creation of the current financial crisis as Alan Greenspan is , as both men ignored the advice of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) and strongly opposed the regulation of derivatives .
Over -exposure to credit derivatives of mortgage - backed securities – or credit default swaps ( CDS ) was a key reason for the failure of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , American International Group , and Washington Mutual in 2008 .
On November 4 , 2007 , Rubin became the Chairman of Citigroup and is currently co-chairman of the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Rubin is also a member of the Group of Thirty .
Lawrence H. Summers
Former chief Economist for the World Bank ( 1991 –1993 ) and Secretary of the Treasury for the last year and a half of the Clinton administration .
Also served as the 27th President of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006 .
Summers has been persistently criticized as an ardent proponent of globalization .
He has been involved in scandal several times , but perhaps the most notable was in December 1991 while at the World Bank .
Summers signed a memo , which was subsequently leaked to the press , stating that developed countries ought to export more pollution to developing countries because these countries would incur the lowest cost in terms of lost wages of people made ill or killed .
An aside to the memo stated that “ the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ” .
Summers is also a member of the Group of Thirty , the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission .
So there you have it , choose your poison .
Although they all have different labels they originate from the same bottle .
These people do not represent change , they represent a continuation of the same elitist system that has no allegiance to the US and has been driving the American economy into the ground as part of its maniacal agenda for decades .

Can fat ever be fashionable ?
Is it possible to wear high fashion as a size 16 plus ?
We challenged celebrity stylist MARCELLA MARTINELLI to find out
By Julia Robson for MailOnline
What makes celebrity frock watching so compulsive ?
Marvelling at the fabulous fashions or the size of the women wearing them ?
Statistically speaking , size zeros ( UK size 4s ) are freaks , with more than 40 per cent of women a size 16 or above .
Yet if you do fall into the national average - a curvy size 16 - and want your fashion with a capital ' F ' , it 's likely that you will find it difficult to buy stylish items in your size .
Big girl : Model Erika wears ( from left ) red dress , £ 25 , JL by John Lewis ; shoes , £ 60 , Moda in Pelle .
Purple silk shirt , £ 400 , tartan jacket , £ 369 , black wool skirt , £ 159 , all Vivienne Westwood at Harrods ; metallic ankle boots , £ 395 , Wunderkind at Liberty .
Silver and black lace dress , £ 45 , Star by Julien Macdonald at Debenhams ; peep - toe shoes , £ 320 , Fratelli Rosetti .
Deep V - neck black dress , £ 175 , Anna Scholz ; shoes from a selection at Carvela .
Black and white dogtooth dress , £ 95 , Jesire ; black ponyskin boots , £ 445 , Fratelli Rossetti
As well as getting larger and taller , British women are more aware of catwalk trends .
But being a size 16 fashionista is not as easy as it sounds .
Apart from Vivienne Westwood , many designers stop at a 12 , the national British average in the Fifties .
Even High Street chains are not as forthcoming in fashionable 16s as they are for skinnier 12s .
What is this fashion conspiracy all about ?
Do n't designers and retailers want curvier women to wear their clothes ( which explains why shoes and bags are such moneyspinners ) or do curvier girls not want to wear high fashion ?
We asked the celebrity stylist Marcella Martinelli to pull together key seasonal trends , not for the usual model size 10 but for a size 16 .
' I was shocked at how difficult it is to find the sort of pieces everyone is looking for , ' says Marcella , whose clients include Kelly Brook , Julia Roberts , Anjelica Huston , Catherine Zeta -Jones and Martine McCutcheon .
' I'm not sure whether this was because they had sold out or they had n't been there to start with .
' I was amazed I could n't find a decent pencil skirt or tailored suit that was n't frumpy at the younger fashion chains , such as Topshop .
And no beautiful statement coats , apart from more expensive ranges or in the plus - size ranges of upmarket department stores such as Selfridges and Harrods . '
You are beautiful : Stylist Marcella arranges model Erika 's clothes in preparation for the plus - size shoot
And when Marcella visited High Street chains known for their high fashion , she found size 16s difficult to locate .
' The bigger sizes were shoved to the back of the store and up close looked more like a 12 / 14 , the size I wear .
Many did not even have labels or had the price tag strategically stapled over the size label . '
On the positive side , there are more than 60 specialist plus brands in the UK , including designer names such as Elena Miro , Marina Rinaldi , Chesca and Anna Scholz .
Many stores carry size 18s , including Dorothy Perkins , Primark , Principles , Monsoon , Matalan , New Look , Marks & Spencer and Next .
Some , like Matalan , even have specialist ranges ( Rogers + Rogers goes up to a 28 ) .
Evans goes up to 32 .
' I was impressed by the Designers at Debenhams range , particularly Julien Macdonald 's clothes , which were so sexy and fashionable , ' says Marcella .
' And I was pleasantly surprised to find labels such as Nanette Lepore at Fenwick , which had plenty of size 16s .
' Evans had the most fashionable dresses - including a one - shoulder , Grecian style short dress .
Unfortunately , this was the wrong shape for our model , but I could see it looking terrific on other 16 - plus women .
' The plus sizes at Selfridges and Harrods tended to be aimed at an older customer .
They were classic rather than trend led and tended to be shapes traditionally associated with larger sizes . '
Shopping online is one route to finding great 16 - plus fashions .
' We sell more 12s than any other size , but because our ethos is everyone who wants to buy into fashion can , we offer choice in size , ' says Moriamo Oshodi , head of womenswear at fashion online retailer ASOS .
' There is no denying there is a market for 16 to 18s , which is why we 've been carrying 16s for two years on most of our 200 brands and up to an 18 on our own label .
I am a 14 and know only too well how resourceful you have to be if you are into fashion .
' I recently asked in a British department store if my Herve Leger dream dress went up to a 14 and was told by a sales assistant rather sniffily that the designer did n't go up to that size .
When I did find the dress in my size in New York , I punched the air .
If more designers did larger sizes , women would buy them . '
Deborah Wiles , who recently took over as design director at Long Tall Sally ( aimed at women above 5ft 8in , sizes 10 to 20 ) , agrees .
' I'm a 14 .
I understand fashion , I know how to dress and how to put clothes together and yet whenever I go shopping I come home empty handed .
Why should I have to shop in the ' fat corner ' ?'
Wiles worked at Monsoon - which goes up to a size 22 - for 17 years .
' My brief when I joined Long Tall Sally was to turn it into a fashion brand , ' says Wiles .
' It would help if there were more role models out there in designer brands .
Not all female designers are a perfect size 10 .
It would be great to see someone like the plus - size women behind cool American label Rodarte include clothes for women who share their body shape .
' This would help change the perception of larger sizes , which is seen as niche market , not mainstream .
The reason we do n't see more fashionable clothes for bigger women is to do with body image and confidence . '
One designer plus - size range that has championed fashion since its launch in 1980 is Marina Rinaldi , the market leader and a sister brand to Italian giant MaxMara .
' We used to cater for a customer who wanted classic suits , silk blouses and cashmere , ' says Monica De Bellis , Marina Rinaldi 's design director .
' Now it 's younger girls who are larger for many reasons and want fashion .
Even baby boomers want young and hip , not ladylike . '
British - based Anna Scholz 's designs go up to a size 26 .
She is stocked in 65 stores in nine countries .
Although not cheap ( £ 250 upwards ) , her clothes are fashionable .
' I grew up with designer tastes .
My father worked in advertising and handled the Jil Sander account .
My mother ran an art gallery .
By the time I was 13 , I was 6ft , a size 16 and clothes mad .
My parents were desperate to spoil me , but could n't .
There was nothing in my size I wanted to wear . '
Scholz studied fashion at London 's Central St Martins to come up with clothes that were suitable .
Belle Robinson , owner of the Jigsaw and Kew chains , and Bluebird designer boutique in Chelsea , is a size 16 .
' From a production point of view , there is a practical argument why there are fewer plus sizes , ' she says .
' The more sizes you have , the more work they are to produce .
At Jigsaw , we know we 'll sell a lot more 10s and 12s than 16s because that is our customer .
When I buy for Bluebird , some designer labels make only sizes eight to 12 .
' Often it 's a vicious circle : you do n't have the bigger sizes so larger customers can't buy the clothing .
Do you stick out your neck for a size 16 customer who may not be looking your way ? '
Jigsaw 's Belle Robinson says : ' The fashion for a stick - thin body shape means some styles are impossible in larger sizes .
You can't scale them up , so what is considered fashionable remains out of reach for many women . '
' I do n't think the media help .
We all know the Western world is getting bigger thanks to changes in diet and more sedentary lifestyles , yet magazines air - brushing and stretching models are sending out a reverse message .
As soon as celebrities put on a small amount of weight they are seen as being compulsive eaters .
' It is important that people with an influence make a stand .
That involves changing our perception of beauty , which is n't easy to do . '
Belle finds shopping on the High Street an isolating experience .
' I do n't think I am alone .
I 'm not advocating size 16 models should be on the catwalk , but we should n't be left feeling like social outcasts if we are not the size of Cheryl Cole .
The use of size zero , emaciated models on the catwalk is morally wrong and fuelling body dysmorphia . '
Companies who have n't embraced the curvy fashion - conscious girl might be encouraged by the healthy profits of those who have .
On the day the Icelandic banks froze , British home shopping firm N Brown , which specialises in plus - size womenswear , announced a 20 per cent rise in profits .
Anna Scholz has a 30 per cent annual rise .
' British women are catching up with the U.S. in terms of sizes , ' says Beverley Jamieson , head of marketing at Marisota , the sister brand to Simply Be .
' It 's amazing that clothing companies still refuse to work with plus sizes in case they get tarred with the fat ladies brush .
' There are occasions when you can't do some trends - pencil skirts , because of the shape and cut , and metallics because shiny things make you look bigger .
But when we offer fashion for larger sizes , it sells out .
Maxi dresses were a hit this summer .'
Media attitudes are starting to change .
Larger - than - life singer Beth Ditto got eight pages in U.S. style magazine , Nylon , outlining what fashion means to her and posing in custom - made dresses by cutting - edge names such as Jeremy Scott .
There is even a plus size supermodel , 22 - year - old American Crystal Renn .
She is the face of Evans , which is focusing on fit , cut and fashion this season with Gothic - inspired day and evening wear .
' You can find fashionable pieces in larger sizes , you just have to spend a lot longer looking for it , ' says Marcella Martinelli .
' I would advise women to think about their body shape and not get hung up on their size .
That way you'd be surprised what you can pull off . '

The government 's attempt to give retroactive immunity to the companies that helped the Bush administration 's warrantless spying program violates the Constitution by ripping from the courts the power to hear citizens ' grievances against the government , a rights group told a federal court Thursday .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also challenging the government 's assertion to the court that the program was n't a " dragnet " that pulled in the contents of millions of Americans , arguing that the government is playing word games .
The filing late Thursday night comes three months after the Democratically - controlled Congress gave in to political pressure and gave the Attorney General the power to tell a court to dismiss lawsuits against the nation 's phone and internet companies .
To win dismissal , the attorney general must provide some evidence to the judge that the companies were given assurances the program was legal or that they did not help .
After seeing these in secret , the judge has little choice but to dismiss the suits without being able to look at what the company did .
In September , the government invoked that power in the EFF 's case against AT&T , which is being argued along with three dozen other suits against the nation 's telecoms in a San Francisco federal court .
The EFF 's lawsuit includes documents from a former AT&T technician that the EFF claims describe a secret room in an AT&T building in San Francisco that is wired up to share raw internet traffic with the NSA .
The EFF 's response brief
(.pdf ) argues that Congress had no right to pass such legislation , since the courts have a fundamental duty and right to hear citizens '
complaints that the government violated their Constitutional rights .
" For if Congress can give the Executive the power to exclude the
Judiciary from considering the constitutional claims of millions of
Americans , can abdicate to the Executive the authority to change the law applicable in specific litigation , and can prevent the Judiciary from making an independent determination of the facts and law in specific litigation , then the Judiciary will no longer be functioning as a co-equal branch of government , " the EFF 's brief reads .
The government surprised many court watchers with the assertion in its September filing that its secret surveillance program was not a content dragnet and that all the companies being sued on such grounds should have the suits tossed .
The EFF calls that semantic wordplay .
To document what exactly is known about the surveillance program , its secret rooms and its wholesale surveillance of Americans ' internet communications , the group collected all that has been revealed about the warrantless spying —
from news accounts to Congressional testimony to White House press statements and filed them in eight large binders with the court .
The group then summarized
(.pdf ) for the court what is known about how the program worked , how much of Americans ' communications were sucked into government databases and how the nation 's top officials have continuously spoken in carefully chosen phrases in order to conceal the breadth of the operation .
The EFF 's filing and documents were provided to U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker .
According to the immunity bill , Congress authorized Mukasey to inform Judge Walker via classified and non-public documents about why the government is seeking immunity on behalf of the communication companies .
According to the legislation , Walker has little power to deny Mukasey 's request .
However , Walker , a libertarian - leaning
Republican appointee , has so far not been sympathetic to the government , ruling early on that the suits could continue despite the government 's claim that the suits would put the nation at risk .
Walker will hear oral arguments in early December .

McColo , a network provider that was yanked offline following reports it enabled more than half the world 's spam , briefly returned from the dead over the weekend so it could hand - off command and control channels to a new source , security researchers said .
The rogue network provider regained connectivity for about 12 hours on Saturday by making use of a backup arrangement it had with Swedish internet service provider TeliaSonera .
During that time , McColo was observed pushing as much as 15 MB of data per second to servers located in Russia , according to Paul Ferguson , a security researcher for anti-virus software maker Trend Micro .
The brief resurrection allowed miscreants who rely on McColo to update a portion of the massive botnets they use to push spam and malware .
Researchers from FireEye saw PCs infected by the Rustock botnet being updated so they 'd report to a new server located at abilena .
podolsk - mo.ru for instructions .
That means the sharp drop in spam levels reported immediately after McColo 's demise is n't likely to last .
" It 's going to take a little while before we probably see the spam levels go back up again , at least from those botnets , " Ferguson told The Register .
Because McColo was cut off so quickly after regaining connectivity , botnet operators were probably not able to update as many nodes as hoped , he added .
Rustock is capable of sending 30 billion spam messages per day , according to researchers from anti-virus provider Sophos , which also witnessed the Rustock transition .
The arrangement between the McColo and Telia had been in place for more than a year , according to an individual at Giglinx , a California - based reseller of wholesale bandwidth that brokered the deal .
The IP address used to reconnect McColo had been allocated to the " CWIE Holding Company , " which claimed to process credit cards .
Telia quickly pulled the plug once researchers learned it was linked to McColo .
Ferguson said it was more than a mere coincidence that McColo waited until Saturday , more than four days after being disconnected , to use its backup link with Telia .
" It seems suspicious to me that they waited until Saturday afternoon on the assumption that people do n't work on the weekends and it would take at least until Monday before somebody could actually take any action on it , " he said .
Ferguson 's report , which was co-written by researcher Jart Armin , is available here ( PDF alert ) .

You can build an inexpensive solar heating system that only costs $ 30 out - of - pocket .
See the solar heating system diagrams in the Image Gallery .
" For a super - simple and super - inexpensive solar heating system that really works , " say Don R. and George Waterman of Springfield , Missouri , " you only have to follow four rules .
One , glaze with low - cost plastic film instead of glass or plexiglass . . . two , use a structure 's existing south - facing wall for the back of your collector . . . three , forget about trying to store the heat you collect . . . and , four , scrounge ! "
If you really want to put solar energy to work for you right now on a minimum - cash - investment basis , you can .
I know , because last winter my father , George Waterman , and I supplied a 30 by 40 insulated workshop with almost all of the heat needed to keep the building 's interior comfortable throughout near - zero days . . . and we did it with a solar heating setup that cost us a total , out - of - pocket , of only $ 30 .
We accomplished this feat with a four - fold secret of low - cost construction : [ 1 ]
We glazed our 8 foot by 30 foot solar collector with inexpensive plastic film instead of glass or plexiglass , [ 2 ] we used our workshop 's existing south - facing wall for the back of the collector , [ 3 ] we did not build any heat storage into our design , and [ 4 ] we scrounged a great deal of the material that went into the solar heating system .
Thanks in large part to the four points listed above , our sun-powered heater was also quite simple in design and went together very rapidly .
We put the whole system up with only about a week 's worth of work ( spread out , due to bad weather , over nearly two weeks ) .
Compare our total time and cash investment to the $ 1,500 , $ 2,000 , or more that 240 square feet of commercially manufactured collectors would have cost ( before installation , of course , and before tacking on another ridiculous figure for blowers , ducting , etc. ) . . . and I think you 'll agree that our initial investment was quite reasonable .
Nor will upkeep ( which should mainly involve the replacement of our collector 's double layer of plastic film ) be the continuing expense that you might think .
We figure on replacing our film no more frequently than once every two years ( it 's already been through one winter and looks good for another ) .
But even if we have to change both layers of the plastic every year , it 's quite inexpensive ( a roll of six - mil polyethylene measuring 8 feet by 100 feet cost us only $ 17 ) .
At that price , it 'll take 34.5 years worth of annual replacements to add up to the cost ( $ 400 ) of one original double set of glass collector covers . . . and 69 years of annual replacements to equal the cost ( $ 800 ) of duo plexiglass glazing .
We think we 've got the trade - off working in our favor .
How We Framed And Painted Our Solar Heating System
We started our collector by outlining its 8 foot by 30 foot area with four 15 foot - long and two 7 foot 9 inch long 2 by 4's .
( Since our plastic was just eight feet wide , we used 7 foot 9 inch uprights on the ends of the unit which , when capped top and bottom by 1 1/ 2 inch thick " 2 by 4's " , added up exactly to the plastic 's eight - foot width . )
These 2 by 4's could have been just toenailed ( on edge ) to the south wall of the shop , but we took the time to mount them in a somewhat more sophisticated ( and we think better ) way .
What we did was first nail 3 / 4 inch by 2 1/ 2 inch strips of lumber flat against the edges of the 2 by 4's ( see detail I sketch on the diagrams in the Image Gallery ) .
Since the so - called 2 by 4's sold today actually measure only 1 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches , this means that the strips formed a lip measuring 3 / 4 inch deep and a full one inch wide completely around the 8 foot by 30 foot circumference of the collector frame .
And that then made it awfully - easy to attach the frame ( right through the lip ) to the shop 's wall with wood screws .
We made the seal between the 2 by 4 frame and the tongue - and - groove siding on the workshop wall as airtight as possible by stuffing small amounts of fiberglass insulation and old cardboard into every crack we could find .
A good bead of caulking compound run completely around the outside of the collector - to - wall joint finished off that part of the job .
As soon as we had our collector framed in , we cut three holes into the part of the shop 's wall that was enclosed by the framing : one in the top center and one each in the lower corners .
These openings , of course , were made so that cool air from the workshop could enter the collector ( through the two lower holes ) where it would be heated before exhausting back into the shop ( through the top , center vent ) to warm the building .
The size of the upper hole was determined by the dimensions of the case around the intake on the blower we later mounted inside the shop and over the opening .
( See BLOWER section of this article for more details about that part of our installation . )
The two cool air inlets , however , were pretty much calculated on a by - guess - and - by - gosh basis .
Which would you rather do ?
Move a little bit of air through your collector and heat it a lot . . . or allow a great deal of air to flow through and warm up only moderately ?
The size of your inlet vents can decide that question one way or the other .
In general , though , you 're better off making those openings too large rather than too small . . . since severely restricted intakes will " starve " the blower in the top hole , make it labor excessively , and thereby cause it to wear out faster .
You 'll also find that a greater volume of air freely circulated through the collector and then back into the area that is being warmed pays off ( especially in larger buildings ) in more uniform temperatures throughout the space being heated .
The 42 truncated triangles ( triangles with one tip cut off ) which we used as spacers inside our collector were cut from leftover two - foot - long lengths of 2 by 12 that we picked up free at a local lumberyard .
If we had not added the 3/4 inch - thick lip to our collector 's frame , these truncated triangles would have been cut 2 3/ 4 inches high .
Since we did add the lip to the frame , though , we made the triangles 3 1/2 inches tall .
( The whole idea , of course , is to cut these spacers so that when they 're topped by the 3/4 inch - thick strips which make up the framing for the collector 's front . . . the outside [ front ] surfaces of the strips will come out just flush with the outside [ front ] surfaces of the 2 by 4's that form the collector 's perimeter . )
- Advertisement -
I should point out , too ( no matter which height spacer you use when building one of these collectors ) , that you do n't really have to make the blocks in the shape of truncated triangles .
The " ears " on such triangles are awfully handy when it comes to nailing or screwing them to a wall . . . but squared - off , rectangular blocks about 31 feet long and either 2 3/ 4 inches or 3 1 / 2 inches high will work just as well if you do n't mind toenailing them in place .
The truncated triangle spacers were spiked into position in three evenly spaced horizontal rows so that they were two feet apart , center to center , both horizontally and vertically .
Once they were in place we slapped a good , thick coat of black wood stain on the triangles , all the wall area bounded by the collector 's main frame , and the inside and outside surfaces of the frame itself .
( As you know , dark colors — especially black — tend to absorb the sun 's heat , whereas lighter colors reflect the sun 's rays away . . . and we wanted our solar collector to absorb . )
This is a good place to mention that you should not coat the inside of one of these collectors with a paint that contains lead or any other toxic compound .
The relatively high temperatures sometimes generated inside the unit can release the noxious elements as gases which will then mix with the air drawn through the collector and spew into the living or working area that the solar setup heats .
Even the wood stain we used emitted a rather disagreeable ( though harmless ) odor during the first few weeks our sun-powered heater was in operation .
And that was bad enough .
So take a tip from someone who knows :
Paint the inside of your collector only with a high - temperature , flat black paint or stain that contains absolutely no toxic compounds and which — if at all possible — will emit no odors when heated to as much as 200 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the sun .
The Solar Collector Blower
Once you 've framed in and painted the inside of your collector — and before you add the facing strips and plastic film to its front — you 'll probably find it convenient to install the blower on your heater 's exhaust ( top ) vent .
( Although this blower is installed inside the shop or room that is to be heated — not inside the collector itself — you may very well find it convenient to put the fan in position with one man or woman working inside and a second on the outside of the building .
After the plastic film is in place , of course , that will no longer be possible . )
We salvaged our blower from an old , unused gas furnace that was gathering dust in my father 's basement .
The " squirrel cage " fan was ideal ( as well it should be , since that 's exactly the kind of job it was designed to do ) for distributing warm air throughout the 30 foot by 40 foot area we wanted to heat .
If you do n't just happen to have an old blower on hand the way we did , ask around at your local furnace sales and supply houses .
For every new central heating unit that goes into an already - built house , there 's usually an old one that comes out .
One dealer , in fact , told my father that he sometimes accumulates so many replaced furnaces that he has to cart them — lock , stock , and blowers — off to the dump .
Which is why he 's always happy to remove some of the fans and sell them for a price .
His price ?
Usually about $ 3.00 for a blower with a working motor . . . although we talked him out of four of the fans with motors and two without for a grand total of eight bucks .
Bargain a little .
And if bargaining does n't turn up a real " blower or two , you can always use an old window fan instead .
Sure , such a fan will probably take up more space than one of the compact squirrel cage blowers , and you 'll most likely have to cut a bigger hole in the wall where it mounts in order to get a proper transfer of air .
But that 's neither here nor there .
The important point to remember is that you have a great deal of latitude when it comes to scrounging up a blower for this solar heating system .
Almost anything that will pull hot air out of the collector and push it into the area where you want it is probably going to be just fine .
And here 's yet another possibility :
If you 're thinking about adding one of these sun-powered heating setups to a cabin or other building that happens to be located out beyond the powerlines somewhere . . . well , it can be done .
Just scrounge up a 12 - volt automobile heater blower and a few batteries from some junked cars , and you 're in business .
Especially if you have a waterwheel or a windplant out there " back of beyond " to keep the batteries charged !
We built a housing for our squirrel cage blower out of scrounged pieces of plywood and sheet metal . . . and we did n't put a whole lot of scientific study into the design .
We just made sure that the hole in the wall through which the fan would draw warm air from the collector was at least as big as the blower 's outlet .
Then we mounted the fan over that hole and boxed in around it .
A rectangular opening that just fit around the blower 's exhaust was left in the side of the casing that faced into the shop .
At first , since we all know that hot air tends to rise , we put a set of louvers in this outlet hole on the housing and positioned the flow guides so they 'd direct the stream of hot air down toward the floor .
That did n't work so well , though , because the concrete immediately under the blower tended to soak up most of the heat and what was left of the air 's circulation never seemed able to make it past various benches , equipment , and other objects in the shop to the building 's other side .
So we took the louvers out , and immediately noticed a much more even temperature throughout the whole 30 foot by 40 foot workshop .
As you wind up your blower installation , remember that the job wo n't be complete until you 've put a furnace filter screen over each of the cool air inlets in the collector 's bottom corners .
You do n't want dirt , sawdust , and other fine debris to float into the collector , cling to its plastic cover , and thereby reduce the amount of sunlight ( heat energy ) that the unit absorbs .
For the same reason , it 's a good idea to frame in all three of the holes cut through the wall . . . to keep any dust , insulation particles , etc. , that might be inside the partition from floating into the collector .
Solar Collector Facing Strips and Plastic Film
There are approximately 500 linear feet of 3/ 4 inches by either 1 inch or 1 1/ 2 inch facing strips on the front of our collector and we scrounged 'em all from old boxing lumber .
It 's possible to get four or five lengths of these strips from even split boards that are virtually useless for any other purpose .
Remember , too , that a great many of these facing pieces can be as short as two feet long and still work .
Nail your longest strips to the tops of the triangles so that you form three horizontal rows that extend the full length of the collector .
Then cut short pieces that fit between the horizontal rows to make vertical rows of the stripping .
When you 've finished , you 'll have a very neat gridwork of two - foot squares completely covering the face of the whole 8 foot by 30 foot unit .
This gridwork ( which you 'll probably want to paint ) will provide excellent support for the plastic film you 're about to apply and will keep the flexible covering from being drawn against the back of the collector when the solar heating system 's blower is pulling air from the unit .
Check around and take a look at the various plastic sheetings available in your area before you buy .
In general , the clearer the covering on your collector , the better the unit will work . . . and you 'll find a considerable range of transparency , even in the least expensive plastic films .
Either four - or six - mil - thick sheeting should be all right . . . but the sixmil ( even though it transmits slightly less light ) is somewhat more durable and , therefore , to be preferred .
We covered our collector with sixmil polyethylene that we bought in an 8 foot by 100 foot roll ( for $ 17 ) from Sears .
Before you begin to apply the plastic film ( especially if you do the job in cold weather ) , make sure that it has warmed to at least room temperature .
If you do n't , you 'll find it impossible to stretch the covering tightly enough to compensate for the plastic 's expansion once the collector begins to heat up .
And that 's not good .
Besides looking bad , a loose , floppy covering will also wear out a great deal faster than a taut one .
We tacked our plastic on with a few staples to hold it in place until we could really anchor it every two feet with pre-drilled vertical 3 / 4 inch thick by 1 inch wide by 8 foot long strips of wood .
These strips were attached with screws . . . which we think are almost a must for later easy replacement of the plastic covering .
A second layer of the film was then put on right over the strips holding the first ( which , of course , automatically created a 3/ 4 inch - thick insulating air space ) .
This second plastic covering was also stretched as tightly as possible and anchored with strips and screws .
This time , however , the vertical strips were spaced four feet apart .
Solar Heating : Single Versus Double Glazing and Other Surprises
We wondered just how much better our collector would work with two layers of plastic on its front instead of only one .
So we operated the solar heating system with its collector enclosed by a single sheet of film for about a week before we applied the second .
Surprisingly enough , the " double glazing " of plastic raised the temperature inside the collector by only about ten degrees . . . which was n't nearly as much as we had anticipated .
There was , however , relatively little wind during the test of the single layer ( although it was quite cold : 5 to 10 degrees above zero ) , and this undoubtedly made some difference .
The single sheet would almost certainly lose far more heat on windy days than the double layer of film .
We were also surprised to learn that temperatures inside our collector did not directly reflect the differences in outside air temperature .
In the middle of the winter , with the blower turned off , it did n't seem to matter much whether it was five or 40 degrees above zero outside .
The temperature inside the double glazed collector usually hit 140 degrees by about 10:00 a.m. , rose to 150 or 160 somewhere between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. , and then fell back to 140 by 4:00 p.m .
With the blower running , these figures all dropped about 30 degrees right across the board .
( Remember , too , that our collector is set up in Springfield , Missouri .
Readings will be somewhat different for any unit you build if you live at a different latitude , your area experiences more or less cloud cover , etc . )
From our observations , then , we have concluded that the outside air temperature makes practically no difference in the performance of our vertically mounted collector .
The angle of the sun , however , makes a great deal of difference in the unit 's output . . . and , interestingly enough , these variations in output work entirely to our advantage .
That is : During the coldest months of winter ( outside air temperatures of five to 40 degrees Fahrenheit ) , when the sun is lowest in the sky , our collector — as we 've already stated — hits a maximum internal temperature ( blower off ) of 150 to 160 degrees .
In May , though ( outside air temperature of 80 degrees ) , with the sun much higher in the sky , the collector warms up inside ( blower off ) to only about 120 degrees !
A vertically mounted collector , then , works just the way we'd all like a solar energy trap to work .
It catches a lot of the sun 's rays in the winter ( exactly when we want it to ) , and absorbs increasingly less of those rays as Ole Sol rises higher in the sky and the weather warms ( which is precisely the time that we do n't want a solar or any other kind of heating system to work well at all ) .
Solar Collector : The Bottom Line
Despite our enthusiasm for the solar heating system we 've added .
to my father 's workshop , we do want to be painfully honest and say that our 8 foot by 30 foot collector has proven slightly too small to completely heat the whole 30 foot by 40 foot building as much as we 'd like .
If the insulated structure had only been turned the other way ( so that one of its 40 foot sides faced south ) , however , the solar heater would probably be just big enough to supply all the warmth we 'd ever want on almost any winter day that we 'd care to work in the shop .
This is not to say that the solar furnace does n't do a bang - up job .
It most certainly does .
With no supplemental heat at all , the sun-powered system will bring the workshop up to a very comfortable temperature for at least five hours a day . . . from 1:00 in the afternoon to 6:00 that evening .
And if a small propane burner is turned on for 45 minutes just once about mid-morning to warm the shop to 55 or 60 degrees , the solar heating system will then maintain and gain on that temperature throughout the rest of the day . . . topping out right at 70 degrees about 4:30 in the afternoon .
( The building 's insulation then keeps the shop 's inside temperature from dropping below 35 or 40 degrees during the following night .
The lower figure does n't concern us , though , since we only use the shop during the day . )
We think that 's pretty good performance for a total installation cost of $ 30 .
As a matter of fact , it 'd still be darned good performance if we'd have bought everything new and spent , perhaps , $ 100 on the solar heating system .
The bottom line , then , is that for very little cash outlay we 're tapping a meaningful amount of the sun 's energy for use in our family workshop .
The question I 'd like to ask you , then , is :
Are you sure you do n't have a workshop , playroom , or other enclosed area that you need heated only during the day . . . for which this very simple , low - cost , non-storage sun-powered system that can be largely constructed from scrounged materials would n't be ideal ?
Once it 's up , you know , all you have to do to keep this solar furnace working for years is [ A ] supply its blower with a small amount of electricity , and [ B ] replace that plastic every two years .
Which is a pretty inexpensive way to heat in this day and age !
An Automatic Controller for Your Active Solar - Heating System
Some sort of device that will automatically turn the blower used in the accompanying solar heating system on and off is a handy thing to have .
It can ensure that your shop or room or whatever will receive its full quota of sunny days ' heat ( but no nighttime or cloudy days ' cold ) from its collector .
Perhaps the simplest way to control your blower is with one of the readily available , low - cost , automatic timers on the market .
Just estimate the most effective period for the fan to be on ( say , from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ) and set the timer to operate it for that length of time .
The only problem with this setup , of course , is that it's " blind " to any external changes which might take place and that can influence the operation of the blower .
If the sky is heavily clouded over , for instance , when the timer dumbly switches the blower on . . . the fan will just as dumbly sit there for seven hours , blowing cold air into the room .
Clearly , to be really effective , your controller needs some sort of temperature sensor .
No , this sensor does n't have to be expensive .
As a matter of fact , almost every gas furnace made has just such a device somewhere in its innards and a little scrounging can probably get you one for nothing .
( We removed ours from the same old furnace that supplied our blower . )
It 's easy to scavenge one of these temperature sensors from an old gas furnace .
Open the panel that covers the pilot light and burning chamber .
Inside you should see a small box with wires leading out of it .
Cut or disconnect these wires and remove the box 's cover .
You should find a little gauge or dial inside with two movable pointers that can be set to turn the burner on and then off at whatever temperatures you choose .
Remove the screws that hold the box in place and pull it straight out .
Surprise !
You 're now holding a box in your hand . . . and that box has a long snout of a tube perforated with holes sticking out its back .
If you can peer into this tube , you 'll see a spiral strip of metal that expands and contracts as it's heated and cooled .
It 's this expansion and contraction that operates a simple switching mechanism inside the controller . . . thereby making it possible for the controller to turn a gas furnace 's blower — or , in this case , the blower for a solar furnace — on and off .
It 's no trick to adapt one of these controller boxes to your sun-powered heating system .
Just drill a hole through the wall that forms the back of your solar collector , stick the probe through the opening so that enough of the snout extends right into the collector to get a good temperature reading , and then electrically connect the " little black box " in series with the blower 's motor in the same way that you 'd hook up any other simple switch .
Now , at least , your solar furnace 's blower can be set to turn on only when there 's enough excess heat in its collector to make the operation of that blower worthwhile .
But what if you do n't want that warmth . . . what if your room or shop is already up to — or higher than — the temperature you prefer ?
No problem .
When you hook your collector 's temperature sensing device in series with the blower motor , just add an indoor high voltage thermostat ( the kind used when electric heating cables are installed in a ceiling ) as shown in Diagram 1 .
By adjusting the settings on both the collector sensor and the indoor thermostat ( which you 'll mount somewhere in the room being heated ) , you can now go away for days at a time . . . always confident that the solar heater 's blower will kick on - and will only kick on — when the collector is hot enough to do some good and the room is cool enough to need the collector 's heat .
Pretty neat , huh ?
Except , of course , for the fact that a high voltage thermostat can set you back about $ 12 to $ 15 .
However , as you might have expected , there is a way for the dedicated scrounger to get the same job done for considerably less .
Go back to that junked gas furnace you 've been scavenging parts from and pull out its thermostat .
Yes , this is a low voltage thermostat , which means that it can't be wired directly into your blower 's circuit the way a high voltage thermostat can ( the load would burn it out ) .
But that 's no problem either .
With just a little tinkering , we can make this one work too .
You 'll need the step - down transformer that you can take from that old trusty - rusty gas furnace that has served you so well for so long .
You 'll also need one of the 12 - volt relays that
Radio Shack and other electronics stores sell for anywhere from $ 3 to $ 5 .
The relay should have a 12 - volt coil and contacts rated for 120 volts at 5 amps minimum .
And try to get one with a coil designed for alternating current .
A relay with the more sensitive direct current coil ( which is what we used , since that 's what we already had ) wo n't work unless you add a diode and capacitor as shown in Diagram 2 ( See the solar collector diagrams in the Image Gallery ) .
And since that 's about as complicated as we can possibly design our circuit , let 's hop on down to Diagram 2 and learn how to make this final , scrounged - up system work .
What we have is a circuit in which a low voltage thermostat connects and disconnects a low voltage transformer to and from the coil in a high voltage relay .
And as that relay opens and shuts , it — in turn — connects and disconnects your solar heater 's blower to and from the 110 - volt electricity that makes it run .
If the relay came wired with an AC coil , all well and good .
You 're home free .
If it has a DC coil , however , you 'll have to add the diode and capacitor shown in Diagram 2 .
Which brings us to one final bit of electronic know - how that you should have .
A capacitor large enough for this job ( 100 microfarads or so ) will probably be electrolytic and , thus polarized .
( That is , it will have me terminal that is positive + and one that is negative -) .
If you hook such a capacitor up " backwards " you 'll burn it out and you must therefore take care to connect it properly .
But that 's not difficult either , since there 's such an easy way to determine the polarity of any low voltage source .
With your transformer plugged in and the diode connected , simply stick the bared ends of the copper wire about 1 / 4 inches to 1/ 2 inches apart in a chunk of raw potato .
Leave them there for a half hour — during that period an electrochemical reaction will take place , turning the potato dark blue around the wire connected to the positive pole .
Connect the + side of the capacitor to that leg of the thermostat and the - side to the other one .

I try to be clear and avoid expressing myself in ways that confuses people .
But sometimes that still happens as I assume that people are aware of all of the confusing aspects in which economics is discussed , which is not always the case .
In my recent post about U.S. retail sales I wrote that I expected GDP to fall by more than 4 % during the fourth quarter .
That 's bad , but it 's not as bad as one reader thought it was , who believed that this meant that fourth quarter GDP would be 4 % lower than third quarter GDP .
There are basically three ways in which quarterly growth can be expressed .
The first is the American way .
Here growth is expressed in change from the previous quarter in annualized terms .
Annualized terms means the 4 quarter change that would happen if the quarterly change was sustained for 3 more quarters .
The second is the European way .
Here growth is expressed in quarterly change in absolute , non-annualized terms .
The third is the Chinese way .
Here growth is expressed in change compared to the same quarter the previous year .
I call it the American , European and Chinese way as they are the most important countries / regions using the different ways of expressing growth , but many other countries choose to use these 3 different ways of expressing growth .
For example , let 's say a country sees its GDP rise by 1 % compared to the previous quarter in absolute terms and 3 % compared to the same quarter last year .
Using the American way of expressing growth , growth would be 4 % , using the European way it would be 1 % and using the Chinese way it would be 3 % .
Because the same data can be expressed in three different ways , it can be confusing .
I will try to at least sometimes point out this briefly in future posts discussing growth in different countries , but in case I forget remember that I am using the local way of expressing growth ( because I have readers from all over the world there is no common standard for them ) and remember the difference in how numbers are expressed when comparing for example European and American numbers .
Two clones of highly antibiotic - resistant organism strains , which previously had only been identified in the United States , are now causing serious sickness and death in several Colombian cities including the capital Bogotá , say researchers at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston .
The study , done in collaboration with Universidad El Bosque in Bogotá , is presented in a research letter published in the Nov. 13 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .
U.S. clones of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) and vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecalis ( VREF ) have emerged in communities across Colombia .
The variation of the MRSA clone , referred to as the USA 300 , has been previously reported to be the most important cause of severe skin and soft tissue infections in the United States .
The VREF clone is genetically related to a strain that hit a Houston hospital in 1994 .
In Colombia before 2005 , there were no recorded cases of any community - associated MRSA infections , including USA 300 MRSA .
In 2005 , there were two : one in Bogotá and one in the city of Villavicencio .
Now the number of MRSA infections is climbing across the country .
The paper reports a total of 15 infections , some of which were documented in two additional cities between 2006 and 2007 , said Cesar A. Arias , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of infectious diseases at the UT Medical School at Houston .
The first case of VREF was reported in Bogotá in 2001 .
Since then , 50 additional cases have been identified at seven hospitals .
" We are tracking and recording these cases to find the link between the U.S. and Colombia .
The goal is to find out why and how these organisms got there .
With this information , researchers hope to better understand the molecular epidemiology of these super bugs to understand how they spread and how to control them , " Arias said .
" The UT Medical School will continue to work with Latin American academic institutions to learn more about these antibiotic - resistant organisms . "
All patients diagnosed with community - associated MRSA infections suffered severe skin and soft - tissue infections .
Some patients also experienced death of tissue surrounding bones , bacteria in the bloodstream and meningitis , and 20 percent of the patients died .
The MRSA infections were treatable with common antistaphylococcal antibiotics , although 40 percent were resistant to tetracycline .
Arias added that the USA 300 clone of MRSA has not only been found in Colombia .
In a recent presentation at the annual meeting of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy ( ICAAC ) and Infectious Disease Society of America in Washington , D.C. , Arias shared the news that this clone has been recorded in multiple patients in Ecuador and Venezuela .
Other research personnel at the UT Medical School included : Shahreen Chowdhury , Sreedhar R. Nallapareddy , Ph.D. and Barbara E. Murray , M.D. The research was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
Earlier Today : Felonious Senator Says Will Not Ask Bush for Pardon , Still Has ' Faith ' He 's Going to Win Re-Election
Final Update : Stevens Concedes to Begich ...

UPDATE : AP calls race for Begich ...
Mark Begich , the Democratic Anchorage mayor , has defeated Sen .
Ted Stevens in a closely contested , see - saw race for the United States Senate , according to Associated Press projections .
The Division of Elections has almost concluded an initial count of absentee , early in - person and questioned ballots Tuesday .
That , coupled with the numbers culled from Election Day , gave Begich a 3,724 - vote lead over Stevens , the 40 - year Republican incumbent , with about 2,500 ballots left to count .
Earlier tonight from Bloomberg :
Democratic challenger Mark Begich extended his lead over Alaska Senator Ted Stevens with about 10,000 ballots still to be counted , according to the state 's elections division .
Begich now leads by 2,374 votes as the remaining ballots are tallied from the Nov. 4 election , according to division Director Gail Fenumiai .
Officials said they may complete counting about 7,700 absentee ballots today with another 2,500 ballots from military families overseas yet to arrive .
Republicans in the Senate postponed their vote today to consider removing the felonious Stevens ' committee assignments , since indications are that he 's going to lose anyway at this point .
Plus , it was his 85th birthday .
But he 's not deterred .
According to AP , " Stevens revealed that he will not ask President George W. Bush to give him a pardon for his seven felony convictions . "
And Bloomberg says , in regard to his re-election prospects at this point , that he told reporters : " I still have faith I 'm going to win . "
Ready for a recount , Ted ?
( Actually a count , since all of the ballots have only been tabulated by faulty Diebold op - scanners at this point . )
If so , we 're happy to help .
UPDATE 11/20/08 : Unfortunately , Uncle Ted concedes .
We would have welcomed that recount .
Instead , we 'll just have to be content this time with the end of an era .
From Seattle Times :
Sen .
Ted Stevens conceded the election for U.S. Senate to Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich on Wednesday , bringing to an end his 40 years as the dominant force in Alaska politics and the longest - serving Republican in Senate history .
Stevens ' office issued a written statement congratulating Begich , a Democrat who ran as a change candidate in the face of federal ethics charges against the man many Alaskans call " Uncle Ted . "
" Given the number of ballots that remain to be counted , it is apparent the election has been decided and Mayor Begich has been elected .
My family and I wish to thank the thousands of Alaskans who stood by us and who supported my re-election , " said Stevens , 85 .

Right now you ’re probably asking yourself “ Dude , WTF is this ? ”
The simple answer is , this is My Zombie Pin-up , which is to say it ’s Gil Elvgren meets Night of the Living Dead .
Or , as NBC put it , “ Like Vargas girls who ’ve had a nasty run-in with the clan from 28 Days Later ”
We dug up the idea of the vintage 1950 ’s pin-up and hit it over the head with a shovel .
We we ’re inspired by the traditional cheesecake pin-up girls , especially by the illustrations and paintings of the classic American artist Gil Elvgren ; with several of our works being homages to Mr. Elvgren .
A bad idea taken too far by Shalaco Sching and over a dozen other very talented San Francisco based artists .
You can learn more about the project in our About section .
So , go ahead , let yourself get infected by these bloody gore - gous women who are just dying to get under your skin .
See some of our inspiration behind this project .
Learn more about this project .
Meet Shalaco the evil genius who conceived this really good bad idea .
That ’s Ryan Holiday ’s query .
This is not about quality , this is about " representing a literary era " or perhaps just representing the era itself .
I ’ll cite Bonfire of the Vanities and Fight Club as the obvious picks .
Loyal MR reader Jeff Ritze is thinking of Easton Ellis ( " though not American Psycho " ) .
How about you ?
Dare I mention John Grisham ’s
The Firm as embodying the blockbuster trend of King , Steele , Clancy and others ?
There ’s always Harry Potter and graphic novels .
The Tribler BitTorrent client , a project run by researchers from several European universities and Harvard , is the first to incorporate decentralized search capabilities .
With Tribler , users can now find . torrent files that are hosted among other peers , instead of on a centralized site such as The Pirate Bay or Mininova .
We have reported on Tribler and it ’s development several times already .
Previously , the researchers introduced BitTorrent streaming , and new algorithms that will improve the sharing behavior of BitTorrent users .
The latest innovation , however , might have even broader consequences , as it creates the world ’s first ‘ True P2P ’ BitTorrent Client .
Up until now , central servers have always been required in order to use BitTorrent effectively .
Although the transfer of files via BitTorrent has always been decentralized , the .torrent files that are required to start sharing are always hosted on central servers , those of The Pirate Bay or Mininova for example .
The Tribler developers have found a way to make their client work , without having to rely on BitTorrent sites .
Although others have tried to come up with similar solutions , such as the Cubit plugin for Vuze , Tribler is the first to understand that with decentralized BitTorrent search , there also has to be a way to moderate these decentralized torrents in order to avoid a flood of spam .
BuddyCast , the decentralized search feature of the Tribler client is able to do so .
Tribler project leader Johan Pouwelse told TorrentFreak : “ It has taken us many years to get the zero - server search infrastructure called ‘ BuddyCast ’ running fast and efficiently .
We believe that today BuddyCast is the most efficient , scalable , and battle - hardened algorithm out there which is also ready for user tagging and ratings in true buzz - compliant 2.0 style . ”
In addition to the decentralized torrent distribution and search capabilities , Tribler aims to make the BitTorrent experience more social .
For instance , users will have the option to boost the download speed of friends , the client will give recommendations based on your download behavior , and it rewards users who are good sharers while punishing those who leech .
“ Tribler peers all work together towards a common purpose : fast search and downloads , ” Pouwelse explained .
“ Peers recognize fellow ‘ tribe ’ members and are pre-programmed with the notion that embracing mutual self - interest is good .
This is a radical deviation from the core BitTorrent tit - for - tat mantra dictating pursuit of self - interest only and no memory of past experiences . ”
Although this is only the first public implementation of the decentralized search feature , it seems to work pretty seamlessly .
Obviously , the content is more limited than on the large BitTorrent sites , since it comes exclusively from other Tribler users , but this will grow as soon as more people start to use the client .
Decentralized BitTorrent search has the potential to make public BitTorrent sites no longer necessary .
For now , we think that such a radical shift is not going to happen anytime soon , however , since the top - three BitTorrent sites are involved in legal action in some way or another , you never know when you might need it .

As you may well be aware , Dungeons & Dragons creator Gary Gygax passed away this year .
His memory was classily honored by geekfest GenCon , who raised over $ 17,000 in an auction for Gygax 's favorite charity , the Christian Children 's Foundation .
The CCF , however , has decided to refuse the money .
Why ?
Because the money was raised with the sale of D&D merchandise .
I really cannot get over how myopic and frankly despicable that is .
Because the money came from a gaming convention , apparently it 's not clean enough for the good little Christian boys and girls that the CCF looks after .
The group is claiming that this is about the " integrity " of its name , which it says it wo n't lend to events it had no hand in .
If you ask me , refusing the money shows a far greater lack of integrity than accepting a perfectly valid $ 17,000 .
Would the CCF had turned down a donation from a Church bake sale ?
Somehow , I do n't think so .
Filthy , Satanic D&D players , however , are not welcome .
A BBC radio presenter who asked a taxi firm not to send a Asian driver has been sacked .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sam Mason made the comments while ordering a taxi for her 14 - year - old daughter who she said would be “ freaked out ” by a turban - wearing driver .
The taxi operator routinely records messages in case of complaints and later passed a transcript of the conversation on to The Sun , who subsequently contacted the BBC .
Mason , who took over BBC Radio Bristol weekday afternoon programme six weeks ago , was initially suspended on Friday over her comments , before being informed by station bosses on Saturday that she would no longer be working for the BBC .
A BBC spokesman said : " Although Sam Mason 's remarks were not made on - air , her comments were completely unacceptable and , for that reason , she has been informed that she will no longer be working for the BBC with immediate effect . "
According to The Sun , the transcript of the conversation runs as follows .
Mason : “ I know this sounds really racist , but I ’m not being . . . please , do n’t send anyone like , you know what I mean .
An English person would be great , a female would be better . ”
Operator : “ We would class that as being racist .
We ca n’t penalise the Asian drivers and just send an English one . ”
Mason : “ You ’ve managed it before . ”
Operator : “ Right , OK .
I do n’t agree with it personally . ”
Mason : “ It ’s not your 14 - year - old girl who ’s , you know , is it ? ”
Operator : “ Yes , but that ’s racist to say you do n’t want an Asian driver . ”
Mason : “ If it were me I would n’t care if it had two heads , but it ’s my little girl we are talking about . ”
Mason , is then handed to a male taxi operator and tells him that his female colleague has “ a bad attitude ” .
She adds : “ I work at the BBC .
I ’m far from racist and that uneducated woman has no right to call me one . ”
She says of her daughter : “ I do n’t want her to turn up with a guy with a turban on .
It ’s going to freak her out .
She ’s not used to Asians . ”
The Django cache middleware is great , but has one drawback .
If you are caching views ( which can give a nice performance boost )
Django will only use the path segment of the URL to create a cache key .
If you are an avid reader of RFC 3986 you may remember that a URI consists of multiple components ; path and query being of special interest here .
The problem is documented in ticket 4992 ( Update : it is now in Django ) .
Given the following URL :
http://example.com/items/?order_by=name
… Django will ignore the query part when determining a cache key so the key for the above request will be :
/items /
Any type of query parameter will make Django ignore the cached page .
Django will not create a new cache item for the order_by request .
This will be detrimental for the performance of your site .
I had expected Django to create three different cache items for these URLs instead of one cache item and two ignored requests :
http://example.com/items/
http://example.com/items/?order_by=name
http://example.com/items/?order_by=date
The solution
Fortunately Django ’s source is very readable and easy to adapt to your own needs .
A few minor changes to middleware / cache.py and utils / cache.py and you are ready to go .
For details see the patch I attached to ticket 4992 .
I recently deployed a Django site to get an overview of VPS hosting plans and the ability to cache items based on the filtering parameters gives much better performance .
A piece of steel ( left ) coated with a thin layer of the super - slippery material just 2 to 3 micrometers thick – such coatings provide a kind of eternal lubrication to reduce friction and save energy ( Image : US DoE Ames Lab )
A superhard substance that is more slippery than Teflon could protect mechanical parts from wear and tear , and boost energy efficiency by reducing friction .
The “ ceramic alloy ” is created by combining a metal alloy of boron , aluminium and magnesium ( AlMgB14 ) with titanium boride ( TiB2 ) .
It is the hardest material after diamond and cubic boron nitride .
BAM , as the material is called , was discovered at the US Department of Energy Ames Laboratory in Iowa in 1999 , during attempts to develop a substance to generate electricity when heated .

Eternal lubricant
BAM did n’t do that , but was found to have other desirable characteristics .
“ Its hardness was discovered by accident .
We had a terrible time cutting it , grinding it , or polishing it , ” says Alan Russell , a materials scientist at Iowa State University in Ames .
Those chance findings have now developed into a $ 3 - million programme at the Ames Lab to develop the BAM into a kind of eternal lubricant , a coating for moving parts to boost energy efficiency and longevity by reducing friction .
BAM is much slipperier than Teflon , with a coefficient of friction of .02 compared to .05 .
Lubricated steel has a friction coefficient of 0.16 .
One way to exploit this slipperiness is to coat the rotor blades in everyday pumps used in everything from heating systems to aircraft , says Russel .
A slick BAM coating of just 2 microns ( see image , top right ) could reduce friction between the blades and their housing , meaning less power is needed to produce the same pumping power .
Mystery material
Bruce Cook , lead investigator on the Ames Lab project , estimates that merely coating rotors with the material could save US industry alone 330 trillion kilojoules ( 9 billion kilowatt hours ) every year by 2030 – about $ 179 million a year .
BAM is also potentially attractive as a hard coating for drill bits and other cutting tools .
Diamond is commonly used for this , and is harder , but it reacts chemically with steel and so degrades relatively quickly when used to cut the metal .
By contrast , BAM is cheaper and does not degrade when used with steel .
The exact reason for the new material ’s characteristics is still unclear , Russell told New Scientist .
Most superhard materials , such as diamond , have a simple , regular and symmetrical crystalline structure .
But BAM is complex , unsymmetrical , and its lattice contains gaps , none of which would be expected in a hard material .
Its slipperiness is also not entirely understood .
Although Russell says the best theory is that the boron interacts with oxygen to make tiny amounts of boron oxide on its surface .
They would attract water molecules from the air , to make a slippery coating .
“ It ’s almost as if it ’s a self - lubricating surface .
You do n’t need to add oil or other lubricants .
It ’s inherently slippery , ” he says .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama met late Thursday in Chicago with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss what role she might play in his administration , advisers to both Democrats said on Friday .
Neither side disclosed details of the conversation , and it was unclear how seriously Mr. Obama was considering bringing Mrs. Clinton , his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , into his cabinet .
Speculation in recent days has focused on the possibility that Mr. Obama would ask Mrs. Clinton , a second term senator from New York , to be his secretary of state .
Others mentioned for that post include Senator John Kerry , Democrat from Massachusetts and the party ’s presidential nominee in 2004 , and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle .
Appearing at a public transit conference in Albany on Friday , Mrs. Clinton said she would not address reports about whether she would be offered a position in the Obama administration .
For pioneering Turkish blogger Erkan Saka , these are dark days .
Last week , he found himself cut off from a group of blogs that he belongs to and from hundreds of other websites he regularly reads .
A Turkish court had just banned Blogger , the popular blog - hosting site owned by Google , because of illegal material found on a few sites on its servers .
It was just the latest among hundreds of sites banned by Turkey 's courts and government this year , raising concerns about censorship in a country with an already troubling record on freedom of speech .
" I feel very helpless and frustrated .
I am not allowed to use something very natural now .
A basic means of communication is being prevented , " says Mr. Saka , who teaches popular - culture studies at Istanbul 's Bilgi University and operates the website erkansaka.net .
Although his site , hosted elsewhere , was not affected and the Blogger ban was provisionally lifted Tuesday , some 850 websites remain off limits .
YouTube has been blocked since May , after clips mocking Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , modern Turkey 's founder , were posted there .
And recently a court agreed to bans on the websites of Oxford evolutionist Richard Dawkins and one of Turkey 's largest newspapers after an Islamic creationist group complained about them .
" The current Turkish law on controlling Internet content , through its procedural and substantive deficiencies , is designed to censor and silence political speech , " says a report to be published next month by Cyber - Rights .
Org , a British Internet civil liberties organization .
" Its impacts are wide , affecting not only freedom of speech but also the right to privacy and fair trial . "
A law passed by the Turkish parliament last May , intended to prevent access to primarily pornographic Web content , has given the state broad powers .
The newly created Telecommunications Directorate , a government office that monitors the Internet , is allowed to shut down sites without a court order .
The agency has been behind 612 bans this year .
Critics of the Internet laws have been dismayed by the state 's heavy - handed approach , which allows for entire sites to be blocked because of a small number of offending items .
" It 's like having a huge library and finding an error on a page in one book and closing down the entire library , " says Mustafa Akgul , an Internet expert at Ankara 's Bilkent University .
" The government is deciding what is suitable for everyone to see on the Internet , " he adds .
" That 's a problem .
We do n't object to filters in school , libraries , or public places , but it 's a problem to decide what is suitable for an entire population in a democracy . "
Turkey , of course , is not alone in blocking online content .
Britain , for example , is active in obstructing child pornography sites , while Germany goes after racist online content .
But Turkey has taken a much more expansive approach , giving courts the power to shut down Web access with little explanation or public oversight .
" In terms of Internet censorship , Turkey is for sure now one of the significant countries , " says Clothilde Lecoz , head of the Internet freedom desk at the Paris - based Reporters Without Borders .
" We are very , very concerned about it . "
The European Union , which Turkey hopes to join , has previously been critical of Turkey 's record on freedom of expression , particularly in regard to its prosecution of writers and journalists under Article 301 , a vague law that punishes those who insult the state and its institutions .
Orhan Pamuk , the Turkish author and Nobel laureate who was tried under Article 301 , used his opening speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair this month to criticize Turkey 's YouTube ban .
" YouTube , like many other domestic and international websites , has been blocked for residents of Turkey for political reasons , " Mr. Pamuk said .
" Those in whom the power of the state resides may take satisfaction from all these repressive measures , but we writers , publishers , artists feel differently , as do all other creators of Turkish culture and indeed everyone who takes an interest in it : Oppression of this order does not reflect our ideas on the proper promotion of Turkish culture . "
EU officials in Turkey say their concerns will be expressed in an upcoming report detailing the progress of Turkey 's membership bid , due to be released in November .
" It is a very restrictive law and the implementation has been very problematic , " says an EU official based in Ankara .
Turkish officials admit problems with the law , but defend its intent .
" The fight against elements that aim at degenerating societies and poisoning the youth and children is the fundamental task of each country .
Every country has different regulations related to the Internet , " transportation minister Binali Yildirim , who is also responsible for communications , recently said .
" Our aim is not to ban websites .
Such measures will come to an end as soon as our courts are able to ban problematic content instead of entire websites . "
Critics like Yaman Akdeniz , a professor of law at the University of Leeds and director of Cyber - Rights .
Org , say Turkey 's Internet law would most likely not stand up to a legal challenge in Strasbourg , the French - based European Court of Human Rights , whose judgments are binding on Turkey .
" The current law should be abolished and the government should start from scratch when it comes to controlling the Internet . "
Professor Akgul says without a new approach , Turkey may find itself left behind when it comes to utilizing the power of the Internet .
" Turkish politicians have n't had any real vision on how to develop the Internet , " he says .
" There are more people working on censoring it than developing it . "
