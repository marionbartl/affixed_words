BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Baghdad ’s fortified “ Green Zone ” came under repeated rocket or mortar attack on Sunday , and police said up to 17 people had been killed by rockets falling short outside the government and diplomatic compound .
The attacks were part of a wider increase in violence in the capital and in the northern city of Mosul , underlining warnings by U.S. military commanders that recent security gains in Iraq are both fragile and reversible .
In the past , the U.S. military has blamed such attacks on the Green Zone on rogue elements of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al- Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia .
Sadr has imposed a ceasefire on the militia , but there have been signs that it is fraying .
In Mosul , a suicide truck bomber killed 15 Iraqi soldiers and wounded 45 people , including civilians , in an attack on an Iraqi army base , the Interior Ministry said .
U.S. commanders describe Mosul as al Qaeda ’s last urban stronghold in Iraq .
Much of Sunday ’s violence took place in Baghdad , the centre of sectarian bloodletting between Iraq ’s majority Shi’ites and minority Sunni Muslims in 2006 and 2007 in which tens of thousands died .
A security crackdown by U.S. and Iraqi forces has since sharply reduced levels of violence .
Gunmen in three cars opened fire on pedestrians in the religiously mixed southern district of Zaafariniya , killing at least seven and wounding 16 , police said .
Blood and bullet casings littered the street in front of a clinic , market and a housing compound .
“ I heard that my brother was killed .
I just want to know how the terrorists got through all the checkpoints to reach here , ” said Zaafaraniya resident Abu Mohammed .
In northwestern Baghdad ’s Shula district , a predominantly Shi’ite neighborhood , a suicide car bomber killed six people waiting in a petrol queue , police said .
ATTACKS UNUSUAL
The U.S. - protected Green Zone in central Baghdad was hit by at least three separate barrages in the morning and after night fell , suggesting that militants are becoming bolder .
It is unusual for there to be so many attacks in a single day .
A U.S. embassy spokesman said the attacks wounded five people in the Green Zone .
The Green Zone was often hit by rockets and mortars at the height of sectarian violence a year ago , but attacks have become rarer as security has improved across Iraq .

Baghdad police said 17 people were killed when mortars and Katyusha rockets , either randomly aimed or which misfired , hit three Baghdad neighborhoods during the attack on the Green Zone .
Interior Ministry sources said five people were killed .
In those attacks , police said one mortar hit a house in downtown Baghdad killing a man and woman and their three sons .
U.S. embassy officials confirmed “ indirect fire ” attacks on the Green Zone , a term used to describe rocket or mortar fire .

“ The assessment at this time is that it caused no deaths or major casualties , ” said an embassy spokeswoman .
A large plume of thick black smoke could be seen rising from one part of the Green Zone , which houses many government ministries and diplomatic missions , including the U.S. embassy .
Sirens could be heard warning people to take cover .
While there was no immediate claim of responsibility , suspicion is likely to fall on Sadr ’s Mehdi Army , which last week clashed with Iraqi and U.S. forces in the southern city of Kut and southern Baghdad .
Mehdi Army fighters are known to be chafing over the seven - month - old ceasefire , which they complain is being exploited by U.S. forces and police allied to a rival Shi’ite faction to target them in the oil - producing south of the country .
The U.S. military meanwhile said it killed 12 insurgents in a raid on a house east of Baquba in volatile Diyala province .
“ Six of the terrorists killed had shaved their bodies , which is consistent with final preparation for suicide operations , ” spokesman Major Winfield Danielson said .
Mosul and Baquba are the capitals of two of four northern provinces where offensives were launched this year against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda fighters who regrouped there after being driven out of strongholds around Baghdad and western Anbar .
The Iraq war last week moved into its sixth year , U.S. President George W. Bush marking the anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein with an upbeat speech in which he said the United States was on track to victory .
独身のグラフィックデザイナーの自分は、欲求不満解消のために風俗に行くようなことはありません。
ほぼオナニーで解消しています。
無修正モノの動画などは、気軽に手に入る時代ですから、それらを使っています。
しかし、もう少し刺激が強いおかずがほしいと思うようになっていました。
動画とは違ったオナニーの興奮はないかと調べていました。
見つけ出したのがテレクラマックスというツーショットダイヤルです。
エロ系サービスですから、エッチ気分の女の子と出会えるのではないかと期待しました。
何の気なしに利用をしてみました。
するとオナニーをしていた女の子と通話になりました。
こういうシチュエーションは初めてでしたから、ひたすら驚かされた感じです。
心臓バクバクさせながら通話したのですが、相手から突然にオナ指示してほしいと言われました。
テレフォンセックス経験がなかった自分は、ただひたすら焦りを感じました。
でも相手のアヘ声を聞いていると、自然と言葉が飛び出してきました。
自分の出すオナ指示で 「ああん、いいっ」とよがる声を聞いてフルボッキのチンコをさすりまくったのです。
あまりにも激しい興奮のため、我を忘れた状態でした。
オナ指示を出すことがこれほど深く激しい興奮を利用者なのかと感動さえ覚えました。
自分の出すオナ指示に従順に従い、オナニーを続ける女の子の声は格別に聞こえました。
耳元でリアルタイムの喘ぎ声を聞けるし、1人で虚しくするオナニーとは全く違った官能を感じました。
無事にオナ指示を出し続け、互いのアクメをたっぷり感じあった後、通話が終了。
その余韻がたまらなく心地良いものに感じました。
こんな素晴らしい関係を、もっと続けなければ損をしてしまうと思いました。
誰かにこの興奮を伝えたくなっている自分がいました。
きっと興味を持ってくれるはずです。
こういう話を楽しそうに聞いてくれる男を思いつきました。
それは高校時代から今でも付き合いのある友人です。
彼も独身で欲求不満のようだから、テレクラの話を教えてやるためLINEを送りました。
テレクラの体験を高校時代の友人に話すことにしました。
彼も独身で欲求不満なのはよくわかっていました。
彼から通知が帰ってきて通話になり、じっくり話すことになりました。
自分がテレクラでいきなり女の子とテレセをしてしまった話をしたところ、ものすごい勢いで食いついてきてくれました。
しかし、彼から思うぬ関係を聞き出すことになってしまいました。
テレクラと違って、相手を探す時間が必要にはなるけれど無料で楽しむ方法があるっていうんです。
無料でたっぷりオナ指示が出せたら、これはなかなか面白いことになると思いました。
下手をすれば毎日だって性処理が可能になってきます。
彼に自慢話をするつもりが、逆にあれこれと教えてもらう立場になってしまいました。
彼は無料通話アプリを利用し、料金を一切かけずにオナ指示を出して快楽を楽しんでいたらしいのです。
通話が可能な相手を探すのは、出会い系サイトで時間をかけてやることが必要のようです。
このときお金はかかるものの、かなりの低料金のようでした。
また女の子も、リアルな関係ではないため通話してくれる可能性も高めだと言われました。
そこから無料通話アプリで仲良くなったら、オナ友として関係を続けることまで可能だと言うのです。
こんな素晴らしい方法を、なぜ今まで黙っていたんだって感じでした。
オナ指示出しながら相手を興奮させ、自分もハッスルしてオナニーをする関係を作りたい気持ちを強めました。
無料でオナ指示をやりまくりたい自分は、友人に詳しくノウハウを聞いていくことになりました。
彼のやる方法はとても理にかなっているように感じられたし、実際に彼自身が美味しい思いをしているのもわかりました。
最終的にはセックスフレンドになるとまで言われたのだから、どうしても彼と同じ行動を取らなければいけない気持ちになったのです。

As the old adage has it , cleanliness is next to godliness , but it also has sinister consequences for lab rats : they are much more likely to cannibalise their young if their cages are frequently cleaned .
Charlotte Burn at the University of Oxford and Georgia Mason at the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada , found that nearly twice as many pups were eaten in cages cleaned twice a week as in those cleaned fortnightly ( Applied Animal Behaviour Science , DOI : 10.1016/j.applanim.2008.02.005 ) .
Cannibalism was most likely if the cages were cleaned soon after the pups were born .
Burn notes that cannibalism in …
In 1967 Gene Amdahl pointed out what appeared to be a fundamental limit in how fast you can make concurrent code .
Only a portion of a program 's processing can be run entirely in parallel , and only that portion can scale directly on machines having more and more processor cores .
The rest of the program 's work is sequential .
The main problem that Amdahl ’s law highlights is locking contention , a problem exacerbated as the number of processor cores increase .
Most large CPU shared memory hardware systems support very fast concurrent reads but are speed limited to " 1 - cache - miss - per - write " or " 1 - memory - bus - update - per - write , " so it is important to avoid all CPUs writing to the same location .
Even with reader - writer lock , it is not possible to scale past the 50 - 100 CPU range .
Multi -core processing is an increasing industry trend with almost all hardware manufacturers now exploring the possibilities .
Azul is making production hardware with 768 cores , Sun's Rock is around 64 , and even x86 based commodity hardware is expanding the number of cores it uses .
Thus the problem of lock contention is becoming a pressing one for developers looking to write performant code .
Dr Cliff Click , a distinguished engineer at Azul Systems , gave a talk ( slides here ) at this year ’s JavaOne describing a set of techniques that have allowed him to get quite some way towards a scalable , non-blocking coding style in Java .
In very broad terms his approach implements a non-blocking algorithm such that stopping one particular thread does not stop global progress .
The major components of Click ’s work are :
A large , fast array to hold all the data which allows rapid parallel reads of the data and also allows a parallel , incremental , concurrent copy .
Atomic - update on those array words ( using java.util.concurrent.Atomic .* ) .
The Atomic update will use either Compare and Swap ( CAS ) if the processor is Azul / Sparc / x86 , or Load Linked / Store - conditional ( LL/SC ) on the IBM platform .
A Finite State Machine ( FSM ) built from the atomic update and logically replicated per array word .
The FSM supports array resize and is used to control writes .
With these basic elements in place , Click then constructs an algorithm from many FSM steps that is lock free , ie each CAS makes progress .
A CAS success is a local success , whilst a CAS failure means another CAS succeeded .
If the CAS is successful the state machine advances , whilst a failed CAS retries .
Click has implemented two examples ( Bit Vector and Hash Table ) with the code available on SourceForge and is working on a third ( a FIFO queue ) .
To take one example in slightly more detail , the hash table is an array of Key Value pairs with the keys in even slots and values in odd slots .
Each word is Compared and Swept separately but the state machine spans both words and during copy includes words from both arrays .
The hash table implementation supports concurrent insert , remove test and resize and passes the Java Compatibility Kit ( JCK ) for ConcurrentHashMap .
On Azul ’s hardware it obtains linear scaling to 768 CPUs with more than a billion reads / second simultaneous with more than 10 million updates / second .
InfoQ spoke to Dr. Click to get a little more background on the work .
During his JavaOne talk he highlighted a couple of issues with writing the hash table implementation in Java so we asked him how suitable Java was for this kind of work .
He responded that it was " actually fairly suitable ... it has a well understood memory model ( and well implemented ) .
It 's lacking in some fine - control issues , which I can ignore as they cost a little bit of performance .
This lack of fine - control ( i.e. direct ASM access ) would be a problem with e.g. OS design or device drivers , but not for performant data structures . ”
We also asked when he would recommend using one of his data structures .
His general advice was to use it when the " tried and true " alternatives are too slow to be useful :
“ When a single data structure is highly contended ; and you 've already tried e.g. java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap .
My stuff is generally slightly faster with no load ( so no real reason to use it ) , and works much better
- with more than 32 cpus contending , or
- with a high percentage of writes vs reads .
Your mileage may vary , of course , so test before using . ”
There 's a lot of activity around concurrency in Java at the moment and Dr. Click 's work tackles similar problems to the fork / join framework being considered for Java 7 .
Although not a member of the expert group himself , Click is regularly consulted by them .
Microsoft 's chief executive , Steve Ballmer , narrowly avoided getting egg on his face on Monday when a furious Hungarian student began pelting him with missiles during a lecture at a university in Budapest .
In an incident caught on video which has fast become a YouTube hit , the boss of the world 's biggest software company was obliged to take cover under a desk at Corvinus University to avoid a one - man protest by a portly , bespectacled individual in a white shirt .
The interruption happened just as Ballmer began addressing the students by asking , in avuncular fashion , how many of them were studying for imminent exams .
" Hey , you ! " yelled the protestor , standing up in the audience .
In heavily accented English , the angry student accused Microsoft of stealing an indecipherable figure " from the Hungarian people " .
He continued : " Give the money back , right now ! "
An onslaught of three eggs missed Ballmer but hit a white board just above him as the billionaire software chief crouched to the floor .
Having delivered his message , the student abruptly walked out of the room , muttering in Hungarian .
His shirt had " Microsoft = corruption " scrawled on the back .
Hungarian news reports suggested that the student was upset that the country 's government has awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide software and IT training to local professionals under a program called Titan .
Although he looked briefly shaken , Ballmer laughed off the attack , telling his audience : " It was a friendly disruption ... that broke my train of thought . "
The episode comes as Microsoft continues delicate negotiations over a possible takeover or partnership with Yahoo .
It is not the first time that Ballmer has unwittingly starred in a viral video .
A few years ago , a clip of him running around a stage at a conference , pumping his fists and screaming to a Gloria Estefan track became an online hit .
In the incident , dubbed a " monkey dance " by bloggers , a clearly emotional Ballmer raised his arms , revealing large sweat patches , and bellowed : " I have four words for ya - I love this company ! "

Near the end of Alex Jones ’ appearance on Fox News ’ Geraldo at Large , host Gerald Rivera calls for Florida governor Charlie Crist and his attorney general Bill McCollum to “ investigate the apparent suicide of Debra Jeane Palfrey because if these three people ( Alex Jones , former judge Jeanine Pirro , and former prosecutor Kimberly Guilfoyle ) are all agreed — and I tend to agree with them — this is too stinky to pass the stink test . ”
Indeed , the Debra Jeane Palfrey case stinks — and certainly reeks enough to merit an investigation .
But the question is : will Crist risk his office to bring Palfrey ’s killers to justice ?
“ Think about it , ” said Pirro , “ you got a top State Department official , you got a military strategist , a United States Senator , you got all of these individuals , lobbyists paying for prostitutes , ” and most importantly , according to investigator Wayne Madsen ’s sources inside the CIA and the Pentagon , Dick Cheney was on Palfrey ’s customer list .
Cheney was CEO of Halliburton during the time of his alleged liaisons with the Pamela Martin & Associates escort firm .
Geraldo insists Crist is a man of principle .
However , if he has any skeletons in his closet , chances are slim he will investigate this “ suicide , ” obviously a murder intended to take Palfrey ’s secrets to the grave .
Crist may look with trepidation at the Eliot Spitzer scandal .
As F. William Engdahl wrote on March 18 , the FBI release of “ wiretap data to the New York Times exposing the tryst of New York state Governor , Eliot Spitzer , the now - infamous ‘ No.9 , ’ with a luxury call - girl ” is “ highly bizarre , ” but not so bizarre when you consider Spitzer ’s record “ as a relentless State Attorney General going after financial crimes such as the Enron fraud and corruption by Wall Street investment banks during the 2002 dot.com bubble era …
He made powerful enemies by all accounts , ” as did Palfrey , who vowed to reveal names if sent to prison .
Going after the financial crimes of Enron and Wall Street pale in comparison when stacked up against outing the salacious and illegal behavior of Dick Cheney , a U.S. senator , and a top State Department official .
For the crime of placing the blame for the current financial and economic disaster at the doorstep of the Bush administration , Spitzer “ signed his own political death warrant , ” writes Engdahl .
Indeed , Spitzer was lucky , as only his career suffered sudden death .
Debra Jeane Palfrey was not so lucky .
Or was Jonathan Luna .
Luna , a Baltimore - based Assistant United States Attorney , apparently suffered the same fate as Palfrey , although his murder , also excused as a “ suicide , ” was far more grisly .
At the time of his “ suicide , ” Luna was working under fired US attorney Thomas M. DiBiagio , who was investigating corruption charges against then - Republican Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich and his staff , the lot accused of engaging the services of Palfrey ’s escorts .
In addition to Ehrlich , Jack Abramoff , convicted of fraud in dealings with SunCruz Casinos , was under investigation at the time of Luna ’s “ suicide , ” obviously a homicide .
It is said Luna stabbed himself 36 times with a penknife and subsequently drowned himself in a creek in Denver , Pennsylvania .
Luna ’s purported “ suicide ” is as “ stinky ” as the “ suicide ” of prize - winning investigative journalist Gary Webb , who made public details of the CIA ’s cocaine smuggling operation .
Webb , we are expected to believe , shot himself twice in the head .
“ Credible sources who were close to Gary Webb have stated that he was receiving death threats , being regularly followed , and that he was concerned about strange individuals who were seen on multiple occasions breaking into and leaving his house before his apparent ‘ suicide , ' ” Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson wrote in December , 2004 .
“ Palfrey ’s building manager said she often told him she believed she was being followed and he thinks there may have been some former clients of her escort service who wanted her dead , ” WESH 2 in Orlando reported last week .
“ She insinuated that there is a contract out for her and I fully believe they succeeded , ” said the building manager .
It is now up to Florida governor Charlie Crist to investigate this highly suspect case .
However , as Mr. Crist more than likely does not wish to suffer the same fate as New York state governor , Eliot Spitzer , it remains to be seen if he will indeed pick up the ball and run with it .
Spitzer ’s case sends a strong message – if you value your job , indeed your life , you will not mess with the Mafia .
It is not healthy to mess with the Mafia — and rest assured , the U.S. government is the largest , most vicious and murderous organized crime syndicate on the planet .

The body of a man , believed to be missing TV presenter Mark Speight , has been found in a remote area of London 's Paddington station , police have said .
Officers are treating the death as " unexplained " but have confirmed that the man had not been hit by a train .
Mr Speight , 42 , disappeared last Monday , three months after the death of his fiancee , Natasha Collins , in the bath of the flat they shared in London .
Miss Collins ' mother was devastated at the latest news , her spokeswoman said .
She asked for Carmen Collins to be given time to grieve in peace .
The BBC released a statement saying : " This is very sad news and our thoughts and sympathies are with Mark 's family and friends .
" Mark was a hugely talented and very popular presenter for many years . "
Video footage
The body of the man was found at about 1000 BST at the station .
Mr Speight 's relatives have been informed of the discovery , police said , but a formal identification has yet to take place .
Mr Speight said in January he was " distraught " at Miss Collins ' death Video footage from CCTV cameras at the station is to be studied by officers as part of their investigation .
The presenter , who was the host of BBC children 's show SMart until February , was reported missing last Monday when he failed to meet Miss Collins ' mother as arranged .
He was recorded on a security camera entering Queen 's Park underground station in north - west London .
Then , 22 minutes later , he boarded a train on the Bakerloo Line , which serves Paddington .
' Fragile state ' Relatives had made a number of appeals over the past few days , with his father , Oliver , urging him to get in touch and not to " give up " during his time of grief .
He was blessed with a remarkable personality , great artistic talents and the wonderful warm ability to communicate those skills with people , especially children of all ages
Jan Kennedy
Mark Speight 's agent
The families of both Mr Speight and Miss Collins had issued a joint statement , expressing their " deep concern " and saying he had been in " a fragile state of mind " when he vanished .
A friend had also described how Mr Speight , originally from Wolverhampton , had been planning a concert as a tribute to his late fiancee , which would have raised money for one of her chosen charities .
Mr Speight had been arrested on suspicion of murder and supplying Class A drugs following the discovery of Miss Collins ' body at their St John 's Wood flat on 3 January .
No charges were brought , however .
She suffered burns on 60 % of her body from boiling water and had suffered a drugs overdose after taking cocaine , sleeping pills and alcohol .
A coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure at an inquest earlier this month .
Police had released CCTV footage of Mr Speight at Queen 's Park station Speaking on behalf of Mr Speight 's agent , Billy Marsh Associates , Jan Kennedy said the discovery of the body at Paddington had left the company " absolutely devastated " .
" Caring and compassionate in everything he did , Mark was truly gifted in life and we are proud to have represented him as a friend and client for almost 20 years , " she added .
" He was blessed with a remarkable personality , great artistic talents and the wonderful warm ability to communicate those skills with people , especially children of all ages .
" With his sensitivity of spirit , coupled with his dynamic presence and natural enthusiasm , he was loved and respected by his adoring family , friends and colleagues everywhere in the media , " Ms Kennedy said .

Heavily armed Shia gunmen attacked Druze areas such as Choueifat Control of several villages loyal to Lebanon 's pro-government Druze leader Walid Jumblatt has been handed to the army after an attack by Hezbollah .
The group 's fighters used heavy weapons and small arms to attack the mountain settlements south - east of Beirut .
A truce was called after the Druze capitulated to avoid bloodshed , a BBC correspondent reports .
It follows four days of fighting in which Hezbollah stormed west Beirut , raising fears of a return to civil war .
About 40 people have died in total in the clashes , which pitch the Syrian - backed Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah and its allies against the governing Western - backed Sunni , Christian and Druze alliance .
Beirut was quiet on Sunday , after control of areas seized by Hezbollah was handed to the Lebanese army , but clashes took place overnight in Lebanon 's second city , Tripoli .
Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo have urged an immediate halt to the fighting in Lebanon and agreed to send a ministerial delegation to Beirut to try to mediate an end to the crisis .
Lebanon 's problems are part of a much bigger struggle , which is why they are so dangerous for the Middle East , says BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen , who is in the country .
Druze appeal
The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut reports that Sunday 's battle began in earnest after some skirmishing and provocations , with a string of Druze villages caught in a barrage of fire .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Mr Jumblatt knew Hezbollah , by far the strongest power in the land , could easily storm his entire mountain enclave , so he asked a Druze rival allied to Hezbollah to broker a deal to hand the whole area over to the Lebanese army , he adds .
" I tell my supporters that civil peace , coexistence and stopping war and destruction are more important than any other consideration , " Mr Jumblatt told the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation .
A ceasefire was arranged , and it seems to be generally holding , our correspondent says .
The army is also filling the vacuum in west Beirut since Hezbollah 's withdrawal on Saturday .
Violence erupted in Beirut after the government moved to shut down Hezbollah 's telecoms network and remove the chief of security at Beirut airport for alleged sympathies with Hezbollah .
The group 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , called the move a " declaration of war " .
Seen by many as neutral , the army has emerged as an arbiter
But the army , which correspondents say remains trusted by most of Lebanon 's competing political factions , overturned both measures after Hezbollah gunmen seized control of swathes of the city .
On Sunday many roads in the capital remained blocked , including the airport road , as the Shia group continued a campaign of civil disobedience .
In Tripoli , Sunni supporters of the government have reportedly been fighting members of an Alawite sect loyal to Hezbollah with machine - guns and rocket - propelled grenades .
At least one person was killed over the weekend and thousands are believed to have fled their homes .
Stalemate
For the past 16 months , Lebanon has been locked in political stalemate between the ruling coalition and Hezbollah - led opposition over the make - up of the government .
High stakes of Lebanon 's crisis

The country has been without a president since late 2007 , although there is general consensus that the head of the army , Gen Michel Suleiman , would make the best compromise candidate .
The Arab League delegation agreed on in Cairo will be led by the Qatari Foreign Minister , Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem .
Ministers also decided to give what they describe as logistical support to the Lebanese army to help it maintain security .
The delegation 's mediation mission will not be easy , the BBC's Heba Saleh reports .
An existing Arab League initiative aimed at facilitating the election of a Lebanese president has been deadlocked for months and Syria , a key Hezbollah ally , stayed away from Sunday 's meeting .
The fighting in Lebanon is seen as a disaster by pro-Western Arab countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia , which are concerned about the influence of Hezbollah 's other ally Iran , our correspondent adds .
Lebanon was plunged into civil war from 1975 - 90 , drawing in Syria and Israel , the two regional powers .

McCain risks looking inauthentic and conventional if he solidifies standing with conservatives and then races back to the middle to appeal to swing voters .
GOP getting crushed in polls , key races
John McCain is planning to run as a different kind of Republican .
But being any kind of Republican seems like some sort of death sentence these days .
In case you ’ve been too consumed by the Democratic race to notice , Republicans are getting crushed in historic ways both at the polls and in the polls .
Advertisement
At the polls , it has been a massacre .
In recent weeks , Republicans have lost a Louisiana House seat they had held for more than two decades and an Illinois House seat they had held for more than three .
Internal polls show that next week they could lose a Mississippi House seat that they have held for 13 years .
In the polls , they are setting records ( and not the good kind ) .
The most recent Gallup Poll has 67 percent of voters disapproving of President Bush ; those numbers are worse than Richard Nixon ’s on the eve of his resignation .
A CBS News poll taken at the end of April found only 33 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the GOP — the lowest since CBS started asking the question more than two decades ago .
By comparison , 52 percent of the public has a favorable view of the Democratic Party .
Things are so bad that many people do n’t even want to call themselves Republicans .
The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press has found the lowest percentage of self - described Republicans in 16 years of polling .
“ The anti-Republican mood is fairly big , and it has been overwhelming , ” said Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis .
With an environment so toxic , does McCain have even a chance of winning in November ?
The McCain camp thinks so — but only if he sands down the “ R ” next to his name .
“ Nobody ever gets elected president by running on their party label , ” said Charlie Black , a senior McCain adviser .
“ The character , the qualities , the independence — that certainly allows him to rise over the party label .
It is more important than usual to rise above the party label . ”
This statement seems a little at odds with the current McCain strategy .
The presumptive GOP nominee has spent much of the recent campaign fastening himself to the traditional Republican brand and even to Bush himself .
McCain ’s views on the war , the overall economy ( especially supporting the Bush tax cuts he previously opposed ) , the mortgage crisis and judicial appointments are hardly the stuff of a new kind of Republicanism .
McCain risks looking inauthentic and conventional to both camps if he simply solidifies his standing with conservatives and then races back to the middle to appeal to swing voters .
For now , Republicans are heartened by how well McCain sometimes does in head - to - head polling with Barack Obama , the likely Democratic nominee .
But it ’s silly to watch those numbers :
They fluctuate and reflect nothing more than momentary feelings about the candidates , and they come at a time when public attention is fixed on the final rounds of the Democratic slugfest .
Right now , most voters with any familiarity with McCain probably know him as a war hero , somewhat of a maverick in the Senate and a pretty affable candidate .
Let ’s see how they view McCain after Democrats use their decisive money advantage to paint him as a much - older Bush clone who loves an unpopular war and knows little about the economy .
Democrats provided us a look at their polling data from 17 swing states — data they ’re using to craft new attacks on McCain as Bush 44 .
The Democratic National Committee polling , according to a memo it provided , has two - thirds of swing voters expecting McCain to pursue policies very similar to Bush ’s .
The voters ’ top three concerns about McCain : his age , his support for the war and his similarities to Bush .
The latest DNC ad ties two of the three together , slamming McCain over the war and showing a picture of him embracing Bush .
Lots more to come on that front , DNC officials said .
The DNC will leave the age issue alone for now .
Many top Republicans seem heartened by Obama ’s likely victory on the Democratic side .
They say they ’re confident Obama will pay a big price for his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the persistent questions about his patriotism and his inability to connect with working - class whites in swing states .
These are all big problems for Obama .
But he will have a massive cash advantage when it comes time to fight back , and the Republican National Committee ’s fundraising edge over the DNC wo n’t be enough to overcome it .
Consider this fact :
Since the beginning of last year , Obama , Hillary Rodham Clinton and the DNC have raised $ 460 million total — about $ 200 million more than what McCain , Mitt Romney and the RNC raised together in the same time span .
Rich liberals operating outside the traditional fundraising structure are also in private talks to vastly outspend the GOP on issue ads and voter mobilization efforts .
Still , McCain ’s biggest problem is the toxic political atmosphere for his party .
It ’s so toxic , some Republicans are pointing to 1976 as a favorable historical comparison .
That was the year Gerald Ford ran in the dark shadows of Watergate and lost to Jimmy Carter .
Says Dick Wadhams , the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party : “ When voters really homed in on the choice between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and what each stood for , Gerald Ford almost won the election despite this horrible environment . ”
Almost .

The businessman was meeting with clients for lunch at Mimi's Café when he noticed the woman .
Sitting a few tables over with her 4 - year - old boy , she seemed groggy — yet she was drinking a mimosa .
It got worse .
The woman ordered a glass of white wine , then another .
She was so out of it , the businessman would later write in a statement to police , that she looked ready to fall asleep at the table .
When the woman paid her bill and left the restaurant , the businessman was right behind her , cell phone in hand .
When she ran a stop sign in the parking lot , he called the police .
Info drunk driving
By the time the cops showed up a few minutes later , the woman already had parked at the Chandler Mall , less than a mile from Mimi's .
She was buying bath salts when the businessman pointed her out to the cops .
Thanks to the businessman 's intervention , Shannon Wilcutt was eventually charged with three felony counts : a DUI above 0.08 , a DUI with a child under 15 in the car , and drug possession .
Justice served , right ?
Hardly .
Turns out , those glasses of white wine were actually water .
Wilcutt was groggy because she 'd just had dental surgery .
She 'd thought a mimosa might be soothing , but when it stung her sutures , she pushed it away half - finished .
The proof is in the police report : Wilcutt 's blood alcohol content was only 0.02 , the equivalent of one drink .
She was n't even close to the legal limit .
No matter .
Shannon Wilcutt was busted anyway .
Her little boy was taken from her as she was handcuffed , arrested , and entered into the justice system .
That meant weekly random alcohol tests , weekly phone calls to a court - appointed " counselor , " and the looming possibility of heavy fines and a three - year license revocation , not to mention jail time .
It would take two years and thousands of dollars for Wilcutt to be vindicated .
Here 's what really happened .
Shannon Wilcutt was n't a big drinker , and she 'd certainly never been in trouble with the law before .
Her husband , Bryan , is a software engineer working on his doctorate in computer science .
Shannon is a homemaker who 's taking classes at the University of Phoenix , though at the time of her arrest she worked in Walgreens ' inventory department .
The couple have three boys and a home on a quiet street in the older part of Chandler .
On the morning of May 18 , 2006 , Wilcutt , then 34 , underwent surgery to remove a bad set of dentures .
The dentist used Novocain but did n't knock her out .
After the procedure , her dentist cleared her to leave — and prescribed hydrocodone for the pain .
( That medication is a generic form of Vicodin . )
Too tired to cook , Wilcutt took 4 - year - old John to Mimi's Café , a chain restaurant .
She ate soup and a muffin and drank half a mimosa , but the orange juice irritated her mouth , which was raw and sore from the surgery .
Feeling dehydrated , she switched to water .
The waitress brought her goblet after goblet .
At the very end of the meal , Wilcutt took one hydrocodone pill .
She wanted to stop at the mall and get bath salts , a trip she estimated at 10 minutes , max .
She figured the pain pill would kick in as she reached her house and settled into the tub .
She did n't realize that Steven Ceballes , the aforementioned businessman , had already made a phone call .
Ceballes is the owner of a commercial landscape company called Horticulture West .
Dining with clients , he noticed that Wilcutt was woozy .
He suspected alcohol , according to a statement he gave police , so he called the cops .
He then followed Wilcutt 's minivan to the Chandler Mall to point her out to the officers .
( Reached by phone , Ceballes declined comment and told New Times not to include his name in this story .
Then he hung up . )
At the time , Wilcutt was suffering from numerous health problems .
She was significantly overweight , asthmatic , and had a herniated disc in her back .
So although she did fine on some of the field sobriety tests , like counting to 30 , she had difficulty walking and turning and standing on one leg .
She was also freaking out .
She felt herself gasping for breath ; right in front of the police officers , she took a hit on her inhaler .
Numerous academic studies have shown that inhalers can artificially increase a breathalyzer 's blood alcohol reading .
But the cops administered the breath test anyway , just minutes after she used her inhaler , Wilcutt says .
Sure enough , it gave an inflated reading of 0.048 .
Even that , of course , is well under the legal limit .
But the cops were convinced Wilcutt was impaired , possibly by drugs .
She said she 'd taken one hydrocodone pill , but they were convinced she 'd had at least two .
The police report notes that Wilcutt 's eyes were heavy and " her speech was slow and slurred . "
" I had no teeth in , " she says now , laughing .
" I had just had my dentures removed , remember ? "
The sketchy sobriety tests , plus Wilcutt 's admission that she 'd taken a hydrocodone pill , were enough to book her .
She was handcuffed and taken to a jail cell , where she waited for her husband to pick her up .
( John , terrified , was separated from his mother and taken to the police station to wait with the officers . )
It took nearly five months for DPS to return Wilcutt 's drug screen .
Turns out , she had taken just one hydrocodone , the prescribed dosage .
Meanwhile , her blood test confirmed Wilcutt 's protestations that she had n't been swilling wine .
Blood tests are significantly more accurate than portable breathalyzers like the one police initially used .
Wilcutt 's test put her blood alcohol content at 0.022 — way under the legal limit of 0.08 .
Chandler Police Detective David Ramer tells me that did n't matter .
A witness said she was driving badly .
( Never mind that the witness also mistook water for wine .
Makes you wonder about his powers of perception , does n't it ? )
They also knew she 'd been driving with a little kid in the car .
And there was hydrocodone in her blood — the fact that it was legally prescribed does n't matter if it affected her driving .
Police are still convinced it did , Ramer says .
So police recommended three felony charges .
The county attorney agreed .
Something weird happened in the process .
Chandler Police had recommended that Shannon Wilcutt be charged with " being impaired to the slightest degree , " a charge that allows cops to use discretion and charge someone with DUI , even if their blood alcohol content is as low as 0.02 .
But when the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office indicted her , Wilcutt was instead charged with DUI above 0.08 — a ludicrous charge on its face , and one that prosecutors could never possibly prove in court .
( The County Attorney 's Office did not respond to requests for comment . )
Ultimately , though , the details did n't matter .
In cases like these , it 's still up to the accused to prove innocence , or face trial .
And Shannon Wilcutt was never going to plead guilty to any charge of driving while impaired .
" I 'm Italian - Irish , " she says , describing her willingness to fight .
" And I knew I was n't guilty . "
She had an added incentive .
The Wilcutts were in the process of getting approval to adopt a pair of kids out of the foster care system .
They worried that , even absent a conviction , the nature of the charges could derail their plan .
Last month , the county attorney dropped all charges .
The part that still stings ?
The Wilcutts can never recoup the $ 12,000 they spent in legal fees , money they had to borrow money from friends and family .
" We essentially did n't have a Christmas because we were making payments to people , " Bryan Wilcutt says .
The Wilcutts ' adoption plans are moving forward .
They 're excited about adding to their family .
But it 's hard to put the events of last year behind them .
" These were just bizarre circumstances that collided in one day to cause this , " Bryan Wilcutt acknowledges .
" But there are checkpoints that should make sure that a case like this does n't go any further .
" When they saw the results of her blood and alcohol tests , this should have all gone away . "
Your immediate reaction to that story is probably much like mine .
Yes , it 's scary , and it cost the Wilcutts plenty , but it was an aberration .
The circumstances were bizarre .
You and I have nothing to worry about .
Then I talked to Diana Sifford .
Sifford , 52 , is a slim , attractive woman with a job in midlevel management at a local healthcare company .
She was at first nervous about telling her story ; she knows people immediately jump to conclusions , and she 's not sure she wants to put herself out there .
Plus , she 's passionately opposed to drunk driving — she wants to make that clear .
Her story , though , is just as frightening as Shannon Wilcutt's .
Sifford was driving home from a George Thorogood concert last October .
It was the first time she 'd gone out in months ; she 'd had back surgery five weeks before and was taking time to heal up .
The concert was fun , but by midnight , she was looking forward to bed .
Sifford was just a mile from her house when she noticed a car stopped by police , and she slowed down to rubberneck .
" I have two boys in their early 20s , " she explains .
" Every time I see a cop car , or an accident , I automatically think of my boys . "
But she passed too close to the parked car .
That was her one mistake .
The next thing Sifford knew , she was charged with DUI , driving under the influence of drugs , unsafe passing of an emergency vehicle , and failure to drive in a single lane .
She 'd had only one glass of wine .
She 'd been the designated driver .
The crazy thing is that police knew that when they charged her .
The breathalyzer put her blood alcohol content at 0.03 , well below the 0.08 legal limit .
But the Scottsdale police were convinced Sifford was on drugs .
Without evidence , the officer kept hassling her about whether or not she 'd used cocaine at the concert , Sifford says .
And when Sifford volunteered that she 'd taken a Vicodin earlier in the day because she was still suffering the effects of surgery , they surely thought they had her .
That 's where the " driving under the influence of drugs " charge came from .
A urine test , performed by officers that night , revealed not even a trace amount of Vicodin .
She 'd taken the pill so many hours earlier that it had passed out of her system entirely .
And , of course , there was no coke in her blood , either .
Diana Sifford was n't drunk , and she was n't high .
She just drove too close to a parked car .
She was handcuffed , taken to the station , and booked .
Her car was impounded .
In great pain from sitting while handcuffed , with a tender back , and exhausted , she was n't released until early morning .
A cop friend told her not to hire a lawyer and to tell the truth at her pretrial hearing and that she'd be okay .
But the pretrial hearing was a cattle call — she had just five minutes with the prosecutor , who offered to drop the other charges if she pleaded guilty to the DUI .
Sifford was not about to do that .
After the judge refused to listen to her story — refused to even look at the paperwork she 'd brought — she knew she had to hire a lawyer .
It cost her about $ 3,000 , but it worked .
In January , Sifford pleaded guilty to a single charge of not staying in her lane and agreed to a defensive - driving class .
" I had to go through this ordeal for four months , " she says .
" Not sleeping .
And it was basically a $ 3,000 traffic ticket . "
But I was struck by something as I talked to Sifford .
She begged me not to read too much into the police report — in the officer 's account of her field sobriety tests , she was sniffing constantly , her pulse was above normal , and she swayed .
Reading that , without the results of the urine test , you might assume she was coked - up .
But that 's the thing about these reports .
You can see it on Shannon Wilcutt 's , too .
Shannon Wilcutt had a 0.02 blood alcohol content , but the police report notes a " moderate " odor of alcohol on her breath .
How is that possible ?
It also says that her speech was " slurred " and she had dried blood on her lips .
That could n't possibly be related to dental surgery , could it ?
And what about Diana Sifford 's rapid pulse ?
Could it be that she was simply anxious about being pulled over ?
The cops were building their cases ; it was up to Wilcutt and Sifford to find lawyers willing to ferret out the truth .
The officers are only doing their job , but their job is to bust drunk drivers .
That 's what the Legislature wants , what the governor wants , and what the public wants .
From the minute the cops pull you over , they assume you 're drunk .
It 's your job to prove yourself innocent .
Frightening .
And it 's also frightening to think how much overtime money , how many grants from the state and federal government , goes toward busting drivers like Shannon Wilcutt and Diana Sifford .
Not to mention paying public defenders in cases where the defendant can't afford a lawyer .
Keeping dangerous drunks off the road should be a priority for all of us .
If that means major penalties for a first offense , if that means mandatory Interlock for first time offenders — heck , even if it means yet another " public health " campaign plastering County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' mug on billboards across town — it 's hard to argue against it .
The problem comes when the focus shifts from stopping real drunks to punishing people who 've had only a glass of wine or half a mimosa .
It 's also troubling , I think , when the punishment is n't commensurate with the crime .
Studies have shown that drivers chatting on their cell phones are just as dangerous as those who've had a few drinks .
So why should we want to slap three felonies on a woman who 's had half a mimosa — when we give a mere citation to drivers impaired by their cell phone use ?
Last year , Phoenix was one of the first municipalities in the Valley to pass a law banning text messaging while driving .
Good move , right ?
But the fines and fees amount to less than $ 500 even in a case in which an accident is involved .
Contrast that with someone who's had a few drinks and gets into an accident — you can bet that driver 's not getting off without jail time , even though the damage is the same .
It all comes down to our attitude about drinking .
Groups like MADD have done such a great job humanizing the victims of drunk drivers , but we forget about the bigger picture .
ADOT statistics show that in 94.5 percent of all car accidents in Arizona in 2006 ( the most recent year available ) , drivers involved had not a drop of alcohol in their systems .
Six times as many accidents were caused by speed as by alcohol impairment .
But we still want to throw the book at tipsy drivers — even tipsy drivers who are n't involved in crashes .
Thanks to new laws passed by the Arizona Legislature last year , DUI penalties here are among the toughest in the nation .
For a first DUI , even if the driver never hit anything and is barely above the legal limit , the penalty is still 10 days in jail , $ 1,500 in fines , and an interlock device on the car for a year .
( It 's worse if you 're extremely drunk .
Get popped with blood alcohol content of 0.20 , and even if it 's your first offense , you 're looking at 45 days in jail , $ 6,300 in fines and fees , and an interlock device for 18 months . )
And what about Shannon Wilcutt ?
With a child under 15 in the car , her offense was automatically a felony .
She could have faced up to $ 150,000 in fines and fees , plus jail time .
The possibility of such harsh punishment is having a serious effect on the system , and it's not necessarily what lawmakers intended .
Karyn Klausner is a former municipal court judge who now handles numerous DUI cases as a lawyer at the Gillespie Law Firm in Phoenix .
She says more and more defendants are choosing to pay for lawyers — and go to trial — rather than face the Legislature 's mandatory minimums .
And the defendants are winning .
" In many instances , people do n't have anything to lose by going to trial , " Klausner says .
" So we fight like hell .
It 's inundating the prosecutors , costing the state lots of money — and they 're losing .
These are decent prosecutors , but in a trial , you never know what 's going to happen . "
And here 's the sick part .
Harsh penalties make defendants squirm , but studies show that they do n't actually prevent drunk drinking .
It 's way too soon to see what effect Arizona 's new DUI laws are having .
It 'll be at least two years before we have any data that show whether there 's been a change in accident rates .
If history is any indicator , though , we may be disappointed .
Alexander Wagenaar is a professor of epidemiology and health policy at the University of Florida .
He does n't share my views about social drinkers ; he admits he'd like to see the United States set the legal limit even lower than 0.08 , as it is in Europe .
But Wagenaar has made his name by studying what actually reduces drunk driving — and his results might surprise Arizona legislators .
Mandatory jail time and heavy fines , his studies conclude , are not effective deterrents .
Far more effective , researchers have found , are immediate license revocations .
If it happens quickly , and happens to everyone who 's busted , revocation can be a serious deterrent , Wagenaar says .
" If you 're arrested for a DUI , and a year later you end up getting a $ 1,000 fine and a weekend in jail , that 's a lot less effective of a deterrent than sitting at the roadside at 2 a.m. , watching as they tow away your car , " he says .
The point of long jail sentences and fat fines is n't deterrence — it 's punishment , Wagenaar says .
" If a driver is endangering the lives of others , then justice demands you have a penalty .
But whether it's the most effective preventative tool is a much more open question . "
Nearly a year ago , I wrote about 83 - year - old Phil Cisneros .
His case does n't have the most immediate link to Shannon Wilcutt and Diana Sifford , because Cisneros really was guilty — his blood alcohol content was well above 0.08 .
But what happened to Phil Cisneros last year says a lot about our attitude toward DUIs and , indeed , toward anyone who gets caught in the criminal justice system here .
Here 's the backstory : Cisneros had racked up a number of DUI convictions in the 1980s while his wife fought Alzheimer 's and soon after her tragic death .
But then he remarried , and seemed to be walking the straight and narrow .
He stopped driving , for one thing ; his neighbors in Maricopa would later aver to the court that they never saw him behind the wheel of a car .
( See " Death Sentence , " June 21 , 2007 . )
Then , returning from a trip to Mexico as a passenger in his new wife 's car in early 2007 , Cisneros was flagged by the border patrol and hauled away to jail .
Turns out he had been convicted in absentia for his last DUI , in 1998 , and had never showed up to serve his sentence .
Last spring , Gila County Judge Robert Duber sentenced him to three years in prison .
Not jail .
Prison .
Cisneros ' family — a huge , close - knit group — begged the judge .
They said that the old man suffered from a host of health conditions : prostate cancer , diabetes , pulmonary hypertension , sleep apnea , shingles , and shortness of breath .
He 'd already had double bypass surgery .
He would surely die behind bars .
But the judge would n't relent .
Neither , in fact , would the public .
After I wrote about Cisneros ' case , urging leniency , I heard from several readers who thought I was crazy .
He 'd driven drunk , they argued .
He could have killed someone !
( Never mind that , for all his DUIs , Cisneros had never hit anything , much less actually killed someone . )
One man commenting on New Times '
Web site said that drunk drivers were worse than drug dealers .
Let 'em rot .
Well , those people got their wish .
Phil Cisneros was repeatedly hospitalized during his prison stay , his lawyer , Jason Squires , tells me .
Last month , he had a heart attack .
Cisneros had perfectly good insurance — he 'd worked for a copper mining company .
But because he was a ward of the state , we taxpayers had to foot the bill when Cisneros was checked into the hospital time and time again this winter .
When he had his heart attack , we picked up the bill for his care .
Even worse , Cisneros ' family had to deal with the pain of seeing their patriarch handcuffed to his death bed .
That 's the rule for incarcerated people who end up in the hospital , even a non-violent guy like Phil Cisneros .
The family petitioned Governor Janet Napolitano for clemency :
His death , they said , was imminent .
Her board of executive clemency recommended his release , unanimously , on March 4 .
Three days later , the governor commuted Cisneros ' sentence .
His handcuffs were removed , and he was moved to hospice , but the damage of nine months in prison was done .
Phil Cisneros died two days later , on March 9 .
The Craftsman By Richard Sennett ( Yale University Press , 326 pages , $ 27.50 )
In " The Human Condition , " Hannah Arendt distinguished between Animal laborens and Homo faber -- between man as a worker , thoughtlessly and amorally lost in his labor 's object , and man as a maker of society and its institutions , a builder of life in common .
For Arendt , the maker had it all over the worker , who was , in her view , basically a drudge .
Richard Sennett , Arendt 's former student , thinks that his mentor 's division is too sharply drawn , too contemptuous ...
CHARLESTON , W.Va .
– Barack Obama yesterday turned his sights on winning the White House in November , as Hillary Rodham Clinton hinted she might wrap up her campaign as early as next week .
“ Thank you for caring so much about our country , ” Clinton said in a video sent yesterday to supporters .
“ And now it ’s on to West Virginia and Kentucky and Oregon , and we ’ll stay in touch . ”
Not mentioned in her apparent video swan song are the final three primaries , in Puerto Rico , Montana and South Dakota , to be held after next week – leading to speculation that she might pull the plug on her campaign after what are expected to be strong wins in West Virginia and Kentucky .
But a new poll says 64 percent of Democrats nationwide , want her to stay in the race .
Even 42 percent of Obama ’s supporters in the ABC News / Washington Post poll , said they do n’t want Clinton to throw in the towel .
Obama still leads Clinton by 12 points nationwide .
Separate polls released yesterday show Clinton beating Obama in West Virginia , 60 percent to 24 percent , and in Kentucky , 58 percent to 31 percent .
Obama has also said that after next Tuesday ’s primaries in Kentucky and Oregon , he may be in a position to say that he ’s effectively won the nomination .
Meanwhile , Clinton has been playing up her gender in the last few days on the campaign trail in West Virginia .
“ A woman is like a tea bag :
You never know how strong she is until she is in hot water , ” she said .
Obama delivered a speech here yesterday in just his second visit to the state and acknowledged that Clinton would likely win today .
“ I ’m extraordinarily honored that some of you will support me , and I understand that many more here in West Virginia will probably support Senator Clinton , ” he said to boos from his supporters .
Still , with the electoral mathematics firmly behind him , Obama turned to face Republican Sen .
John McCain by announcing an extensive campaign tour through swing states that are n’t hosting primaries .
He goes to Michigan and Missouri today and will spend three days in Florida next week .
“ We ’re not going to let John McCain wander around in those states unchallenged anymore , ” a spokesman said .
The themes of Obama ’s speeches also have turned from Democratic politics to more broadly appealing orations about patriotism .

COMPLETE ELECTION 2008 COVERAGE
When Maine officials tried to warn residents of the dangers of this winter 's near - record snowpack , Big Media slanted the story , hampering efforts to warn folks of the danger .
" This winters [ sic ] near - record snowfall has created a flood potential that is above normal , " began a news advisory
released by the Maine River Flow Advisor Commission on March 6th .
" Statewide water content readings from this week 's snow survey are some of the highest since 1969 , the ' snow season ' of record , and in some locations higher than the record . "
In case there was any doubt , the banner headline on the release reads : " Spring Flood Potential Elevated Due to Near - Record Snowfall . "
However , the lead in the Associated Press story in the next day 's edition of the major regional daily , the Boston Globe , downplayed the threat posed by the snowpack , referring to it as just " above - average , " and shifting the emphasis to concern about an approaching storm .
" The National Weather Service says weekend rain could cause some flooding of streets and small streams . "
The story does eventually reference " near - record snowfall " , in the 13th paragraph of a 17 - paragraph story , with a spin that turned the Maine officials ' warning on its head .
" While this winter 's near - record snowfall has created a flood potential that is above normal , that does n't guarantee flooding will occur this spring .... "
The result ?
" There are people who are losing their property , their homes and their livelihoods , " Maine Governor John Baldacci said after the flooding that officials had tried to warn the public about did occur last week .
Why did the AP and the Globe de-emphasize Maine officials ' snowpack warning , especially when doing so endangered the property and safety of the public they are supposed to serve ?

Both the Times and the Associated Press are heavily invested in the myth of Global Warming , or -- as I like to call it -- Global Warning .
Record snowpack means higher than normal amounts of snow , colder than usual temperatures , or both .
None of which readily fits into the MSM 's chosen story line that mankind is giving Mother Nature a fever .
Big Media 's Global Warning bias has largely remained in the realm of theory ; now it has begun to endanger people 's lives and property in real time .
The AP and the Globe had the choice of reporting a truly inconvenient truth -- for them -- or of perpetuating Global Warning , of facilitating officials ' efforts to protect the public or advancing their ideological agenda .
Why are we not surprised by the decision they made ?
The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee is defying the Bush administration and promising to investigate the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes .
The Justice Department has urged Congress not to look into the matter and advised intelligence officials not to cooperate with a legislative inquiry .
Speaking on " Fox News Sunday , " U.S. Rep. Peter Hoekstra said he thinks Congress will issue subpoenas .
He lambasted the intelligence community as " incompetent , " " arrogant " and " political . "
The CIA says it destroyed videos showing the harsh interrogation of top al - Qaida suspects .
The CIA 's director says the 2002 videos were destroyed in 2005 for fear the tapes would leak and reveal the identities of interrogators .
The Bush administration has asked Congress to postpone its review until it's clear where the government 's preliminary inquiry will lead .
They say they do n't know how long that will take .
Whatever the results of the primaries on Tuesday in Indiana and North Carolina , Mrs. Clinton has accomplished the seemingly impossible in those states .
Somehow , a woman who has not regularly filled her own gasoline tank in well over a decade , who with her husband made $ 109 million in the last eight years and who vacations with Oscar de la Renta , has transformed herself into a working - class hero .
In promoting herself as a champion of ordinary Americans in a troubled economy , Mrs. Clinton has also tried to cast her rival , Senator Barack Obama , as an out - of - touch elitist .
She has made her case at all the right stops ( an auto - racing hall of fame ) and used all the right props ( lately delivering speeches from pickup beds ) .
But what is more remarkable about Mrs. Clinton ’s approach in Indiana and North Carolina is how minimally she uses her own biography .
Perhaps because almost nothing she could say about her life would sound humble or hardscrabble  she grew up in an affluent Chicago suburb , went to prestigious schools and is , of course , a lawyer  Mrs. Clinton says very little about herself at all .
Instead , she focuses on her audience ’s concerns .
In most speeches , she now offers just one suggestive strand of her life story .
Introducing her plans to overhaul the student loan system , Mrs. Clinton explains that although her father paid her tuition , room and board for college , he refused to pay more .
“ If I wanted a book or a cup of coffee , I had to pay for it with money I made , ” she said Monday at a community college in Greenville , N.C.
She never says the name Wellesley .

This is a surprising turn in the Story of Hillary Clinton , who spent her Wellesley years as an activist and a student leader .
She wrote a chapter of “ Living History , ” her autobiography , about the college , but never mentioned earning money .
What the work was , she does not say in these speeches .

A criminal conspiracy
White House , CIA hid torture tapes from 9/11 Commission
By Joe Kay
24 December 2007
The CIA withheld videotapes of the abuse of suspected Al Qaeda members from the 9/11 Commission despite repeated requests for information on interrogations directed to top CIA and White House officials , according to the executive director of the commission .
The CIA has acknowledged that in November 2005 , more than a year after the requests were made , it destroyed tapes of CIA interrogations of two alleged Al Qaeda leaders , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
The history of the commission ’s interactions with the CIA on the issue is outlined in a memo from the executive director of the commission , Philip Zelikow , to the chairman , former Republican governor of New Jersey , Thomas Kean , and the vice chairman , former Democratic Congressman Lee Hamilton .
The memo is dated December 13 , 2007 and was released to the news media on Friday .
( See “ An analysis of the 9/11 Commission memo on interrogation tapes . ” )
Zelikow ’s account is a damning indictment of White House and CIA officials , and it comes from a prominent Republican with close ties to the intelligence establishment .
( Zelikow served on the National Security Council in the administration of the senior George Bush and co-authored a book with current Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ) .
According to the memo , in 2003 and 2004 the commission made “ repeated requests for very detailed information about the context ” of the CIA interrogations , including those of the two individuals whose interrogations were recorded on the destroyed videotapes .
Videotapes of the interrogations would have clearly been relevant to the inquiry .
However , according to Zelikow , the commission was never informed of the existence of the videotapes and was allowed access only to CIA summaries of the interrogations .
Zelikow indicated that withholding the information was likely illegal , but he concluded , “ Further investigation is needed to determine whether these nondisclosures violated federal law . ”
Among those named by Zelikow as involved in the discussions with the 9/11 Commission were : Alberto Gonzales , who was then the White House counsel and would later take the post of attorney general , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Undersecretary of Defense Stephen Cambone , CIA Director George Tenet , CIA General Counsel Scott Muller and CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence John McLaughlin .
The CIA responded to the memo over the weekend with a series of lies and obfuscations .
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said that the tapes would have been turned over if the commission had asked for them .
“ Because it was thought the commission could ask about the tapes at some point , they were not destroyed while the commission was active , ” he said .
Mansfield did not explain how the tapes could be requested if there was no acknowledgement until this month that they even existed .
The New York Times , in an article on Saturday , reported that in interviews with Hamilton and Kean , the commission leaders “ said their reading of the [ Zelikow ] report had convinced them that the agency had made a conscious decision to impede the Sept. 11 commission ’s inquiry . ”
Zelikow ’s memo is further evidence that the refusal to inform the 9/11 Commission of the existence of the tapes and subsequent decision to destroy them were part of a high - level cover -up of the administration ’s policy of using sadistic methods in interrogations that are clearly banned under international and national laws against torture .
Last week , the New York Times reported that at least four senior administration lawyers were involved in discussions on whether or not the tapes should be destroyed .
The discussions were held between 2003 and 2005 , the very period when the 9/11 Commission was making requests for documents on interrogation .
The four lawyers named by the Times include Gonzales ; Harriet Miers , Gonzales ’ successor as White House counsel ; David Addington , counsel and later chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney ; and John Bellinger III , the top lawyer at the National Security Council .
The Times cited one former intelligence official as saying that there was “ vigorous sentiment ” among some of the lawyers that the tapes should be destroyed .
The fact that , at the very least , Gonzales — a close Bush confidant — participated in both discussions strongly suggests that Bush and Cheney themselves were aware of and acquiesced in the concealment and subsequent destruction of the tapes .
During the same period as the 9/11 Commission investigation , several federal courts issued orders for the preservation of evidence relating to the interrogation and possible torture of prisoners held by the US .
It is almost certain that Bush was aware of the videotapes from the very beginning , and it is quite possible that he personally viewed at least some of them .
When Zubaydah was arrested in 2002 , he was seen within the administration as a test case for “ harsh interrogation techniques ” — i.e. , torture — which Bush was eager to implement .
An article in the Times of London on Sunday ( “ CIA Chief to Drag White House into Torture Cover - Up Storm ) cited Vincent Cannistraro , former head of counterterrorism at the CIA , as saying it was impossible that Jose Rodriguez , the former head of clandestine operations at the CIA , acted on his own .
Rodriguez has been named in the media as having given the order to destroy the tapes .
“ If everybody was against the decision , why in the world would Jose Rodriguez — one of the most cautious men I have ever met — have gone ahead and destroyed them ? ” Cannistraro asked .
There are indications that Rodriguez may implicate the White House when he testifies before the House Intelligence Committee next month .
Rodriguez requested and was granted a subpoena to compel his testimony , which will likely be accompanied by immunity from prosecution for what he says .
The newspaper also cited Larry Johnson , another former CIA official , as strongly implicating the White House .
“ The CIA and Jose Rodriguez look bad , but he ’s probably the least culpable person in the process , ” Johnson said .
“ He did n’t wake up one day and decide , ‘ I ’m going to destroy the tapes . ’
He checked with a lot of people and eventually he is going to get his say . ”
“ It looks increasingly as though the decision was made by the White House , ” Johnson said .
The Times of London reported that Johnson “ believes it is ‘ highly likely ’ that Bush saw one of the videos , as he was interested in Zubaydah ’s case and received frequent updates on his interrogation from George Tenet . ”
New York Times national security correspondent James Risen , in his 2006 book State of War , cites one well - placed source as telling him , “ George Bush was taking a very personal interest in the Zubaydah case ” in 2002 .
According to Risen ’s account , when CIA Director Tenet told Bush that no information had yet been gleaned from Zubaydah because he was too groggy from painkillers , Bush is said to have replied , ‘ Who authorized putting him on pain medication ? ”
The torture of Zubaydah was initiated soon after this conversation , and the treatment of Zubaydah then became a precedent for the torture of other prisoners — at secret CIA prisons , at Guantánamo Bay and later at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
Tenet , in his 2007 book , At the Center of the Storm , records that when Zubaydah was captured , “ we opened discussions within the National Security Council as to how to handle him . ”
The NSC includes the president , the vice president , the secretary of state , the secretary of the treasury , the secretary of defense , and other top officials .
The suggestion that there was such high - level involvement in the interrogation of Zubaydah renders absurd the notion that administration officials were not aware that it was being videotaped .
It should be recalled that the infamous “ torture memo , ” written by the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel to justify illegal interrogation methods , was produced on August 1 , 2002 , in the midst of the CIA ’s interrogation of Zubaydah .
The memo was written partially in response to CIA concerns that methods ordered by the administration could subject intelligence agents to future prosecution .
The revelation of the existence of the torture tapes and their destruction has become a focal point of intense divisions within the political and intelligence establishment .
In a separate development , the CIA has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether John Kiriakou , a former CIA officer , illegally disclosed classified information when he told the media earlier this month that water - boarding had been used against Abu Zubaydah .
Kiriakou said he considered water - boarding to be torture , but he has also sought to legitimize such methods , saying the treatment of Zubaydah was necessary to “ save lives . ”
Kiriakou speaks for elements within the agency who insist that top administration officials authorized all aspects of the interrogation .
Kiriakou ’s attorney , Mark Zaid , issued a warning to the Justice Department .
He told the Washington Post , “ If they do pursue [ an investigation into his client ] , they will open a Pandora ’s box that will put the spotlight on whether the interrogations were lawful , and the extent to which they have been fully revealed by federal officials . ”
Under these conditions , the administration is seeking to contain a scandal that threatens to get out of its control and that of leading congressional figures from both parties who are also complicit in the cover-up .
Last week , Bush continued his obfuscation over his knowledge of the tapes ’ destruction .
At a Thursday White House press conference , an Associated Press reporter posed the following question : “ There ’s ambiguity in the statement that you have no recollection about the existence and destruction of the CIA interrogation tapes .
Why ca n’t you say yes or no about the tapes and their destruction ? ”
Bush replied by merely repeating that his “ first recollection ” of the tapes is when CIA Director Michael Hayden spoke to him about them earlier this month .
The White House has avoided making any direct statement that this was , in fact , the first time Bush heard about the tapes .
It has stonewalled reporters ’ questions with the statement that the White House will not speak about the matter because of ongoing internal investigations by the CIA and the Justice Department .
In a hearing before the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Friday , the government urged Judge Henry Kennedy to deny a motion for a hearing into the destruction of the videotapes .
Kennedy issued a court order in 2005 directing the government to preserve all evidence related to the interrogation of prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay .
Lawyers for Guantánamo prisoners petitioning his court for a review of their detention are arguing that the destruction of the videotapes may have violated the judge ’s order .
The government repeated its argument that it “ would be unwise and imprudent ” for the judge to investigate further , pending the government ’s own investigations .
Joseph Hunt , a lawyer for the government , issued a promise that the court would be informed of any results of this self - investigation , and inform the court if any rules were violated .
Hunt also argued that the tapes were immaterial to the case at hand , since the individuals involved in the taped interrogations — Zubaydah and al - Hashimi — were not at Guantánamo Bay at the time of the court order .
Whether or not they were at Guantánamo Bay , they may well have named or otherwise provided information about the defendants whose case is before the court .
Even if the people who appear on CIA tapes did not say anything that directly pertains to the defendants , documentary evidence that the US tortured people under interrogation and used the information extracted to conduct their military prosecutions would be highly damaging to the drumhead military commissions operating at Guantánamo .
All of these revelations — and there can be no doubt that the truth goes far beyond what has been revealed so far — demonstrate a level of criminality that exceeds Watergate , Iran - contra and other past scandals .
The administration is depending heavily upon the Democratic Party to prevent the scandal from spiraling out of control .
Calls for investigations have thus far been extremely muted , and they will be held largely under the control of Democratic legislators who have known about the tapes and the CIA torture program for years .
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- Georgia has asked the U.N. Security Council to discuss Russia 's " military aggression " after saying a Russian jet shot down one of its unmanned spy planes .
" We call upon the United Nations to address this direct military aggression against Georgia and to fully exploit its own means and capabilities in order to keep the situation from further escalation , " Georgia 's U.N. Ambassador Irakli Alasania told reporters Monday .
To bolster its case , the Georgian air force released a video that it says shows a twin - tailed Russian MiG - 29 shooting down a Georgian unmanned aerial vehicle , or UAV , over the separatist region of Abkhazia on Sunday .
The video -- shot by the drone , Georgia says -- shows a jet fighter firing a missile that streaks through the sky , trailed by a column of white smoke .
The missile gets closer and closer and then suddenly the screen goes blank .
Watch unmanned spy plane be shot down »
" The radar shows that the MiG - 29 took off from Gudauta in Abkhazia , Georgia .
It is absolutely illegal for a Russian MiG - 29 to be there , " Col .
David Nairashvili , Georgia 's air force commander , said .
" The MiG - 29 flies south , shoots down the Georgian UAV and then flies north crossing into Russian territory . "
Georgia 's charges come at a time of increasing tensions between the pro-Western government and Moscow , which is providing assistance to a pair of breakaway regions in Georgia -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Without addressing the question of whether a Russian fighter flew over Georgian territory , Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was surprised by Georgian military flights over Abkhazia , Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency reported Tuesday , blaming the flights for the escalation of tensions .
In a phone call with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Monday , Putin expressed " bewilderment over the very fact of military flights performed by the Georgian side over the conflict zone and stressed that this contradicts the letter and the spirit of the Moscow ceasefire and disengagement agreement of May 14 , 1994 , " the news agency said .
Georgian forces fought separatists in Abkhazia before the ceasefire was negotiated more than a decade ago .
Last week , Moscow formalized relations with the breakaway territories , withdrawing trade sanctions and expanding " trade , economic , social , scientific and technical , information , cultural , and educational " contacts with them , Itar - Tass reported .

Is it unusual to eat kiwi fruits without removing the skin ?
Recently I had an experience where approximately 30 people laughed simultaneously at me when I expressed that I eat kiwis this way .
So now I wonder , who is crazy : me , or 30 people ?
Also : happy birthday , Buttersafe !
You ’re one year old now !
Thanks for being our website , Buttersafe .
And thanks for visiting us here , all you people who visit us !
- Alex
P.S. Did you hear about the upcoming Buttersafe convention ?
I hear that it exists , and that it is upcoming .
Do you need some more evidence that the Land of the Free has died — that any hope of peaceful recovery is pretty much gone ?
I ’ll probably talk about the supposed freedom - lovers of the US in a later entry here at SOB , and how they ’re the biggest piece of the problem we have .
For now , though , let ’s just look at one more piece of evidence that the problem exists :
North Carolina Superior Court Judge Robert Hobgood ruled “ there is no fundamental right for a voter to vote for the party of their choice .
By extension , then , it would be entirely appropriate for North Carolina ( or any state , for that matter , that does n’t have language in its constitution asserting such a right ) to reduce the options on the ballot to one , sole , single candidate in each position , all in the name of alleviating voter confusion :
“ The more parties there are that are recognized by the State and that place candidates on the ballot , the greater the chance there is for ballots that are so long as to be unwieldy and to risk voter confusion and frustration of the electoral process , ” Judge Hobgood wrote .
You ’ll vote for who they tell you to vote for , dammit , or you ’ll go to bed without your dinner .
If we gave you more options , you ’d just be confused and pick the wrong candidate .
We ca n’t have you picking the wrong candidate , now — can we ?
Compare this with recent Iraq elections , in which Iraqi citizens were deemed smart enough to vote using ballots listing hundreds of candidates .
I guess Americans are stupider than Iraqis .
Well , perhaps we are , if we let this kind of crap go on in our government .
As H. L. Mencken famously said :
Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want , and deserve to get it good and hard .
I guess it ’s a great day for democracy , after all .
PS : If you live in North Carolina , it looks like your best option for voting this November is to vote with your feet .
Move somewhere your vote still counts — where you can vote for who you like , rather than who the gray - haired party bosses choose your votes for you .

Check out this funky looking robot from Toshiba called ApriPoko .
This clever little robot weighs 5 lbs and measures 8 x 11 inches .
ApriPoko learns how to operate various remote controls by watching and asking questions .
Set him up in your living room and when you use your TV remote he will ask you ‘ What did you just do ? ” , you then tell the robot what you just did , for example “ switched to channel 1 ” , the next time you want to switch to channel one , you just say the command and ApriPoko will change the channel for you .
ApriPoko can be programmed to work with any device with a remote control , so you could have him closing your electric curtains or dropping your projector screen from the ceiling all from voice commands .
I have to admit this is one of the coolest gadgets I have seen in a long time .
Although the ApriPoko is only a prototype at the moment , lets hope he goes into production as I bet this would be a really popular gadget .

People with higher levels of vitamin D in their bodies are 72 percent less likely to die from colorectal cancer , according to a new study published in the Colorectal cancer kills approximately 50,000 people in the United States per year .
Researchers tracked the health status of 16,818 people in a nationwide government health survey .
Participants joined between the years of 1988 and 1994 and were followed until the year 2000 .
Their blood was measured regularly to determine their bodies ' levels of vitamin D .
Those with higher levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study were 72 percent less likely to die from colorectal cancer than those who began the study with the lowest levels of the nutrient .
Vitamin D is produced by the body when ultraviolet radiation from the sun strikes the skin .
This means that deficiency can be a serious health problem in northern latitudes , particularly during the winter .
For this reason , many milk products and non-dairy milk substitutes are fortified with the vitamin .
Certain fatty fishes , such as salmon , are naturally high in vitamin D.Deficiency in vitamin D can lead to rickets , a condition characterized by soft , weak bones , particularly in children .
Prior research has indicated that in addition to acting as an essential nutrient , vitamin D may inhibit the growth of tumors or even kill cancerous cells .
In an accompanying editorial , National Institutes of Health experts Cindy Davis and Johanna Dwyer warned that vitamin D supplementation is not the end - all of cancer prevention .
" While vitamin D may well have multiple benefits beyond bone , health professionals and the public should not , in a rush to judgment , assume that vitamin D is a magic bullet and consume high amounts of vitamin D , " they wrote .
" More definitive data on both benefits and potential adverse effects of high doses are urgently needed .
" Vitamin D can be toxic in high concentrations , but toxicity cannot result from sunlight exposure , because the body ceases production when the needed bodily levels have been reached .
HALF of the world 's population enjoys fuel subsidies .
This estimate , from Morgan Stanley , implies that almost a quarter of the world 's petrol is sold at less than the market price .
The cheapest petrol is in Venezuela , at 5 cents per litre .
That makes China 's pump price of 79 cents seem expensive , but even this is a bargain compared with $ 1.04 in the United States and $ 2.35 in Germany ( see chart ) .
As the gap has widened between soaring international prices and fixed domestic prices , so has the cost of subsidies .
Indeed , budgetary strains are now forcing some governments to lift prices .
On May 24th Indonesia raised fuel prices by around 30 % .
This was the first increase since 2005 , but it still leaves petrol too cheap at 65 cents a litre .
Dearer oil is likely to push up inflation from 9 % to 12 % .
But without the increase , the government 's subsidy bill was heading for an alarming 3 % of GDP this year .
In the past week Taiwan has also raised petrol prices by 13 % and Sri Lanka has lifted them by 24 % .
Malaysia has one of the biggest fuel - subsidy bills in the world , estimated at as much as 7 % of GDP this year .
By holding down the price of petrol , Malaysia now has the lowest inflation rate of all the 32 emerging economies tracked by The Economist .
But the government is expected to allow prices to rise soon to curb its widening budget deficit .
In theory , rising crude - oil prices should reduce global demand .
But if domestic prices are capped , then emerging economies will continue to guzzle oil , pushing world prices still higher .
Emerging economies accounted for more than the whole increase in world oil consumption last year — because demand in the rich economies fell .
But recent price increases will make little difference to global consumption unless China and India follow suit .
India 's state - owned oil companies face mounting losses , as they are forced to sell fuel at fixed prices below cost .
Petrol prices are actually slightly higher in India than in the United States , because Indian motorists pay much higher fuel taxes , but diesel is about 40 % cheaper than in America .
The oil firms are partly compensated by bonds which the government issues to them — a trick which allows the government to keep the subsidy off its books .
At today 's prices , the total subsidy ( including the full losses of oil companies ) could be as much as 2 - 3 % of GDP this year .
Morgan Stanley estimates that the government 's total budget deficit ( central and state governments and all off - budget items ) is running at 9 % of GDP in this fiscal year .
The government must hold an election by May next year , so it is reluctant to raise fuel prices by much .
It is thought to be considering a modest rise combined with a cut in excise duty .
In early 2008 Chinese motorists paid roughly the same for their petrol as Americans did .
Whereas the pump price in America has since jumped by 33 % , Chinese prices have remained fixed , swelling the losses of state - owned refiners .
According to Dragonomics , a Beijing - based economic research firm , the retail price for diesel is about 40 % below that in America .
To cut their losses , oil firms have reduced supply , causing shortages at some petrol stations .
However , China is less likely than other countries to lift prices soon .
Oil subsidies are estimated at less than 1 % of GDP , and its budget surplus and small public debt mean that the government can afford to keep prices down for some time .
Most likely , it will delay increasing fuel prices until food - price inflation has eased .
Across the emerging world , governments fear that lifting fuel prices will hurt the poor and so trigger social unrest .
Yet fuel subsidies are an inefficient way to protect the poor : they mainly benefit the richer owners of cars and air - conditioners , and favour energy - and capital - intensive industries , rather than those that create most jobs .
An IMF study of five emerging economies found that the richest 20 % of households received , on average , 42 % of total fuel subsidies ; the bottom 20 % received less than 10 % .
That money would be better spent on health , education and infrastructure .
Not only would this benefit the poor , but higher prices would also help to dampen global oil consumption , and hence the price of oil .
A Silicon Valley start - up says it has developed technology that can deliver solar power in about a year at prices competitive with coal - fired electricity , a milestone that would leapfrog other more established players and turbocharge the fast - growing industry .
SUNRGI 's " concentrated photovoltaic " system relies on lenses to magnify sunlight 2,000 times , letting it produce as much electricity as standard panels with a far smaller system .
Craig Goodman , head of the National Energy Marketers Association , is expected to announce the breakthrough Tuesday .
Under its plans , which experts call promising but highly ambitious , SUNRGI would initially target utilities and large industrial and commercial customers .
The company — founded by veterans of computer , digital design , aerospace and solar industries — would market to homes within three years .
Executives of the year - old company say they 'll start producing solar panels by mid-2009 that will generate electricity for about 7 cents a kilowatt hour , including installation .
That 's roughly the price of cheap coal - fired electricity .
" We 're bringing the cost of solar electricity down to be competitive with " fossil fuels , says Bob Block , a co-founder of SUNRGI .
Solar power is acclaimed as free of greenhouse gas emissions and able to supply electricity midday when demand is highest .
But its cost — 20 cents to 30 cents a kilowatt hour — has inhibited broad adoption .
Solar makes up less than 1 % of U.S. power generation .
An armada of solar technology makers aim to drive solar 's price to 10 to 18 cents a kilowatt hour by 2010 , and 5 to 10 cents by 2015 , at or below utility costs .
SUNRGI 's timetable is far more aggressive .
Solar panels generate electricity when photons in sunlight knock loose electrons in silicon or another semiconductor .
Other concentrated photovoltaic makers magnify sunlight about 500 times .
SUNRGI says it can multiply that by four because it has a system to instantly cool its germanium - based semiconductor from 3,300 degrees to 20 degrees above ambient temperature .
High temperatures can melt a solar cell .
Also pushing down costs are a highly efficient semiconductor that converts 37 % of the sunlight to electricity , more than double the industry average .
The unit 's compact size allows it to be made at electronics or PC factories , avoiding the need to build new plants .
Sarah Kurtz , principal scientist for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , says SUNRGI 's plans seem scientifically viable , but the start - up could face hurdles as it scales up to mass production .
" Moving from the lab to the market in two years is typically not what happens , " says Stow Walker of Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
Yet , he adds , the semiconductor market " moves much more quickly than power technologies . "
Enlarge Tech firm SUNRGI says its " concentrated photovoltaic " system could revolutionize the solar power industry .

Some customers and industry analysts charge that inkjet companies are using their influence to unfairly distort the price of replacement ink cartridges and shut out off - brand competitors .
" What I 've found over the past few years is that ink itself is a very good commodity to be in , " says Tom Merritt , executive editor of CNET , a technology news and reviews website based in San Francisco .
High - quality ink is expensive to make .
It 's packaged in specially designed cartridges that are difficult for others to replicate .
And it comes saddled with patents and copyrights that the companies staunchly defend .
" But what 's happening is that [ printer manufacturers ] have gotten so aggressive now in preserving their profits that a lot of people worry they are clinging too tightly to this minimonopoly , " he says .
It 's a concern that escalated into an antitrust lawsuit that was filed in Boston last month .
The legal complaint accuses Hewlett - Packard of paying Staples $ 100 million to stop selling off - brand ink cartridges that are compatible in HP printers .
Both HP and Staples deny any anticompetitive practices .
Despite the calls that the inkjet market stifles competition , there are still many alternatives available .
One of the easiest ways to save a few dollars on the cost of cartridges is through generic brands .
" About 10 years ago , there were only about four places for a small company to buy generic printer ink , " says Tim Molhoek , owner of O-ink , a small chain of printer supply stores in Michigan .
" Now , there about 100 worldwide – the vast majority are in Asia . "
These off - brand outfits often collect used tanks , pump them full of new ink , and sell them at a discount .
Another avenue to consider is refilling your own spent cartridges .
Plenty of shops , from big - box stores such as Walgreens to smaller outfits like Mr. Molhoek 's , run their own , in - house refill programs , with prices ranging widely .
For the do - it - yourself crowd , there are even take - home kits that let you squeeze new life into old printer cartridges .
But this option is only for the adventurous .
" I tried one of the home kits , " says Mr. Merritt .
" But it just turned into a sloppy mess .
I 'll probably not use them again . "
Similarly , the whole category of third - party inks comes with a big disclaimer .
While the vessel is often identical to the name - brands , the ink inside ranges widely in quality .
Technology in every drop
Hewlett - Packard alone spends $ 1 billion a year on printing and ink research – a figure that no generic vendor could easily match .
This heavy investment is why ink costs thousands of dollars per gallon , printermakers say , and why they think consumers will stick to high - quality brands .
There 's a lot of technology that goes into each ink drop .
" Typical ink development might have five PhD chemists working on it for several years , and of course an army of technicians , " says Nils Miller , an ink and media senior scientist for HP .
" And that was just to develop it . "
In a process similar to making new pharmaceuticals , the lab teams build complex dye molecules , develop chemicals that affect the way the liquid spreads , and tweak the cocktail formulas for mass production , he says .
For several years , the independent reviewer Consumer Reports has warned against off - brand ink as a " false economy , " especially with color and photo printers .
Studies have shown generic inks are more likely to leak or dry out inside the cartridge and run or fade on the page .
And while the price per tank is cheaper , some generic cartridges run out of ink after fewer pages .
But for those consumers who primarily use black ink or do n't need their prints to last , third - party tanks still hold great value , says Andy Lippman , a printer industry analyst for Lyra Research in Newtonville , Mass .
" Most people will never know the difference , " he says .
" It just depends on what you want out of it . "
Outsmarting the printer
Of course , there are problems with genuine ink cartridges as well .
Just like gas tank sensors in a car , printers try to warn users when a cartridge is almost empty , but sometimes these sensors can jump the gun .
A study released this year , found that , on average , printers that use one cartridge for several colors say they 're empty when about half of the ink is still left inside .
The report , commissioned by the printermaker Epson , hoped to show the value of its method of using one cartridge per color .
But the report found that even they run at about 80 percent efficiency .
" I 've found that if you just pop them out and put the cartridge back in as if it were new , you can usually trick the printer into using the same one , " says CNET 's Merritt .
" Or , if you really do a lot of printing , consider a laser printer . "

About 1,500 college students rallied at state Capitol this morning to protest $ 1 billion in budget cuts that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is proposing for California 's three college systems in the coming fiscal year .
Students from many UC , state university and community college campuses marched about a mile from Raley Field to the Capitol , where they heard from Lt. Gov John Garamendi and other speakers opposed to the governor 's cuts to education .
Similar protests were held at a half - dozen other locations up and down the state at the same time , from Los Angeles and San Diego in the south to Arcata in the north .
" Kick us out , we will vote you out , " the crowd in Sacramento chanted as they walked along a bridge crossing Highway 99 , through downtown and onto the Capital steps .
The line of students , which included hundreds from the Bay Area , stretched six blocks , and dozens of motorists honked in support as they drove by .
The fears , voiced again and again , where that if Schwarzenegger 's proposed funding cuts go through , students will end up paying more to attend , while reduced services and a narrower selection of classes .
The governor 's proposed cuts to higher education are part of an across - the - board reduction in all state spending in response to a growing budget crisis caused by economic hard times statewide .
Aaron McLear , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger , said higher education continues to be high priority for the governor , but considering the scope of the budget deficit , it would be unfair to cut certain items in the state budget while leaving others untouched .
" The governor is as frustrated as the students are that he has to make these cuts .
He does n't want to make these cuts , " McLear said .
Students were n't buying it .
" They keep talking about us being the future of California , but if they keep cutting education there will be no future , " said Tiffany Trujillo , a 22 - year - old junior at San Francisco State University .
" It seems like education is always the first thing they cut . "
Trujillo said she is among many at San Francisco State who get financial aid and expect to graduate owing thousands of dollars in loans .
Having to pay higher fees would severely impact her financially , she said .
Ai Ho , a 35 - year - old student and San Francisco City College , carried a sign reading " Educate to Liberate " as he marched .
He said he works in digital imaging and went back to school because , " I want to get a better job .
Education is the way . "
If fees go up , he may have to drop out , he said .
Once the crowd reached the Capitol steps , they rallied and listened to speeches for about two hours , while nearby a separate rally rang with cries against proposed cuts in the state parks system .
Garamendi , a Democrat , reminded protesters that Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson , the former conservative Republican governors , both raised taxes to fund education , something Schwarzenegger has flatly rejected .
" Are we ready to reach back into history and do it once again ? " Garamendi asked to rousing cheers .
" We can , we must . "
" Let 's get real , " the lieutenant governor added .
" There is no more important investment than the investment in students .
We will build roads , we will build trains , but the most important things to build are the minds of students . "
State Sen. Don Perata , D - Oakland , also urged tax hikes .
" There is no way we can balance the budget this year without a tax increase , " he said .
" If we were to cut what the governor suggests , we will destroy the education system , and we are simply not going to do it . "
One student from San Jose State , 24 - year - old Joel Bridgeman , said raising the money for college was so tough that he was homeless - couch surfing - for about a year as he went to school .
" Most of the people who work in this building probably either went to CSU , UC or ( community college ) , but as the next generation comes up they are looking for the easy solution , " he said .
" They are looking for what is going to get them re-elected .
They say our voice does n't matter , but I have a message for them ... we are here to demand our chance . "
Schwarzenegger and his top financial advisers have said the state 's plummeting revenues means that all services , from education to state parks and health care programs , must suffer cuts to balance a budget gap that is likely to grow to $ 14 billion - and possibly as high as $ 16 billion - by June 2009 .
Budget negotiations are bound to become increasingly difficult as lawmakers haggle over what programs to cut and whether to use taxes and / or fees to increase revenue for the state .
The Republican governor and the Democrat - controlled Legislature took emergency actions in February that included additional borrowing , delaying debt payments and delaying cost - of - living increases for some welfare recipients to reduce the projected deficit to about $ 8 billion .
But with the housing market meltdown continuing to wreak havoc in the slowing economy , many lawmakers believe the deficit will grow back to its predicted high during the fiscal year that begins on July 1 .
In Los Angeles , the rally turnout was not as large as in Sacramento , but those who attended made their point loudly .
About 200 students from all three systems picketed the governor 's office at Pershing Square , chanting slogans and slowing foot traffic on the sidewalk around lunchtime .
" We think it went amazing , " said Jennifer Knox of the UC Students Association , one of several student groups that helped organize the rallies all over the state .
" Our goal was to send the governor a clear message , and I think that 's what happened . "
Gregory Cendana , a senior at UCLA , said he and other Los Angeles protesters were acutely aware that as they were rallying , others were doing the same thing all over the state .
" We 're talking about the future of California , and with the budget crisis going on , it only makes sense to invest in students who will give back to the economy and the state later on , " he said .
Europe ’s employment growth revived after 1995 while productivity growth slowed :
Is it a coincidence ?
Ian Dew - Becker , Robert J. Gordon
Europe ’s jobs outlook has brightened over the past decade .
Recent research suggests that about half the rise in job creation is due to labour market reforms , but much of the rest is due to changing social norms concerning female and immigrant labour force participation .
But what ’s good for European job creation seems to be bad for labour productivity growth – a trade - off that European policymakers must be willing to acknowledge and address .
As of 1995 , Europe ( the EU - 15 ) had almost caught up to the PPP - adjusted level of US labour productivity , while its per-capita income ratio to the US stagnated at only 70 percent .
This discrepancy is explained by a decline over 1960 - 1995 in hours worked per capita in Europe compared to the US .
Edward Prescott ( 2004 ) has blamed low hours exclusively on high labour taxes , while Prescott ’s critics , although accepting a role for taxes , have broadened the list of culprits to employment protection legislation , product market regulation , a high average replacement rate of unemployment insurance , high union density , and high “ corporatism ” ( cooperative bargaining between unions , management and the government ) .
We label this group of potential explanatory factors as the “ policy / institutional variables ” .
The previous literature and many policy debates , especially in the US , have missed three important points .
First , EU - 15 hours per capita stopped declining and began to rise after 1995 .
This was particularly evident for employment per capita , less so for hours per employee .
Most of the policy / institutional variables have also turned around .
Data on the 25 years from 1978 to 2003 and for 15 countries provide a fertile field for investigating the response of growth in employment per capita to changes in the policy / institutional variables .
Second , growth performance within the EU - 15 became much more heterogeneous after 1995 .
The standard deviation of growth rates across the 15 countries roughly doubled for labour productivity , hours , and income per capita .
Spain and Italy experienced particularly sharp reversals , exhibiting marked post -1995 declines in productivity growth and increases in growth of employment per capita .
Remarkably , despite its negative growth of labour productivity during the period 1995 - 2006 , Spain ranked third in the EU - 15 for its growth of income per capita , due to its startling acceleration of growth in employment per capita .
The third and most novel – and also most controversial – finding is that there may have been a substantial trade - off between labour productivity and employment growth over the past two decades .
Before 1995 , European policy made labour more expensive through higher taxes , tighter regulations , and strong unions .
This reduced labour demand , lowering employment but raising the real wage and the average product of labour .
Slow employment growth and relatively high productivity growth were negatively correlated .
After 1995 , this process was reversed , with lower taxes and looser regulations reducing the cost of labour , which helps explain the simultaneous increase of growth in employment per capita and slower growth in labour productivity .
The textbook labour demand curve holds constant capital input and the level of technology .
The initial effect of policy - driven employment growth is to reduce capital intensity .
But intuition and standard models both imply that when employment and income increase , so should investment .
This may eventually happen , but it does not seem to have happened in the EU - 15 as of 2005 .
Thus the static negative employment - productivity trade - off appears to describe the first part of the current decade without as yet any evident movement toward faster capital growth and a corresponding revival of productivity growth .
In the medium - run , if current trends continue , we should expect to see European investment pick up ( and US investment to lag ) .
The most recent data for Europe suggest that this process may have already begun .
Empirical results : employment growth and productivity growth
In recent research , using the best available data collected by the OECD , Groningen Growth and Development Center , and others , we estimate the relationship between the policy / institutional variables and employment per capita growth in the EU - 15 ( Dew - Becker and Gordon 2008 ) .
We find that while the policy / institutional variables can explain a significant amount of the variation in employment , they provide only a partial explanation of the post - 1995 increase in European employment per capita .
At best , they explain about half the rise , leaving another 1 percent per year in employment growth unexplained .
Moreover , this unexplained 1 percent acceleration holds across the EU , not just in Spain and Italy .
We interpret this change largely , with reference to the work of Tito Boeri and Christopher Pissarides ( 2005 ) , as the result of a change in social norms regarding female labour force participation in southern Europe .
As recently as 1985 , the female labour force per capita in Spain and Italy was barely one half of that in Scandinavia .
Since 1985 , that ratio has begun a long process of convergence , and much of the strong growth in employment per capita in the EU - 15 after 1995 can be traced to female labour - force participation .
Also evident is an increase of immigration , particularly in Spain , which has expanded employment and participation at the cost of lower productivity of the marginal new workers .
However , the change in the growth rate of employment is not restricted exclusively to women .
Up until 1995 , male employment had been falling dramatically across Europe .
After 1995 though , this decline stops .
Growth in male employment went from substantially negative to zero , which makes just as important a contribution to the EU employment turnaround as the increase in female participation .
We also find a strongly robust negative correlation between growth in labour productivity and growth in employment per capita across all of Europe , not just in Italy and Spain .
We identify this effect using the following strategy .
While it is obviously the case that there is two - way causation between productivity and the employment rate ( since productivity drives wages ) , changes in labour taxes should have no direct effect on productivity .
Rather , the tax effects should be mediated through employment .
Using labour taxes as an instrument , we find a strong and robust negative relationship between productivity and employment .
This same relationship has also been noted by Beaudry and Collard ( 2002 ) , as well as Pichelmann and Roeger ( 2008 ) .
We go beyond their work by relating this trade - off to the post - 1995 productivity slowdown .
The elementary theory of the production function suggests that an autonomous increase in employment that reduces the capital - labour ratio , without any response of investment , would reduce labour productivity growth by about 0.33 , roughly the share of capital in national income .
However , our results indicate that the response of productivity growth to employment growth is substantially higher than - 0.33 , at least - 0.5 if not - 0.7 .
We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that labour is not homogeneous .
The new immigrants and the new female entrants in Spain and Italy are unlikely to have the same set of skills as native workers .
At least in the short run , these new workers are likely to have lowered productivity over and above the effect of a declining ratio of capital to labour .
Conclusions
The most important innovation of our approach is to change the current focus of European policy discussions .
Our analysis suggests that some of the policy reforms that are at the top of the European reform agenda may raise employment per capita but may also reduce productivity .
We find that some reforms , such as lowering labour taxes , may only have small short - run effects on output per capita after their effects on productivity are taken into account .
We find that the revival of European employment growth can help explain why European productivity slowed .
But we do not explain why European productivity growth did not accelerate as occurred in the US .
US productivity took off after 1995 , growing at 0.7 percent faster per year , but in Europe a literal reading of the productivity growth data leads to doubt that the internet revolution ever occurred in Europe .
Some of Europe ’s poor recent performance can be explained by reforms that will enhance growth in the long run , but not all of it .
Our findings should lead EU policymakers to think about the two - edged effects of policy reforms on employment and productivity , but they should also worry about how to encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies .
1
The work discussed here is only about the short - run effects of labour market policies .
However , the dynamic effects are critical to the long - run prosperity of Europe .
Increases in employment should be expected to spur investment not only in physical capital , but also in human capital .
The simple act of working increases skills , especially for teenagers , adult women , or unskilled immigrants just entering the labour market .
Moreover , when employment rates are high , the expected returns to education are also high .
The findings we report here are not meant to discourage policies that increase employment – precisely the opposite .
Our findings show that we should not be discouraged when labour market liberalisation leads to declines in productivity growth in the short run .
This result is to be expected , and our paper quantifies this effect .
Policymakers who want a quick fix that will rapidly raise both employment and productivity should find a tool other than labour market liberalisation .
Liberalisation should be expected to provide long - run benefits , but there will be noticeable short - run costs .
We hope that politicians in Europe and elsewhere have the fortitude to propose these policies even if the benefits may take years to fully accrue .

' Building more roads in response to congestion is the economic equivalent of telling an obese man to buy bigger trousers
Who will be the last man to use the last drop of oil in his car ?
Will he be a tyrant , a president or a billionaire ?
Maybe the last stash will come from a battered jerry can of petrol , which has been hoarded and squirrelled away for years .
How much do you think the last drop will cost ?
How impotent will he feel as he watches the petrol gauge move to empty , never again to be replenished ?
What will the world look like on that last day ?
Will it be a dystopian Mad Max type wasteland , destroyed by wars over the last drop of oil ?
What are the chances that the last day will be welcomed by a sensitive green society that has prepared for this eventuality for decades ?
Human nature suggests that the green image of a tranquil last day is not likely and it is more likely the last day will be preceded by panic and anger .
For example , how many people will have starved because the productivity of agriculture will fall precipitously as dwindling petrol supplies dry up ?
These are not questions we ask ourselves everyday , but surely this day will come and our own children might see it .
The world is involved in a monumental resource battle as the irresistible force of an exploding global population smashes into the immovable object of finite resources .
While cycling around Amsterdam recently , it struck me that cities like the Dutch capital will be among the best prepared for the end of oil .
Of course , life there will change in a most dramatic fashion -- as it will everywhere .
However , by creating a consensus around cycling , urban living , public transport and fuel efficiency , the Dutch are pre-empting the inevitable .
Maybe , every time they cycle to work , they do n't see this decision as training for the last day , but this is exactly what it is .
The people of Amsterdam are doing the hard part today to make sure that when the hard part really comes , that they will find it easy .
The interesting aspect is the " hard part " is n't hard at all .
In fact , cycling around on narrow streets with few cars gives you an almost childlike sense of freedom .
Contrast this Dutch approach to urban transport within Ireland .
In our planning , with our refusal to go high - rise and our increasingly spread - out , car - dependent , commuting model , we are going in the wrong direction .
By building more roads and buying more cars in response to congestion , we are fooling ourselves .
This is the economic equivalent of telling an obese man that the solution to his fatness is to buy bigger trousers .
The news coming from the energy sector suggests we have precious little time left .
Last week , both the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal told us that Russian oil production had peaked .
Russia is the world 's second largest oil producer and the implication of this announcement from Lukoil , Russia 's biggest oil company , is frightening .
In addition , Mexico -- the US 's third largest source of oil -- announced that it would not be an oil exporter in a few years .
Meanwhile , the North Sea 's output is declining rapidly .
What is the world doing about this ?
We have responded by bizarrely growing food to use as fuel !
This , at a time when there are food riots all over the third world , seems almost grotesquely surreal .
Corn -- the staple for the world for thousands of years -- is now being grown to feed engines , not people !
This is not a long - term solution .
In fact , the idea of food for fuel should be seen as an indicator of just how serious the energy crisis is and how close we are , not just to an uncomfortable spike in the price of petrol , but also to a monumental shift in the price of all energy .
Ireland should prepare for this now by using planning as the key instrument to change our behaviour .
In fact , we should use the slump in the economy to take stock and learn a few lessons .
The major lifestyle lesson of the past few years is that sloppy planning leads to urban sprawl .
If you combine this with the deregulation of financial markets , which allows credit to cascade into the economy , you get a housing bubble which results in lots of worthless houses being built in the wrong places .
This is what we have ended up with ; loads of empty houses in parts of the country with few people and not enough accommodation in the part of the country with the most people .
So we have thousands of once expensive , second homes unoccupied and not enough fairly - priced , first homes for those who need them !
One way to solve this is to build up not out , creating the population density to make new public transport investment in trams and trains affordable .
In the 1970s , the Dutch decided to move the old port of Amsterdam out of the city , freeing up valuable land , reducing congestion and giving the new port access to the road and rail network .
Dublin could do exactly the same .
Dublin 's port is a waste of space .
It could be moved and built on .
This idea is hardly new , it 's been knocking around for a while , but the energy crisis makes it imperative .
Developments like the Point Village and U2's tower are the future .
Similar ideas are being floated in Cork , down by Pairc Ui Chaoimh , while anyone who has tried to get around Galway at rush - hour will realise that it can't sustain more suburban sprawl .
Creating new towns , with mixed use shops and residential developments in the one area is the only way to respond to the world running out of oil .
There are lots of ways that a government with a clear vision could do this .
Give out free bikes , for example .
I know this sounds odd but why not ?
No one could argue that free education did not prepare the society for the challenges of globalisation , why not prepare the population for the coming energy crisis -- where oil could be at $ 200 or $ 300 a barrel -- with free bikes ?
The State could also cut public transport fares by half to encourage use .
The basic tenet of economics is that people respond to price changes , so use economics creatively .
We could reward development that is environmentally logical and penalise development that is not .
These are all pretty simple things .
Cost these initiatives , figure out how to finance them and do it .
The Dutch have shown us the way and have been repaid in spades by tourist revenue alone .
So why do n't we break the habit of a lifetime and prepare for the coming energy depression ?
Given the certainty of the last day of oil , we owe it to our children to ready them for the greatest revolution in living the world has seen for centuries .

Remember back in high school biology class , when you cultured bacteria on an agar medium in petri dishes ?
This is the same stuff .
It 's actually a gelatinous preparation of the cell walls of red algae , used to thicken the fruit filling .
On ingredient labels , it 's sometimes called red seaweed , likely because the idea of ingesting seaweed is somewhat palatable ( think sushi ) .
Eating red algae , on the other hand , sounds nasty .
Modified Cornstarch
When liquids are added to regular cornstarch , it turns into a thick , cloudy gel .
Modified cornstarch becomes a clear mucus - like gel , excellent for filling fruit pies .
What 's the difference ?
Instead of stretching out in a chain , modified cornstarch molecules cross -link to one another .
That way , they swell with water just like regular starch but do n't break down and become opaque .
The FDA - approved chemicals for modifying cornstarch include hydrochloric and sulfuric acids , hydrogen peroxide , chlorine , and sodium chloride .
High - Fructose Corn Syrup , Corn Syrup , Sugar
It would n't be a proper snack food if it did n't have three types of sugar , would it ?
In fact , more than one - third of the total weight of a Lemon Fruit Pie comes from this trio of sweeteners .
Vegetable and / or Animal Shortening
You can't produce light , flaky , delicate crusts in industrial quantities with butter ( the water in it can make pastry tough and chewy ) .
Which type of shortening is used in these pies depends on the state of the commodities market .
Your scrumptious treat could be made with soybean oil , but if the price is right , nothing goes better with the zesty taste of lemon than ... beef fat .
Yup , your fruit pie might be fluffed with ol ' Bessy 's blubber .
Lemon Puree
Finally , some fruit .
According to the label , only 6 percent or less of this lemon fruit pie can be traced to lemons .
Enriched Wheat Flour
The ingredient that gave us the phrase " white - bread America . "
The first standards for enriching bread were set by the US in 1941 , requiring the addition of iron and the B vitamins thiamine , riboflavin , and niacin ( and later folic acid ) to white wheat flour .
These days , of course , white flour is considered unhealthy — so it 's perfect for junktastic foods like fruit pies .
Locust Bean Gum
An extract of the seeds of the carob tree , locust bean gum was known to the ancient Egyptians , who used it to bind the wrappings of mummies .
Here it keeps the crust from getting soggy and letting the fruity goodness leak out .
Calcium Sulphate
Plaster of Paris .
Used for millennia to congeal soy milk into tofu , this gunk has hundreds of applications .
In a fruit pie , it may be present as a coagulant , a gel extender ( helping to hold the moisture in ) , or just to add calcium .
Artificial Flavor
Hostess wo n't say what it uses .
But most citrus flavors can be derived from naturally occurring terpenes , plant - based hydrocarbons that can be replicated easily in the lab by distilling the mother lode of terpenes : turpentine .

Capital Weekly is telling the story of Congresswoman Laura Richardson 's decision to Walk Away .
The story of the foreclosure of Long Beach Democrat Laura Richardson 's Sacramento home is a tale of a real estate market gone sour .
It is also an illustration of how far many candidates will go to seek elected office , even if it means quite literally mortgaging their own financial future .
While being elevated to Congress in a 2007 special election , Richardson apparently stopped making payments on her new Sacramento home , and eventually walked away from it , leaving nearly $ 600,000 in unpaid loans and fees .
Tax records at the Sacramento County assessor 's office show that in January 2007 , Richardson took out a mortgage for the entire sale price of the house -- $ 535,000 .
The mortgage amount was equal to the sale price of the home , meaning she was able to buy the house without a down payment , even though the housing market was beginning to turn .
A March 19 , 2008 notice of trustee 's sale indicates that the unpaid balance of Richardson 's loan , which is held by Washington Mutual , is more than $ 578,000 – $ 40,000 more than the original mortgage .
The Curtis Park house is not Richardson 's primary residence .
She also owns a four - bedroom house in Long Beach , in her Congressional district .
Real estate records show she purchased that house in 1999 for $ 135,000 .
An estimate from Zillow.com puts the current value of that house at $ 474,000
Like many homes that have gone through foreclosure , Richardson 's new residence quickly became an eyesore .
With Richardson gone , upkeep on the home lapsed , and neighbors began to get angry .
" The neighbors are extremely unhappy with her , " said Sharon Helmar , who sold the home to Richardson .
" She did n't mow the lawn or take out the garbage while she was there .
We lived there for a long time , 30 years , and we had to hide our heads whenever we came back to the neighborhood . "
While Richardson walked away from her loan , she bested Oropeza in a June special election , and moved on to Congress .
As a member of Congress , Richardson has been asked to vote on legislation pertaining to the spike in foreclosures around the country .
On the biggest pieces of legislation having to do with government bailouts for people whose homes have entered foreclosure , Richardson has recused herself .
She did not vote on legislation by Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass , which would direct $ 2.7 billion in government funds to help an estimated 500,000 homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure .
Richardson also did not vote on a measure by Rep. Maxine Waters , D - Los Angeles , that would give local governments $ 15 billion to purchase , rehab and resell foreclosed properties .
While Richardson walked away from her bank loan , she has begun to pay herself back for the money she personally invested in her initial race .
Records show that Richardson spent $ 587,000 out of her Congressional campaign committee since declaring her Congressional candidacy through March of this year .
Of those expenditures , Richardson has spent $ 18,000 of that money to begin repaying herself for the money Richardson loaned to her campaign .
According to documents at the Sacramento County Clerk 's office , Richardson first received a default notice in late 2007 .
By December 2007 , less than a year after Richardson purchased the house , she was behind in her payments by more than $ 18,000 .
Three months later , on March 19 , a notice was filed with the county that Richardson 's property would be sold at auction .
According to the documents , the unpaid balance and other charges Richardson owed the bank was $ 587,384 .

The Hollis F. Price Middle College High School is undoubtedly a successful school .
As a collaboration between the Memphis school district and LeMoyne - Owen College , it provides an opportunity for gifted African - American students to earn credits towards their college degrees while still in high school .
And by selecting only 150 of the district ’s best students , it avoids many of the problems that plague public schools : fighting , truancy , and falling educational standards .
And Hollis F. Price has admirable stated ideals and intentions including
We believe that every member of our learning community has value and worth and has the right to be respected .
and
All students enrolled at Hollis F. Price Early Middle College are able to participate in many of the approved and available high school and college organizations and activities .
But in her effort to provide an ideal educational environment , Principal Daphne Beasley went way beyond what is appropriate or even legal .
Seeking to eliminate public displays of affection , Beasley asked that students and teachers report suspected romantic couples to her .
She then compiled a list and posted it where teachers and other students could read it .
Although this is disturbing in itself , Beasley left all measure of reasonableness when a pair of boys hit her list .
Although both boys were A students , had never displayed any public affection , and were an asset to any learning institution , that did n’t stop Beasley from seeking to humiliate them .
Memphis Eyewitness News reports
One of the young men , Nicholas , an 11th grader who just made the Dean ’s List , spoke with Eyewitness News Everywhere .
“ It was actually frightening , ” he says , “ to see a list with my name on it where not just other teachers could see but students as well . ”
Nicholas says his teachers and other students treat him differently as a result of Principal Beasley ’s decision and that he and Andrew have both had to deal with verbal assaults .
Nicholas was also not allowed to go on a trip to New Orleans to help rebuild homes because , as one of his teacher ’s explained , he would “ embarrass ” the school by engaging in gay affection .
“ I really feel that my personal privacy was invaded , ” Nicholas says .
“ I mean , Principal Beasley called my mother and outed me to my mother ! ”
The ACLU stepped in to support the boys and their mothers .
Their letter to the school board clarifies some of Beasley ’s motivation .
Specifically , we have been informed that during their telephone call about Nicholas ’s inclusion on the “ list ” as being part of a gay couple , Principal Beasley told [ Nicholas ’ mother ] that she did not like homosexuals and found it hard to deal with homosexuality .
Principal Beasley , according to [ Nicholas ’ mother ’s ] contemporaneous notes , then informed her that homosexuality would not be tolerated at Hollis F. Price and that she was glad that she did n’t have any kids so she would n’t have to deal with these kinds of problems .
Ms. Beasley clearly does not believe that her school ’s “ all students ” statements include gay students , no matter how well behaved .
Such an attitude is not conducive to an unbiased and discrimination - free learning environment , and either Principal Beasley should lose it or she should find some form of employment in which she does n’t have to deal with persons that she does not like .
U.S. Considers Outlawing ' Unauthorized Information Exchanges '
International plan at centerpiece of massive new anti-piracy push Slashdot points to a freshly posted Wikileaks document that states the United States is considering a " Pirate Bay Killer " international trade agreement that would " criminalize the non-profit facilitation of unauthorized information exchange on the internet . "
This would obviously take aim at The Pirate Bay and other P2P websites , but it potentially could also impact whistle - blower sites like Wikileaks , or networks like TOR .
From the Wikileaks synopsis of the full document ( pdf ) : quote :
If adopted , the treaty would impose a strong , top - down enforcement regime imposing new cooperation requirements upon Internet service providers , including perfunctory disclosure of customer information , as well as measures restricting the use of online privacy tools . "
Laments one Slashdot reader in their comment section : quote : Too late .
Pass all the laws you like , crack down with all the jackbooted thuggery you can muster .
Suspend habeas corpus , declare the 4th amendment null and void , force the royal family to submit to regular body cavity searches , install a camera on every corner , give police orders to use deadly force against downloaders ... none of it will make any difference .
You can't turn back the clock .
As I just got done saying Laments one Slashdot reader in their comment section :
As I just got done saying yesterday , we 're entering a brave new era of anti-piracy enforcement , with ISPs playing the starring role .
Comcast plans to begin enforcing DMCA letters by terminating user accounts , AT&T is working on piracy filters , the entertainment industry wants piracy filters in network hardware or anti-virus tools , while an international coalition focuses on criminalizing all " unauthorized information exchanges .

So essentially , these buffoons want to lock down the Internet , censoring / blocking everything that they specifically do not approve of .
We 've seen this in action already .
It 's called China .
Sun Valley Parkway divides America 's past from its probable future .
The road loops round the foot of the White Tank mountains , a craggy outcrop of rock that rises to 1,200 metres ( 4,000 ft ) from the Sonoran valley in Arizona .
On one side of the road there is the America as it would have been experienced by Jack Swilling , the frontiersman who first spotted the area 's potential for settlement in 1867 .
It is untouched desert , bristling with creosote bushes , palo verde and ironwood trees and the state 's signature plant , saguaro cacti .
At this time of year the desert looks wispy and brittle , but in a few weeks it will be carpeted with wild flowers and the ocotillo will be in bright red bloom .
On the other side of the road is Tartesso Homes , a rocky outcrop of a different sort .
Its entrance is marked by a granite plinth that pronounces the community 's name in large bronze letters , flanked by a lush green lawn and rows of palm trees .
A two - lane road leads into the complex , past detached houses in various stages of completion , a playground and " community park " .
There are model houses to look around in styles to meet all tastes , from " trend homes " to Spanish haciendas , all arches and terracotta .
The developers have replanted some of the saguaros , using wooden tripods to prop them up until their roots take , but despite this effort at blending in , the two sides of the road could not be more contrasting .
Tartesso Homes is the physical manifestation of a demographic trend felt across America but nowhere more keenly than in Arizona .
The state has the fastest growing population in the country , recently overtaking Nevada , which held the title for 19 years .
In 1950 there were 750,000 Arizonans ; in 2000 there were almost 5 million and in 2020 there are projected to be 7.4 million .
Phoenix , the state capital that lies about 50 miles east of the White Tank mountains , is the fastest growing city in America .
It covered 17 square miles in 1950 ; now it sprawls over almost 500 , an area larger than Los Angeles .
A horse brought Jack Swilling to the area .
But the town he helped to found , which later became known as Phoenix , took off only after the invention of the car and air conditioning , allowing newcomers to bear 46C ( 115 F ) temperatures .
Thousands descend every year on Arizona , led by baby - boomers reaching retirement .
They come mainly from other parts of the US - from California where land is increasingly expensive , and the midwest , where the winters are severe .
And each new arrival is looking to build a castle in the desert , the epitome of the detached , individualistic and car - dependent American dream .
Other cities build upwards .
Phoenix spreads outwards , gobbling up the desert .
" We have a default position in much of America , which if you do nothing about it will always be applied , " said David Goldberg of the sustainable planning group Smart Growth America .
" Single detached family homes on an acre or so where all the streets end in cul - de - sacs , there is only one way in and out and all needs are a drive away . "
You can see the result along the Sun Valley Parkway , where at several points the desert has been stripped bare ready for new developments such as Tartesso Homes .
All over Arizona the same pattern is repeating .
Further west there are two new communities planned , each with 250,000 people .
To the south - east of Phoenix a new town , Superstition Vistas , is envisaged for up to 900,000 .
Thirty miles to the north of Phoenix is Anthem , a town that is relatively mature in Arizonan terms having been opened in 1998 and with a population of about 40,000 .
It is a kind of anti-city .
It has no real centre , save a park with fancy water features and a " marketplace " full of superstores .
The town continues to spread its tentacles into the surrounding desert , with the outskirts occupied by bulldozers and Mexican building gangs .
Kristina Jauch is one of the new residents on the edge of the town , having moved into a newly built home in December .
She fled Illinois because of cold winters and mosquito - infested summers , and now runs a pet - sitting service .
( " Relax , your babies are safe with us , " says the blurb . )
" We feel like every day we are on vacation .
We 've got a smokin ' view from our back window of the mountains , and the sunsets are breathtaking , " she said .
Houses are going up all around her , in roads newly dubbed Paso Nuevo drive and Hidden Mountain Lane .
For residents such as Mrs Jauch the attractions are palpable : more space for their bucks , eternal summers and fulfilment of what remains of the west 's original frontier spirit .
But the costs are high too .
Arizona 's water table is being depleted as a result of homes being built on pristine desert rather than on agricultural land already used to grow thirsty crops such as cotton and alfalfa .
Air quality is suffering from dust thrown up from developments and car exhausts , and highways are clogged with commuters travelling to and from the desert communities .
In Phoenix , widening one of the main intersections to 24 lanes , 12 in each direction , has been mooted .
" At what point do we just stand up and start screaming ? " said Wellington Reiter , dean of Arizona State University 's design college , who has been involved in creating a light rail system - a first step towards public transport .
But he fears the pace of growth in the opposite direction , comparing the carbon footprint ( the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by each person every year ) of Phoenicians : 1,400kg , with that of the people of Hong Kong : 50kg .
Environmentalists tried unsuccessfully to introduce tougher restrictions on development in Arizona in 2000 .
Sandy Bahr of the state 's Sierra Club said the unlikely alliance between developers and farmers hoping to make a fortune by selling their land for housing complexes proved too powerful .
" The policy - makers are burying their heads in the sand .
Our whole economy is based not just on growth , but on rapid growth , " she said .
With the American population passing 300 million , and projected to reach 400 million by mid-century , Arizona is the most extreme example of stresses being played out across the States .
America is being paved over .
Some estimates suggest that more than half of the built environment that will exist in the US in 2025 will have been constructed since 2000 .
That translates in Arizona as an army of Tartesso Homes marching across the desert .
The White Tank mountains will before long rise up from a carpet not of wild flowers but of haciendas .
You could call it the final taming of the wild west , though it might not have been what Jack Swilling intended .
Bush Family Chronicles : The Patriarchs Editor ’s Note : When Americans wonder how the arrogant and corrupt Bush family managed to seize so much power for so long , part of the answer is that the electorate lost control of its history during the long Cold War and into a new era of secrecy called " the war on terror . "
Cold War secrecy gave the rich and powerful extraordinary abilities to hide information from the American people , including the unsavory history of the Bush family , as journalist / historian Morgan Strong observes in this guest essay :
To fully understand the present manifestation of the Bush family and its excesses , one must consider its history over several generations , a difficult and painful undertaking since it reveals so much about the self - destructive apathy of the American people .

Printer friendly James Madison wrote passionately in the Federalist Papers that in order for a democracy to function and not descend into a tyranny of the wealthy and the well - connected , the citizenry must stay well informed .
In Madison ’s view , a democratic society was wholly dependent on an informed citizenry .
Much of the responsibility to inform was placed on the press and the educational system .
Indeed , the Founders gave the press the unchallenged right to seek out and publish information under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
In recent years , however , the U.S. press has failed in that responsibility dreadfully .
Education in this country also has been a dismal failure .
But in the end , it is the citizens who bear the principal duty to make themselves informed .
Below , in a bleak and foreboding history , is what occurs when the citizenry is deprived of meaningful information and then fails in its obligation to find out the facts and exercise the critical judgment required for self governance .
The Bushes
In the late 19th Century , Samuel Bush moved to Ohio from Orange , New Jersey , where he had attended the nearby Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken .
He made the first big move in his manufacturing career as an engineer with Buckeye Steel Castings Company , which produced gun barrels and railroad parts .
Samuel Bush became a confidante of the company ’s president , Frank Rockefeller , a brother of the enormously wealthy and powerful John D. Rockefeller , who owned Standard Oil .
Another participant in Buckeye Steel was railroad baron E.H. Harriman .
The Rockefeller - Harriman connection was to remain important through the lives and careers of several generations of the Bush family .
Samuel Bush took over from Frank Rockefeller as president of the company in 1908 , and held that job for the next 20 years .
Through his Rockefeller - Harriman connections , he was made chief of the Ordnance , Small Arms and Ammunition Section of the War Industries Board in the Wilson administration during World War I. Percy Rockefeller , John D. Rockefeller ’s first cousin who had acquired Remington Arms in 1914 , built a new plant just in time to enjoy enormous profit from the sale of weapons in World War I .
Percy benefited from no -bid contracts to manufacture arms and supply ammunition to the U.S. military , arranged by Samuel Bush .
Samuel Bush ’s Buckeye Steel made the gun barrels for Remington , which also outfitted the Czar ’s forces in Russia after contracting to supply a million rifles to Russia in 1916 .
During World War I , Remington supplied 67 percent of all the weapons and ammunition used by the Allied forces .
Samuel ’s son , Prescott Bush , served as an artillery liaison officer with the French forces during the war and wrote back home about his heroic exploits in letters that were published .
But the exploits proved to be fabricated , forcing Prescott to apologize .
But that did n’t deter him – or dim his career prospects .
Prescott was a Yale College graduate and a member of the influential Skull and Bones Society along with Averell Harriman , the son of his father ’s associate , railroad magnate E.H. Harriman .
Prescott also married well , wooing the favorite daughter of financier George Herbert Walker , who brought Prescott into the Wall Street firm of Harriman & Co. , which later became Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. During the 1930s , Prescott Bush was a fanatical opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt .
There were even rumors that Bush tried to encourage a military coup against Roosevelt after his election as President in 1933 .
But the evidence – while intriguing – has never been conclusive .
Similar secrecy and uncertainty surrounded the intricate web of ownership and control of Harriman ’s Union Banking Corp. , which Prescott Bush administered in collaboration with backers of Germany ’s Nazi Party .
As a rising star at the Harriman firm , Prescott Bush became a director ( effectively in charge ) of Harriman ’s UBC , which had a financial relationship with German industrialist Fritz Thyssen , an early supporter of Adolf Hitler .
Brown Brothers Harriman supplied Thyssen with financing and other banking services that allowed the Nazis to build up their war machine .
After Thyssen broke with Hitler in 1939 , Thyssen ’s banking empire came under control of the Nazi government , with Prescott Bush continuing as a behind - the - scenes force in the relationship .
One of these Bush - connected companies , Consolidated Silesian Steel , made use of Nazi slave labor from concentration camps , including Auschwitz .
After Germany declared war on the United States , the U.S. government investigated these relationships and seized Harriman ’s UBC in 1943 under the Trading with the Enemy Act .
However , following the war , rather than face the ignominy of profiting off his dealings with the Nazis , Bush was compensated for the seizure of the bank , receiving a $ 1.5 million settlement from the U.S. government , an astonishing amount of money in 1945 .
It was remarkable that despite Prescott Bush ’s lying about his heroics in World War I and his assistance to the Nazis in World War II , he was nonetheless elected to the U.S. Senate as a Republican from Connecticut in 1952 and served there until 1963 .
While in the Senate , Prescott Bush continued to serve the interests of his financial benefactors , the Harrimans and Rockefellers , especially by aiding the oil industry .
Short of those services , his legislative accomplishments amounted to little .
But Prescott Bush ’s business and personal connections were to have a profound impact on the course of American history .
Many of his wealthy friends bankrolled his son , George Herbert Walker Bush , in launching his first oil business in Texas – and then a political career that would take the Bush family to the White House .
Morgan Strong was an adviser on the Middle East to CBS News “ 60 Minutes . ”
He is a former Professor of Middle Eastern History at MercyCollege and S.U.N.Y .

The secret to long life may not be in the genes
A research on the bone health of one of the oldest persons in the world , who recently died at the age of 114 , reveals that there were no genetic modifications which could have contributed to this longevity .
The research team , directed by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona professor Adolfo Díez Pérez , pointed out a healthy lifestyle , a Mediterranean diet , a temperate climate and regular physical activity as the reasons for his excellent health .
The research team studied the bone mass and analysed the genetics of a man with enviable health who at the time of the study was 113 years old .
The research was carried out with four other members of his family : a 101 - year - old brother , two daughters aged 81 and 77 , and a nephew aged 85 , all of them born and still living in a small town of the island of Menorca .
The research findings were recently published in the Journal of Gerontology and reported that the man 's bones were in excellent conditions : his bone mass was normal , there were no anomalous curvatures and he had never sustained a fracture .
With regard to the genetical analyses , researchers were unsuccessful in finding any mutations in the KLOTHO gene , which is generally related to a good level of mineral density and therefore healthy bones .
Neither did they find any mutations in the LRP5 gene , which is associated with longevity .
None of the members of the family who participated in the study presented any mutations in this gene .
The results of the research do not rule out the possibility that other genetic mutations could positively influence longevity .
However , researchers do point out the fact that the excellent health of this family , and of the 113 - year - old man in particular , is probably due to a Mediterranean diet , the temperate climate of the island , a lack of stress and regular physical activity .
The article underlines the fact that until the age of 102 , the man cycled every day and looked after the family orchard .

It was not unusual for the police to turn up at the West London home of Emma Mills and Levi Bellfield .
Emma knew her partner 's life was a confusion of grey areas as far as the law was concerned .
This time , however , was different .
Scroll down for more ...
Haunted : ' Every day I think about these girls , ' says Emma Mills .
' I always thought Levi ( Bellfield ) was a cheat , a bully and a liar ... but I never thought he 'd killed anyone '
" It must have been four or five in the morning when they came , " says Emma .
" The house was lit up with torchlights and I thought he must be in trouble with the police – he'd been in trouble before , for fraud .
" But this was different .
There were about 30 policemen with guns , there were dogs – all surrounding the house .
They were banging on the door and screaming his name .
I thought , ' What the hell have you done now ? '
" We were in bed and he turned and he just looked at me and he looked so scared .
It was complete fear .
I 've never seen him look like that before .
" He said , ' I 'm sorry , ' and then he ran out on to the landing , pulled out a chest of drawers and used it to jump up into the loft .

Family man : Bellfield with his children Andrew and Anna in 2004
" That 's the last time I ever saw him .
I went downstairs just as the door flew open and a load of police officers pushed past me calling his name . "
Emma knew , of course , that this was serious ; that it was n't about a stolen van or a car - clamping scam .
But she did not realise that Bellfield , her partner of nine years and father of her three children , was about to be arrested for the murder of 22 - year - old Amelie Delagrange .
Nor did she know just what horrors and discoveries lay ahead of her .
In recent weeks , the British courts have borne witness to three chilling trials .
Last month the Suffolk Strangler , Steve Wright , was jailed for life for the murder of five prostitutes , while Mark Dixie was imprisoned for the murder of the teenage model Sally Anne Bowman .
Yet even in such debased company there is something truly shocking about Levi Bellfield , 39 , who was last week sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Amelie and 19 - year - old gap - year student Marsha McDonnell .

In court , he winked at the families of his victims and then refused to appear to hear his fate .
Dubbed the " bus - stop murderer " , Bellfield is now the prime suspect in the Milly Dowler case and is believed to be connected to at least 20 other attacks and murders .
For Emma , Bellfield 's common - law wife and mother to Anna , ten , Andrew , eight , and three - year - old Beth , it is a knowledge that is almost impossible to bear .
Her story offers a devastating insight into the mind of Bellfield , who could turn out to be one of the most dangerous serial killers in Britain 's history .
Speaking for the first time , Emma , 30 , has told The Mail on Sunday of Bellfield 's obsessive need to control everyone around him .
She explains how he would use a menacing combination of intimidation and charm and how he beat , raped and degraded her throughout their years together .
She also reveals the sickening detail of his eventual emotional breakdown .

Emma had long grown used to her partner 's emotional and physical abuse but it was only when the police arrested him in November 2004 that she realised the depths of his depravity .
Pretty and articulate , Emma says : " I always thought Levi was a player .
He 's a cheat , he 's a bully , he 's a liar but I never thought he 'd killed anyone .
Now though , looking back , when the police told me I did n't instinctively say he had n't .
" I do n't think he 'll admit to killing anyone .
He 's not the type to own up to anything .
He 's a control freak .
Levi likes to have the power and control over everything and that includes women .
" Now , I feel such guilt for my children for giving them a father like that .
They adore him and they 've got to grow up with the knowledge and the stigma of what he 's done .
And I feel guilt for those girls .
Every day I think about them .
If I 'd only realised , they might be alive . "
Emma does not want or expect anyone 's sympathy .
Yet she , too , was a victim of Bellfield .

Bellfield was last week sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Amelie Delagrange , left , and Marsha McDonnell
She is not the type of girl you would expect to end up with a man like Bellfield , a 16 - stone thug who ran a car - clamping racket .
He was born in Isleworth , West London and his father , a mechanic , died when he was young .
He was brought up by his mother , Jean , an overbearing woman who doted on her youngest son and brought him up to believe he could do no wrong .
The family boasted of their pure gipsy blood .
Emma was born in Hersham , Surrey .
Her father Graham was an insurance broker , her mother Gilly a receptionist .
Graham left home when Emma was young but she had a loving and stable upbringing with her mother .
They lived in a pretty Victorian cottage and weekends were spent riding her horse Billy .
After taking her GCSEs at Trinity School in Esher , Surrey , Emma went to Guildford College to train to be a nanny but had to leave after contracting glandular fever .
It was in 1996 while she was still recovering that she met Bellfield , then a bouncer at Rocky 's nightclub in Cobham .
She recalls : " Everybody knew Levi .
He was a bit of a cheeky chappy and always friendly and kind .
I was quite impressed by him .
He was very charming .
" One night I 'd had too much to drink and Levi said , ' Come on , babe , I 'll take you home . '
He drove me back and dropped me off at the door and was the perfect gentleman .
" A few weeks later he took me home again and this time we kissed .
I was completely obsessed by him .
He would leave flowers and notes at my house and was always calling me .
He was my first proper boyfriend and he made me feel very special .
" For my 19th birthday he bought me a huge bucket of roses .
At karaoke nights , he would sing You To Me Are Everything .
Even now , every time I hear it , I think of the one time I was happy , when I believed everything he said . "
Within six months , Emma had left home and moved in with Bellfield , who was then living with his Uncle Charlie in a council house in Walton - on - Thames .
" I think that was when I realised that our backgrounds were very different , " says Emma .
" It was filthy and Charlie and his girlfriend , Bern , did n't sleep upstairs .
" They slept in their clothes downstairs and smoked and drank all day long .
When the reality of the place hit me it was quite scary but I loved Levi and it was exciting to be independent . "
But in a matter of weeks Emma was to see another side to his personality .
She says : " He 'd been drinking and we had an argument because I 'd asked for Uncle Charlie 's help about something without Levi 's permission .
I was driving him home from the pub and he started hitting me on the side of my face by my left eye .
" Then the car ran out of petrol and we walked the rest of the way home .
It was about two miles with him punching and kicking me the whole way .
When we got home , I went upstairs .
I remember someone trying to pull my trousers down and then the next thing I knew Charlie was throwing a bucket of water over me .
" Levi called his ex-girlfriend Jo and told her to take me to hospital .
He told me not to give my real name and I told them I 'd been beaten up by a gang of girls .
Afterwards , he cried and said he loved me .
He was so sorry that I forgave him . "
A month later he raped Emma for the first time .
She says : " We 'd had a row .
I 'd been out with friends and he did n't like it .
A couple of nights later , we 'd been out for a drink .
I was driving us home when he ordered me down all these little roads .
We got to Walton Bridge and then he got the back of my hair and said : ' You think you 're going to get away with the other night ? '
" Then he undid the belt of my jeans and said : ' Next time I tell you not to do something , do n't do it . '
" Afterwards , I was in shock .
The next day I still was n't speaking to him but then I thought : ' Do n't be dramatic , Emma .
It ca n't be rape because he 's your boyfriend . '
Then I started to blame myself for the argument . "
Many will find it hard to understand why Emma did n't leave then .
To begin with , she admits , it was a mixture of love and childish pride .
Then , quite simply , it was fear .
She says : " I loved him .
In between all this , we did have nice times .
I know that 's hard to believe now but we did .
For my 21st birthday he hired a limo and brought me up to London .
We stayed at the Waldorf and went to see Saturday Night Fever .
" I knew the relationship was n't right because he was so possessive .
My mum hated him but I was too proud to admit she was right .
Then I was too frightened to leave him because I was afraid of what he might do to her .
" By then I knew what he was capable of .
I just started to live my life in a way that would n't bring that side out , in a way that was acceptable to him .
" About a year after we met , I fell pregnant with Anna .
I was n't happy .
He was , though .
He had me then .
I remember thinking , ' I do n't speak to my friends , I do n't speak to my mum . '
I could n't leave .
I had no money , no job and no one but Levi . "
By this time they had moved home to West Drayton .
Emma says : " I desperately wanted to work but I did n't dare ask him .
I knew he'd never allow it .
Yet in a weird way I thought he protected me . "
Such feelings are not unusual in women who have suffered extreme domestic abuse .
And Emma 's experience was becoming increasingly violent and traumatic .
There is a numb , detached tone to her voice , as she says : " He never hit me again after that first time but sometimes while he was raping me , he would slap me .
And he 'd always pull my hair and call me a slag and a bitch .
" Once , he raped me outside and then locked me out for about half an hour afterwards with no clothes on .
Another time , it was on the stairs and he got a Stanley knife and traced it across my back .
" Afterwards , I 'd try and forget it .
It was too scary to think about the reality and how wrong it was .
It always happened after an argument .
It was always : ' Think you 're clever now , do you ? '
" By the end it was probably happening once every couple of weeks .
And he stopped saying sorry the next morning .
" The last time , in about autumn 2001 , was the worst of all .
He degraded me to the point of utter despair and disgust .
It was all night .
" He got a camera out and said , ' I know , let 's have more fun . '
He started videoing me and made me perform for the cameras .
Then he strangled me with my cardigan .
I was terrified .
I thought he was going to kill me .
" Afterwards he ran me a bath .
It was boiling but he said , ' Get in there .
Get rid of all the evidence .
You know it 's my word against yours . ' "
Finally , Bellfield had pushed Emma too far .
She says : " The next day he was completely normal .
I came down and he said : ' Morning , babe . '
He went out to work and I rang my mum and said , ' I want to go today . '
" I packed the children 's clothes into two bin bags and Mum got me into a refuge . "
But by the end of the year , Emma had agreed to go back to him – as long as she did n't have to return to the family home straight away .
Instead , she insisted they rent a flat for a while as a way of creating a fresh start .
The flat , in Collingwood Place , Walton - on - Thames , was 30 yards from the bus stop where Milly Dowler was last seen .
Emma says simply : " I believed that he 'd changed .
And he was true to his word .
He never touched me again . "
Instead , a terrifying trail of murders , rapes and assaults began in the local area , with Milly 's being one of the first .
Emma 's recollection of March 21 , 2002 , the night she went missing , now raises serious concerns about Bellfield who , last week , became the prime suspect in the case .
She explains : " We were house - sitting for a friend in West Drayton the day Milly disappeared .
It was weird .
I was ringing his phone but it was switched off all day .
I had no money .
I was like , ' He knows I need to go to the shop and where is he ? '
" I thought he 'd just gone off drinking .
He finally came back about 11.30 pm .
" The first thing I said was obvious ...' Where 've you been ? ' and then I said , ' Why have you changed ? ' because he'd changed his clothes and he said ' I have n't . '
" He was adamant he had n't changed .
He was drinking , swigging a can of Tennent 's lager .
" Then I went to bed and the next thing I knew , he was getting up and it was about three in the morning .
I said : ' What on Earth are you doing ? '
And he said , ' I 'm going back to the flat . '
I said , ' Why ? '
He said he wanted a lie - in in the morning .
I thought it was a bit odd as we were in a three - storey maisonette so he would n't have heard the kids .
" The next day , or the day after , my friend was coming home so I went back to the flat in Collingwood Place .
" When I went in , all the bed was bare .
There were no sheets , no duvet , just bare pillows .
I called him up and he said the dog had had an accident .
I thought the dog would n't do that and if he did , Levi would n't clean it up .
" Then he told me he'd put the sheets out in the bin cupboard .
I went and checked but there was nothing there .
" I thought it was strange but I automatically thought it was another woman .
I never thought anything else . "
A day or so later , Bellfield insisted they move back to the family home in West Drayton .
After Milly 's murder , police tried to trace a red Daewoo that was close to the bus stop 25 minutes after she was last seen .
Emma says : " I had a red Daewoo and he had the use of it .
He had the car the day Milly went missing but then it got stolen .
" Levi went out with his friends one night and said he had n't driven the car home because he'd been drinking .
I actually thought that was good because normally he did n't care about that .
When he went to pick it up the next morning , he said it had gone . "
In November of that year , Sonia Salvatierra escaped an attempted attack on her in Twickenham Green .
Police have said they are looking at links with Bellfield .
Similarly , they believe he was responsible for a hammer attack on Jesse Wilson on January 8 , 2003 .
The following month , on February 5 , Bellfield killed Marsha McDonnell .
The pretty 19 - year - old was clubbed three times over the head with a blunt instrument .
She died just yards from her home in Hampton , West London .
According to Emma , there was nothing unusual about Bellfield 's behaviour after the attack .
She says : " He did suddenly announce that we were going to Tenerife .
We went to Tenerife three times that year , all last - minute holidays , but that was the only odd thing .
" An acquaintance of his was arrested for Marsha 's murder .
His mum was talking about it one day and he did n't seem any different .
And he loved watching Crimewatch .
He 'd always watch it if it was on .
" I once found a pair of plastic surgical gloves in his coat but when I asked what they were for , he said it was to do with his clamping .
I believed him . "
Police are now investigating a further four attacks on women that took place after Marsha 's murder and before Bellfield deliberately drove over Kate Sheedy on May 25 , 2004 .
It was only now that there was a noticeable change as he became increasingly erratic .
Emma says : " In July he went really peculiar .
He 'd rented a flat in Hanworth and would go off all the time .
Then he rang me one night and said he was so sorry for what he 'd done to me .
I thought he meant going off with other women because by then I knew he'd been having an affair with a local girl , Terri Carroll . "
Bellfield had always liked to think of himself as a bit of a womaniser .
He had had at least two significant relationships other than with Emma .
He had four children by barmaid Becky Wilkinson and one child by Johanna Collings .
Emma knew about both relationships .
Emma continues : " He was edgy .
He 'd always had panic attacks but they got much worse .
He was clammy all the time and would n't come round if it was daylight .
He 'd ring and say , ' I 'm parking now at the end of the road so open the door for me . '
" He 'd run along the road with his hood up and if I had n't opened the door in time he 'd practically kick it down .
Then he'd go straight upstairs to the bedroom .
And he had to have all the curtains closed . "
Shortly afterwards , on August 19 , 2004 , Bellfield killed Amelie Delagrange , a French exchange student
who was bludgeoned to death on Twickenham Green .
It was clear to Emma that he was now unravelling emotionally .
She just did n't know why .
She says now : " It must have been a few days afterwards that we had a fight .
He asked me to turn the radio down and I said no because the children were dancing to it .
He got the stereo and threw it over Andrew 's head and out of the front door .
" Then he went into the kitchen , smashed it up and went outside .
I still ignored him but then every now and then I 'd hear a thud from the garden .
I thought he must be kicking the wall in temper .
Eventually I opened the door and asked Levi what he was doing .
" He came out of the shadows like something out of a horror film .
There was blood pouring out of the side of his head .
That was what he'd been hitting against the wall .
" Then , in the last week of August , he came round and he looked terrible .
He was sobbing and sitting on the bed , rocking .
I was worried about him .
" I called his doctor who spoke to Levi and then insisted I get him to the psychiatric ward immediately .
" Apparently , Levi had told him he'd tried to take an overdose days before .
And I 'd also found some piping which he'd bought for the car .
" I called a friend who took him to Hillingdon A&E .
Levi called me from the hospital car park .
He was crying and said : ' You 'll be burying me in a month .
If not , I 'll be in prison . '
" I asked why and he said , ' Oh , because of this fraud . '
He was always being investigated for fraud or drugs or something .
He always had all sorts of scams going .
" He sometimes brought drugs into the house but he never kept them there .
To be honest , I did n't really know much about all his different deals .
I turned a blind eye .
And anyway , you did n't ask Levi questions .
" Then he said , ' Just do me one thing , Emma .
Always look after my children and make sure they 're all right . '
" That he could say that angers me like you would n't believe .
He always said he idolised his children .
Then how could he do this to these other families ? "
Emma adds : " I 'm not sure we 'll ever be able to understand it .
He was a control freak .
And I truly think that a lot of it had to do with his upbringing , not that that 's any excuse .
" He would never talk about his father , who died when he was eight , but he was very protective of his mum .
She was horrible .
She 's a female version of him ... violent , aggressive , possessive and domineering . "
Bellfield clearly needed professional help but he refused to stay in the hospital for more than one night .
Emma says : " He made me come and pick him up and then he insisted that we go away for a bit .
We went to stay
with a friend in Kent but it was all very cloak and dagger .
I had to pretend we were on a caravanning holiday .
When we got to Kent , he would n't let me go home .
" We were only supposed to be going for a few days but it ended up being a couple of weeks .
Still , once we were there he was the old Levi .
He obviously thought he was safe . "
So much so that when the couple saw a television appeal for information about Amelie , Emma recalls how he turned round and said : " F*** ing w****r. I 'd like ten minutes with him . "
On November 22 , Bellfield was arrested for her murder and Emma was left with the heartbreaking task of explaining the situation to their three children .
She says : " My children left the house in their pyjamas and we never went back .
At first , I tried to hide it from them .
You want to cosset them from everything but that only made it worse .
" They were very , very hurt at the beginning .
The nights I 've cuddled them and they 've begged me to see their daddy .
That was when they did n't know what had happened .
" In the end , I told them on the advice of psychiatrists .
And after Levi was arrested I started a diary for them so that they know what happened in years to come .
I never ever want my children to tell me that I lied to them . "
When it came to his own children , Bellfield was a kind and loving father .
Emma says : " After Anna was born , he did all the shopping and cooking .
" He 'd come home with nice cards with things like ' You 're my world ' written in them .
I 've kept some of them to show the children .
He loved all of them .
" That 's why I can't understand how he could do this to these families .
It 's as if there are two different Levis .
" As the oldest , I think Anna finds it very hard .
She does n't go to bed at night , she can't be on her own , ca n't eat properly .
She does n't mention him .
She still loves her daddy but does n't feel that 's allowed .
" But she can tell me every minute of every day how much she loves him .
To the children he is still their daddy and if they want to see him when they 're older , I 'll stand by them 100 per cent . "
Nevertheless , Emma now has to steer them through a difficult childhood and adolescence as Bellfield 's children learn to live with what he 's done .
She says : " I do worry for them .
And if we were still there with him I 'd worry but we 're in a completely different environment now .
I just hope I 'm doing the best I can .
They 're going to have a different upbringing now .
I 'm not Levi 's mum bringing up Levi .
" They are amazingly resilient .
Yesterday Andrew said to me , ' Is Daddy ever coming out of prison ? '
I said , ' No , ' and he said , ' That 's good .
You can't kill people and come out of prison . ' "
And Bellfield never will .
Emma has not seen him since the night of the arrest but had hoped she might see him at the sentencing hearing .
She says : " I did feel a bit uneasy because it was the families ' thing , not mine .
But I admit I wanted to see Levi .
I wanted to have the last look .
For years he's had the look , the laugh , the say , everything .
This was my turn . "
Emma was disappointed but not surprised that he did n't show up .
" It was the only thing in his power left to control , " she says .
" That 's why he did it . "
But if Bellfield can never control Emma again , he has left her a lasting legacy .
" I may be free of him , " she says , " but I 'll always feel guilt for those girls and their families . "

Egg says it no longer wants to lend some customers money Credit cards are to be withdrawn from 161,000 Egg customers who it believes pose an unacceptably " high risk " .
The internet bank is writing to 7 % of its customers to give them 35 days ' notice of the withdrawal .
Cardholders will be able to continue making minimum monthly repayments on their balances but will not be able to spend any more after the deadline .
The move follows a " one-off " review after Egg was bought by US - based Citigroup for £ 575 m last year .
In a statement , the bank said it was not demanding immediate repayment of balances or making any changes to customers ' terms and conditions or their interest rates .
The 35 - day notice period starts on receipt of the letter , which also provides details of how to appeal against the decision .
Risk profile Letters will be followed up with e-mails to customers .
Egg was sold to US banking giant Citigroup in May 2007 by life insurer Prudential .
It prompted the review , which picked out customers considered to have " a higher than acceptable risk profile " .
This will not have a detrimental effect , it may even have a positive effect
Peter Brooker
Experian public affairs director Angela Knight , chief executive of the British Bankers Association , said that Egg 's action was " a sensible way of looking after a business " .
" Whilst it is lovely to spend , it is the paying back that is always the difficulty .
It might seem a bit hard to say to people ' You do need to stop spending ' but it does actually make real sense so to do . "
Peter Brooker , public affairs director of credit reference agency Experian , said the move would not have a negative impact on the credit rating of those affected and could even improve it .
Positive effect " Credit reports only have balances showing as outstanding or settled and a date .
So when Egg updates its portfolio with us , it would just say those accounts have been settled , " he advised .
" That will not have a detrimental effect , it may even have a positive effect , but that depends on the scoring mechanisms used by lenders and the other balances the individual has .
" Some lenders might feel that someone with five credit cards is a risk but someone with four is a better bet and the fact that one card has been settled could be a positive sign .
To other lenders it may make no difference .
You ca n't generalise . "
The 161,000 customers whose cards are being withdrawn had had a deteriorating credit profile since they signed up , according to Egg spokeswoman Rachel Roe .
This could include those who have missed repayments or exceeded their credit limit .
But the description has angered some customers who told the BBC that they had received a letter informing them of the withdrawal , despite having an excellent credit history .
They claimed that by making repayments strictly every month , Egg was not making a profit from them in interest .
Tightening market Gillian Cox , of Farnham , Surrey , said she was " absolutely furious " to learn that her credit card had been cancelled in what she described as an " unbelievable arbitrary action " .
Mrs Cox said she and her husband are " retired , no mortgage , no debts " and " always paid the balance off in full each month " .
She added that she had contacted Experian who informed her that she was marked as having an " excellent " credit rating , " thus totally negating Egg 's claim that this measure is about credit risk " .
Egg 's decision could be a signal of the tightening credit market , with consumers facing more difficulty in repaying debts and cutting spending .
But Ms Roe said the appraisal was the result of an unusual set of circumstances owing to the change of ownership last year .
" There are no plans for a future review , " she said .
Your comments on this story I 'm an egg customer also and after reading this report thought that I would be one of the ones affected .
We regularly max out our egg card through balance transfers .
" Risky customer " you may think , but not so it seems .
I have yet to receive a letter so this seems to bear out what everyone is saying about maximising profits
Dave , London UK I too have just received one of these letters .
I have had an Egg card for almost 8 years and have never missed a payment ( like others here I usually pay off the balance if I have one ) and have never gone over my limit and my credit rating is excellent .
It seems to me that Egg are picking on those who are in control of their finances and therefore not paying them lots of interest .
If they deem fit to remove my Egg card , I shall be removing my Egg Savings ( which has a far larger balance than my Egg card ! ) .
I think this is disgraceful behaviour on their part .
Mary , Edinburgh Egg MAY be cancelling high - risk customers , but they are also apparently ditching those , like me , who pay no interest because we are GOOD creditors !
Its disgusting that they are making out its just the bad ones who are being dropped .
Fair enough if that 's what they want to do , but do n't send a really upsetting letter that makes it sound like we have a bad credit history all of a sudden .
Good riddance to them , I say , if that 's how they treat people .
Trevor Smith , Nottingham I too had the " Your Egg Card has been cancelled " letter .... very rude to put that before the Dear Sir or Madam !
I too checked my credit rating as I was alarmed with the High Risk label I was being given .... NO problem , excellent credit rating !
I agree with other comments , it seems I was not making them enough money as I paid my balance off .
There was also no way of appealing .
I asked when I rang and was given a very curt " No " .
Jane , London I received the letter yesterday .
What angered me most was the suggestion that the decision may have been the result of some detrimental entry to my credit report , causing me to fear that I may have been the victim of identity theft .
This put me to the needless expense of obtaining a copy of my credit report , which of course is fine .
The letter from Egg consisted of a tissue of lies which were merely a smoke - screen for the real reason behind the decision which I suspect is that I do n't use the card enough .
Why could n't they just be honest and say that - but then I suppose the two words " honest " and " banking " do n't sit well together these days do they !
Chris O'Shea , Woking , Surrey I received this letter yesterday , I 'm not sure why .
I 've been an Egg card holder for five years .
I 've always met the repayments and a year ago I paid off my whole £ 2000 balance in one go and have not used the card since .
Perhaps Egg is equating ' high risk ' with unprofitable ?
Chris , London
After receiving my letter yesterday , I checked my credit rating .
It 's one of the highest possible .
I told egg and they agreed that I was a " perfect customer " but they will not reverse their decision .
There is no information on how to appeal in their letter .
Kirsty , London I was notified yesterday that my account is to be closed .
For Egg to say I 'm a risky customer is a joke .
I have a mortgage and a loan which I have never missed any payments on .
The reason they have cancelled my account is that I pay the balance off each month .
That 's what they do n't like .
Luckily I already have other credit cards just waiting to be used so it has n't impacted on me .
It 's just left me annoyed that they treat a loyal credit worthy customer of 5 years like this .
Mark , Sheffield I had a letter from Egg yesterday about this .
My Credit Record is excellent and I actually took out an egg loan 3 months ago !.
My Egg Credit card has not been used for over 6 months and had £ 0 owing .
Some customers are being ditched because in my view they are not making Egg any money .
Dave Ware , Herts
As one of those affected by egg 's decision .
I would vehemently deny that I am a ' risky ' costumer .
I am homeowner who has never missed a payment on his debt .
I can only guess that because my debt with Egg is low ( under £ 700 ) that they deem my account as unprofitable .
For Egg to withdraw my account in this manner is an insult and to label me a ' Risky ' customer in the media is a further affront .

If the European Union has its way , cameras will be placed in the back of every passenger seat on Airbuses , just in case there are terrorists aboard or people suffering from “ air rage , ” defined as a temporary psychological condition caused by changes in air pressure .
“ The Security of Aircraft in the Future European Environment , or SAFEE , project tested a prototype in January using cameras installed in a fake Airbus A380 fuselage .
In addition to the seat cameras , the fuselage was outfitted with six wide - angle cameras to monitor activity in the aisles , such as someone running or lingering near the cockpit door , ” writes Kim Zetter for Wired .
How this surveillance would stop a terrorist is not explained , although New Scientist makes an attempt .
As Privacy International documents , the United Kingdom is an endemic surveillance society — on par with Russia and China — with the United States close behind .
Suspect behaviors include “ a person nervously touching their face , or sweating excessively . ”
I do n’t know if the rocket scientists at SAFEE have ever flown on a plane , but if they have they would realize nervousness and even sweating are common enough for passengers .
“ Much of the computer ’s ability to detect threats relies on sensitive information gleaned from security analysts in the intelligence community , ” you know , the same sort of people who told us Saddam Hussein had a nuke and the ability to bomb New York in 45 minutes .
In fact , notes Mohan Trivedi of the University of California at San Diego , citing research conducted by the University of Reading in the UK , the system requires “ optimal conditions ” and may be thrown off by lighting conditions and reflections in the cabin “ every time someone turns on a light or closes a window shade . ”
In other words , the system is near useless .
Imagine the false positives , the possible chaos , the flight crew thrown into a panic , all very dangerous at 30,000 feet .
But never mind .
SAFEE and the European Union want you to know they are working on a high - tech control grid and after they hammer out the numerous and vexing bugs likewise systems will be installed all over Europe , as the control freaks working for our rulers will not be satisfied with detecting “ terrorists ” on air planes , they want to detect terrorists everywhere , including terrorists who throw apple cores on the ground and put too much trash in their curbside bins .
As Privacy International documents , the United Kingdom is an endemic surveillance society — on par with Russia and China — with the United States close behind .
Germany , Belgium , Poland , the Netherlands and the rest of Europe do a somewhat better job at protecting privacy , although it appears things will change as the EU gets its act together .
As Naomi Klein notes , China ’s Shenzhen , where some 200,000 surveillance cameras have been installed , will serve as the template .
China ’s “ Golden Shield ” will become a “ Global Shield ” of surveillance and repression soon enough .
It ’s all about control , as Orwell knew .

It ’s one of the biggest questions in all humanity : are we alone in the Universe ?
Either way , the answer is significant .
And so , scientists are searching for intelligence out there .
Huge arrays of radio telescopes , like the Allen Array scan the skies for radio broadcasts .
And researchers have also proposed that aliens might be using lasers to communicate with us .
A Russian researcher is proposing another way that aliens might be communicating with us – with neutrinos .
To borrow a quote from the Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy , “ Space is big .
You just wo n’t believe how vastly , hugely , mind - bogglingly big it is . ”
When you ’re attempting to communicate across the vast distances of space , you need huge amounts of energy .
Just look at a star , even though it ’s generating an incomprehensible amount of energy every second , the brightness drops dramatically with distance .
Instead of broadcasting in all directions , the other strategy is to focus your communications towards a specific location .
A targeted beam of radio waves or laser light towards another star still requires an enormous amount of energy , but it ’s less .
To save energy , alien civilizations might not be using radio or optical light at all , they might be communicating in a completely different way , with neutrinos .
Researcher Z. K. Silagadze at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics and Novosibirsk State University recently posted this idea to the Arxiv pre-press mailing list .
His article is called SETI and Muon Collider .
It might sound like science fiction , but scientists are starting to understand how to generate beams of neutrinos – by creating beams of muons .
Beams of these unstable particles can be generated in large particle accelerators .
The muon beam decays quickly into a focused beam of neutrinos that can travel for light years and still remain remarkably coherent .
A beam fired at relatively nearby star Tau Ceti , 12 light - years away , would open up to about 600 astronomical units across – enough to bathe the whole system in neutrinos that could be tracked back to a specific source star .
Finding neutrinos here on Earth is difficult .
We ’ve got an incredible amount of neutrinos stream towards us from the Sun .
In fact , you ’ve got billions of neutrinos passing through your body every second and you never feel them because never interact .
It takes a huge vat of water , protected underground from other radiation and a suite of sensitive detectors .
And even then , they only turn up a few thousand neutrinos a year .
In fact , a neutrino can pass through light - years of pure lead and not even notice .
But there are some advantages .
Neutrino detectors are omnidirectional – they do n’t have to be targeted in a specific direction to “ tune in ” a signal coming from a star .
If the stream of neutrinos is passing through the Earth , we should be able to detect it , and then track back the source after the fact .
Neutrino detectors are also sensitive to many different energy levels .
They do n’t have to scan specific frequencies , they can detect high energy neutrinos as easily as low - energy ones .
According to Silagadze , the newly developed IceCube neutrino observatory being built in Antarctica should have the sensitivity to spot neutrinos generated on purpose by alien civilizations – whether they ’re targeting us specifically , or we ’re just overhearing their conversations .
It has been suggested that advanced civilizations might deliberately choose neutrinos for communications because it shuts out the very young , and not mature civilizations from the galactic conversation .
But give us a few years , and we ’ll be listening .

Friends May Seal Clinton's Fate
WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton is talking as if the battle over seating disputed delegations from Florida and Michigan at the Democratic National Convention is the greatest crisis for democracy since the 2000 Florida recount .
Her rhetoric flies in the face of intensive efforts by members of the party 's rules committee to settle the delegate battle with a compromise that would likely guarantee the nomination for Barack Obama .
Ending the struggle quickly depends on whether the rules committee 's peacemakers succeed in their work .
Clinton 's chances of winning are slim , partly because some of her own supporters believe the contest is over .
They see the clash over Michigan and Florida as futile for Clinton and destructive to the party .
As a result , officials close to the controversy say that even if the 13 members of the rules committee who support Clinton stick with her , they would likely be outvoted by the eight members loyal to Obama who would join the seven neutral members in favoring a compromise .
The most likely deal would seat the full Michigan and Florida delegations but give each delegate half a vote .
This would be in line with party rules , and with how Republicans dealt with the two contested states .
" If we do this right , " said Alice Germond , secretary to the party -- she will be calling the roll at the Denver convention in August -- " everyone will be a little happy , even if no one will get everything they want . "
Germond , a rules committee member , said it is inconceivable the party will not find a way to seat delegations from both states .
" I can't stand up there and say , ' Michigan ! -- oops , only kidding . ' "
Germond added that if the rules committee fails to resolve the issue at its May 31 meeting here , " it does not bode well for our convention , or our unity . "
Because of this , Clinton could see some of her own supporters defect on a rules vote rather than risk a party split .
In an interview , Don Fowler , a South Carolina committee member who supports Clinton , stated his own view very carefully : " I 'm inclined to support the Clinton position , but that 's not a carte blanche . "
Without endorsing rules committee efforts to split the differences , Fowler noted " an inclination to reach a compromise . "
The controversy began when Michigan moved its primary up to Jan. 15 and Florida to Jan. 29 , both in violation of party rules .
The Democratic National Committee stripped the states of their delegates .
Complicating matters is the fact that while both Clinton and Obama appeared on Florida 's ballot , Obama removed his name from Michigan's .
Clinton originally agreed with the party decision , and neither candidate campaigned in Florida or Michigan .
But when she won both contests and it became clear she needed more delegates , she reversed course and demanded that the delegations be seated , a position her campaign reiterated in a conference call with reporters on Thursday .
Obama currently leads Clinton by roughly 185 delegates .
According to the Clinton campaign , her challenge in the two states would net her 111 delegates if Michigan 's uncommitted delegates continued to be counted as uncommitted .
If the uncommitted delegates were allocated to Obama , that would cut her gain to 56 .
In the Michigan primary , Obama supporters urged a vote for the uncommitted slate .
The Obama campaign would like to split both delegations evenly between the candidates , but is ready to accept a version of the half - vote compromise .
This could net Clinton 17 delegates , perhaps a few more .
Clinton also wants to validate the use of Michigan and Florida in popular vote counts .
Without Michigan 's numbers , she trails Obama in popular votes cast in the primaries so far .
The popular vote understates the weight of states that held caucuses and has no formal role in the nomination process .
But Clinton is leaving no incendiary metaphor behind in tying her personal interests to an argument for democracy .
In Florida on Wednesday , she linked the controversy both to the battle for democracy in Zimbabwe and to the disputed election of George Bush that still enrages many Democrats .
The heat of Clinton 's rhetoric threatens to end an informal cease - fire she and Obama have observed in recent weeks , and some Democrats fear it presages a fight to the convention .
It may thus fall to Clinton 's own supporters on the rules committee to force her to accept a settlement .
By picking this fight , Clinton may guarantee that her defeat is sealed not by her enemies , but by her friends .
May 28th , 2008 by Jeff Simmermon
Hey there , visitors — there ’s more ( and much better ) photos of this here — check ‘ em out .
I got another cryptic text from a friend last Friday afternoon : “ Fight Club in Union Square . GET HERE . ”
For those who do n’t live in New York , Union Square has historically been a giant meeting place for political protesters , social activists , and merchants of all sizes .
In the days following September 11th , it was a meeting place for rescuers and mourners alike .
Now it ’s home to a multiplex , Ann Taylor Loft , a Whole Foods , and a Diesel store .
So really , it makes perfect sense that in the inner chamber of Manhattan ’s consumer culture , right there in Union Square , there would be a massive , public fight club .
I was off the subway and taking the stairs two at once , faster than you can spell - check Palahniuk .
Hundreds of people stood in a big ring right there by the Shoe Mania , cheering and chanting .
All kinds of people : old people , moms with strollers , skateboarding teens , foreign tourists throwing Euros around .
They could have been watching some awesome breakdancing group or an unusually good street magician .
But instead , two shirtless guys were flopping around on the ground , grunting and grating one another ’s faces across the cobblestones .
One guy pinned the other and a shirtless ref called the match .
Both fighters leapt up , gave each other the universally - approved one - armed bro-hug and left the ring together , laughing .
A number of shirtless , scraped - up men paced the perimeter of the circle , alternately refereeing and answering questions .
The rules were simple : find a partner , get in the ring .
No face shots , tapping out ends the fight .
No settling scores , just fighting for the fun of fighting .
No experience or discernible skill required .
A couple of emo-hipsters in matching floppy sideways haircuts and matching white belts got into the act , proving that one does not inherit martial arts skill by simply being Asian .
One of them actually SMOKED during the fight , paradoxically making himself look both tougher and more ridiculous .
You ’ll note that a man scooted through the aforementioned fight in a wheeled office chair — this man :
He acted as a combination rodeo clown and Sandman , scooting through the ring to break slow , weak fighters .
But in his own way , he fucking brought it to the ring , too in a simplistic , berzerker style : one hand behind his back , the other swinging wildly , with a small stuffed bird tied to his belt .
If you listen closely , you can hear his opponent yelling “ You keep hitting my NUTS ! ”
Not all the combatants were ridiculous , though .
Most were n’t .
Fighting styles were mixed : grappling , boxing , various martial arts — anything that could bring somebody down .
I spoke with a wild - eyed Marine who ’d learned hand - to - hand combat during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ Size wo n’t help you if you do n’t know what you ’re doing , ” he said .
“ I ’ve seen little guys snap the arms off of big dudes who just want to throw their weight around .
It ’s about practice .
Practice and just wanting it more . ”
I ’m not familiar with many combat techniques , but his seemed to owe as much to the Incredible Hulk as any sort of martial art :
“ Legend ” is petite and diamond - hard man with dreadlocks and a Tyson - esque lisp .
He ’s the apparent ringleader of the Union Square Spartans and claims to teach classes in martial - arts - influenced street combat .
“ We ’re not trying to look pretty in a competition , ” he said .
“ As you can see here , ” pointing to the scars on his arm , chest and face , “ I been in a few fights in the streets .
I can teach you how to handle yourself , how to do what you got to do . ”
He says classes are $ 50 per week , but beyond that , details are sketchy .
Making an appointment to train is complicated .
Union Square Spartans ’ entire presence online currently amounts to a Myspace page that has three friends .
I asked Legend for a phone number and got one that did n’t work .
When I went back to the square , I got a different number .
It did n’t work the first time I tried it , but later in the day it did .
Legend ’s phone representative , a lanky , bespectacled 20 - year old named Wraith , told me that fighters start showing up in the park at around 6 and generally train for a few hours .
When I tried to find out hard and fast hours , I did n’t get hard and fast answers .
“ Call me up at least a day ahead of time and let me know when you want to meet us , ” Wraith said .
“ Someone will come meet you .
A lot of people , they think they can miss a day and we ’ll be there tomorrow , or like , we ’re out here at the same time every day , and it ’s not like that .
They think we ’re not serious about training people .
But we are , we really are . ”
In a matter of time , Legend plans to open up a dojo , but for now , all interested parties can show up in the park .
Being moderately organized and being able to whip somebody ’s ass real quick are not necessarily the same skill set .
Sure , you ’d want a little more overlap , but life does n’t work that way .
The real fighting , among the Union Square Spartans and their peers was incredible , like an actual kung - fu film shot in New York in the early ’ 80s .
People from all over the map fought with whatever they had — spinning , kicking and grappling in a fury of limbs and profanity .
I saw jump kicks , back flips , and this : one man deftly caught another ’s high kick between his hands , grinning .
The kicker snapped his torso , spinning , to land on the previously captured foot while delivering a rib - crushing blow with the other .
In that moment , I would have given a tooth to be the guy that caught that kick in his hands and to his ribs .
I stood there , fresh from work in my 3 - piece suit and cuff links , feeling clueless and amazed .
Like most white guys that work in the tech industry , I ’ve never won a fight .
Unless you count flame - wars on Digg as fights , but everyone loses those just for being there in the first place .
Public fighting is for everybody .
It ’s aspirational – even if you do n’t get in the ring , you feel that pull .
And no matter who you are , you stop and watch .
Street fighting is a million times cooler than anything on TV has ever been , and New York ’s the only city in America where a bunch of guys fight in public all weekend long while the cops watch and approve .
IN 1968 a Chinese - American physician wrote a rather lighthearted letter to The New England Journal of Medicine .
He had experienced numbness , palpitations and weakness after eating in Chinese restaurants in the United States , and wondered whether the monosodium glutamate used by cooks here ( and then rarely used by cooks in China ) might be to blame .
The consequences for the restaurant business , the food industry and American consumers were immediate and enormous .
MSG , a common flavor enhancer and preservative used since the 1950s , was tagged as a toxin , removed from commercial baby food and generally driven underground by a new movement toward natural , whole foods .
“ It was a nightmare for my family , ” said Jennifer Hsu , a graphic designer whose parents owned several Chinese restaurants in New York City in the 1970s .
“ Not because we used that much MSG  although of course we used some  but because it meant that Americans came into the restaurant with these suspicious , hostile feelings . ”
Even now , after “ Chinese restaurant syndrome ” has been thoroughly debunked ( virtually all studies since then confirm that monosodium glutamate in normal concentrations has no effect on the overwhelming majority of people ) , the ingredient has a stigma that will not go away .

If you know your co-workers ' IP address , you can net send them goofy messages , like this person on the Geeknewz boards :
A good prank that I have played on some friends involves the net send command .
What I did was I used the net send command to send a message that said " Microsoft has detected that you have a small penis .
Please consider upgrading for better performance " to other people on my local network .
When you use the net send command in the command prompt , you specify the computer you want it sent to by typing the computer name , it also says on the message which computer it came from , so I changed my computer name to Microsoft , so it appeared , to the technically challenged , that the message actually came from Microsoft .
In case you were interested , the syntax for the net send is : net send computername message

Mr McGee said he had evidence of state - sponsored violence
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has threatened to expel the US ambassador , accusing him of meddling in the country 's political process .
" I am just waiting to see if he makes one more step wrong .
He will get out , " Mr Mugabe told a rally in Harare .
Earlier this month ambassador James McGee warned post-election violence in Zimbabwe was " spinning out of control " .
Mr Mugabe was speaking as he launched his campaign for the presidential election run-off on 27 June .
He also said Zimbabweans who had fled recent anti-immigrant violence in South Africa would be given land if they returned to Zimbabwe .
" Our land is still there , even for youngsters , those who are in South Africa who wish to return to the country , " Mr Mugabe told his Zanu - PF party supporters .
Earlier this month , Mr McGee told the BBC he had found evidence of " politically - inspired " violence against hundreds of people in Zimbabwe .
The diplomat warned the situation made it impossible for the second vote to be fair .
Mr Mugabe also noted that Mr McGee had publicly urged opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader Morgan Tsvangirai to return to Zimbabwe to lead his embattled supporters in the run-off .
" As long as he carries on doing that , I will kick him out of the country , " Mugabe said of Mr McGee , a Vietnam War veteran .
" I do n't care if he fought in Vietnam .
This is Zimbabwe , not an extension of America , " he said .
According to Zimbabwe 's election authorities , Mr Tsvangirai won the first round , but not by enough votes to avoid a second round .
He returned to Zimbabwe on Saturday after more than six weeks abroad .
( CNN ) --
The U.S. military is promising action to address conditions in a barracks at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , after a soldier 's father posted images on YouTube showing a building that he said " should be condemned . "
A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan .
" This is embarrassing .
It 's disgusting .
It makes me mad as hell , " Ed Frawley said of the building where his son , Sgt. Jeff Frawley , had to live upon his return this month from a 15 - month deployment to Afghanistan .
Frawley said Monday that Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Dick Cody called him to say he shares Frawley 's anger and that " there 's no excuse . "
Cody said he would not want his own sons or any troops to return to such conditions , Frawley said .
Frawley 's 10 - minute video shows still photos from throughout the building , which appears to be falling apart and filled with mold and rust .
Paint -- which Frawley said is lead - based -- is chipping .
Ceiling tiles are missing .
A broken drain pipe allows sewer gas into the building , while another one has tissues stuffed into it in an apparent effort to stop the gas from coming in .
Photos from the communal bathroom show some of the most disgusting images .
In one , a soldier stands in a sink to avoid what Frawley describes as 3 inches of sewage water that filled the floor when toilets overflowed .
Watch the run-down conditions that soldiers have been living in »
At times , " sewage water backs up into the sinks in the lower floors of these barracks , " Frawley said in his narration .
" The soldiers have to tell one another who 's taking a shower when they turn the sinks on , or the person taking the shower gets scalded with hot water . "
Do n't Miss Watch barracks in bad condition
Watch barracks in bad condition Watch more about Frawley 's Afghanistan deployment
Frawley said the Army promised to have new barracks ready when his son's unit , part of the 82nd Airborne Division , returned .
" The conditions depicted in Mr. Frawley 's video are appalling and unacceptable , and we are addressing the concerns he expressed , " said Maj .
Tom Earnhardt , spokesman for the 82nd Airborne , in a written statement .
" Our paratroopers are our most valuable resource , and our commitment is to their well - being .
Our actions now must represent the best we can do for our soldiers . "
" Fundamentally , we acknowledge these conditions are not adequate by today 's standards , " he added .
" The images in Mr. Frawley 's video are alarming , and our soldiers deserve the best conditions we can provide as an institution . "
Watch an interview with Frawley »
Officials at the base invited the media into the barracks and acknowledged that there are serious problems .
Earnhardt said the building had been mostly unused during the 15 months Frawley and his unit were away .
Fort Bragg has a massive construction project under way to create housing , but it is behind schedule , Earnhardt said .
The buildings used by the 82nd Airborne are about 50 years old , he said .
Earnhardt said the incident with the overflowing toilet took place the first day after the unit 's return and has been addressed .
Sen. Elizabeth
Dole is among government officials who have responded to the video .
In a written statement , she called living conditions in the barracks " unacceptable " and said the situation " must be immediately corrected . "
Ed Frawley said he is " hoping no one gets fired .
I just want to see it get fixed . "
" They have the slowest contractors in the world , " he said , adding that people in jail live " in better conditions . "

Australia has asked Indonesia to extradite a former Catholic priest accused of molesting his parishioners ' children , so he can face child abuse charges in Adelaide .
South Jakarta District Court began hearing the application against Charles Barnett yesterday .
It was presented with details of alleged sexual assaults against nine boys between 1977 and 1994 .
Soon after the last alleged offence Mr Barnett moved to Indonesia , where he has taught English and runs a clothing business .
While many people question the government 's conclusions about 9/11 , rest assured that the government agencies tasked with investigating 9/11 are confident that the government 's answer to the following questions is correct :
(1) How could a rag - tag bunch of hijackers penetrate the strongest military in history and disable normal defensive procedures ?
(2) How could 3 super - strong , over - engineered buildings become the first modern steel - frame high - rises in history to collapse due to fire , falling at virtually free - fall speed , and exhibiting many indications normally associated with controlled demolition ?
At least the government itself is confident about the answers to these questions , right ?
FEMA admits that its best hypothesis for why WTC 7 collapsed has only " a low probability of occurring "

UPDATE Sep 2015 : After ten years online , this site is getting painful to update and maintain .
To simplify that process , I 've created at auxiliary tumblr site at slide- rules.tumblr.com .
I 'll eventually copy over some of the important things to that site , where it will be fun and easy to add comments and things like that !
UPDATE Dec 2013 : Finally , at long last , you can simulate a slide rule on an iPad !
Bob Roswell over at The Computer Museum has edited the Pickett N3 so it 's usable on a tablet .
The page can be found HERE !
UPDATE Apr 2011 : Timothy Scott has converted the N600 - ES rule to an Android app so it can run on smart phones .
Now the virtual N600 is truly as portable as an analog original .
The app can be downloaded HERE .
UPDATE Feb 2009 : Bob Denny has packaged all the slide rules into a single , self - contained ZIP file , which makes them much easier to use offline .
It 's no longer necessary to separately save all the various elements as described below .
The zipfile can be found HERE .
UPDATE
Oct 2007 : Stefan Vorkoetter has created a great simulation of a Aristo Multilog Nr. 970 complete with a numeric readout of the cursor position !
It 's really useful if you 're unfamiliar with reading the various scales .

Questions and comments from around the world :
Would there be any chance of producing the simulations as freestanding applications , able to operate without access to the internet ?
So that instead of calling up a calculator to do a little calculation , I could call up a slide rule .

Hello ,
If you had the .html file , and all the image files and the JavaScript file in a directory on your computer , then you could open the html file locally and it would run without access to the internet .
( That 's how I developed them , locally on my computer .
Then I put it on the internet when it was done . )
I tried to save the files all at once by doing " Save Page , Complete HTML " in both IE and Mozilla , but it did n't work .
The JavaScript switches some images dynamically , so it fails when you try looking at the opposite side of the ruler .
I tried the following steps and it seemed to work OK : - Save the webpage to a local folder , as HTML only .
- Manually right - click on and save the images of the : - front stator top , - front slider - front stator bottom .
- little end pieces at right and left .
-
Flip the rule , and save - the back stator top - back slider - back stator bottom .
-
Save the following two files into the same folder : http://www.antiquark.com/sliderule/sim/transparentpixel.gif
http://www.antiquark.com/sliderule/sim/wz_dragdrop.js
Now when you click on the HTML file , it should open a browser and have the simulation running , without internet access .
For some reason , IE gives a security warning before you can use it .
I 'm not sure why .
Anyways , let me know if that still does n't work , I 'm glad to help ...
Derek .
Can I translate your page " Slide Rule Calculations by Example " on slide rules to the Italian language , with your permission ?
I 'll refer you as original author ( with link to your page if you want ) .
I am an Italian slide rule collector .
Thank you very much for your courteous answer , E.R. , Italy
Hello E. R. , Yes , go right ahead .
Once your page is done , let me know , and I 'll put a link to it .
( I still have to do an explanation of log - log scales .
When that 's done , I 'll send you an email . )
Derek .
Thanks ,
Derek , for making it so easy for me to demonstrate to my sons how we did math in the old days !
Your site is very math - fun , with the slide rules that are so very life - like .
I can almost feel the glide of the cursor !
Great Work !
D. B. , Michigan
Thanks ,
D. , I 'm glad you liked it !
Slide rules were a great invention , I hope everyone gets to try one at least once , to see how elegant yet powerful they were .
I gave my 3 year old kid an old wrecked Pickett .
He just swings it around now , but I 'm hoping he 'll get the concept of numbers and scales " imprinted " in his mind ... maybe it'll help him with his math when he 's older ( ??? ) .
Once again , thanks for the encouraging words !

The Shuttleworth Foundation has sent out a press release explaining what it believes is wrong with OOXML as a standard , and stating its conviction that the the South Africa Bureau of Standards has a strong case for appeal .
It says SABS expects others to join them in appealing against OOXML as an ISO standard .
If the appeal is successful , then OOXML would be rejected as a standard and would have to be resubmitted , the latter being something the Foundation hopes will not happen , since it believes having two standards for the same thing reduces interoperability .
It 's a matter of due process not being followed , the Foundation explains , " several vital ISO procedures were bypassed " .
And now , by introducing complexity into standards , there is a threat to open access to information , which " impacts negatively on education and citizen access to government services " .
It 's about being able to open any document , edit and save , without difficulties , after all .
Here 's why the Shuttleworth Foundation 's Intellectual Property Fellow , Andrew Rens , believes SABS has a strong case : ISOs policies state that contradictions must be dealt with in the process before any standard can be passed .
ECMA , the body that Microsoft handed the standard over to in running the approval campaign , was afforded the opportunity to respond to international contradictions .
However , it provided no response and it was merely ruled that these concerns would no longer be discussed .
This is against ISO procedures ,  continues Rens ....
 The reason why block voting and other side - stepping of ISO processes took place is because OOXML was fast - tracked through the process ,  he explains .
 However , OOXML was not a suitable candidate for fast - tracking given the immaturity of the standard .
Microsoft itself has said that it will not be able to fully integrate OOXML in the ISO form of the standard until 2011 .
It s simply a broken standard at this stage .
Fast - tracking through ISO is reserved for mature standards where no issues have been raised and where it is possible to hasten the process of rubber - stamping the standard .
In OOXMLs case , however , the standard had not been fully developed and there were many concerns raised internationally .
This would preclude certification of the standard via a fast - track process .
 The fact that OOXML was fast - tracked , and certified , casts serious doubt on the integrity of ISO as an international standards authority ,  adds Rens .
Here 's the full press release : ******************************
SABS leads appeal against OOXML ratification
The South African Bureau of Standards is leading an international appeal against the ratification of Microsoft Office Open XML as an ISO standard .
Document formats seem like a technical , unimportant subject until you can't open an important document .
The role that standards play in making things work is easily overlooked .
But South Africa 's standards body is working to ensure that documents are usable , that software does inter-operate , and it is taking a global lead .
In April 2008 the Microsoft Office Open XML digital document format was ratified by a committee of the International Organisation for Standardisation ( ISO ) .
The standard approval was fast - tracked through the ISO process but it has since been found that due process was not followed in this regard and that several vital ISO procedures were bypassed .
For this reason the South African Bureau of Standards ( SABS ) believes that there is cause to appeal the decision by ISO and is expected to be joined in the process of doing so by other international standards  bodies .
OOXML was introduced as a second open document format .
Open Document Format ( ODF ) precedes OOXML by years and has the same design objective .
The Shuttleworth Foundation believes that introducing complexity into the standards market is unnecessary and threatens open access to information .
This impacts negatively on education and citizen access to government services .
Andrew Rens , Intellectual Property Fellow to the Shuttleworth Foundation believes that the SABS has a strong case for appeal .
 Microsofts OOXML was submitted to ISO as a relatively immature standard ,  he explains .
 As such , several international bodies expressed concerns and lodged contradictions to the standard for consideration in the ratification process .
ISOs policies state that contradictions must be dealt with in the process before any standard can be passed .
ECMA , the body that Microsoft handed the standard over to in running the approval campaign , was afforded the opportunity to respond to international contradictions .
However , it provided no response and it was merely ruled that these concerns would no longer be discussed .
This is against ISO procedures ,  continues Rens .
 In total there were 1027 responses lodged with ECMA and instead of handling these individually , representatives were asked to block vote , ultimately ignoring all of the issues .
This is against the ISO process which aims to resolve all issues surrounding a standard on an individual basis , allowing engineers and other developers to make the necessary changes ahead of ratification . 
Rens insists that these contraventions of ISO process stem from the fact that OOXML was submitted as an immature standard .
 The reason why block voting and other side - stepping of ISO processes took place is because OOXML was fast - tracked through the process ,  he explains .
 However , OOXML was not a suitable candidate for fast - tracking given the immaturity of the standard .
Microsoft itself has said that it will not be able to fully integrate OOXML in the ISO form of the standard until 2011 .
It s simply a broken standard at this stage .
Fast - tracking through ISO is reserved for mature standards where no issues have been raised and where it is possible to hasten the process of rubber - stamping the standard .
In OOXMLs case , however , the standard had not been fully developed and there were many concerns raised internationally .
This would preclude certification of the standard via a fast - track process .
 The fact that OOXML was fast - tracked , and certified , casts serious doubt on the integrity of ISO as an international standards authority ,  adds Rens .
As such , the SABS is the first international body to seek appeal in the case and has begun a process that will lead to other international bodies joining in the appeal .
 Should the appeal be successful , OOXML will be rejected as an ISO standard and will have to be resubmitted , if there is still interest in it ,  states Rens .
 Hopefully if it is resubmitted ISO will follow due process in a second attempt at certification .
However , from an open access perspective we would prefer not to see the standard being reintroduced at all , because that would result in two document standards instead of one with resulting loss of interoperability .
 The Shuttleworth Foundation opposes the introduction of multiple standards for the same objective and , as such , approves of the SABS  decision in this regard .
We agree that there is a case for appeal and wish all international bodies involving themselves in the process success in this undertaking ,  he concludes .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Admit it -- at one point or another we 've all dreamed of being able to teleport .
How much easier and less stressful life would be if , at the flick of a switch , we could whisk ourselves direct from home to work without the intervening two hours crushed onto public transport , face wedged into the armpit of a man with a sweat gland problem .
Is Captain Kirk 's transporter close to reality ?
Now teleportation , long a staple of the world of science fiction -- what episode of Star Trek would be complete without Captain Kirk et al " beaming " off the Enterprise onto the surface of some distant planet ? -- is being talked of as a serious scientific possibility .
More than just talked of , indeed : over the last couple of years physicists working independently in Austria , Australia and Denmark have all achieved a rudimentary form of teleportation , albeit at the quantum level of atoms and photons rather than the macro level of objects and actual people .
" Exact teleportation was thought to be impossible , " Charles H. Bennett of IBM Research , part of the team that first discovered " quantum teleportation , " told CNN .
" Now , however , it is known to be possible . "
Teleportation -- the term was first coined by American writer and paranormal investigator Charles Fort in his 1931 book " Lo ! " -- is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as : " The instantaneous transportation of persons , etc. , across space by advanced technological means . "
This idea of transferring an object or person in the blink of an eye from one place to another -- often across vast distances -- has for decades appeared in books and films , from the aforementioned Star Trek " Transporter " to the Portal Keys and Floo Powder of the Harry Potter novels ( for a less cheerful take on teleportation check out the 1986 movie The Fly , where the process has a very unpleasant effect on poor old Jeff Goldblum ) .
It even crops up in Islamic mystical tradition in the concept of Tay al - Ard , or " the folding up of the earth , " whereby a person is , without actually moving , miraculously transported to a far - off destination by the world spinning very rapidly beneath their feet .
Sadly for sci- fi enthusiasts the work currently being carried out by scientists is not producing quite the sort of teleportation beloved of popular fiction .
Instead physicists -- spurred on by the theoretical work of Charles H. Bennett and others -- have been focusing on what is known as " quantum teleportation . "
A brain - pulpingly complex and , at times , surreal field of study -- one touching upon such knotty issues as the Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen Effect and The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle -- quantum teleportation involves the transmission not of actual matter , but rather of information .
" This whole area is surrounded by a sort of mystique that makes people feel they can't understand it , " says Bennett .
" In fact it is simpler than it sounds .
What you have to note is that in this sort of experiment the atom itself is not teleported , but rather the delicate quantum information contained in the atom .
" In effect you are disembodying the complete quantum state of one atom and reincarnating it in another atom of the same sort . "
Valerie Jamieson , physics editor of New Scientist Magazine , explains further :
" This is not teleportation as we like to think of it , " she told CNN , " Namely an object disappearing from one place and reappearing in another .
" Rather , it is about the transferring across space of the quantum properties of particles , and in particular their spin .
" One way of imagining it is to think of a snooker table with balls on it .
In the traditional view of teleportation a spinning ball will de-materialize at one end of the table and exactly the same ball will re-materialize at the other end .
" In quantum teleportation the spinning ball stays where it is , but its spin is transferred to another ball somewhere else on the table , in effect creating a Doppelganger .
" It is an aspect or a ' property ' of the original ball that has been transmitted rather than the ball itself .
Although to complicate matters the process of transmission would destroy the original ball . "
How is this " quantum teleportation " actually achieved ?
The process relies upon something called " Quantum Entanglement , " a fiendishly counter - intuitive phenomenon that Einstein described as " spukhafte Fernwirkung " or " spooky action at a distance . "
Basically it involves two separate particles behaving as if they were essentially one and the same , even though they are separated by a great distance .
Changes to one particle will be mirrored in the other .
Using this phenomenon physicists have been able to transfer -- or in effect teleport -- the properties of one particle to another , in the case of atoms over a distance of about half a meter , in the case of photons over tens of kilometers .
While not as overtly exciting or dramatic as the teleportation of an actual person , such quantum teleportation nonetheless has enormous implications for the world of computing both in terms of the amount of information that can be stored and the speed with which it can be moved around .
" Although we are still some way off actually building a quantum computer , the possibilities are extraordinary , " says Professor Neil Johnson of the University of Miami's Department of Physics .
" In theory it could contain an almost infinite amount of information , and move that information around at almost the speed of light . "
And what of the " classical teleportation " so integral to the adventures of Captain Kirk , Mr. Spock and Harry Potter ?
Will there ever come a time when actual people , rather than just the particles of which they are made up , will be able to beam from one place to another ?
Charles Bennett believes that , in principle at least , it is perfectly feasible to teleport humans without violating any of the fundamental laws of physics .
Not only that , but , also in principle , it could be done without resorting to the complexities of quantum entanglement .
" Quantum entanglement is valuable in transmitting particles such as atoms and photons where the most delicate properties are significant and where simple approximation is not enough , " he explains .
" Teleporting a person , on the other hand , would not require reproducing the quantum state anything like as exactly .
" Everything we know about biology and how molecules fit together to produce a living being , including the brain , indicates that creating some level of approximation would give you a real person who was a serviceable replica of the original in terms of looking the same and thinking the same thoughts , without necessarily being a perfect quantum replica .
" The teleported person would end up slightly different , but not in a biologically important way . "
The implication of this is that you could scan a person using some advanced form of the technology used to perform MRI scans , and transmit that scanned information somewhere else -- using normal electrical or sound signals -- where it would then be reassembled into an approximation of the original .
" It 's the same principle as a fax machine , " says Bennett .
" When you fax something what comes out the other end obviously looks like the original and contains the same information .
It 's not the same paper , however , or the same type of ink .
" It 's the same , but not the same .
" We already have three - dimensional fax machines , so the basic theory is there . "
What actually happens to the original person when their bio-molecular details are " faxed " somewhere else , and whether your average person on the street would be happy to be reassembled as a similar but at the same time slightly different average person on the street , are , thinks Bennett , moot points .
With each human being made up of trillions upon trillions of atoms -- 10 to the power of 28 to be precise -- the technology to perform a sufficiently accurate scan to produce even the most basic approximation of a living person does not exist , and probably never will .
" What might be possible in theory is , from a technological point of view , blatantly impossible , " he says .
" If you consider all the atoms in a person , and the fact that in the scan you would have to locate all those atoms to within a nanometer of each other , and then have some machine capable of translating that information into DNA , water , fat , protein etc. -- it 's just silly to think about . "
Valerie Jamieson is equally pessimistic about human teleportation moving anywhere beyond the realms of theory .
" I really do n't think it is ever going to happen , " she says .
" Then again , one thing I 've learnt is never to underestimate the ingenuity of physicists , so never say never . "

So you ’ve probably seen this around :
I ’ve been wondering where the smiley came from for a while now ( keeps me up most nights ) , and over the last couple days today I ’ve done some digging to find out its history .
As :awesome : is part of the emoticon set for the f13 forums , I began by asking schild , f13 founder .
driph : so whats the story of the gigantic smiley anyway ?
schild : some guy on something awful made it
schild : some guy on 4 chan made it BIGGER
schild : some guy on neogaf made it small
schild : schild made a tiny set of smilies out of them .
schild : fin .
That gave me a place to start , and further searching on the f13 boards led to this post by Fabricated , referring to the use of the smiley by Yahtzee in the most recent Zero Punctuation :
Um no .
That smiley originated from a Cyanide and Happiness comic , and became a smiley on Something Awful ’s forums long before it was beaten to death here .
He ’s a goon .
Ah ha , Cyanide and Happiness !
I was getting closer , and a random pumpkin carving blog entry led me to the particular comic referenced :
So , the source was found , or so I ’d thought .
This epic thread on Something Awful from January of 2007 , over a month before the comic went up , shows the escalation of the icon already well underway .
Originally purchased and added to the Something Awful smiley roster ( SA has a pay system allowing members to add smileys ) just prior to the above linked thread , it took off like a rocket .
Known as : awesome : , the emoticon eventually reappeared as : fuckyou : and later : iamafag : after excessive overuse within GBS and other areas of Something Awful .
This explosion of popularity led to its migration onto other forums , most notably 4 chan ( especially within / v / ) , where it was embraced with great vigor and enthusiasm .
*** Interstitial !
A couple more web comics that have been erroneously linked as the source at one time or another .
After learning that the original purchaser of the smiley on SA was a user named Whalley , my next step was to get in touch with him .
Finding Whalley was n’t too difficult , and we chatted for a bit about : awesome : .
Still amused at how widespread the whole thing has become , Whalley told me about its genesis :
driph : you originally bought that one on SA , right ?
whalley : that i did
driph : was it a BYOB invention , or did you find it somewhere else ?
whalley : much to my dismay of what i started
driph : I ’ve heard everything from 4 chan to SA to newgrounds , etc etc
whalley : some guy in byob drew it for this tiny little offsite forum he was at
whalley : i ca n’t remember who it was , i have n’t looked at an internet forum for like two months
whalley : he posted it one day though and i went “ THAT IS SO AWESOME ”
driph : nice .
whalley : and well now it ’s the mascot for 4 chan and has infected the entire internet
driph : the internet is a weird place .
whalley : i have come to be afraid of it
There you have it .
Even with potential loose ends to tie up ( who the artist was and the site he ’d originally drawn it for ) , this wraps things up enough for me .
schild was right , : awesome : did originate at SA , and while it was enormously popular there for a while , it was n’t until its spread to 4 chan that things really went nuts .
Peaking in popularity in mid to late 2007 , the reign of : awesome : has not yet ended .
Spend any amount of time in /v/ on 4 chan and you ’re bound to see it pop up , and with its continued spread across forums and exposure to new audiences , : awesome : is here to stay .
…
An update !
Yes , as sleuthed by folks in the comments , the icon ( and several other expressions ) was indeed originally drawn for Pokemopolis .
I recently corresponded with the creator of the smiley , and with her permission , here ’s the story of the genesis , in her words :
I drew the icon years ago as part of an emoticon set he wanted for their new forum software , and I think he showed you all the other ones that were designed along with it .
I ’m not really sure what exactly I wanted it to represent but I think the ‘ ridiculous childish glee ’ that it now signifies is probably close !
I ’m also a member at Something Awful and the first time I saw it posted I did a double take …
I even remember my mind racing as to why and HOW someone had picked up a crappy lil’ icon off a tiny website , and I ’m still not sure to this day …
I assume a Pokemopolis member posted it on 4 Chan .
At that point I thought its posting would be a one time thing , but then I saw it more and more .
It got to the point where I could n’t read SA because everytime I saw it I ’d just be completely freaked out , and naturally I came to hate it !
I hoped every day that it would become bannable to post it , but the next best thing was replacing the VBCode .
I also posted in BYOB in a thread Whalley made saying that I had made the icon originally , trying to get him to divulge where * he* had gotten it from .
Most of SA assumed it was a ‘ BYOB thing ’ which was probably good because they ’d probably want to lynch me if they actually knew where it was from .
I never expected it to become such a widespread meme , and I ca n’t say I even understand why its popular or why people want to make bag pins of it ( Sure wish I could get some commission for the design though haha ) .
It still weirds me out when I see webcomics use it though I ’ve grown used to it now , sometimes I even tell nerdy neckbeard types that my dirty secret is * psst I drew THAT smiley * , which makes them say “ MOAR ! ” or whatever is cool on 4 Chan this week .
Though just for clarity sake my excuse for being on a Pokemon site in the first place was that I was young and stupid .
But that ’s the price of Internet fame !
So there ya go , mystery solved .
ROFLCon conference attendees keep one eye glued on the panelists and another to the projected backchannel screen .
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts – At ROFLCon , the two - day gathering of internet memes and the people behind them , attendees did n't have to wait in line to pepper geek celebs with burning questions .
They just submitted their questions online
and voted , thanks to a custom - designed web - based tool , backchan.nl .
" Twitter is just one kind of a backchannel , " said Drew Harry , the MIT graduate student who first came up with the concept in November 2007 .
" But I think this worked well as a public forum held in a physical space . "
Harry was contacted by the organizers of ROFLCon to create a special backchannel for the weekend 's event .
The Reddit - and Digg - like forum was available online throughout the entirely of the conference .
Moderators and panelists alike occasionally referenced the top eight questions , which were projected on a screen during each session .
A screenshot of the posts voted to the top during a panel about internet marketers .
" We were worried that speakers would get lampooned , " said Christina Xu , a ROFLCon organizer and Harvard undergrad .
" But decided if it was an event about the internet , we needed to make sure everyone had a voice . "
By allowing a constant flow of dialogue with the audience ,
ROFLCon-specific tool helped side step the mob rule that took over during the disastrous Zuckerberg keynote at South by Southwest .
Audience members were able to virtually shout - out proclamations of geek love , ask poignant questions – and even play mischievous pranks .
During one panel , Incubating the Mind Virus , panel attendees furiously began submitting lines of the lyrics to the Rick Astley song
" Never Gonna Give You Up , " voting to get them in the proper order – to
silently rickroll the entire session .
The only real question was – which was more entertaining , the panels or the feed on backchan.nl ?
" I found it a bit distracting , " said Brad Neely , an animator on Superdeluxe and panelist during ROFLCon .
" But I think it was a good thing .
It 's probably an appropriate things to have for a group of people used to multiple forms of communication at once . "

I ’ve been using aluminum foil for more years than I care to remember .
Great stuff , but sometimes it can be a pain .
You know , like when you are in the middle of doing something and you try to pull some foil out and the roll comes out of the box .
Then you have to put the roll back in the box and start over .
The darn roll always comes out at the wrong time .
Well , I would like to share this with you .
Yesterday I went to throw out an empty Reynolds foil box and for some reason I turned it and looked at the end of the box .
And written on the end it said , “ Press here to lock end ” .
Right there on the end of the box is a tab to lock the roll in place .
How long has this little locking tab been there ?
I then looked at a generic brand of aluminum foil and it had one , too .
I then looked at a box of Saran wrap and it had one too !
I ca n’t count the number of times the Saran wrap roll has jumped out when I was trying to cover something up .
“ Credit Crunch ” is one common way to describe America ’s current economic situation .
This basically means that the financial sector of our economy is struggling from a lack of funds from which they can offer credit to consumers , students , and businesses .
The problem appears to be spiraling , as a lack of business credit is leading to lost jobs and lost jobs are leading to more loan defaults that end up further draining what the banks have available .
Student loan providers are facing many of the same problems , and this is on top of the problems they usually face like higher than average default rates among student borrowers .
Federal lending programs are supposed to offset the extra risk that student loan companies take on , but many of these subsidy supports were removed in the last year in response to the peak of profitability that financial businesses reached about two years ago .
Now , a variety of proposals are floating around to restore profitability to the student loan industry .
Ironically enough , many of the plans are many times more generous than the original system that was just last year the target of outrage and accusations of inflated profits at the expense of tax payers and student borrowers .
One plan , backed by student loan companies and some Congressional leaders , mimics the way the Federal Reserve “ bailed out ” the banking and financial institutions : it would allow private companies to exchange risky student loans with the Department of Education for government securities .
While it would ensure that lenders have money to lend , the other effect is lowering the value of those government backed securities , and by extension , the dollar .
This method of bailout is largely responsible for recent , sharp rises in gas and food prices .
If lenders are able to sell student loans to the Department of Education while retaining service and origination payments , the profitability would be guaranteed and the risk would be distributed throughout the entire economy .
Of course , the alternatives must be considered .
The direct federal loan program is attracting more college participation , and although it is known for inefficiency it would still allow any gains made through paid loans to come back into the funding system .
Allowing loan companies to adapt or fail would probably drive down the cost of education , but at the expense of declining quality standards in colleges & universities .
If less students could find loans , schools would be forced to eliminate staff and increase class sizes in order to charge lower tuition that more students could afford .
Many schools deep in their own debt might fail outright .
Its REAL as can be !
tried it a few months ago and thought I saw GOD HIMSELF !!
try it only if you dare !

Toshiba is to put HD - DVD out of its misery .
Reuters confirmed reported Saturday afternoon that it will cease manufacturing HD - DVD equipment , following earlier reports from Japan 's NHK public broadcasting network .
This leaves Blu - Ray as the presumptive victor in the irrelevant optical disk format war .
It now must face up to the real competition : the continuing success of DVD and the growing popularity of downloads , both on the internet and on - demand cable TV .
The end comes only a day after Wal - Mart announced it would no longer carry HD - DVD stuff .
This will go a long way to confirming the view , long - held by cynics , that the mega - retailer always held the executioner 's axe to begin with , and was merely waiting until it was clear which format 's camp had the most densely - stuffed brown envelopes to throw at Hollywood .
Toshiba to exit HD DVD , end format war - NHK [ Reuters ]
( CNN ) -- Mike Mertz was dead .
Mike Mertz says does n't remember a thing -- only what people told him later .
With no pulse , no heartbeat and no vital signs , he lay slumped in the front seat of his Saturn , foot wedged against the accelerator with the car stuck between a tree and a stucco wall in Mertz 's townhome complex in Glendale , Arizona .
He never saw his life flash before his eyes .
In fact , he does n't remember a thing -- only what people told him later .
A UPS driver , Corey Ash , was making deliveries that Wednesday afternoon , when he heard the engine noise .
Sprinting across the street , Ash reached across Mertz 's slumped body , turned off the car and pulled the 59 - year - old from his vehicle .
He hit 911 on his cell phone and started CPR , the way he had learned it in a National Guard training exercise two months earlier .
The American Heart Association says that sudden cardiac arrest kills more than 400,000 people in the United States every year .
This is the worst - case scenario .
If a person 's heart stops pumping blood through the body , and they are n't in a hospital , they have only about a 2 percent chance of surviving without serious disability .
But Arizona cities including Glendale are starting to find that a few simple steps can radically improve the odds .
Less than a minute after his 911 call , Ash could hear the ambulance siren racing from Fire Station 154 , barely a mile from the complex .
When the truck arrived , a burly medic firefighter named Ruben Florez thumped an urgent rhythm on Mertz 's chest , 200 times in the next two minutes , before another medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator .
After 600 chest compressions and three electric shocks , a weak pulse returned .
Until three years ago , Arizona 's success rate in cases like this was no better than most of the country .
This past month , however , physicians in the state reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that a new regimen by paramedics has tripled the success rate , to more than 5 percent .
Among patients whose collapse from cardiac arrest was observed , long - term survival went from 4.7 percent to 17.6 percent .
In a bold departure from standard practice , paramedics in most Arizona cities do not follow the guidance of the American Heart Association .
Instead , they follow a protocol that was developed at the University of Arizona 's Sarver Heart Center , largely by Dr. Gordon Ewy .
Even after cardiac arrest , Ewy said , there 's enough oxygen in the body to feed the brain and keep a person alive for several minutes .
But that air helps only if someone compresses the heart to circulate blood .
In traditional CPR , rescuers alternate 30 chest compressions with two long " rescue breaths . "
Paramedics are trained to start by checking the airway , and insert a breathing tube at the start of resuscitation .
These extra steps , said Ewy , waste precious time .
In Arizona , paramedics skip the breathing step when they begin to treat a cardiac arrest .
They simply alternate two minutes of pumping on the chest -- 200 compressions -- with a single shock from a defibrillator .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : CPR
Epinephrine , a powerful stimulant that jump - starts the body 's vital systems , is given as soon as possible .
Paramedics insert a breathing tube only if several cycles of shock and compressions fail to re-start the heart .
Ewy said the Arizona study , along with studies on bystander interventions in Japan and his own animal research , show that resuscitation without additional breathing is superior .
" In my mind , the evidence is overwhelming right now , " he said .
On Monday , just weeks after the Arizona study was published , the AHA revised its official guidelines to promote breathless resuscitation as the preferred method for bystanders without CPR training -- even as it continues to recommend medical professionals such as EMTs continue to incorporate artificial breaths .
Dr. Vinay Nadkarni , past chairman of the American Heart Association 's Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee , said it is too soon to say whether Arizona 's EMT method is better than the AHA guidelines .
He noted that while Arizona paramedics do n't stop to give breaths , they do insert a device to keep the airway open .
He said the AHA agrees that forceful , " minimally interrupted compressions " are the most important factor in resuscitation .
But Nadkarni said the AHA is committed to what works .
" If there is a way to save lives , and a system can find a way to save a life , the Heart Association is for it . "
Crystal Sorenson , a Glendale firefighter and medic for more than 20 years , experienced a vivid example last summer with the case of 48 - year - old Daniel Lane .
As she pounded his chest , Lane kept grabbing her wrist , struggling to look up .
Each time she paused to deliver a defibrillator shock , " he 'd let go and drop down , passing out . "
A similar story inspired Ewy , who told CNN about a recording of a 911 call he heard several years ago , on which dispatchers guided a woman through CPR on her husband while she waited for paramedics to arrive .
" After a while , she came back to the phone and said , ' Why is it every time I press on his chest , he opens his eyes , and every time I stop and breathe for him , he goes back to sleep ? ' "
Ewy paused and gave a rueful laugh .
" This woman in 10 minutes learned more about cerebral perfusion [ getting blood flow to the brain ] than we had in 15 or 20 years of CPR research . "
All that research , Ewy said , pointed to one thing : " You do n't stop pressing on the chest for anything . "
In Glendale , paramedics are convinced they have a good thing going .
" I hate to say it , but before , you went in [ to a cardiac arrest scene ] , almost expecting that it would n't work , " paramedic Matt Juscius said .
" Now ... it 's almost commonplace to have these guys come down to the station . "
Mike Mertz had a big grin on his face last week , walking in to shake hands with Florez and the rest of the crew at station 154 .
Outside , he shook his head at what might have been .
" I was completely out .
Gone . "
Now , aside from still - sore ribs and a new implanted defibrillator , he 's fine .
" If that UPS guy did n't come around the corner , I would n't be here today .
It was that close . "

Mr. Humphrey , who works in the home improvement division of Sears , has made offers on two homes , but the sellers have refused to negotiate .
He is willing to spend up to $ 300,000 and has enough money to put 20 percent down , but Mr. Humphrey said he was worried prices were going to fall farther and could wipe out any money he puts into a home .
“ I am not afraid of the monthly mortgage payment , and I am not afraid of taxes , but I am afraid of losing the value I am putting in , ” he said .
“ I believe the right deal will come along , and I am in no rush , ” He added
About 35 miles south , outside Tacoma , Irené Foster - Worthy and her husband have received no offers on their three - bedroom , two - bath ranch home since they put it on the market a month ago .
The couple plan to retire to a home they are buying on an island near the Canadian border to be closer to their children .
“ Only about four people have come to see it , which makes it difficult to sell , ” she said .
While some buyers seem to be waiting , many others have been locked out of the market .
Since early 2007 , lenders have sharply scaled back the easy - lending policies that powered the boom .
Most lenders are now making only loans that conform to the standards set by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration , which all require either a substantial down payments or mortgage insurance .

“ Once the credit pendulum starts swinging from too easy , it never stops at neutral  it goes to too tight , ” said Lou Barnes , a mortgage broker in Boulder , Colo. , who said he was turning down about two applicants a week .
During the boom , he rarely had to turn down borrowers .
Mr. Childers , a local courthouse official in Booneville , pulled together a coalition of blacks , who turned out heavily , and old - line “ yellow dog ” Democrats , to beat his Republican opponent , Greg Davis , the mayor of Southaven , a Memphis suburb .
With all precincts reporting , the vote was 54 percent for Mr. Childers to 46 percent for Mr. Davis .
The seat had been in Republican hands since 1995 , and the district , largely rural and stretching across the northern top of Mississippi , had been considered one of the safest in the country for President Bush ’s party , as he won here with 62 percent of the vote in 2004 .
Mimicking a strategy that proved successful in 2006 , Democrats ran staunch conservatives in both this and the Louisiana race , forcing their Republican opponents to attack national party figures as surrogates .
Mr. Davis had been hoping for a large turnout in his home of DeSoto County , where roughly 15 percent of the district ’s voters live , and which is solidly Republican and mostly white .
But a last - minute appearance for him by Mr. Cheney on Monday apparently failed to rally his base sufficiently ; indeed a modest room at a local convention center was hardly packed .
“ There are indications that the normal Republican turnout is just not there , ” Mr. Black said .
“ If they ca n’t win up there , where are you going to win ? ”
Both Mississippi candidates depicted themselves as down - the - line conservatives on social issues , and there was little difference between them on abortion and gun rights : staunchly against the first , and for the second .
But the Republican strategy of trying to link Mr. Childers to more liberal national Democratic figures fell short , as it did in Louisiana .
Indeed , voters here were bombarded by advertisements equating Mr. Childers with Senator Barack Obama , a tactic intended to turn conservative whites away from Mr. Childers and which some politicians said played on white racial resentments .
Mr. Childers , for his part , fiercely resisted the connection , calling himself over and over a “ Mississippi Democrat . ”
For all his recent troubles – his resounding loss in Pennsylvania 10 days ago , his inability to crack Hillary Clinton 's hold on white , working class voters and , of course , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright chronicles – Barack Obama still seems to be winning the battle that really counts : the one for superdelegates .
Harvesting superdelegates is now more important than ever since they will almost certainly determine who wins the nomination at , or before , the Democratic National Convention in August .
And yesterday saw a defection that serves to underline that garnering superdelegates is an area where Mr Obama is still doing surprisingly well .
Joe Andrew , a former leader of the Democratic Party and a native of Indiana , announced he was flipping from Mrs Clinton 's side and now supports Mr Obama .

That switch alone should be an important boost to the Obama campaign .
Appointed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the waning days of Bill Clinton 's presidency , Mr Andrew declared his support for Mrs Clinton on the day she announced she was running for president .
But in a letter to party members in Indiana and in media interviews , Mr Andrew said he was jumping the fence because he felt " inspired " by Mr Obama and he urged Indiana voters to join him in the state 's primary on Tuesday .
In particular , he cited the manner in which Mr Obama has handled the continuing flap over the Rev. Wright controversy , as well as his refusal to join Mrs Clinton and Republican nominee John McCain in calling for a suspension of the federal tax on petrol on the grounds that it is a political gimmick .
" He has shown such mettle under fire , " Mr Andrew said .
" The Jeremiah Wright controversy just reconfirmed for me , as the gas tax controversy confirmed for me , that he is the right candidate for our party . "
He also said that voting for Mrs Clinton , who faces almost insurmountable odds in collecting enough convention delegates actually to win , will only prolong a process that is hurting the party .
" The math [ ematics ] for this is simple , " Mr Andrew told ABC News .
" A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to continue this process . "
If Mr Obama can carry both Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday – he is ahead in the latter but appears to be in a close race in the former – it could be enough to force Mrs Clinton out .
A CBS - New York Times poll offered mixed news for Mr Obama .
On the one hand , it showed him leading Mrs Clinton by eight points among Democratic voters nationally , an improvement over early April when the same survey saw him holding only a three - point edge .
But on the other hand , any notion of inevitability for Mr Obama seems to have evaporated .
A month ago , 69 per cent of Democrats said they thought the nomination would be his .
That number has shrunk to 51 per cent , reflecting the damage done by his recent losses and the Wright saga .
There would be outright panic in the Obama camp if the bumps of recent weeks were translating into a rush of so - far uncommitted superdelegates to Mrs Clinton .
But , to date , the opposite seems to be happening .
His net gain in superdelegates just yesterday morning : 4 . Her net gain : 0 .
Mrs Clinton is winning a few , most notably the endorsement of North Carolina Governor Mike Easley earlier this week .
But in two months , the most recent estimates show that Mr Obama has halved Mrs Clinton 's previously healthy advantage in superdelegate pledges .
Moreover , for the first time he has taken the lead over Mrs Clinton among superdelegates who are members of Congress .

President Bush is poised to change course and announce as early as this week that he wants Congress to pass a bill to combat global warming , and will lay out principles for what that should include .
Specifics of the policy are still being fiercely debated , but Bush administration officials have told Republicans in Congress that they feel pressure to act now because they fear a coming regulatory nightmare .
It would be the first time Mr. Bush has called for statutory authority on the subject .
“ This is an attempt to move the administration and the party closer to the center on global warming .
With these steps , it is hoped that the debate over this is over , and it is time to do something , ” said an administration source close to the White House who is familiar with the planning and who said to expect an announcement this week .
The source requested anonymity to be able to speak on a sensitive matter still under debate .
Given the arguments at the White House over the extent of the action to take , it is not clear exactly what Mr. Bush will propose , the adminstration source said .
Still , Republican members of Congress who were briefed last week let top administration officials know that they think the White House is making a mistake , according to congressional sources and others familiar with the discussions .
Opponents said Mr. Bush could be setting off runaway legislation , particularly with Democrats in control of Congress .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino would not say whether an announcement is imminent .
She said discussion has continued on how to follow up on Mr. Bush ’s call at the Group of Eight summit last year for the U.S. to lead on a post - Kyoto Protocol worldwide framework .
The administration also is trying to head off what it sees as a regulatory disaster .
Environmentalists say greenhouse gases can be regulated under existing rules under the Clean Air Act , the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Policy Act , and have filed lawsuits to try to force action .
The Bush administration and others want to avoid a web of rules and regulations for businesses .
“ The embedded regulatory trajectory that we ’re on is a train wreck , ” Mrs. Perino said .
“ For those who want reasonable and responsible action , it is worthwhile to have a constructive conversation as we work to keep the developing nations in this process in a way that will work to solve the problem without harming the economy . ”
She said the administration ’s discussions , both internally and with Congress , are building toward an expected debate on climate change in the Senate in June and toward the next G - 8 meeting in July , when the U.S. would like to have a more specific conversation about goals for cutting greenhouse - gas emissions .
At the end of this week , U.S. officials will be in Paris for a meeting with officials from other major economic powers , where climate change is expected to be on the table .
Sources in the administration and in Congress say this meeting explains the White House push .
Mrs. Perino , though , stressed that the White House does not expect countries to come to the meeting with specific proposals .
Many scientists say humans are contributing to climate change through increased carbon dioxide emissions from industry , power generation , automobiles and other sources .
Some governments , including European nations , have enacted rules to try to limit their emissions , though opponents say those rules end up hurting their economies without much environmental benefit to show for it .
With Sens. John McCain , Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton , the remaining major presidential candidates , all favoring new controls on greenhouse - gas emissions , Mr. Bush could be trying to lay the groundwork for the next president .
All three candidates are on record in favor of a cap - and - trade system , such as the Europeans have .
The system sets an overall limit on carbon emissions and allows polluters to buy credits from companies that stay below their carbon targets .
The congressional and administration sources said it ’s not clear whether Mr. Bush will go that far this week .
But Brian Kennedy , spokesman for the Institute for Energy Research , said Mr. Bush should realize that the U.S. is already ahead of the Europeans .
“ U.S. taxpayers are already spending more than $ 40 billion a year to address climate change , and to date we ’re achieving better results than the Europeans are under a bureaucratic regulatory framework , ” he said .
“ That should be kept in mind before any rash — or political — decisions are made inside the White House .
Excessive regulations would come with significant economic consequences and additional costs for consumers . ”
Christopher C. Horner , author of “ The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming , ” said the Bush administration should have seen the regulatory problems long ago and that the president is trying to solve them the wrong way .
“ There ’s a way to responsibly do this , but calling for a bill is n’t it .
Democrats — and all presidential candidates — desperately want Bush to take ownership of the issue before he goes , leaving them free of the burdens of responsibility for their rhetoric , ” Mr. Horner said .
He said Mr. Bush should have been spending the past two years pointing out that even as the U.S. reduces the rate of growth of carbon emissions , it is taking manufacturing jobs from Europe .
Nations that adopted strict carbon emissions are facing economic consequences while finding the goals impossible to meet , he said .
“ The U.S. is the world leader in reducing the rate of growth of CO2 emissions while also growing its economy — faster on both counts , as with population as well , than its principal antagonist , Europe , which is suffering for reasons of political ‘ face ’ under a failed scheme that the Democrats and McCain amazingly want to burden us with , ” he said .
James L. Connaughton , chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality , and Keith Hennessey , a domestic policy adviser to Mr. Bush , got an earful Wednesday when they briefed House members on the options the White House is considering .
One person familiar with the meeting said several members , including Republican Reps.
John Shimkus of Illinois and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin , told the White House it was making a mistake if it called for congressional action .
Spokesmen for both congressmen said their bosses did n’t want to be interviewed about the meeting , which they regarded as private .
Steve Tomaszewski , a spokesman for Mr. Shimkus , said the congressman ’s exchange with administration officials was intended to let them know the prospects under a Democrat - controlled House .
“ He was emphasizing that whatever proposal the administration might be discussing would not be received favorably by the majority in Congress , ” Mr. Tomaszewski said .
“ The speaker is pretty much focused on a cap - and - trade , and anything less that you might propose would likely not be received favorably .
Small steps are n’t what they ’re looking at right now . ”

Americans are out of touch with today 's China .
It 's a knowledge deficit that carries more weight in the long - term bilateral relationships between China and the United States than the ballooning US trade deficit with China .
And as China makes a comeback on the world stage , it 's one that the US should address .
Chinese visitors to the US have shared the shock of witnessing a severe dichotomy between how much Americans seem to talk about China and yet how little they know about it .
The US status as the world 's superpower , coupled with its location , warrants people this type of benign negligence .
But what about those experts who have the power to impose their perceptions of China on others ?
All too often China experts in the US cannot even speak the language .
How can they claim to understand a culture without knowing how its people communicate ?
This knowledge deficit accounts directly for widespread and deep - rooted misperceptions about China .
There are three faulty , recurring talking points in the American media .
First , China is a rising power , and a rising power is dangerous .
The first part of this argument is incomplete , and the latter part is misplaced .
China is not only a rising power ; it is a returning power .
China , as a united continental power , has existed for more than 2,000 years .
As a returning player , China is composed , restrained , and mature , just like a former champion returning to the title game after a short lapse .
Also , if history is any guide , Chinese - ruling regimes have not been considered aggressive or expansive ; they were famous for building walls .
This fact alone should call into question the comparison of China 's current resurgence with Japan 's and Germany 's disastrous rising path before World War II .
Second , China is a Communist country , and Communism is evil .
Repeatedly placed upon China by media commentators , most notably CNN 's anchorman Lou Dobbs , this characterization is both simplistic and utterly misleading .
To today 's China , Marxism is as foreign as liberal democracy .
When you look back at China 's past , no alien cultures have uprooted Chinese tradition ; instead , they were either localized , or submerged .
China can still be Chinese without the Communism title .
Likewise , today 's ruling Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) could easily be renamed the Chinese Confucian Party ( CCP ) without changing much of its ideological belief or organizational structure , or even its acronym for that matter .
Both the " ruling by virtue " policy promoted by former President Jiang Zemin and the " harmonious society " guideline proposed by current leader Hu Jintao were derived more from the Confucian doctrine than from the Marxist ideology .
Singling out " Communist " as the definer confuses the reality .
Third , Tiananmen Square in 1989 is an iconic image that lingers in the minds of the Chinese .
American observers ' obsession with this tragic event reflects how deep their perception gap about China runs .
There is no question that what happened that summer was historic .
However , it was a generation ago , and sea changes have occurred since then .
Those who were born in 1989 are turning 19 .
What this new Chinese generation cares about is not the guy who blocked those tanks , but the Chinese Super Girl Singer and Yao Ming .
America 's unyielding interest in Tiananmen is out of touch .
Is the Watergate scandal still the dominant issue facing the US today ?
This lack of updated information about China becomes more problematic in a larger context .
Chinese students are required to study English beginning in primary school .
Students are exposed to both American culture and the Western way of thinking by college .
For at least two decades , tens of thousands of the best and the brightest Chinese students attend American 's top - tier graduate schools , channeling back the most updated perceptions and information about the US .
Although the number of American students studying in China witnessed a huge jump over the past few years , the accumulated knowledge deficits and language barriers are still immense .
This imbalance of knowledge , just like the imbalance of trade , is unsustainable .
With the trade problem , Chinese leaders outlined a " win-win partner " scenario , and American policymakers have mapped out the " responsible stakeholder " blueprint .
However , no strategy will be feasible if the two parties cannot understand each other well enough to weather the uncertainties ahead .
It is highly probable that the next generation of Americans will live in a world where China is the largest economic power .
Are they prepared ?
When and how are they going to fix this current knowledge deficit with China ?

CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - When Ohio ’s Kent State University offered custodial staff the option of working four days a week instead of five to cut commuting costs , most jumped at the chance , part of a U.S. trend aimed at combating soaring gasoline prices .

“ We offered it to 94 employees and 78 have taken us up on it , ” said university spokesman Scott Rainone .
The reason is simple : rising gas prices and a desire to retain good workers .
And while so far only the university ’s custodians are eligible , Rainone hopes the option will be offered to all departments -- including his own .
“ In our office , we have people who travel anywhere from five or six miles to a couple who are on the road 45 to 50 minutes , ” Rainone said .
“ As the price of gas rises , the level of grumbling rises . ”
Regular gasoline averages $ 3.94 a gallon in the United States , up 33 cents in the past month and 88 cents since the beginning of the year , the Energy Information Administration said this week .
The federal government has offered four - day workweeks to eligible employees for years as part of a flexible work program that also includes telecommuting .
But the surge in gasoline prices is pushing more private employers as well as local governments to offer a four - day week as a perk that eliminates two commutes a week .
Staff at Neighborhood Development Services in rural northeastern
Ohio were talking about quitting to find work closer to their homes when executive director Dave Vaughan stepped in with offers to compress their work week .
“ I did n’t want to lose people , ” Vaughan said of the program , which more than half of his 19 employees began last week .
“ In rural areas like we are , gas price increases are more challenging because we do n’t have the mass transit alternative -- we ca n’t jump on a bus or take a train . ”
Eventually , Vaughan hopes to close the office one day a week , further reducing energy costs .
In America ’s struggling automaking heartland , the shorter workweek offers employers a way of rewarding employees when the budget does not allow a salary increase , said Oakland County , Michigan , executive L. Brooks Patterson .
“ By allowing employees to work four 10 - hour days it will save them 20 percent on their commute costs and ease the financial pinch of filling up their cars , ” said Patterson , who last week proposed the compressed week for county workers .
Gasoline prices have begun altering U.S. commutes in many ways , a survey released on Thursday showed .
CHANGING HABITS
Some 44 percent of respondents said they have changed the way they commute -- doing things such as sharing a ride or driving a more fuel - efficient car -- or are working from home or looking for a closer job in order to reduce gasoline costs , according to staffing services company Robert Half International .
That ’s up from 34 percent two years ago .
On New York ’s Long Island , Suffolk County legislator Wayne Horsley also has proposed employees have the option of working four 10 - hour shifts , rather than five eight - hour shifts , saying it would save 461 barrels of oil in a 120 - day pilot project .
“ This is a gasoline - driven proposition and we ’re looking to change people ’s long term philosophies of life , ” Horsley said .
The program , termed Operation Sunshine , will cut gasoline costs for workers who drive an average round trip of 32 miles to work .
It also aims to cut the county ’s energy bill by having fewer employees in the office at a time , Horsley said .
In Oklahoma , a resolution is pending before the state legislature encouraging state agencies to implement flexible work schedules that would allow the four - day workweek .
“ State employees are on fixed budgets and they are not usually the most highly paid in our society , ” said State Sen.
Earl Garrison , a Democrat , who sponsored the measure .
Some schools , including community colleges in rural areas where commutes are long and public transportation is scarce , already have plans to drop a day of classes , usually Fridays .
The school district in Marietta , Georgia , a city north of Atlanta , institutes a four - day week during June and July when schools are out and it is mostly administrative staff who are working , saving on air conditioning and water in addition to commuting costs for employees , said Thomas Algarin , director of communications at Marietta City Schools .
But a four - day workweek brings problems too .
The state government in Ohio is bucking the national trend and canceling an 8 - year - old policy that allowed a compressed workweek .
“ There were just too many vacant seats on Friday , ” said Ron Sylvester , a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Administrative Services .
Scientists in Germany have discovered a new mechanism of infection for the most fatal bee disease .
American Foulbrood ( AFB ) is the only infectious disease which can kill entire colonies of bees .
Every year , this notifiable disease is causing considerable economic loss to beekeepers all over the world .
The only control measure is to destroy the infected hive .
The mechanism of infection ( pathogenic mechanism ) was originally thought to be through the growth of a bacterium called Paenibacillus larvae in the organ cavity of honey bee larvae .
The accepted view was that the bacteria germinate preferentially at either end of the gut of honey bee larvae then make holes in the gut wall and enter the larval organ cavity , the presumed primary place of bacterial proliferation .
In a paper published in Environmental Microbiology , Professor Elke Genersch and colleagues in Berlin explain that they have discovered that these bacteria cause infection in a completely different way .
They colonize the larval midgut , do most of their multiplying in the mid-gut – living from the food ingested by the larvae – until eventually the honey bee larvae gut contains nothing but these disease - causing ( pathogenic ) bacteria .
It is n’t until then that the bacteria ‘ burst ’ out of the gut into the organ cavity thereby killing the larvae .
These findings are a major breakthrough in honeybee pathology .
“ Now that we fully understand the way in which this disease works , we can start to look at ways of preventing the spread of infection ” said Professor Genersch .
Honeybees are important pollinators of crops , fruit and wild flowers .
Therefore , they are indispensable for a sustainable and profitable agriculture but also for the maintenance of the non-agricultural ecosystem .
Honeybees are attacked by numerous pathogens including viruses , bacteria , fungi and parasites .
For most , if not all of these diseases , the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood hampering the development of new ideas about how to prevent and combat honeybee diseases .
Professor Genersch added : “ Molecular understanding of pathogen - host interactions is vital for the development of effective measures against infectious diseases .
Therefore , in the long run , our findings will help to save large numbers of bees all over the world . ”

The president of the United Mine Workers of America ( UMWA ) Cecil E. Roberts announced today that his organization is endorsing Barack Obama for president .
“ He understands and will fight for the needs our members have today and the hopes our members have for a secure future for themselves and their families , ” Roberts said .
Roberts also said that the current administration does n’t respect or value working people , “ Most of all , Sen .
Obama will implement the clear change in direction UMWA members - indeed , all American working people - must have if they are to once again move forward and have a true opportunity to realize the American dream .
After eight years of being pushed aside by an administration which neither respects nor values the contributions American working families make to our society , we are looking forward with great anticipation to a new era in our nation starting with the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20 , 2009 . ”
“ We looked at the positions of both Sen. Obama and Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) when considering this endorsement , ” Roberts said .
“ On issue after issue , it is clear that Sen . Obama will be on our side while Sen. McCain will not .
He cited McCain ’s position wanting to privatize Social Security , and his desire to tax the healthcare benefits of union members and retirees .

I am sure that John Edwards deserves some credit for the timing of this endorsement , because he was the UMWA ’s original choice , but since John McCain is the same old Republican on union issues , it was only a matter of time before they endorsed Obama .
Private sector unions have declined in influence , but they still have the potential play a critical grassroots role in organizing blue collar voters for Obama .
The UMWA ’s endorsement is an important step towards consolidating all of the constituencies of the Democratic Party behind Barack Obama .

Who is Lamont Williams ?
That ’s the question on many a blogger ’s mind since the story about the direct mail and illegal robo - call voter - registration drive broke earlier this week in North Carolina .
African - American voters in North Carolina received automated , anonymous phone calls from a mysterious man named Lamont Williams a week ago .
The voice informed them that they would be receiving a voter - registration packet in the mail , and it asked them to sign and return it .
The only problem is that the mail - in voter - registration deadline in North Carolina had passed , and some of the call ’s recipients had already registered .
The North Carolina attorney general ’s office is investigating the incident , which it says may be illegal because the calls did n’t identify their sponsors and offer recipients a way to opt out .
A D.C. - based voter - registration group called Women ’s Voices , Women Vote was responsible for the campaign , and has apologized for confusing voters .
The anonymous calls using the unknown male persona look especially strange since the voter - registration group has , in the past , used high - profile celebrities to advance their cause .
And everything the group has said about its mission before this week has indicated that it exclusively targets unmarried women .
Consider this price list ( .pdf ) , found on the group ’s website , in which WVWV offers to sell its database .
" WVWV targets only unmarried women , including divorced or widowed women , " the document reads .
" WVWV has used state - of - the - art technology and data - mining and analysis techniques in order to accurately identify these women and encourage them to register and turn out to vote . "
There ’s nothing in there , or anywhere else on its website , about the group expanding to target African - American men .
The group said Thursday that Lamont Williams is the real name of the voice performer they hired for the 20 - second recording .
Threat Level searched the top voice talent agencies with online databases , and did n’t find Mr. Williams .
While the real Lamont Williams is apparently lying low , a tongue - in - cheek Lamont Williams meme is spreading through the blogosphere .
One enterprising blogger performed a MySpace search and found several " Lamont Williams , " and he finally settled on an online suspect .
" My favorite Lamont , one with a clear motive and the perhaps the power to see it through , is Lamont " Action " Williams .
This Lamont is a wrestler from Euclid Ohio who is , in fact , running for president .
‘ Vote Lamont 4 President ’ runs his MySpace headline . "
Could Lamont " Action " Williams have teamed up with " Women ’s Voices
Women Vote , " the reportedly pro-Clinton group that has admitted responsibility for the calls ?
If so , was it part of getting the word out about his candidacy ?
Has Lamont " Action " Williams been offered a VP
slot ?
Regardless of his involvement , I ’m going to take a good hard look at this wrestler candidate .
He may have just stolen my heart , and my vote .
Someone else set up a Twitter feed witter in Lamont ’s name .
His latest update reads : " So what if we spent millions on contracts with people who were on the
WVWV leadership team ?
We trust our friends and family with our money ! "
Previous tweets told readers that they would n’t have to wait for a call from him — instead they could listen to his " dulcet tones on
NPR . "
Another read , " Damn , now I got the law on my back . "
If the real Lamont Williams is reading this , please call me .
Contact me at sstirlan at wired dot com to start the conversation .
No robocalls , please .
Saturday update ( klp ) :
The North Carolina NAACP has filed a formal complaint about the robo-calls .
The group also obtained a fuzzy recording of the call targeting women , which has a different script .
Hi .
Just a reminder .
Your voter registration form is in the mail to you .

Thanks !
Meanwhile , Julia Louise - Dreyfus has issued a statement on the Huffington Post distancing herself from WVWV .
She had shot a public - service announcement for the group , in which she ’s seen sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office set , encouraging unmarried women to vote .
" I am not affiliated with WVWV in any way other than participating in this PSA campaign , and I debated whether to ask WVWV to pull my PSA from their website , " she wrote .
" In the end , I realized the message of the PSA is more important than the actions of some its members . "
Here ’s the PSA .

What actually determines an attractive women 's figure ?
For most people the answer is absolutely clear :
An attractive woman must be above all slender .
It is no wonder than , most women judge themselves as being too big and are not content with their own figure .
Although this ideal of attractiveness seems natural to us , historically seen , this ideal is new and unique .
The modern slimness ideal Before the beginning of the 20 - th century , most women who were considered to be attractive had bodies richly equipped with typically feminine curves .
For instance much quoted  Rubens women are an extreme example which portrays women not only consistent with the social trend at that time , but most likely reflected the personal taste of the painter .
A glance at the paintings and sculptures of the old masters clearly shows that for centuries feminine figures which were once considered to be appealing , would be regarded today as being too fat .
" Three graces " , here in a painting of Raffael ( 1505 ) , a motive popular in the art history which shows the beauty ideal actual in each case at a certain time in the form of three women .
All " grace representations " of former centuries show more corpulent women than it to our today 's ideal corresponds ( see picture on top ! ) .
Researchers have stated that in former times the ideal of attractiveness , or being fat , was considered to be a status symbol .
Only the well - to - do could afford to eat well , while the poor remained slender from lack of food .
However today , the supply of food is abundant and fat has lost its value of information as a sign of prosperity .
To a certain extent , this correlation has reversed : for instance in the US obesity has become a problem of the lower class .
On the left : " Venus before the mirror " ( 1615 ) of Rubens with excessively baroque figure .
On the right : A model after the modern slimness ideal .
If the preference of slimness has something to do with economic prosperity , people should then prefer fatter bodies in economically poorer countries .
And thus it is .
A worldwide study in which 62 different cultures were examined showed that being slim is preferred above all in countries where people do not think twice about their daily bread .
In poor countries , however , heavier women are judged as being more beautiful ( Anderson , 1992 ) .
Also the social position of the woman seems to play a role in body size :
In traditional cultures where women are primarily housewives and mothers , more corpulent figures are preferred .
In cultures where women have more political power and more economic participation and employment , slender figures are preferred .
Barber ( 1998 ) showed that during the 20 - th century this connection also existed in the western world .
The more traditional the women 's role , the more curvaceous was the ideal figure .
The greater the economic growth and the women 's role in the educational system and employment , the less curvaceous was the ideal body .
The waist - to - hip ratio However , the ideal figure is not completely dependent on social influence , but rather derived from a numerical ratio , namely the waist - to - hip ratio ( WHR ) .
If does not matter whether a person is fat or slender , the ideal relation should approximate 0.7 .
This value is calculated by dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference .
Example : 63 cm of waist circumference by 90 cm of hip circumference whiche makes 0.7 .
A waist - to - hip ratio of 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8 ( from the left to the right ) .
According to theory the middle figure with a WHR of 0.7 should be most attractive .
The WHR is gender specific .
Women tend to have a lower WHR compared to men .
Until the beginning of puberty , the relationship between waist and hip is almost identical in boys and girls ( nearly 0.9 ) .
Later the influence of estrogen causes the pelvis to grow in women .
This results in the typical female fat distribution where fat accumulates in the buttocks and upper thighs , causing the WHR to deviate from 0.7 .
In males the hip in proportion to waist remains small ( the ideal is here 0.9 ) .
Devendra Singh , researcher specializing in attractiveness , carried out numerous investigations in the waist - to - hip ratio in the nineties .
He discovered that all winners of the " Miss America contests " from 1920 until the 1980 `s had a WHR between 0.72 and 0.69 .
He also found that playboy 's models WHR was between 0.71 and 0.68 .
For decades the ideal waist - to - hip ratio was consistently 0.7 , despite the changing body weight of these models .
Thus , in spite of their different weight classes the beauty icons Marilyn Monroe , Sophia Loren , Twiggy and Kate Moss all had at least one thing in common - a WHR of about 0.7 .
The painting " Liebeszauber " ( " magic of love " ) of an anonymous artist from the Lower Rhine ( around 1470 ) shows a bride with a figure corresponding to the medieval beauty ideal :
Tight pelvis , wide waist circumference and small breasts .
However , it is not so simple .
Recent investigations have questioned the validity of the magic 0.7 .
In non-westernized cultures the preferred WHR is roughly 0.9 ( in the direction of male proportions ) .
Different WHR preferences have also been found in westernized cultures .
While in the middle ages a more corpulent waist was in vogue , the renaissance and baroque eras brought popularity to the hourglass figure .
It was additionally emphasized by clothing such as corset and crinolines .
In the 1920's , boy - like figures were popular among women and the feminine waist was concealed by loosely fitting clothes .
In the 1950 's the " wasp 's waist " was desired .
From the 16 - th century a tight waist was stressed by the fashion .
The corsage was invented and allowed the so - called " wasp 's waist " by stringing the corsage tightly .
It was followed by the corset , which remained in vogue till late 19 - th century .
A part of Singh's ( 1993 ) stimulus material .
The waist - to - hip ratio was changed here only by manipulating the waist .
However , the hip remained unchanged .
In this experiment the left figure with a WHR of 0.7 was strongest preferred by the experimental subjects ( besides WHR with 0.8 and 0.9 ) .
In addition , the methodology for obtaining the results of the waists - to - to - hip ratio has been criticized .
In most experiments the change did not focus on the WHR , but rather the altered waist size .
If the waist is made smaller , the WHR decreases .
However the ratio would also be reduced if the waist size remained the same but the hip was made wider .
However , it is doubtful whether the experimental subjects would still find a figure with broader hips and normal waist as attractive in contrast to a figure with the same WHR but with a normal hip and narrow waist .
Nevertheless , with the famous experiments of Singh only two variables were changed on the shown female dummies :
The corpulence ( underweight - normal - weight - overweight ) and the waist width ( 0.7 to 1.0 ) .
The role of the bust size However , there 's more to a womans figure than corpulence , waist and hip .
The suitable bust size also belongs to the beauty of a women 's figure .
However , what suits ?
It is also worthwhile to review historical preference :
In previous centuries an ideal womans figure emphasized small breasts .
At first ideal breasts were small and round ( see pictures on top ! ) - in the middle ages the ideal breasts were compared to apples .
Today , however , the ideal figure incorporates a big bust ( especially in westernized countries ) .
It is also fascinating that in previous centuries , the woman needed to be rather youthful - girl - like on top with a graceful bust and with a feminine bottom and upper thighs that were rich in fat .
Today , however , the ideal is exactly reversed :
Now a great bust is desired and is paired with a narrow , rather of a little bit androgynous hip .
The irony of all this , is that back then , like today , both beauty ideals were barely attainable , because they were extremely unrealistic .
Either a woman 's figure has a great deal of fat and her figure is luxuriant below as well as on top , or she is slender and has narrow hips and slender thighs with small breasts .
Today in contrast to former times , there is the possibility to annul the rule of body fat distribution ( either fat everywhere or nowhere ) with which we were born .
Thus it is not surprising that more and more women " amend " their figures with the help of surgical breast implants .
Also , the trend seems to move towards a fuller bust size , at the implants used during the last several years have become bigger and bigger .
Front - runners of this trend is the US and it seems to influence other countries with their beauty ideal , for example in breast size .
In Brazil , for instance , women traditionally had a curvaceous pelvis , a fuller bottom and a small bust .
They were considered to be beautiful .
For Brazilians , large breasts were regarded as vulgar .
However , in the last several years the Brazilian beauty ideal has approximated the American ideal , and breast implants in Brazil have become larger .
Long legs
The last important feature of a beautiful womans figure is long legs .
It 's actually quite obvious , since legs have been artificially lengthened for decades by high heel shoes .
However , although this criteria is important for the general public , up until now , it has rarely been examined in research dealing with attractiveness .
Singh 's investigations did not include legs as a factor and simply faded out this important variable .
In our online experiments dealing with the ideal female figure , we have taken into consideration all five mentioned variables : Corpulence , pelvic width , waist width , bust size and leg length .
Each feature of our stimulus material exists in three variations ( e.g. , broad - middle - narrow ) , and all variations are combinable independently of each other  therefore , there are 243 possible combinations ( 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 243 ) .
Also , we did not use outline drawings , but rather photo material which we have changed with the help of morphing software .
The online experiments of the University of Regensburg are unique because of the realistic nature and variety of the stimulus material and are now available worldwide .
We expect to receive more exact knowledge from the data regarding the ideal figure rather the different ideal figure of different societies .
The first results suggest that there are different ideal types depending on the observer .
a
b
c
d ( a ) the average women 's figure with " standard measures "
( b ) classical 90-60 - 90 - Typ with hourglass figure
( c ) the sportive type : masculine , tight pelvis , but big breasts
( d ) the " Barbie type " : thin , big breasts , tight pelvis , long legs
In addition , the extremely differentiated stimulus material enables to investigate interaction between the various body features .
If a certain body feature is changed , it also has influence on the perception of other features .
Example :
The figures b and d have exactly the same leg length .
Nevertheless , with figure d they look longer , because the body is thinner and has a smaller pelvis .
Just such interactions make the investigation of attractiveness so complex .
You can also take part in the figure experiments of the University of Regensburg .
Test your own figure ideal !
With 243 figure variations your ideal is certain to be present !

Back in January and February , we surveyed you , our readers , to find out what Linux - based products , tools and services you prefer these days .
More than 5,900 of you completed the survey , and your favorites are the worthy recipients of the 2008 Readers ' Choice Awards .
Although some results are predictable , many are certain to both interest and surprise you .
In this year 's competition , we designated only one winner per category , with strong contenders receiving honorable mention awards .
For instance , in the categories where a cluster of formidable contenders followed the outright winner , we designated up to three honorable mentions .
However , if one product clearly dominated a category ( for example , OpenOffice.org with 85 % in Favorite Office Program or Apache with 92 % in Favorite Web Server ) , and the contenders were barely on the radar , there were no honorable mentions .
The developers among you will want us to weigh in on how we dealt with languages .
We created two categories : Favorite Programming Language and Favorite Scripting Language .
See Technical Editor Michael Baxter 's reasoning in the sidebar , as well as the category contents and winners .
Please let us know what you think of our approach .
And now , without further ado , we present the 2008 Linux Journal Readers ' Choice Awards .
Favorite Primary Linux Distribution of Choice Ubuntu ( 37.4 % ) Honorable Mentions Mandriva ( 13.9 % ) Fedora ( 11.1 % )
In the last LJ Readers ' Choice awards , many readers were “ shocked ” and “ flabbergasted ” that the upstart Ubuntu handily took the crown for favorite distribution .
This year , however , there is little surprise that Ubuntu has won again , garnering nearly triple the votes of its most able challenger , Mandriva — supposedly the forgotten distro ?
Clearly Ubuntu has morphed from the “ little distro that could ” to the “ big distro that did ” .
How would the results differ if we asked for your favorite distribution for servers ?
Favorite Desktop Environment GNOME ( 45.7 % ) Honorable Mention KDE ( 42.5 % )
Clearly independent decision making is in ample supply in our community , because ( despite Nick Petreley 's anti-GNOME rants over the years ) GNOME is your Favorite Desktop Environment .
GNOME barely edged out its also - popular desktop rival , KDE .
The result makes sense given that the GNOME - defaulting Ubuntu trounces all other distributions .
However , the fact that GNOME won by just a few percentage points perhaps means that many of you use Ubuntu 's sister distribution , the KDE - based Kubuntu ?
Favorite Web Browser Firefox ( 86 % ) Given our readers ' extreme penchant for tinkering , it 's no surprise that we love Firefox and its ever - growing treasure trove of extensions [ see “ Must - Have Firefox Extensions ” , page 80 ] .
Firefox wins Favorite Web Browser with 86 % of your votes .
But where , oh where , have the very capable Opera and Konqueror gone ?
Fewer than 5 % of you named them your favorite browser .
Honorable mention for most creative response in this category goes to “ All I know is that IE7 is worse than dreadful . ”
Favorite E-mail Client Mozilla Thunderbird ( 44.9 % ) Honorable Mentions Gmail Web Client ( 19.7 % ) Evolution ( 13.4 % ) KMail ( 10.1 % )
Although Mozilla Thunderbird did not vanquish its opponents as decidedly as its sibling Firefox did in the browser category , it had more than twice the support of its nearest rival , the Gmail Web Client , to win Favorite E - Mail Client .
We were a bit surprised to see that only about 7 % of you are still using text - based e-mail clients , such as Alpine ( formerly Pine ) and Mutt .
Favorite Office Program OpenOffice.org ( 85.1 % ) OpenOffice.org garnered a whopping 85 % of the votes to win Favorite Office Program , while competitors AbiWord and KOffice squeaked in a barely perceptible 3 % each .
Nor did EIOffice , a program that has received much praise in our pages in the past , register more than a few votes .
OpenOffice.org has become the de facto default office suite for Linux .
Favorite Audio Tool Amarok ( 40.5 % ) Honorable Mentions XMMS ( 18.1 % ) Audacity ( 12.3 % ) Rhythmbox ( 11.9 % )
Perhaps the most feature - rich audio player on any platform , Amarok has won most of your hearts and minds for Favorite Audio Tool .
Meanwhile , the applications XMMS , Audacity and Rhythmbox each have their loyal constituencies of a bit lesser but similar size , making each worthy of an honorable mention .
Favorite Media Player MPlayer ( 34.6 % ) Honorable Mention VLC ( 27.4 % )
This close race in the Favorite Media Player category may be as much a testament to MPlayer 's legacy to thankful Linux users everywhere as a vote for excellence .
When playing nonfree media content was still a problem for Linux users , MPlayer was there , leveling the field and making sure we could play anything our Windows - using friends were playing and then some .
VLC , a close second , is growing in popularity for its friendly interface and equally adroit ability to play pretty much any format you can throw at it .
Favorite Communications Tool Pidgin ( 42 % ) Honorable Mentions Skype ( 17.8 % ) Kopete ( 12.8 % ) Pidgin , the messaging tool formerly known as Gaim , readily handled all of its competitors , garnering 42 % of your votes .
Pidgin users appreciate the ability to monitor all of their messaging accounts using one tool .
Currently 15 protocols are available , including AIM , Google Talk , Novell GroupWise , ICQ , MySpaceIM , Yahoo and others .
Despite Skype 's popularity , it remains in Pigin 's long shadow — maybe because its closed - source credentials tug at our consciences ?
Favorite Graphics / Design Tool The GIMP ( 76.4 % )
If anything qualifies as a legendary piece of Linux software , then The GIMP certainly has earned that mantle .
Winning 76.4 % of the votes , The GIMP wins for Favorite Graphics / Design Tool .
As for the others ?
“ Ouch ! ” is the collective cry from the other graphics applications , such as Inkscape , Scribus and Blender , each of which reached percentages only in the single digits .
Notable for its absence is the increasingly impressive KDE graphics tool , Krita .
Favorite Digital Photo Management Tool digiKam ( 24.9 % ) Honorable Mention Picasa ( 24.5 % ) digiKam , at 24.9 % , edged out its image - organizer rival Picasa from Google by a mere 13 votes .
Picasa 's excellent functionality is powerful enough to make up for its deficits — its non-FOSS status and Wine - based emulation .
Like its e-mail cousin Gmail , Picasa is an interesting choice given that it is not a Linux application , per se .
Gmail exists only in Google 's cloud , and Picasa is — gasp ! —a Windows application .
Favorite Text Editor vi ( 35.3 % ) Honorable Mention gedit ( 15 % )
Who would have thought that after all these years , the vi editor would rule the roost ?
It beat out every other editor , including Emacs and vim .
Three years ago , it did n't even make the top three !
Go figure .
It is interesting to note that Emacs , KWrite and Kate all scored about evenly , clustering around the 10 % mark .
Favorite Linux Game Frozen Bubble ( 19.2 % ) Honorable Mentions Doom ( 12.3 % ) Tux Racer ( 11.7 % )
It is beginning to seem that no game will ever knock Frozen Bubble from its lofty perch as Favorite Linux Game .
Not only does Frozen Bubble lure you in with its pure simplicity , but also those penguins are just too darn cute !
Doom and Tux Racer , which won honorable mentions , are two more of your favorites .
Favorite Virtualization Solution VMware ( 38.7 % ) Honorable Mention VirtualBox ( 20.4 % ) Given VMware 's meteoric rise during the past few years , it 's no surprise to see it win the gold for Favorite Virtualization Solution .
More surprising is VirtualBox 's showing , the application that a fellow publication called “ The best virtualization program you 've never heard of ” in late 2007 .
VirtualBox 's patron , innotek of Germany , was acquired by Sun Microsystems earlier this year , giving VirtualBox the marketing injection it needed to match its technical prowess .
Wine and Xen fared decently in this category too .
Favorite Backup System Simple Linux Backup ( 25.5 % ) Honorable Mentions Amanda ( 16.1 % ) Bacula ( 16.1 % )
In this year 's competition , we differentiated between comprehensive applications , or systems , and specific utilities .
Regarding the Favorite Backup System category , most of you prefer the no-frills , low - budget approach over corporate solutions — that is , the application Simple Linux Backup .
The open - source applications — Amanda , with the Zmanda interface for server backup , and Bacula , for network - based backup — also got many of your votes .
Backup also is the category in which the most readers roll their own script - based solutions .
Favorite Backup Utility tar ( 35.4 % ) Honorable Mentions rsync ( 22.4 % ) k3 b ( 15.1 % ) For Favorite Backup Utility , the perpetual winner is the workhorse tar , tallying 35.4 % of the vote .
Enough of you love rsync and the CD / DVD - authoring application k3b to warrant honorable mentions .
Favorite Database MySQL ( 62.7 % ) MySQL is not only the world 's most popular open - source database , it 's your favorite as well .
Although PostreSGL , SQLite , Firebird and others registered votes , the competition was not fierce .
It does n't hurt that MySQL runs on more than 20 different platforms .
Favorite Programming Language C ( 26 % ) Honorable Mentions C++ ( 25.7 % ) Java ( 22.9 % ) ' Twas the battle of the Cs in the Favorite Programming Language category , with C taking first prize , C++ landing in second and Java in the third spot .
Do n't see your own wildly favorite language here ?
You would n't believe the number of “ WTFs ” we got when readers did n't find Python , Ruby or other languages here but rather in the scripting language category .
Check out that category 's results , as well as Michael Baxter 's explanation in the sidebar for how we differentiated between programming and scripting languages .
( No doubt we 'll see you in the on - line comments section too ! )
Programming Languages and Scripting Languages
We received a lot of feedback about our on - line survey of favorite languages .
A particular point from this feedback has been why some languages were called scripting languages , and others not .
A criterion was used to decide this , as will be explained .
A plethora of issues was raised in the responses we received , so highlighting some of the issues will contextualize how the criteria emerged for this survey .
One simple way of distinguishing computer programming languages is whether they are compiled or interpreted , which several Linux Journal readers pointed out .
However , even that is an issue .
Java is considered as a general - purpose programming language , but nominally the runtime environment is a Java Virtual Machine .
This is very similar to a variety of scripting languages actually , including Emacs Lisp .
However , Java also can be compiled to native machine code .
So , for the interpreted versus compiled issue , one might ask , “ What kind of compiled ? ” A scripting language could generally be a language that is hosted by another environment .
In other words , it 's “ running on top of something ” , whether that be a byte - code interpreter or , in the case of embedded application use , as an adjunct to another software application .
One also might ask whether the breadth and representative power are obtained by libraries , or because of built -ins to the language ?
Scripting languages also can have object features and work at a higher level , or work more like a dynamic language , such as Lisp , which does manifest typing .
AWK and Python or Perl are arguably scripting languages , but they are quite different in their utility .
One might think of AWK as slightly easier to use than bash , with the particularly nice facet of associative arrays .
But , Python or Perl ( via strong libraries ) are much more powerful , and they are glued to numerous layers in the complete FLOSS stack .
So , the “ grain size ” of a scripting language tends to matter as to its utility .
One of the scripting languages that was omitted in the original survey was Tcl , and this was a mistake .
Tcl is very popular , especially in certain application domains , such as CAD tools , where it is a de facto scripting language .
Similarly , upon further reflection , it might be argued that the general - purpose programming language BASIC that is most in use today is not really a later variant of Kemeney and Kurtz ' 1964 original , but rather Visual BASIC , arguably a scripting language .
However , that language generally does not run well on Linux , and efforts to bring this particular language to Linux have provoked some controversy .
Based on comparative technical criteria , one could make the case that Java is a scripting language .
Its runtime implementation is strikingly similar to Python , though there are clearly very divergent language syntax and semantics in both : Python is much less strongly typed .
The problem is that Java users really do n't use it as a scripting language , and its promoters do n't promote it that way either .
It 's much more ubiquitous in any of its roles , such as middle - ware , for complete applications , or as a standalone embedded platform .
So , a leading clue is that what defines a “ scripting language ” is not necessarily decided along strictly technical lines .
Perhaps the motivating factor behind what determines whether a language is a scripting language or programming language is ultimately how a critical mass of users tend to use it .
Other factors include how it 's promoted , whether it 's standardized , how the user community is responded to with emergent problems or technical issues , and how the primary maintainers allow the language to “ evolve ” where necessary .
A really good way to see this is to compare the number of technical book titles on computer languages and associated libraries or environments in a modest bookstore .
Finally , it was this “ tendency of use ” that was the primary litmus test to assert which language was selected as a programming language versus as a scripting language .
Some respondents have rightly pointed out that this was relatively “ arbitrary ” , and that there were numerous dissonances along the axis of “ compiled ” versus “ interpreted ” .
They are right .
This arbitrariness is borne out , in fact , by the usage patterns seen ; the mass of users themselves really have decided the use models .
Practical and reasonable programmers , in fact , do disagree on such distinctions .
Such divides cut across much more than compiled or not .
A larger divide would appear to be strongly typed versus dynamic languages .
Another would be functional versus imperative .
One divide that seems to be waning is whether object - oriented is good ; we generally seem to believe that it is .
Despite this general consensus , C is not going away any time soon .
C is viewed as the most portable high - level “ assembly language ” there is .
I think a conundrum about languages is benign , and actually good news , because it reflects the diversity of choice and utility .
If the absolute ultimate runtime performance is not relevant to a programming problem , modern scripting languages are a strong play .
One can get more done with fewer lines of code , if compared with starting a program in the C language .
Most are easier to learn and use than , say , C ++.
This may well be a legacy of highly evolved computer technology .
If you believe that “ premature optimization is the root of all evil ” , perhaps using a “ standard ” programming language is one kind of premature optimization .
A lot of careful thinking has gone into certain scripting languages , and very strong compilation software is available to host these languages .
But , these advances in computer science also derive benefit from late - modern hardware technology .
Machines today are so fast that it really is possible to use scripting languages as general - purpose programming languages for nearly any purpose on a wide variety of applications .
— Michael Baxter , Technical Editor , Linux Journal
Favorite Scripting Language Python ( 28.9 % ) Honorable Mentions PHP ( 21.7 % ) bash ( 19.8 % ) Perl ( 17 % )
It 's no surprise that Python grabbed top honors in the Favorite Scripting Language category , and that PHP , bash and Perl all deserve honorable mention for their strong showings .
Favorite Language Construction Tool Flex ( 18.1 % ) Honorable Mentions Bison ( 14.7 % ) javacc ( 12.8 % )
You know you 're reading the right publication when a collective cheer rises up to celebrate the scanner - generator Flex winning a prize .
Although Flex took top honors for Favorite Language Construction Tool with 18.1 % of the votes , its yacc - compatible parser generator , Bison , tallied enough votes for an honorable mention ( 14.7 % ) , as did the compiler - compiler for Java , javacc ( 12.8 % ) .
Although this category registered fewer votes than other categories , nearly 2,000 of you weighed in with your opinions .
Favorite Security Tool SSH ( 29.5 % ) Honorable Mention iptables ( 19.4 % ) Just as it did in the last edition of this competition , the hyperversatile and hyperfavorite SSH wins this year in the Favorite Security Tool category with 29.5 % of the votes .
You also showed your love for the iptables tool for your packet - filtering tasks , which deserves an honorable mention for garnering 19.4 % of the tally .
Favorite Linux Software Development Tool Eclipse ( 29 % )
This year , Eclipse easily eclipsed all of its competitors to win Favorite Linux Software Development Tool .
Although the rest of the votes were widely dispersed among many different tools —
KDevelop , Emacs , GNU autoconf and NetBeans all registered significant vote counts .
Favorite Package Management Application Apt ( 35.3 % ) Honorable Mentions RPM ( 16.5 % ) Yum ( 14.9 % ) Synaptic ( 11.6 % )
One of the main reasons so many of you love ( K ) Ubuntu so much is its sweet package management via Apt , this year 's victor in the Favorite Package Management Application category .
Apt won 35.3 % of your votes .
Many of you also cast your votes for the classic RPM ( 16.5 % ) and its useful friend Yum ( 14.9 % ) .
Meanwhile , a respectable number of you ( 11.6 % ) prefer the Synaptic front end on top of Apt to perform your package management tasks .
Favorite System Administration Tool OpenSSH ( 52.7 % )
The depth of your love for OpenSSH is clear .
Not only did you choose it for Favorite Security Tool ( above ) , but you chose it as Favorite System Administration Tool as well .
With 52.7 % of your votes , it stands head and shoulders above its nearest competitors .
Favorite Content Management System WordPress ( 23.8 % ) Honorable Mentions Drupal ( 21.4 % ) Joomla ! ( 18.9 % ) Competition was tough for Favorite Content Management System , for you love your myriad options .
Nevertheless , your favorite application in this category was the blog publisher WordPress ( 23.8 % ) , which edged out the able Drupal ( 21.4 % ) and Joomla ! ( 18.9 % ) to take the prize .
It appears that the vast majority of you bloggers are gravitating toward WordPress , while the Webmasters are splitting into Drupal and Joomla ! camps .
Favorite Web Server Apache ( 90.9 % )
Rather than offer a Favorite Web Server category , we should just ask “ Do you use the Apache Web server , yes or no ? ” and leave it at that .
Apache wins with 90.9 % of your votes .
Favorite Linux - Friendly Web Hosting Company GoDaddy.com ( 14.7 % ) Honorable Mentions 1&1 ( 9.8 % ) DreamHost ( 9.4 % ) Rackspace ( 7.5 % )
Given the variety of hosting companies available today , it 's no surprise that none of them dominated the voting for Favorite Linux - Friendly Web Hosting Company .
Although the winner , GoDaddy.com , garnered a respectable 14.7 % , the real winner was “ Other ” with a whopping 42.4 % .
Nevertheless , hats off to GoDaddy.com for its rapid rise in popularity — it was absent from our last awards .
Favorite Network or Server Appliance Avocent Cyclades ACS Console Server ( 15.7 % ) Honorable Mention Guardian Digital Linux Lockbox ( 12.7 % )
As with hosting , the voting for Favorite Network or Server Appliance category was diffuse due to the rabbit - like proliferation of useful products in the marketplace .
The top vote - getter at 15.7 % was the Avocent Cyclades ACS Console Server , and following up with honorable mention ( at 12.7 % ) was the Guardian Digital Linux Lockbox .
Favorite Linux Handheld Device Nokia N800 ( 43.9 % ) Honorable Mention OpenMoko Neo ( 23.7 % )
In case you had n't noticed , many of us Linux Journal editors adore the Nokia N800 .
The N800 won the 2007 awards for Ultimate Linux Handheld , and its predecessor , the N770 , would have won the 2006 Editors ' Choice Award for Best Mobile Device , only we were afraid we never talked about anything else .
Well , clearly our readers dig it too , because 43.9 % of you chose it as your favorite handheld .
Keep your eye on the newer OpenMoko Neo 1973 , which burst on the scene and grabbed 23.7 % of the vote .
Favorite Linux Laptop ASUS Eee PC ( 34.7 % ) Honorable Mention Lenovo T61 p ( 20 % )
Is there any surprise that the ASUS Eee PC got 34.7 % of the vote to win the Favorite Linux Laptop category handily ?
Finally , a company created a laptop with Linux in mind and did n't consider Linux as a second - rate afterthought .
It also is nice to see that our readers appreciate Lenovo 's better - late - than - never but admirable effort to pre-install its T61 p with SLED .
This helped the device win honorable mention .
Hopefully , awards like this will encourage Lenovo and others to pre-install all of their laptops with Linux from the start .
If you accumulate the various models from our Linux - specialist friends like LinuxCertified , EmperorLinux and R Cubed , they fared well as a group too .
Who Makes Your Favorite Linux Desktop Workstation ?
Dell ( 30 % ) Honorable Mention Hewlett - Packard ( 12 % )
It was n't surprising to see PC giant Dell win top choice in this category with 30 % of the vote tally .
Dell 's product line has become more Linux - friendly over the years , which shows up clearly in your preferences .
HP gets an Honorable Mention for its Linux offerings , and there were lots of write - ins for various verndors in this category , but they were too diverse to merit a third place award .
And of course , many of you chose a home - brew solution as well .
Who Makes Your Favorite Linux Server ?
Dell ( 21 % ) Honorable Mention IBM ( 14 % ) Hewlett - Packard ( 12 % )
The majority of voters in this category give their server business to the big vendors , such as Dell ( winner of both Favorite Desktop Workstation and Server categories ) , IBM , HP and Sun .
Many readers also like to purchase from the smaller mom-and - pop shops — with too many write - ins to list here .
And , as with the Favorite Desktop Workstation category , many readers prefer to build their own servers .
Favorite Green Linux Product or Solution VMware ( 42.6 % ) Honorable Mention PowerTOP ( 16.3 % )
Because virtualization is such a fabulous and popular way to improve the efficiency of your servers , VMware landed the top spot in the Favorite Green Linux Product or Solution category .
The PowerTOP tool for finding energy wasters on your systems also is popular and won an honorable mention at 16.3 % .
Although many readers earnestly consider energy consumption and environmental impacts in their data - center strategy , we were surprised to see the high number of responses like “ Hummer ” and “ I promote global warming ” .
We wonder with concern , “ How much good science is necessary to convince us of the seriousness of our environmental challenges ? ”
Favorite Linux Book ( revised or released in or after January 2007 ) Linux System Administration by Tom Adelstein and Bill Lubanovic ( O'Reilly ) ( 16 % ) Honorable Mentions Linux System Programming by Robert Love ( O' Reilly ) ( 7.2 % ) Official Ubuntu Book by Benjamin Hill ( Prentice Hall ) ( 7 % ) Practical Guide to Ubuntu Linux by Mark G. Sobell ( Prentice Hall ) ( 6.6 % )
There are so many great Linux books , how can one choose a favorite !
Despite the amazing diversity , your clear winner for Favorite Linux Book is O'Reilly 's Linux System Administration by Bill Lubanovic and LJ regular Tom Adelstein .
Three other books clustered around the 6 –7 % mark , one from O'Reilly and two from Prentice Hall .
Interestingly , several of you mentioned that you do n't read “ analog ” printed books anymore , only digital materials .
Linux Journal Column FavoriteColumn Cooking with Linux by Marcel Gagnï¿½ ( 26.9 % ) Honorable Mention Work the Shell by Dave Taylor ( 15 % ) Hack and / by Kyle Rankin ( 14.1 % )
Looks like Marcel Gagnï¿½ is going to have to be knocked off before anyone knocks him off the award stand for Favorite Linux Journal Column .
Marcel 's Cooking With Linux column , where Linux must be fun and one hand must remain free to fill the wineglass , has tickled and informed Linux Journal readers since its inception more than 100 issues ago .

So you want to know the ancient super secret technique for cutting pineapples that has been passed down through the ages and closely guarded by all who are privy to it ?
Do you think you are worthy of this powerful ancient knowledge ?
Well … ok then .
Sure , why not .
But first you MUST promise never to use what you are about to learn for works of evil against another , such power must be wielded responsibly or else dire consequences will result .
You have been warned !
Aaaannnyyyway … you ’re here ( I hope ) because you have a pineapple and want to learn how you ’re supposed to get into the darn thing , well follow along !
Tools :
Sharp knife
Cutting board
Pineapple
How to Cut a Pineapple
Place the pineapple on its side on the cutting board and remove the stalk .
2 . Cut off the top of the pineapple .
3 . Cut off the bottom of the pineapple .
4 . Stand the pineapple on its side and cut the skin off of the sides in strips .
5 . Continue cutting strips around the pineapple until you have cut all of the skin off of it .
6 . You should now be left with a cylinder of pineapple flesh .
Mmmmmm , yummy .
Depending on how close you sliced when removing the skin you will most likely have some divits left , you can remove these with a mellon baller or potato peeler easily .
7 . Place the pineapple on its side and begin cutting slices .
The thickness is up to you .
8 . Work your way down the pineapple until the entire thing has been sliced up .
9 . Taking a slice firmly in your hand , begin cutting around the core .
Some pineapples have soft cores that can be eaten , but most of the time it will be pretty hard .
10 .
Depending on the knife you use it will be easier to cut by either ‘ sawing ’ or by ‘ stabbing ’ your way around the core , the method shown here is ‘ stabbing ’ .
11 . Once you ’ve cut all the way around the core , use your fingers to dislodge it and voila !
You ’re all done , time to enjoy !
WASHINGTON — For nearly five decades , the United States has pursued a policy toward Cuba that could be described as incredibly stupid .
It could also be called childish , irresponsible and counterproductive — and , since the demise of the Soviet Union , even insane .
Absent the threat of communist expansionism , the refusal by successive American presidents to engage with Cuba has not even a fig leaf ’s worth of rationale to cover its naked illogic .
Other than providing Fidel Castro with a convenient antagonist to help him whip up nationalist fervor on the island — and thus prolong his rule — the U.S. trade embargo and other sanctions have accomplished precisely nothing .
Now , with Fidel ailing and his brother Raul acting large and in charge , the United States has its best opportunity in years to influence the course of events on the island .
George W. Bush , as one might have expected , wo n’t do the right thing .
It will be up to the next president .
Raul Castro is 76 , just five years younger than his more charismatic brother , and since assuming the presidency he has acted as if he knows he does n’t have much time to waste .
In short order , he has repealed restrictions that prohibited Cubans from buying personal computers , cell phones and other consumer goods — items that Fidel feared might facilitate sedition or , at a minimum , promote counterrevolutionary comfort and lassitude .
It ’s true that these measures are largely symbolic — on an average salary of about $ 17 a month , most Cubans ca n’t dream of buying a computer , and in any event the Cuban government still strictly controls access to the Internet .
Likewise , any Cuban who owns a cell phone ca n’t use it without paying the astronomical rates demanded by Cubacel , the government cell - phone monopoly .
But at the same time , Raul has encouraged the first stirrings of debate in the government - controlled media ( which are the only media ) — something Fidel never would have allowed .
Rumors that the government will soon permit widespread private ownership of automobiles , and perhaps even allow an aboveboard private market in real estate , seem much less implausible than they would have just six months ago .
I ’ve been to Cuba as a journalist 10 times , and friends on the island — including some harsh critics of the Castro regime — say that there is real optimism about the prospects for change .
Bush ’s response has been a cold shoulder .
In remarks a few days ago , the president did little but state the obvious fact that Raul Castro is not , and never will be , a believer in democracy .
He dismissed the recent measures as “ empty gestures at reform , ” and then proceeded to make an empty gesture of his own :
He said he would change U.S. policy to allow Cuban - Americans to send cell phones to their relatives on the island , which is something many families already have done .
Raul Castro is not going to transform Cuba into a free - market democracy .
But he gives every indication of moving at least some distance down the path that China ’s leadership has taken , toward becoming a free - market , one - party autocracy .
That ’s certainly not a perfect outcome , as shown by recent events in Tibet .
But it ’s impossible to deny that the Chinese people enjoy far greater personal freedom than they did , say , 20 years ago .
Why would n’t Washington want to encourage Havana to become more like Beijing ?
That would require actual engagement with the Cuban government , though , and Bush does n’t intend to allow anything of the sort .
On Friday , Barack Obama appeared before the Cuban American National Foundation — one of the most powerful and most strident of the Miami - based anti-Castro groups — and said that if he were elected president he would conduct “ direct diplomacy ” with Cuba ’s leadership .
Earlier in the week , John McCain spoke to an audience in Miami and essentially vowed to continue Bush ’s hard - line course .
Obama ’s into - the - lion ’s - den performance may win him some points for bravery , but may not get him a lot of votes in south Florida .
He has the right idea , however .
The United States can attempt to influence any changes that eventually take place in Cuba , or it can harrumph from the sidelines .
Several of Cuba ’s leading dissidents have urged the White House to end the decades - old trade embargo and the draconian restrictions on travel to the island .
Bush pays no attention to those on the front lines of this struggle .
Stubbornly sticking with a policy that has achieved nothing in nearly 50 years is a pretty good definition of insanity .

In the midst of local house - buying manias , the classic mark of the end is when buyers line up to buy a house and bid against each other .
This is the best way to sell a house and the worst way to buy one .
Why do buyers do this ?
Because they have missed out again and again by offering less than the listed price .
The buyers who offered the listed price bought the house .
[ I did this in February , 2005 for my home .
The other family thought that $ 90,000 for a 4 - bedroom house was too much to pay .
They were wrong . ]
Then the panic escalates .
Those offering the listed price get left behind .
They wait too long .
“ Too long ” means more than one day after the house comes on the market .
They hesitate .
He who hesitates is lost in a seller ’s market .
[ In late 2004 , I found a 2 - acre commercial property listed at $ 30,000 .
The normal price in the area was $ 90,000 an acre .
I got there on the first day it was listed .
There was no For Sale sign .
I visited it again the next day , a Sunday afternoon .
A For Sale sign had been up for one hour , I later learned .
I submitted my offer — $ 30,000 ( no haggling ) — on Monday .
When something is priced 83 % below market , do n’t dilly - dally . ]
Then panic appears .
A group of buyers will line up in front of a property before it officially goes on sale .
The list price is merely the minimum bid in what soon becomes an auction .
In an auction , buyers overpay .
They become frantic that they will miss out again .
The presence of other bidders makes them desperate .
They think : “ This is the last time I will be able to buy .
It ’s now or never . ”
This is always wrong .
They are in fact buying at the peak .
This happened in Southern California in 2005 .
It happened to town houses in the Washington , D.C. area in 2006 .
In March , 2006 , this story ran in the Washington Post : “ Median Price Breaks $ 400,000 Barrier . ”
In a year marked by frantic bidding wars among buyers anxious not to miss out on a house , any house , the median sales price for the region jumped 27 percent to $ 419,000 , up from $ 330,000 in 2004 , according to a Washington Post analysis of government sales records for single - family houses and townhouses .
Prices for condominiums escalated even more steeply , rising 34 percent to $ 281,000 .
That was the end .
Toward the end of the article , the report offered this bit of information .
The volume of single - family and townhouse sales during the year fell about 2 percent to 104,827 .
Some of this drop - off may be the result of a slowing market , but some may also be a statistical artifact .
It was not a statistical artifact .
It was the end of the bubble .
In late September , 2007 , the Post reported on a very different market .
Sellers were not lowering prices , buyers were biding their time , and homes were not selling .
In that region of the country , income comes from American taxpayers .
The flow of funds into the region rarely slows .
Federal hiring never ceases to grow .
So , sellers are not desperate to sell .
But they are stuck inside their houses .
Buyers are not being stampeded .
This has not been the case in California , Florida , and Las Vegas .
There , foreclosures are steadily motivating sellers to come to terms emotionally with the new conditions .
When a home owner is forced to move , he leaves his home empty .
That is a tip - off : “ Motivated seller . ”
Then more For Sale signs appear .
The motivation increases .
Sellers rarely admit to themselves that they made a mistake , that they should have sold in 2005 and rented .
They pretend that their home is different .
Why ?
Because they own it .
They think this makes a difference .
But the home is n’t different .
What varies is the degree of desperation of the sellers .
In some regions , home ownership is still sound policy .
But that policy is going to be less and less sound , depending on the size of the house and the demographics of the neighborhood .
If jobs in a recession dry up , real estate will fall .
A WORLDWIDE MANIA IS ENDING
It was not just Greenspan ’s Federal Reserve that pumped new money into the housing market .
All over the industrial West , central banks inflated .
The commercial banks then imitated the United States and extended credit to real estate buyers .
The whole world became subject to the carry trade : creditors who borrowed short to lend long at higher interest rates .
Residential real estate has for a century been the carry trade of preference for lenders .
In the United States , this has been especially true because of subsidized FDIC and FSLIC insurance programs that guarantee depositors ’ accounts .
Now the real estate carry trade is unwinding .
It has a great deal of capital to unwind .
Trillions of dollars and other currencies have been funneled into residential real estate .
New credit extended to this market is going to decline .
There will be fewer buyers making offers .
Housing prices , as with all other prices , are set at the margin : the latest exchange between buyer and seller .
What conceals this is the difference in markets : locations , income levels , and expected opportunities .
It is not like the commodity futures market , where the products are tightly defined and interchangeable .
In Amsterdam , Prof . Piet Eichholtz , a real estate professor at Maastricht University , has been using records of house prices on the canal to trace the rise and fall of booms and busts .
He has traced this back 350 years .
There are few time series more comprehensive in the literature of economic history .
Professor Eichholtz has come up with a non-spectacular thesis : bubbles always burst .
He has studied more than just the price moves on the Amsterdam canal .
He has been following world real estate price movements in recent years .
He concludes that we have been in the midst of a worldwide bubble .
It has now reversed .
We should prepare ourselves for double - digit price declines in housing .
These declines will be even greater in countries with falling populations .
This includes South Korea , Japan and Eastern Europe .
America ’s professors Shiller and Case take Prof. Eichholtz ’s studies seriously .
In 2005 , in his book , Irrational Exuberance , Prof .
Shiller cited Eichholtz ’s work and warned that the real estate bubble was close to the end .
It was .
Prof. Eichholtz ’s assessment is today very grim .
“ There are long periods where prices go up and prices go down .
Over the centuries there is no uptrend or downtrend , ” said Eichholtz .
“ The index teaches that the house market is volatile and in real terms does n’t go up or down structurally . ”
Eichholtz says home - owners have short memories when it comes to big price falls : “ When there is volatility every so often people are very myopic and tend to forget , ” he said .
“ A price fall of 30 to 40 percent is rather common and cannot be ruled out for the United States and Britain . ”
When someone has the bulk of his capital tied up in his home — a consumer good , not an investment asset — and he finds that he has suffered a 30 % loss , this will affect his plans .
His confidence about the future will decline .
His plan to live inside his capital base until his death , with his widow inheriting it and living there until going off to a retirement facility , is called into question by a 30 % fall .
Because this mania has spread to many nations , the slowdown will hit them all .
This is going to hit with varying intensity , nation by nation .
The home - owning public will react differently .
Where the recession is most likely , such as in the United States , the decline will be sharper and sooner .
It has already begun .
Where there has been less speculation and homes are owner - occupied , the decline will be more gradual .
WHEN REALITY INTRUDES
Reality is what happens whether you believe it or not .
Reality is now intruding into the housing markets .
People had better re-think their plans .
A change is coming to the American political scene .
In my April 4 , 2002 issue of Reality Check , I wrote :
Woe to the Presidential administration that gets caught during a temporary interlude when the Federal Reserve stabilizes the money supply .
Leverage then inflicts pain and decreases mobility .
Soon , that administration will move out .
In American politics , the changing seasons are marked by the delayed effects of changes in Federal Reserve policy .
The future is now .
The presidential administration is now on its way out .
It is under a cloud economically .
Bernanke ’s FED gave us tight money policies .
It looks as though the FED has now reversed .
But this is too late to avoid the recession that almost everyone denied last December .
It is going to hit the economy before the voters go to the polls .
They will vote their pocketbooks .
They will demand change , meaning economic recovery , meaning higher price inflation .
If their homes are falling in price , their ability to refinance will be limited if they refinanced within the last three years .
Their equity is lower today : falling prices , more debt .
The use of home equity as a credit line is still possible for people with good jobs , high credit ratings , and lots of home equity .
But this is not the average American ’s position .
In August of 2003 , I reported on the warnings of Richard Benson regarding the coming crisis of the real estate industry .
His warning concerned the inability of the government - sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac to sustain the bubble they had jointly created .
His warning was too early .
So was mine .
But the scenario he described then has now surfaced .
The accounting scandals at Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac erupted in 2004 .
Here is what Benson wrote in 2003 .
Our honest opinion is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are running massive Hedge Fund balance sheets .
The equity base is 2 % , leverage is over 50 times .
The GSE ’s derivative positions are in the Trillions of dollars , and their accounting is totally opaque , and impossible to figure out .
Mortgage holdings of this size are impossible to hedge without blowing through the GSE ’s eggshell thin equity layer .
Moreover , there are serious concerns for credit quality , moral hazard , and simply being on the wrong side of the “ housing bubble . ”
He cited a report from Franklin Raines , head of Fannie Mae , on the rotten accounting procedures of Freddy Mac .
But it was Raines who got the axe .
He announced his retirement in December , 2004 , under the cloud a suspicion regarding accounting practices .
In 2006 , he was sued by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversite , which regulates Fannie Mae .
Why ?
The OFHEO said he had been given payments of $ 84.6 million on the basis of vastly overstated profits .
He had previously served as the head of Clinton ’s Office of Management and Budget .
The leverage problem is still there .
This is being threatened by the defaults in the subprime mortgage market .
The equity of both organizations is declining .
HOW CAN YOU PROFIT ?
In May , 2004 , I presented my case for avoiding a major loss .
I also described how to profit .
I wrote :
Real estate today is an asset bubble .
Rents usually wo n’t cover mortgage / tax / insurance costs .
But real estate can conceal the bubble longer than any other class of asset because it can be occupied by the borrower .
He pays his mortgage on an asset that has lost 20 % or more of its value .
He does n’t want to lose his credit rating .
If it is residential real estate , he does n’t want to lose his home in a foreclosure .
Surely , his wife does n’t .
So , he pays more in mortgage , taxes , and insurance than it would cost him to rent a comparable property .
He is in fact paying an ego premium .
This allows him to pretend that he made an error by buying too late .
Recessions expose such self - deception .
People lose their jobs .
They ca n’t pay their mortgages .
They are forced to move .
This is when the true value of local real estate is exposed for all to see .
The “ For Sale ” signs go up like dandelions in spring .
When real estate prices leap by over 20 % a year in a region , you know you ’re seeing a bubble .
This is happening in Los Angeles and Boston .
It is the time to sell and rent or sell and move .
When the bubble ends , buyers get locked into their jobs because they must pay their mortgages .
They lose mobility geographically , which reduces career mobility .
Buyers think “ I must buy now . ”
They think the market will never stop rising .
But prices always do stop rising .
There is always a hard - pressed seller who has to walk away from ownership .
You buy the other guy ’s mistake .
You shop for mistakes .
I was a year early .
But , generally speaking , the person in Los Angeles or Boston who did what I said is ahead of the game today .
If he has equity money in reserve , he is going to be able to buy at substantial discount before this cycle is over .
CONCLUSION
Optimists think this housing market is going to reverse in 2009 .
I am not among them .
This is an international phenomenon .
The decline in on - paper wealth is going to shake the confidence of hundreds of millions of home owners .
I suggest that you prepare for an international economic slowdown .
The people who thought they were real estate rich are going to face a new reality : rising property taxes , rising expenses , rising utility bills , and declining equity .
This is not the scenario for bull market investing .

MARCH 6-- In what is surely a first for the federal judiciary , a Texas bankruptcy judge has quoted from the Adam Sandler film canon in a recent opinion .
Dismissing a motion due to ' incomprehensibility , ' Judge Leif Clark cited a scene from ' Billy Madison , ' Sandler 's 1995 comedy , in a footnote to a February 21 court order .
' Deciphering motions like the one presented here wastes valuable chamber staff time , and invites this sort of footnote , ' wrote a miffed Clark .
Lawyers practicing before the 58 - year - old jurist , who presides over cases in San Antonio , should tread lightly or Clark might again dip into the Sandler oeuvre for another stinging rebuke .
' Hey , old man river , zip it or I will break your hip , ' from ' Big Daddy ' might work .
Or perhaps the classic ' Happy Gilmore ' line , delivered by Sandler as he pummeled TV game show host Bob Barker : ' The price is wrong , bitch . ' ( 2 pages )
DENVER ( AP ) --
The lovable losers ' 10,000th win was a memorable one , filled with blown leads , big hits , great catches and , lastly , high - fives all around .
The Chicago Cubs beat the Colorado Rockies 7 - 6 on Ryan Theriot 's RBI single off Kip Wells with two outs in the 10th inning Wednesday night for their sixth straight win .
Chicago has n't won a World Series in a century , and truly significant wins in that time have been rare , but the current Cubs had fun being a part of this one .
" It was a tough first 10,000 wins , " Theriot said with a chuckle .
" I hope the next 10,000 are easier . "
" Really , I did n't remember a lot about the first 9,000 , " cracked Kerry Wood , who got what Theriot termed " a cool benchmark " win as the Cubs improved to 15 - 6 for just the fourth time in the last 100 years .
Both teams blew ninth - inning leads with their closers , but it was the Rockies who ended up losing their fourth straight game when leading after seven innings .
Theriot 's single to right field scored pinch - runner Mike Fontenot from second base as the Cubs joined the Giants as the only franchises in major league history to reach 10,000 wins .
Carlos Marmol pitched a perfect 10th for his second save in as many chances .
Aramis Ramirez hit a two - run homer off struggling Colorado closer Manny Corpas with one out in the ninth to put the Cubs ahead 6 - 5 , but Ryan Spilborghs tripled home the tying run off
Wood with two outs in the bottom half .
Wood ( 2 - 0 ) struck out Clint Barmes to strand the winning run at third , then picked up the win when the Cubs rallied off Wells ( 1 - 1 ) .
" We 've been picking each other up all year , " Wood said .
" That 's why we are in the position we 're in .
It 's somebody different every night .
... I do n't think we could predict the way we were going to be swinging the bats right now .
I do n't think we have more than one guy in the lineup hitting under .300 . "
And that 's Ramirez , who went 2 - for - 5 to raise his average to .287 .
Corpas blew his second straight save and fourth in eight chances just hours after his manager gave him a vote of confidence .
Last year , he converted 19 - of - 20 saves , then signed a big contract over the winter .
Clint Hurdle might be pondering a switch now , but he was n't ready to reveal anything just yet .
" I 'll talk to the player first , " he said .
" I need to think things through , talk to the people I need to talk to , have a conversation , and when we make a decision we 'll let you guys know right away . "
The Rockies have a proven alternative in $ 5 million set - up man Brian Fuentes , who lost his closer job to Corpas last summer when he blew four straight saves just after he was voted to his third straight All - Star Game .
Asked about the possibility of losing his job , Corpas said it 's up to the manager , that he 's just in a funk and has no faith in his slider , which is what he left up and over the plate to Ramirez when he was trying to get him to chase a pitch off the plate .
Before the game , Hurdle was adamant he was n't going to juggle his bullpen like he did his infield a night earlier , when slumping shortstop Troy Tulowitzki did n't start .
Tulowitzki returned to the lineup Wednesday night but was moved from second in the batting order to seventh .
He broke out of a 1 - for - 19 slump with a three - run homer that capped a five - run rally and erased Chicago 's 3 - 0 lead in the sixth .
" I definitely took some better swings tonight .
We came out on the losing end , that 's the main thing .
It 's still bothersome , " Tulowitzki said .
Barmes homered off starter Rich Hill leading off the sixth , and Michael Wuertz came in after Hill walked the next batter .
Matt Holliday and Garrett Atkins hit back - to - back singles off Wuertz , making it 3 - 2 .
One out later , Jon Lieber came in to face Tulowitzki .
With the crowd chanting " Tulo ! " the slumping shortstop sent a 1 - 1 slider over the left - field wall for his first homer of the season .
The Cubs pulled to 5 - 4 in the seventh when Taylor Buchholz surrendered an RBI single to Ramirez .
The Cubs took a 3 - 0 lead on Mark DeRosa 's sacrifice fly , Geovany Soto 's solo homer and Ramirez 's RBI double , all off Franklin Morales , who allowed three earned runs on eight hits in six innings .
Hill surrendered two earned runs on three hits in five innings .
" It 's obviously tough any time you lose leads late , " Tulowitzki said .
" It makes it extra tough .
I remember we went through a stretch last year where we did the same kind of thing and ended up all right .
At least we know we can still be OK . "
Game notes
The Cubs are 4 - 1 in extra innings , including 4 - 0 on the road .
... Chicago also started 15 - 6 in 1932 , '69 and ' 75 .

Citing Barack Obama ’s advocacy for unions and veterans ’ issues , Wyoming Democratic Party Vice Chair Nancy Drummond endorsed Obama today .
“ His position on education , his work with senior citizens and his advocacy for union members and veterans make me proud to support Senator Obama , ” Drummond said .
She explained why veterans ’ issues are so important to her , “ My husband was a Marine during Vietnam — he was one of many vets that has VA Benefits .
The men and women in the military and their families are giving the ultimate sacrifice now and I support Senator Obama ’s plan to honor their service by improving their healthcare , taking care of issues related to combat duty and caring for our homeless vets . ”
She also said that as an official of the Democratic Party in her state , her endorsement is following the will of the voters , “ At both our caucuses and our State Convention , the majority said they want Senator Obama to be our Candidate to run for President .
So with that being said , while I certainly respect and admire Senator Clinton ’s tenacity , I have proudly decided to endorse Senator Barack Obama . ”

Her endorsement raises an interesting point , for all of McCain ’s tough talk about the military he has rarely backed it up by advocating the kind of support system that vets need when they come home .
McCain argues that more aid for vets is too expensive , but what I think this position illustrates is that McCain is only concerned about those who serve in the military , while they are serving .
As a veteran himself , this is a strange position to take .
I look for Obama to hit McCain hard on vets ’ issues throughout the fall .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The FBI gave outdated , incomplete and inaccurate information about terror suspects to be added to the government 's watchlist for nearly three years despite steps taken to prevent errors , a Justice Department audit concludes .
Responding , an FBI spokesman said gaps identified in the system should be fixed within six months .
Overall , the audit released Monday by Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine gave the FBI a mixed review for its process of submitting an estimated 8,000 names and other data to the terror watchlist that is compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies .
It found that the FBI has proper training and other internal controls in place to help make sure names of suspected terrorists were accurately added to the list .
However , Fine 's report rapped the FBI for failing to consistently pass along newly discovered information about people on the watchlist , or to remove those who were no longer deemed a threat .
" We found that the FBI was not always providing updated nominations when new information became known about a nominated individual , " the audit concluded .
" We also found that the FBI was not always removing records from the watchlist when it was appropriate to do so .
" Moreover , FBI headquarters officials reported that watchlist nomination submissions from field offices were often incomplete or contained inaccuracies , which caused delays in the processing of nominations , " the audit concluded .
Between January 2005 and November 2007 , the FBI processed the names of 8,240 suspects who were nominated to be added to the terror watchlist , the audit found .
At times , FBI agents in field offices nominated terror suspects to be included on the list without first checking with FBI headquarters in Washington — preventing a thorough review .
In a statement , FBI Assistant Director John Miller said the FBI has begun changing the way it submits names of international and domestic terror suspects to make the nomination process easier and more efficient for agents .
He said many of the problems identified in Fine 's review should be fixed within six months .
" We will always strive for continued improvement in the conduct of FBI task force coordination and watchlisting process , " Miller said .
" We remain committed to working with the Department of Justice to increase coordination and to find best practices aimed at providing service and safety for our nation . "
The FBI is the only Justice Department agency that can directly choose names to be included on the watchlist .
Other agencies that have that authority include the departments of Homeland Security , State , Treasury , Defense and the CIA .
However , Fine 's office found that other Justice agencies that can refer watchlist data to the FBI generally do so on an informal basis — resulting in omissions .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , for example , " did not categorize criminal activity as being terrorism - related in a manner similar to the FBI , most notably in cases of domestic terrorism , " the audit found .
" As a result , the potential exists for terrorism information to not be shared with the FBI and for terrorists to not be watchlisted . "

It has been claimed that smoothies are good for health Dentists have warned the current popularity of fruit smoothies could lead to widespread tooth damage .
It was claimed last week that the fruit drinks could be twice as healthy as first thought .
But dentists warn that the beneficial effects of boosting consumption of fruit are likely to be far outweighed by damage the drinks cause to teeth .
They warn that the high levels of sugar in the drinks can promote decay without good dental hygiene .
Every time you sip on a fruit smoothie your teeth are placed under acid attack for up to an hour
Dr Nigel Carter
British Dental Health Foundation Dr Nigel Carter , chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation , said : " Fruit smoothies are becoming increasingly popular and the fruit content can make them seem like a good idea .
" However , they contain very high levels of sugar and acid and so can do a lot of damage to the teeth . "
Serious disease Dr Carter said research had linked poor dental hygiene and tooth decay to a range of serious health conditions , such as heart disease , respiratory disease , and diabates .
However , a survey of 1,000 people conducted by the British Dental Health Foundation and the company Oral B found more than 30 % of people think fruit smoothies are actually good for the teeth .
Dr Carter said : " While fruit smoothies can be a good way to get people to consume more fruit , the high concentration of sugar and acids means that they can do real damage to the teeth if sipped throughout the day .
" Every time you sip on a fruit smoothie your teeth are placed under acid attack for up to an hour , so constantly sipping on these drinks can cause the protective enamel to erode , causing pain and sensitivity .
It can also lead to decay . "
Dentists advise the best policy is to brush your teeth before drinking fruit juice , as this helps protect against the damaging effect of the acid contained in the juice .
Brushing immediately after drinking juice can cause damage as the tooth enamel can be weakened by the acid content .
Bad habits
The survey found that many people engage in very poor dental habits , with a significant number admitting to using every day items such as hammers , screwdrivers , scissors and lollipop sticks to pick food from between their teeth - risking cuts and infection .
More than a quarter ( 27 % ) of respondants said they had opened a bottle with their teeth .
More than one in ten ( 13 % ) of respondants admitted to flossing their teeth while driving .
Dr Carter said : " People are putting themselves at risk with these shocking habits - yet around 85 % of people are completely unaware of the link between the health of the mouth and the health of the body . "
" Gum health , in particular , is very important and has been linked to a range of conditions .
However , people are risking their gum health by picking and flossing without paying the necessary care and attention . "

What are these ?
Ambassador Craig Hawke delivered his speech in person , inside the General Assembly Hall in New York , noting that to defeat the coronavirus , “ we will ...
If you put Microsoft at the center of your home entertainment system , be prepared to hand them the remote control , literally .
Following reports that digital television viewers were blocked from recording the new season of NBC's " Gladiators " , Microsoft confirmed that it is preventing users from recording the show .
They claim they were acting on behalf of NBC , and are in line with regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , in disrupting computer usage based upon the so - called " broadcast flag " that was transmitted alongside the show .
A Microsoft spokesperson told CNET News , " ... Windows Media Center fully adheres to the flags used by broadcasters and content owners to determine how their content is distributed and consumed . "
What is the broadcast flag ?
The broadcast flag is a sequence of information transmitted alongside television programs as a kind of digital order telling viewers to not do certain things , such as record the show or share it with a friend .
Many of the large media companies and the FCC tried to make obeying the broadcast flag a law .
However , the Electronic Frontier Foundation took the FCC to court , and US Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority , and that no such law could exist .
Despite this ruling , it appears that Microsoft has decided to work directly with media companies to implement these rules anyway , restricting how and when you watch television .
Building such a system is no trivial task .
To do this , Microsoft has gone to great lengths to restrict users from saving a television program to their computers , we call this kind of functionality an " antifeature , " because it takes more work for Microsoft to prevent the user from saving the program , than if they were to leave just the default behavior alone .
So instead of letting you record programs as you normally would , it locks you out and deletes the show before you can save it .
However , Microsoft has n't just made a little tweak to their software to do this -- they have compiled an entire system built upon antifeatures .
This antifeature platform is integrated into their Windows Media software and forms the basis of their Windows Vista operating system , and they are working hard to convince companies like NBC , that Microsoft can be in control of how and when you get to watch television .
As creepy and as ridiculous as it may sound , this is their business strategy , and by getting this control , both the television and movie industry and computer users will be tied to Microsoft software .
Do n't be fooled into their claims that they are following regulations by the FCC -- the court ruled that the FCC has no power to make such regulations .
This is also claimed as a measure just to stop unauthorized file sharing , yet what Microsoft is doing is trying to make sure that they are on every end of the market , from how it is delivered , to how you watch it .
As Ars Technica reporter Jacqui Cheng puts it , this is not about Microsoft preventing people from sharing files without permission , " [ i ] t's about the ability to strictly control how we consume content " [ 2 ] .
Microsoft wants to have that control , and this software is the way they are trying to get it .
Software that is designed in this way is known as ' DRM ' , which stands for ' Digital Rights Management ' , and yet it is really just another way to restriction how consumers interact with things on their own computers and devices .
Because of this restriction , we refer to DRM as ' Digital Restrictions Management ' .
The alternative to DRM : free software
By far the best way to avoid DRM , is to refuse to use software that is infected with it .
Better yet , you should choose software that tries to do the opposite of DRM -- software that gives you complete control .
This kind of software is called " free software , " and it is based upon the idea that software carries certain freedoms to you :
The freedom to use the software for any reason you wish -- including to the ability to hit the save button when you * wish .
The freedom to examine how the software works and make changes , similar to a car engine -- you can remove the bugs or soup it up .
The freedom to share the software with your neighbor , like photocopying a newspaper article or sharing class notes with a classmate .
The freedom to share your modified software with other people , similar to how mathematics and science have worked for centuries .
Now you may not be a computer programmer , or know how to understand or change computer programs , but there are plenty of people out there who do , and they are likely already making the kinds of fixes and changes you 'd like to see , or are often part of a community willing to make those changes for you .
There are thousands of free software programmers , and many thousands of free software programs , and even complete free software operating systems .
You usually wo n't find annoying antifeatures in a program , and if there were one , you can rest assured that other programmers will have removed it by the time you get to use it .
Conversely , software that does n't give you these freedoms is software you cannot control , and we think that kind of software does n't belong on your computer .
We say , ' free software , free society ' -- with free software , if we are each in control of our machines , then we are all in control of how we use them and what we use them for .
And , do n't let Apple fool you into thinking that they are the alternative to DRM and Microsoft , they , too have their own DRM schemes , and seek to control the world in their own way , from branding their DRM music player , to entrenching the world in their proprietary formats and DRM music purchasing programs .
The alternative to Windows and Apple is software that you control , software that is guaranteed to give you all of the freedoms you need to be in control .
Free software .
There is a good chance you are already using free software , directly , such as using the Firefox web browser , or indirectly , by visiting a Web site that is sending you web pages with the Apache web - server .
However , there are also entire , user - friendly operating systems that you can install on almost any laptop or desktop computer .
So , if you are running Windows or Mac OS , consider replacing these with a free software based GNU / Linux operating system , such as gNewSense [ 3 ] .
Using free software will take the control out of Microsoft 's hands .
With free software , you are in control .

It should be noted that this writer refers to a person that shares files as a " pirate , " we think this is a bit of an extreme description that should be avoided .

BBC's Arab Affairs analyst
Saddam Hussein allegedly feared catching HIV in captivity An Arab newspaper has published what it says are excerpts from diaries written by the ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein while in captivity .
The extracts printed in Al - Hayat portray a man who never seems to have stopped believing in himself as a historic leader .
Al - Hayat said it had obtained extracts from the handwritten memoirs , which the paper said ran to five big volumes .
Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003 and executed three years later .
No remorse Some of the entries were signed " Saddam Hussein , President and Commander - in - Chief of the Armed Forces " .
The language he uses often suggests a leader addressing the nation , and frequently he urges the Iraqis - as he did during his trial - to unite and resist the US - led occupation .
He quotes from the Koran a great deal and describes the Iranians as a greater danger to Iraq and the Gulf Arabs than Israel .
On the other hand , his love poems - addressed to an anonymous woman - show a mawkish sentimentality not uncommon among adolescents suffering the first pangs of unrequited love .
There are a few mundane details about his health checks and what he says is his fear of catching HIV if his clothes were hung to dry next to those of his American guards .
But nowhere to be seen in the extracts is any sense of remorse or self - examination .
This leaves the reader of Saddam 's diaries with a strong impression that may perhaps be aptly summed up in the words of US novelist F Scott Fitzgerald : " The secret griefs of wild unknown men ... or at least the terms in which they express them , are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions .

What are these ?
I ’m a fellow American citizen who has not yet given up hope about re-directing the ship of state .
Wo n’t you please take a moment to read this Op - Ed ?
It contains a solution .
Before I make a point , let ’s agree on some things , OK ?
We ’re American .
Being American has subjective meanings and objective meanings , but let ’s stick to the latter , because that ’s based on fact and what we clearly know to be true :
1 . The contract between citizens and elected officials is the Supreme Law , i.e. our constitution .
There is no law higher than the seven articles and twenty - seven amendments which make up the U.S. Constitution .
2 . The Constitution provides for three branches of government : the Congress , the Executive , and the Judicial .
Of the individuals who people these three branches , some are elected , some are appointed , but all must swear an oath to obey the law before government issues checks for their efforts .
3 . You and I are upset with governance ( if you ’re not upset with governance today , you can stop reading now ) .
We ’re upset with governance because of things like a judicial branch preventing a state from determining who won electoral votes in a hotly contested presidential election , an executive branch holding closed - door meetings with private - sector energy corporations , and a legislative branch failing to standardize the electoral process , securing it once and for all from corporate interests .
These key points and many others are why we ’re upset with governance .
Possibly the most egregious thing about governance is that it ’s failed to secure The Vote from corporate interests .
We ’re currently burdened with what one blogger has termed Faith - Based Voting .
We should n’t have faith - based elections .
The tallying of votes should be based on more than faith .
When you check what voting systems each state currently has , you would be surprised how many are like Pennsylvania .
In other words , if you have doubts , too bad .
Votes are unrecountable , unverifiable , and unauditable .
Where there are paper trails , there are too many cases where proper procedure is not followed , and chain of custody is ignored .
It ’s easy to say it ’s tin foil hat stuff to claim irregularities , but it ’s just as crazy to suggest we ’re getting true results .
How do we get proof when votes are unrecountable , unverifiable , and unauditable ?
It ’s like one presidential candidate says when they talk about unitary executive powers and warrantless wiretaps : you do n't have to prove the power is being abused to object .
It does n't matter if you absolutely trust private corporations to tally votes , we spend more time telling people they sound paranoid than we do objecting to a system that demands scrutiny .
Whether or not elections are accurate we cannot know .
This has been going on for at least 6 years .
Faith - Based Voting should be a thing of the past , instead it is still with us , and the silence surrounding it is deafening to those of us paying attention .
Why has n’t the Congress drawn up blueprints for an official U.S. Voting Unit and mandated voting machine vendors to build them to spec ?
This is the obvious , common sense solution which would immediately extinguish many points of failure .
So why has n’t any legislation of the like made its way to the floor of the House or the Senate ?
It ’s because corporate interests have gridlocked the legislative branch , and prevented it from acting in the public interest .
Corporate interests , in the form of lobbyists , lawyers , and professional politicians , have become an aristocratic title system which operates at will .
The Constitution prohibits the establishment of aristocratic title systems or anti-republican governing bodies , though with corporate laws and charters , both are now the norm .
How can anyone believe that individuals , functioning as aristocrats , in the same manner as aristocrats , with a title system and organizational scheme that ’s aristocratic , somehow conclude they ’re Not aristocrats ?
Simply because they and their system is dressed in corporate clothing ?
The corporatists match aristocrats in both function and arrogance , pretending to have powers they do not , and pretending the average citizen is ignorant of the pretense .
Through legal hair - splitting and inaction , corporatists have technically overthrown what was once a republican government .
This must be addressed with specific prohibitions , and it must be written into the Constitution .
For decades we ’ve seen how corporatists frustrate efforts to restrain them by statutory , legal and regulatory means .
Short of armed revolution , constitutional amendment is the last recourse .
As you may or may not know , the Constitution contains the convention clause .
It ’s found in Article V and it states that once the requisite applications for a convention hit the doorstep of Congress , that branch “ shall call a convention .... ”
The congressional record shows all fifty states have at one time or another applied for such a convention , yet one Congress after another simply ignores them .
The legal term is Laches , or ignoring something on purpose .
In other words , the individuals who perpetuate our aristocratic title system of corporate governance have prevented and continue to prevent a national convention of state delegates , held on authority of Article V of the U.S. Constitution .
Traditional arguments against convoking such a convention are that it might tamper with the Constitution itself , or that such a convention might be taken over by corporate interests and subverted to such ends .
These arguments are bogus , not only irrational but illogical , because a convention is simply the process of opening discussion and building consensus .
Nothing discussed at a national convention can somehow accidentally become new law .
For an idea to become a law it must of course first be ratified , and to ratify an amendment proposal requires 38 states agree to it .
With the country as polarized as it is today , it ’s likely the only idea with any chance of being ratified would be one concerned with electoral reform , one that would secure The Vote from private interests once and for all .
Of the Bell Curve of political consciousness , there will always be citizens like you and I who are paying attention , and who can see past the smoke and mirrors of our homemade aristocratic establishment .
Perhaps the governing class has served us well enough over the years , but ever since it stopped a state from counting votes in a critical presidential election , and foisted upon the nation an executive administration which has repeatedly disobeyed the Constitution and the rule of law , it ’s become clear the time has come to create a 28th Amendment .
Recent legal history , the denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court in October of 2006 , has allowed a lower court ruling to stand , and that ruling has deemed the convention call is now discretionary , that it ’s up to our aristocrats whether the nation will ever convoke an Article V Convention .
In terms of political science , this means we no longer need to seek further applications from the state legislatures , we simply need to galvanize a tipping - point majority of Americans around the idea the time has come to convene .
This website , http://www.articlev.org suggests how such an effort might be carried out .
This website , http://www.foavc.org has further information about the subject .
Whatever you ’re upset about in terms of governance , it is our position that nothing short of a national convention of state delegates is going to do anything to redirect the ship of state .
Not a new executive administration , and certainly not legislation from a branch where corruption has become institutionalized .
An Article V Convention is anathema to the corporatists .
What corporate power is dead - set against , authentic Americans should be all for .
There ’s something magical about complex algorithms .
They take a hard problem and build a strong fence around it .
Once you ’ve got an implementation working , you do n’t have to worry about what ’s inside any more .
Take the specifics of the problem at hand , drop them into the algorithm , and out pops an answer .
It ’s like a cartoon machine with lights and wheels on the outside , and magic happens on the inside .
I ’ve been poking around looking at Python implementations of algorithms for solving .
Roughly speaking , these tools take a system of constraints , and produce an answer comprising the values that satisfy the constraints .
I ’m sure there are more , but these are what I ’ve turned up in a quick search .
¶ Simple Gauss - Jordan Elimination is a classic math technique for solving a system of linear equations .
This works great , but is crying out to be implemented as a C extension .
¶ SMAWK ( an awk - like acronym of the authors ’ initials ) finds the maxima in each row of a large matrix of values , provided the matrix is totally monotone .
This sounds esoteric , but has applications in computational geometry and other areas .
David Eppstein used it to implement Knuth ’s paragraph wrapping algorithm , and if an algorithm lets you re-implement Knuth - Plass in 65 lines of Python , I ’m guessing you have a powerful algorithm .
David has a bunch of other algorithmic stuff for Python too .
¶ logilab - constraint and python - constraint are two Python implementations of constraint solvers .
These seem to be good at discrete problems like solving Sudoku or eight queens .
BTW : Roman Barták maintains a list of constraint system implementations which could be useful .
Beyond these , there are tons of fascinating techniques : simulated annealing ( with some Python implementations ) , genetic algorithms ( Python implementations ) , and optimization algorithms of all sorts .
< p >< span class = " Apple - style - span " > Brown University researchers have found compelling evidence of thick , recurring glaciers on Mars , a discovery that suggests that the Red Planet ’s climate was much more dynamic than previously believed – and could change again .
Results are published on the cover of < em > Geology < / em > magazine .</ span></p>
PROVIDENCE , R.I. [ Brown University ] -
The prevailing thinking is that Mars is a planet whose active climate has been confined to the distant past .
About 3.5 billion years ago , the Red Planet had extensive flowing water and then fell quiet - deadly quiet .
It did n't seem the climate had changed much since .
Now , in a research article that graces the May cover of Geology , scientists at Brown University think Mars ' climate has been much more dynamic than previously believed .
After examining stunning high - resolution images taken last year by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , the researchers have documented for the first time that ice packs at least 1 kilometer ( 0.6 miles ) thick and perhaps 2.5 kilometers ( 1.6 miles ) thick existed along Mars ' mid-latitude belt as recently as 100 million years ago .
In addition , the team believes other images tell them that glaciers flowed in localized areas in the last 10 to 100 million years - akin to the day before yesterday in Mars ' geological timeline .
This evidence of recent activity means the Martian climate may change again and could bolster speculation about whether the Red Planet can , or did , support life .
The State of Oregon takes exception to Web sites that republish the state 's Revised Statutes in full , claiming that the statutes contain copyrighted information in the republication causes the state to lose money it needs to continue putting out the official version of the statutes .
Oregon 's Legislative Counsel , Dexter Johnson , has therefore requested that legal information site Justia remove the information or ( preferably ) take out a paid license from the state .
All citizens are legally presumed to know the law , so claiming copyright over it might seem like an odd position for a state to take ; would n't massive copying be a goal rather than a problem ?
But in his letter to Justia , Johnson makes a more nuanced case .
While the text of the law is not copyrighted , the " arrangement and subject - matter compilation of Oregon statutory law , the prefatory and explanatory notes , the leadlines and numbering for each statutory section , the tables , index and annotations and other such incidents " are under copyright .
A quick visit to the Legislative Counsel 's web site shows that Johnson is serious about two things : order forms and copyright .
The only items in red on the entire page are a copyright notice that includes " Oregon Laws , the Oregon Revised Statutes , and all specialty publications " and a set of links to order forms for such scintillating works as Landlord and Tenant Laws of Oregon 2008 .
The state also makes the complete text of its laws available online , and it welcomes sites like Justia to link these up .
Republishing them , though , is strongly frowned upon , and Johnson indicates his hope that " it will not be necessary to litigate this matter " ( translation : " we are willing to litigate this matter " ) .
Justia still appears to be displaying the Oregon Code online at the same address Johnson mentioned in his letter .
Carl Malamud , who heads public .
resource.org and has long been a proponent of making government information more accessible , works with Justia and also hosts a copy of the statutes in question .
Although Johnson 's letter was not directed at his activities , Malamud has already written Johnson twice in the last week , raising questions about the takedown request .
The second letter directly takes issue with the claim that Oregon 's own publication of the statutes on its website satisfies its public interest requirements .
Malamud ran the " Oregon Revised Statutes " portion of the site through the W3C's Markup Validation Service and found " 503,482 HTML errors in the code . "
In addition , he asserts that the site does not meet accessibility guidelines , uses a robots .
txt file to keep search engines from crawling at , and , generally speaking , " is an eyesore . "
" Your policy objectives would be far better met by allowing the Internet and the legal information community to supplement your efforts and build new tools that make the Oregon Revised Statutes available in a much more comprehensive and systematic fashion , " he wrote .
Such kerfuffles over access to government information are n't new , and they are n't isolated .
Only last month , for instance , Malamud was upset about an exclusive contract between the Government Accountability Office and publisher Thomson West to scan Congressional legislative histories .
Back in 2006 , he testified before Congress regarding various business activities of the Smithsonian , including a deal with the Showtime cable network .
While businesses that want to repackage and publish government information have a right to do so , archivists like Malamud get worked up when they feel that the government is attempting to stifle the republication of such information in free online formats .
Fortunately , the government is a complex place , and the news on public disclosure is n't all grim ; Congress last year decided that drug companies should be required to disclose even negative clinical trials of new products to the FDA , which makes them available to the public .

Virginia School Bans Tag and Touch Football
James Joyner · · 11 comments
An elementary school in McLean , Virginia ( an affluent D.C. suburb ) has banned tag and touch football .
Robyn Hooker , principal of Kent Gardens Elementary School , has told students they may no longer play tag during recess after determining that the game of chasing , dodging and yelling “ You ’re it ! ” had gotten out of hand .
Hooker explained to parents in a letter this month that tag had become a game “ of intense aggression . ”
Huh ?
Kent Gardens , with more than 900 students , is over capacity .
Hooker said the playground can get crowded when there are four or five classes there at one time .
Over the past couple of months , she had noticed that tag was taking up too much space and sending too many students to the nurse ’s office .
“ This is not the old - fashioned tag , where you could use two fingers and you would be it and move on to someone else , ” Hooker said .
The game , she said , has become much more aggressive .
“ I call it the nouveau tag . ”
This tag involves grabbing people who do not necessarily know they are playing and possibly bumping them to the ground .
“ Then the kids do ‘ pyramiding ’ or ‘ towering . ’
They pile on each other .
[ Sometimes ] they call it ‘ jailhouse ’ or ‘ jailbreak , ’ ” because the child has to break out , she said .
We had a less politically correct name for that when I was growing up but I can assure you there ’s nothing “ nouveau ” about this aside from the ban .
Gerri Swarm , secretary of the school ’s Parent - Teacher Association , said she was glad the principal was taking seriously student concerns about being pushed or shoved .
“ In this day and age , you ca n’t dismiss this as something not to worry about , ” she said .
Oh , I think we can .
This is n’t an isolated incident :
Many schools nationwide have whittled down playground activities in response to concerns about injuries , bullying or litigation .
Dodge ball is a thing of the past in many places , and contact sports are often limited at recess .
The Fairfax County schools ’ office of risk management maintains a list of activities that are prohibited at any school - sponsored events .
In addition to bungee - jumping and scuba diving , students are not permitted to break dance or play dodge ball or tug - of - war .
Restrictions on tag are less common .
Officials at several suburban Washington school systems said they were not aware of any schools that had banned the game outright .
I can see banning bungee - jumping and scuba diving , given the seriousness of the risks and liabilities .
But tug - of - war ?

Worse yet , bank runs can be contagious .
If depositors at one bank lose their money , depositors at other banks are likely to get nervous , too , setting off a chain reaction .
And there can be wider economic effects : as the surviving banks try to raise cash by calling in loans , there can be a vicious circle in which bank runs cause a credit crunch , which leads to more business failures , which leads to more financial troubles at banks , and so on .
That , in brief , is what happened in 1930 - 1931 , making the Great Depression the disaster it was .
So Congress tried to make sure it would never happen again by creating a system of regulations and guarantees that provided a safety net for the financial system .
And we all lived happily for a while  but not for ever after .
Wall Street chafed at regulations that limited risk , but also limited potential profits .
And little by little it wriggled free  partly by persuading politicians to relax the rules , but mainly by creating a “ shadow banking system ” that relied on complex financial arrangements to bypass regulations designed to ensure that banking was safe .
For example , in the old system , savers had federally insured deposits in tightly regulated savings banks , and banks used that money to make home loans .
Over time , however , this was partly replaced by a system in which savers put their money in funds that bought asset - backed commercial paper from special investment vehicles that bought collateralized debt obligations created from securitized mortgages  with nary a regulator in sight .
As the years went by , the shadow banking system took over more and more of the banking business , because the unregulated players in this system seemed to offer better deals than conventional banks .
Meanwhile , those who worried about the fact that this brave new world of finance lacked a safety net were dismissed as hopelessly old - fashioned .
In fact , however , we were partying like it was 1929  and now it ’s 1930 .
The financial crisis currently under way is basically an updated version of the wave of bank runs that swept the nation three generations ago .
People are n’t pulling cash out of banks to put it in their mattresses  but they ’re doing the modern equivalent , pulling their money out of the shadow banking system and putting it into Treasury bills .
And the result , now as then , is a vicious circle of financial contraction .
From Conservapedia
A liberal ( alternately called a left - winger or leftist ) is someone who advocates an increase in government spending , power , and control , such as ObamaCare .
Liberals often support the censorship and denial of biblical Christianity [ 1 ] and consistently conservative viewpoints .
Liberals who are a part of the secular left prefer atheism / agnosticism over the Christian faith , as atheism has no objective morality to hinder their big government plans . [ 2 ]
Increasingly , liberals side with the homosexual agenda , including homosexual " marriage " .
Liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working .
[ 3 ]
The liberal ideology has degenerated into economically unsound views and intolerant ideology .
All liberals support , in knee - jerk fashion , the opposite of conservative principles , while lacking an actual ideology or values of their own . [ 4 ]
Many of them cannot understand Christian language .
[ 5 ]
Liberals are especially prone to believe conspiracy theories , particularly those that denigrate people or views they disagree with , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and they are increasingly intolerant of opposing viewpoints .
[ 8 ]
Modern liberals reject classical liberalism , which is now an aspect of conservatism . [ 9 ]
Polling data has consistently shown that a larger percentage of Americans identify as conservative , rather than as liberal , by a margin of 35 % to 26 % as of 2017 ; while the gap between self - identified conservatives and self - identified liberals has been narrowing in recent years , [ 10 ] liberals and " progressives " oftentimes falsely claim that liberals outnumber conservatives .
Liberals are especially active at secular universities , however . [ 11 ]
Political positions and practices of liberals
Liberals support the following political positions and practices : [ 12 ]
Wasting money on ineffective government programs ( the significant economic problems in the Eurozone due to government debt will no doubt increasingly discredit this aspect of liberal ideology and make things more difficult for advocates of liberal economic ideologies )
Many liberals are increasingly attempting to limit free speech . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
Some liberals support :
Liberalism in 2019 America : " Death Camps for Trump Supporters Now ! "
Liberal intolerance
See also : Liberal intolerance and Liberal bigotry Many modern liberals have a tendency of to be intolerant of ideas that contradict liberal ideology which increasingly includes many strange notions [ 65 ] ( see : Liberal intolerance ) .
For example , radical feminists commonly claim that one is not born a man or woman , but one becomes a man or woman through gender socialization . [ 66 ]
A Pew Research study found that “ consistent liberals ” were most likely to block others on social media for disagreeing with them politically . [ 67 ]
Liberal intolerance and violence
As noted above , may liberals are increasingly attempting to limit free speech . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
For example , there have been several intolerant , liberal mobs which have shut down conservative speakers at college campuses ( in 2017 , there were two cases in the United States where violence or threats of violence were used to shut down free speech at college campuses ) . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ]
Democrats used paid leftists agitators to disrupt Donald Trump rallies . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
As far as the paid agitators , veteran left - wing strategist Robert Creamer confirmed on hidden camera that Hillary Clinton “ is fully in it ” and “ Hillary knows through the chain of command what ’s going on . ” [ 72 ]
The agitators were sent to Trump rallies to anger Trump supporters and incite violence . [ 71 ]
There have been a number of attacks against President Donald Trump supporters after his election which the mainstream media underreported . [ 73 ]
In addition , there have been a number of instances of leftists and Trump supporters clashing at Trump rallies after his election . [ 74 ]
Liberals and politics / law
Forced collectivization of healthcare .
In the United States , liberals currently use two Clauses of the U.S. Constitution to try to expand their power : the Commerce Clause and the General Welfare Clause .
The General Welfare Clause mentions " promoting the general welfare " .
This to a liberal means taxing the rich at increased rates and redistributing that money .
The Commerce Clause , on the other hand , says that Congress has the power to regulate trade with foreign nations , between the states and with the Indian tribes .
Since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt this clause has been interpreted very loosely and has resulted in the federal government expanding its power .
The latest example is The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , better known as Obamacare .
In the ACA , the liberals justify the individual mandate by saying it regulates commerce between the states .
The decline in liberal principles can be illustrated by how Franklin Delano Roosevelt opposed and condemned public sector unions , stating that the idea of collective bargaining can't be transferred from the private to the public sector , as that would result in the government being unable to carry out its duties .
Yet today , decades later , Democrats and liberals are in lock - step with public sector unions , as they " donate " money to the reelection campaign in exchange for more taxpayer money in their wallets and fluffed up pensions .
Current dictionaries describe the liberal ideology by pretending that a liberal is " a person who favors a political philosophy of progress and reform and the protection of civil liberties " or " a person who favors an economic theory of laissez - faire and self - regulating markets , " [ 75 ] or " open - minded or tolerant , especially free of or not bound by traditional or conventional ideas , values , etc. " or " favorable to or in accord with concepts of maximum individual freedom possible , especially as guaranteed by law and secured by governmental protection of civil liberties . " [ 76 ]
In practical usage , the term " liberal " is more closely synonymous with " radical , " " immoral , " " anti-freedom , " " elitist , " or " bad . "
Liberals and uncharitableness
See also : Liberals and uncharitableness and Atheism and charity In March 2008 , George Will wrote at RealClearPolitics concerning the United States :
“ Sixteen months ago , Arthur C. Brooks , a professor at Syracuse University , published " Who Really Cares : The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism . "
The surprise is that liberals are markedly less charitable than conservatives ....
If many conservatives are liberals who have been mugged by reality , Brooks , a registered independent , is , as a reviewer of his book said , a social scientist who has been mugged by data .
They include these findings : -- Although liberal families ' incomes average 6 percent higher than those of conservative families , conservative - headed households give , on average , 30 percent more to charity than the average liberal - headed household ( $ 1,600 per year vs. $ 1,227 ) . --
Conservatives also donate more time and give more blood . [ 80 ] ”
Atheists and agnostics often reject Biblical morality ( and therefore conservative Christianity ) and hold to moral relativism .
Therefore , it is not surprising that per capita atheists and agnostics in America give significantly less to charity than theists even when church giving is not counted for theists . [ 81 ]
Liberal politicians and uncharitableness
The political magazine the American Spectator featured an article which focused on liberal politicians and uncharitableness exposing the hypocrisy of the liberal politicians it featured . [ 82 ]
In addition , Barack Obama has been criticized concerning his lack of charitable giving .
Liberals and superstition

The Wall Street Journal reported : " A comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday , shows ... that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians . "
The Wall Street Journal reported : " A comprehensive new study released by Baylor University , shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology . [ 84 ]
Also , in September of 2008 , the Wall Street Journal reported :
“ The reality is that the New Atheist campaign , by discouraging religion , wo n't create a new group of intelligent , skeptical , enlightened beings .
Far from it :
It might actually encourage new levels of mass superstition .
And that 's not a conclusion to take on faith — it's what the empirical data tell us .
" What Americans Really Believe , " a comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday , shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology .
It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience , such as evolution than evangelical Christians ....
This is not a new finding .
In his 1983 book " The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener , " skeptic and science writer Martin Gardner cited the decline of traditional religious belief among the better educated as one of the causes for an increase in pseudoscience , cults and superstition .
He referenced a 1980 study published in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer that showed irreligious college students to be by far the most likely to embrace paranormal beliefs , while born - again Christian college students were the least likely . [ 84 ] ”

According to a 2007 study reported in the Journal of Family Issues , adherents of liberal Christianity are more likely to engage in marital infidelity than theologically conservative Christians . [ 88 ]
As noted above , liberals are more likely to adhere to evolutionary belief than conservatives .
A study conducted by the Australian National University , revealed that belief in evolution is associated with moral permissiveness . [ 89 ]
American liberalism
See also : American liberalism and Liberal elitism
As noted above , American liberalism is a political ideology that dominates the Democratic Party .
Its heroes include Franklin D. Roosevelt , Eleanor Roosevelt , and Martin Luther King .
According to the Gallup Organization , in the United States , 25 % of the population were liberals and 36 % were conservatives in 2016 . [ 90 ]
In 2017 , the Financial Times declared about American liberalism :
“ ... as Democrats struggle to reinvent themselves in the wake of Donald Trump ’s victory , their party remains captured by a toxic mix of identity politics and corporate interests .
The establishment wing is still convinced that racism and misogyny , not economic populism , sank Mrs Clinton , and that wooing big corporate donors is still the way to victory in the next election .
While money matters , and there may have been some voters who turned away from Mrs Clinton because of gender , the key reason that the Democrats lost in 2016 and are struggling to rebrand themselves is that they have failed to grasp two things .
Firstly , most Americans today care more about jobs than identity , and secondly , the same downward mobility that pushed the white working class towards Mr Trump is moving up the socio- economic food chain , and fast .
As research by groups from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD to McKinsey has shown , the technology - related job disruption that resulted in rust belt job losses and wage stagnation since 2000 is beginning to affect white - collar workers across nearly every sector ....
But Democrats over - estimated the power and relevance of identity politics ( there are still more whites without a college degree than minorities ) , and underestimated the breadth and depth of labour disruption .
In any case , says Robert Johnson , president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking , “ it was always a mistake to separate out issues of race and class , because they go hand in hand .
In economically insecure times , fear of the ‘ other ’ increases . ”
It is a phenomenon exploited by Mr Trump . [ 91 ] ”
In recent years , American liberals have experienced a number of political losses and many liberals in the United States have become embittered ( see : American liberalism and 21st century political losses ) ,
Democrats and most media outlets in the U.S. are blatantly liberal . [ 92 ]
Liberalism in North America today practices three primary tactics to attack the Republican Party , and sometimes to attack American values in general .
These three liberal tactics can be pronounced using the following acronym : SIN .
Liberals ( 1 ) shift the subject , they ( 2 ) ignore the facts , and they ( 3 ) name call . [ 93 ] [ 94 ]
Liberals typically support a " mixed " economy , a policy similar to that of fascism . [ 95 ]
Liberals claimed a monopoly on compassion , decency , and social justice ( as defined by themselves ) , posing as the sole defenders of civic virtue against a horde of backwoodsmen , racists , and religious fanatics . [ 4 ]
“ There 's another goal , from my point of view , which is to try to lay the groundwork for a radical political force which would conceive of itself as distinctly to the left of moderate , reformist American liberals .
And that has two aspects .
One is to try to change that liberalism , to transform it by analysis , critique , and activism ; the second is to build a radical movement which would be an autonomous force in its own right , which would be distinct from the traditional American liberal consensus .
This radical part of the program involves not simply supporting the liberal students against conservative students and conservative professors , but trying to act on them , to push them to the left .
It also involves trying to find and support , even trying to help create , networks of radical students in law school and of radical professors around the country — students and teachers who see themselves as wanting to go a lot further than most people want to go . [ 96 ] ”
Liberal Rankings of Congress Members
The National Journal compiles the votes of each congress member each year and uses the information to create rankings [ 97 ] of how liberal each member of the United States Congress is .
In addition to showing the voting records of each member and given an overall all ranking of liberalness , the National Journal also ranks congress members by liberalness in the areas of social , economic , and foreign policy .
American liberalism , demographics and expected tipping point in the decline of American liberalism
See also : American atheism and Decline of atheism and Global atheism
Due to the explosive growth of global Christianity in traditional cultures and their influence on Western Christianity and the higher birth rate of conservative Christians and religious conservatives , social conservatism is expected to rise .
The Birkbeck College , University of London professor Eric Kaufman wrote in his 2010 book Shall the Righteous Inherit the Earth ?
concerning America :
“ High evangelical fertility rates more than compensated for losses to liberal Protestant sects during the twentieth century .
In recent decades , white secularism has surged , but Latino and Asian religious immigration has taken up the slack , keeping secularism at bay .
Across denominations , the fertility advantage of religious fundamentalists of all colours is significant and growing .
After 2020 , their demographic weight will to tip the balance in the culture wars towards the conservative side , ramping up pressure on hot - button issues such as abortion .
By the end of the century , three quarters of America may be pro-life .
Their activism will leap over the borders of the ' Redeemer Nation ' to evangelize the world .
Already , the rise of the World Congress of Families has launched a global religious right , its arms stretching across the bloody lines of the War on Terror to embrace the entire Abrahamic family . [ 98 ] ”
Liberalism in Europe today
The French liberal politician François Hollande was the President of the French Republic from 2012 until 2017 .
In Europe , on the other hand , parties that call themselves liberal are moderate in outlook , ranging from centre - left to centre - right , promote typically economic and business freedom .
The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe [ 99 ] is a party of the European Parliament that represents most liberal parties from European countries .
Similar policies are promoted by many liberal parties throughout the world , [ 100 ] such as the Liberal Party of Australia . [ 101 ]
Trade unions and socialist parties often criticize politicians for promoting lower taxes on business , or more flexible hiring and firing laws , by calling them " liberals " or neoliberals .
Thus , just as in the US , " liberal " may occasionally be used as a term of abuse .
But when someone is called " liberal " in Europe , it has an entirely different meaning than in the US .
In fact , the US meaning of liberal is more similar to the politics of both European socialist / social democratic or Social / progressive liberal parties , in contrast to conservative or fiscal liberal parties which again falls into the right - wing part of the political spectrum . [ 102 ]
Historical Liberalism
In history , the word " liberal " has meant different things at different times , and was associated with individual liberty in prior centuries .
In the postwar period , liberals supported government intervention in the economy and welfare state policies , as well as peaceful coexistence with the communist block , which are not liberal policies in the sense of classical liberalism .
After the end of the cold war , with the demise of socialism and communism , many liberals embraced some ideas from economic neo-liberalism , and coined it the " Third Way " .
In the area of national security and foreign policy liberals in the U.S. failed to define a consistent stance , even after the events of 9/11 and the beginning of the war in Iraq .
Liberals generally support affirmative action , gay marriage , and abortion . [ 103 ]
Original meaning : Classical Liberalism
Liberalism is a political philosophy with freedom as its core value .
The term was originally applied to supporters of individual liberties and equal rights , but , in America , the term has come to represent a movement of social change that often conflicts with conservative values such as moral values and traditions derived from Northern European Protestantism .

Modern liberalism and the use of mockery rather than reasonable argumentation
See also : Atheism and mockery
In a BloombergView article , Stephen L. Carter wrote about modern liberalism :
“ But the left has work to do , not only on policy and organization but also on attitude .
Too many of my progressive friends seem to have forgotten how to make actual arguments , and have become expert instead at condemnation , derision and mockery .
On issue after issue , they ’re very good at explaining why no one could oppose their policy positions except for the basest of motives .
As to those positions themselves , they are too often announced with a zealous solemnity suggesting that their views are Holy Writ -- and those who disagree are cast into the outer political darkness .
In short , the left has lately been dripping with hubris , which in classic literature always portends a fall . [ 116 ] ”

WASHINGTON - The head of the Environmental Protection Agency initially supported giving California full or partial permission to limit tailpipe emissions - but reversed himself after hearing from the White House , according to a report yesterday .
The report by the Democratic staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which cites sworn depositions by high - level EPA officials , amounts to the first solid evidence of the political interference alleged by Democrats and environmentalists since the EPA administrator , Stephen Johnson , denied California 's waiver request in December .
Johnson 's decision also blocked more than a dozen other states , including Massachusetts and Rhode Island , that wanted to follow California 's lead and regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks .
It was applauded by the auto industry and supported by the White House , which has adamantly opposed mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions .
Johnson has defended the December decision as his alone .
He has refused to say whether there was White House pressure .
Although California had never previously been fully denied a waiver request under the Clean Air Act , Johnson justified denying this one on the basis that California is not alone in suffering the effects of global warming and therefore does n't have a compelling need for its own greenhouse gas standards .
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar dismissed the report by the committee , chaired by Representative Henry Waxman , Democrat of California , as " nothing new . "
" Administrator Johnson was presented with and reviewed a wide range of options and made his decision based on the facts and the law , " Shradar said .
" Distraction - oriented , political tactics of the committee will not keep EPA from moving forward , tackling tough issues and putting into place the most health - protective standards ever . "
Shradar did not respond when asked whether it was true Johnson initially supported fully or partially granted the waiver request .
California 's law would have forced automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016 , beginning with the 2009 model year .
In the course of its investigation the committee issued three subpoenas , received more than 27,000 pages of documents and deposed eight EPA officials .
The committee found , as has been previously reported , that the EPA 's career staff was unanimously in favor of at least partly granting the California waiver and advised Johnson that any other decision was unlikely to stand up in court .
The most explosive new evidence came from a deposition with EPA associate deputy administrator Jason Burnett .
Under oath , Burnett told committee staff that Johnson " was very interested in a full grant of the waiver " in August and September of 2007 and later thought a partial grant - allowing the waiver for the first two or three model years - " was the best course of action . "
Johnson 's position changed after Johnson communicated with the White House , Burnett said .
Burnett also said there was White House input into the December letter to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announcing the rationale for denying the waiver , and into the formal decision document released in February .
However the committee was stymied in its attempts to discover the extent and rationale for the White House 's involvement .
Also , the EPA continues to withhold some documents that show telephone calls or meetings in the White House .
The committee report said that the White House Counsel 's office has told the panel the EPA has 32 such documents and has described them as " indicative of deliberations at the very highest level of government . "
A White House spokesman did n't immediately return a call for comment yesterday .
" It appears that the White House played a significant role in the reversal of the EPA position , " the report concludes .
" It would appear to be inconsistent with the president 's constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws of the United States if the president or his advisers pressured Administrator Johnson to ignore the record before the agency for political or other inappropriate reasons . "

Interviews : Four Open Source Questions for Microsoft
by Ostatic Staff - May. 29 , 2008
Recently , I got the opportunity to pose a few questions to key people involved with open source efforts at Microsoft , including Sam Ramji ( the recently promoted head of Microsoft 's open source and Linux efforts ) , Ori Amiga ( Microsoft Group Product Manager , Live Developer Platform ) , and Susan Hauser ( General Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Licensing ) .
They offered up some thought - provoking input on what open source needs , Novell , China , Live Mesh , and other topics .
I thank them for taking the time , and please read on for their comments .
OStatic : Microsoft has , in the past , employed key open source development concepts such as modular architectures in its own products .
Do you foresee more of this , including developing directly on top of existing open source platforms ?
Sam Ramji , head of Microsoft 's global open source and Linux team :
" Yes .
Microsoft has learned from open source development principles and they are making their way into the mindset , development practices and products we deliver .
For instance , Windows Server 2008 was engineered with a new , modular architecture and built - for - purpose configurations .
We ’ve also worked hard to make Windows Server programming language agnostic - PHP on Windows Server is a great example of this . "
" We are building interoperability with openwsman and wiseman into our development process for Microsoft ’s WS - Management stack ( found in System Center ) .
We ’ve built Windows HPC Server on open source code ( the MPICH2 stack from Argonne National Laboratory ) and contributed our enhancements back to the project .
The most recent example of this , the agent infrastructure in System Center , is built to interoperate with UNIX and Linux by utilizing OpenPegasus , an open source project .
As a result , open source has also helped extend our management solutions to Linux and UNIX environments . "
" This is an exciting trend and I expect to see more of it over time , as our culture and practices shift .
This has been confirmed publicly by Bob Muglia , the Senior VP of my division ( the Server & Tools Business ) – where we see opportunities to speed R&D and improve adoption we will assess using open source . "
OStatic :
What do you think is missing in the open source community as a whole ?
Better marketing for commercial efforts ?
Better compatibility ?
Sam Ramji , head of Microsoft 's global open source and Linux team :
" I think of open source as a set of diverse communities , not a single community .
We can think of communities of practice like object - orientation ( OO ) or agile development in the singular , open source projects .
And developers have a very broad range of practices ( think across the different design , development , licensing , distribution , and user engagement models used today in the top 5000 open source projects ) .
When we talk about an “ open source community ” I think of this as more like a movement towards transparency and the sharing of ideas , which is why we see the transfer across domains from software development into science , journalism and even politics . "
" Clearly there are powerful core concepts of transparency and sharing at the heart of this movement .
However , it ’s starting to blur the original ideas articulated by Eric Raymond , Danese Cooper , et al , which are about the source code itself and the developers who share it .
The risk is that the term itself loses meaning over time , which would be unfortunate as it ’s a powerful idea .
So one very important thing that ’s missing in ' the community as a whole ' is a common philosophy that is clear and broad enough to be embraced by everyone and allows some of the factional arguments to be settled peacefully . "
" The other thing I think is missing is implementation of a basic principle of economic fairness .
Thousands of developers have put very hard work into building software used by millions of people and companies , yet only a fraction of these developers are rewarded financially .
Currently there are perfectly good projects that have been abandoned by their developers despite being used by large corporations .
Subsequently the projects fall out of use .
This is unnecessary waste that would often be prevented by making it easy for companies to pay the developers directly .
I think it ’s important to solve this so that the sustainability of open source projects is improved . "
OStatic : Does Microsoft 's recently announced Live Mesh platform have implications that the open source community ought to know about ?
Ori Amiga , Microsoft Group Product Manager , Live Developer Platform :
" Microsoft had an explicit goal in designing the Live Mesh platform that it be as open and accessible as possible .
We wanted to lower the barrier to entry for developers from any background to interact with the system .
We emphasized using simple , text - based established standards wherever possible so that our system would be both observable ( making it easy to watch other applications or transparently experiment with the system ) and approachable from any development tool or environment .
Our RESTful API and support of JSON , RSS and ATOM all help deliver on this goal . "
( Ori also cites this video discussion on how Live Mesh affects the open source community . )
OStatic :
What goals do you have for Microsoft 's interoperability alliance with Novell , and what 's behind the goal of converting Linux users in the Chinese market to SUSE Linux Enterprise ?
Susan Hauser , General Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Licensing at Microsoft :
" We entered into this agreement because based on customer feedback , we believed that there was an opportunity to grow our business by working together and to show leadership in the industry and the community in the following ways . "
" Customers want their vendors to embrace interoperability .
Microsoft and Novell collaborated – and continue to collaborate – on technical solutions for their shared customers to address critical interoperability technologies such as virtualization and web services .
The sales of SUSE Linux support certificates and feedback we ’ve received from those customers affirms that choice . "
" Customers want their vendors to manage IP issues for them .
Both companies recognize that Microsoft and Novell intellectual property is relevant to their respective products and will be increasingly relevant over time .
This agreement has provided customers with confidence these issues have been addressed .
We have provided customers with IP Peace of mind .
In addition , by having reciprocal respect for IP , we are able to collaborate technically and deliver technical collaboration solutions that benefit our customers . "
" Microsoft wants to continue reaching out to the open source community .
Microsoft has begun participation in some important OSS projects and the non-compensated OSS community is being encouraged to experiment and grow through a broad covenant not - to - sue that benefits individual developers . "
" There is a growing recognition among customers – in many countries including China - that there are significant costs to the business by running an operating system that is not supported by a commercial vendor .
These costs include the staff time to do manual patches and bug fixes versus leveraging the seamless updates that are provided by Novell for SUSE Linux Enterprise as part of a support contract . "
" In addition , companies are realizing that with limited budgets , it makes much more sense to use valuable IT staff on strategic projects that support the overall business than on manual tasks that are easily automated when a support contract is purchased . "

Inflation : America 's Greatest Export By Peter Schiff
Feb 22 2008 4:11 PM www.europac.net
Unfortunately one of the few things still made in America is inflation .
In fact , it now ranks as our greatest export .
A significant by - product of the current global economic system , wherein Americans spend money they do not earn to buy foreign products that they do not make , is that trillions of dollars are now parked in foreign banks just looking for somewhere to go .
In a healthy trade relationship , a nation pays for its imports with equal exports that result from real productivity that pumps up demand .
In contrast , the current U.S. import boom has been created by the artificial demand of inflation , in which increased money supply has put more dollars in the hands of U.S. consumers .
Normally , such growth in money supply would result in more substantial increases in domestic consumer prices .
However for a number of reasons , the United States has been able to partially dodge this bullet .
In short , we have exported our inflation abroad .
Our foreign creditors basically have two choices as how to dispose of their excess dollars .
They can use them to buy U.S. financial assets , such as bonds , stocks or real estate , or they can exchange them for other currencies or commodities , such as gold or oil .
If they choose the former , foreign central banks are off the hook , as those dollars find their way back to the U.S. economy without any additional money creation .
However , as foreigners are increasingly choosing the latter , foreign central banks have been “ forced� ?
to print money like it ’s going out of style .
In years past , foreign investors were happy to hold strong U.S. dollars , which they either saved as a store of value , or used to purchase mighty Wall Street stocks and bonds .
However , when the dollar began its epic swan dive , and U.S. investments began to grossly underperform non-U.S. alternatives , private investors dumped their dollars en masse by exchanging them for local currencies .
The unwanted dollars then became the property and problem of foreign central banks .
If central banks did not buy these dollars , foreign citizens would have been forced to sell their surplus dollars on the open market .
To prevent this from happening these banks have become the buyers of first and last resort .
However , to sop up all of the excess supply , central banks must create more of their own , resulting in rapidly expanding money supplies .
As much as Wall Street and government economists pretend otherwise , the expansion of money supply is the essential definition of inflation .
The real reason that prices are rising in China is that so many yuan are being printed to buy up all these surplus dollars .
For much of the past decade foreign central banks invested their swelling U.S. dollar reserves in U.S. debt instruments , such as treasuries and mortgage backed securities .
Not incidentally , these purchases helped sustain our housing and credit bubbles .
But as a result of increasingly poor returns , sovereign wealth funds have recently been created to buy tangible assets instead , such as large portions of Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley .
Thus far these investments have performed poorly ( note the 50 % decline in the value of the China ’s stake in Blackstone ) .
However , my guess is that such losses are of little concern , as the Chinese understand that any active use of their dollars , regardless of short - term performance , is seen as a positive because ultimately their unused dollars might be practically worthless !
It is no accident that those regions experiencing the highest inflation are those with currencies pegged to the dollar .
The formerly strong dollar provided a compelling rationale for nations with weaker currencies to maintain currency pegs .
The linkage provided badly needed discipline to their central banks and created confidence in their currencies .
However , it makes no sense at all for a nation with a strong currency to peg to a weaker one .
It is analogous to an honor student cheating on his exam by copying the answers from the worst student in the class .
Many economic analysts have noted that rising prices in China are now resulting in higher import prices for Americans .
Ironically , many have concluded that this is evidence of China exporting inflation to the U.S. rather than China merely returning the inflation to its original source .
Initially , the strong productivity growth of these export nations worked to lower consumer prices and masked the inflationary impact of rapid money supply growth .
However , with prices now exploding throughout Asia and the Middle East , governments can no longer ignore the inflation problem .
China has recently imposed price controls to deal with rapid increases in consumer prices .
However , as this merely attempts to mask the symptoms of inflation rather than addressing its root cause , this policy will prove as ineffective as it did in the United States in the 1970’s .
Once all of these misguided cures fail , Asia and the Gulf nations will swallow the only medicine that will work .
They will completely pull the plug on their dollar pegs .
When they do it will not just be the dollar , but the entire American economy that goes down the drain .
The manner in which this massive bundle of funds will be disposed will have a gargantuan impact on the trajectory of the world economy .
Unfortunately for America , the decisions are out of our hands , but the ramifications will largely be ours to bear .
For a more in depth analysis of our financial problems and the inherent dangers they pose for the U.S. economy and U.S. dollar denominated investments , read my new book “ Crash Proof : How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse . �?

Conservatives are buzzing this week about whether one of the party 's young up - and - comers , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , has made presumed GOP nominee John McCain 's short list for his running mate .
Democratic strategists , meanwhile , say they 'd welcome the contrast between the 36 - year - old Indian - American and the 71 - year - old senator .
" There 's a mixed bag on [ Jindal ] , " one high - ranking Democratic Party official told U.S. News .
" With McCain , a young vigorous running mate is potentially a negative — it highlights his age . "
Jindal , long a darling of conservative talker Rush Limbaugh , has said he does n't expect to be asked .
But his tour in the national spotlight continues this week with a speech Friday at the National Press Club .
After “ Firefox to Track User Data ? ” post , there were lots of bad comments regarding this new feature .
People all over the internet started to express their opinion ( from posts like “ go to hell ” to “ Firefox is spyware ” , etc ) .
Some of them are already looking for a replacement of their favorite browser .
While user tracking project is still on early stage and it will be possible to turn this feature off , that have n’t convinced most of the Firefox browser users .
Firefox is ( or was ? ) a name which you can always trust , right ?
No spyware , everything is clean .
But what happened now ?
After Firefox became a popular web browser ( see April market share data here ) , something happened .
Have they changed their vision ?
Or just made a mistake ?
Will Firefox users still trust this browser ?
And most of all , should web browsers do that at all ?

Dr. Walter E. Williams is an excellent economist .
He ’s fairly libertarian when it comes to domestic policy in general .
But turn him loose on foreign policy , at least in the post - 9/11 era , and suddenly all that skepticism about government goes out the window .
Case in point : his recent column arguing for all - out war against the Muslim world .
Williams argues that since some Muslims are terrorists , the West is justified in bombing , shooting , torturing , and otherwise employing its " full might " against all Muslims .
He likens this to the total war in which the Allies engaged in World War II :
Think back to the 1930s when the Japanese murdered an estimated 3 million to 10 million people in China , Indonesia , Korea , Philippines and Indochina ; and on December 7 , 1941 when they attacked Pearl Harbor , killing over 2,400 Americans .
I ’m betting that most of Japan ’s at - the - time 60 million population were peace - loving people and would have wanted nothing to do with the brutal slaughter in China and the attack on the U.S.
In formulating our response to the attack , should President Roosevelt have taken into account the fact that most Japanese are peace - loving people ruled by fanatics ?
Should our military have only gone after the Japanese pilots and their naval armada ?
I ’d also wager that most Germans were peace - loving people and not part of the Nazi sadists wanting to wage war on their neighbors and exterminate the Jews .
Again , should Roosevelt and Churchill have taken that into account in their response to German militarism ?
My answer is no and thank God it was their answer as well .
Whether most Germans , Italians or Japanese were peace - loving or not was entirely irrelevant in formulating the Allied response to their militarism .
Unfortunately , this seems to be the prevailing attitude among Americans , perhaps in part because no American cities were firebombed or nuked by the Axis powers .
It is also a horrific attitude to maintain for it makes no distinction between the guilty and the innocent .
Would Williams think the police justified in coming into his neighborhood and machine - gunning all its residents because one suspected murderer happened to reside there ?
Clearly Williams does not subscribe to Just War theory , which requires that ( 1 ) noncombatants be excluded from attacks ; ( 2 ) the force used be proportional to the wrong which the war is attempting to right ; and ( 3 ) only attacks with military objectives be undertaken , with care taken to minimize the harm visited upon noncombatants .
There are good arguments to be made that Just War theory has been used more often to justify unjust wars than to prevent them , but it nevertheless remains true that the U.S. attempted to follow these principles to some extent prior to the Civil War — a war which Williams has more than once denounced .
Total war is , in fact , no more American than apple pie .
The authors of the Declaration of Independence , in their litany of charges against King George , found it outrageous that he was employing total war against them both directly , having " plundered our seas , ravaged our coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people , " and by inciting the " merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions . "
Even the atomic bombing of Japan , so beloved of today ’s conservatives , was not universally admired in its immediate aftermath any more than it is now .
Among its detractors were General Dwight Eisenhower , who tried to persuade Truman not to drop the bomb and later said , " It was n’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing .
. . . to use the atomic bomb , to kill and terrorize civilians , without even attempting [ negotiations ] , was a double crime " ; and Admiral William Leahy , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Truman , who told his secretary on that fateful day , " [ W ]e will regret this day .
The United States will suffer , for war is not to be waged on women and children . "
Williams may be glad that the Allies treated all citizens of Axis countries , whether civilians or military personnel , alike , but his is clearly not the sole American , let alone civilized , position on the subject .
Next Williams takes a leap of logic that can only be described as bizarre :
Horrible acts can be committed in countries where most of the people are peace - loving and simply want to be left alone to attend to their affairs .
I imagine that described most of the people in the former Soviet Union ; however , that did not stop the killing of an estimated 62 million people between 1917 and 1987 .
The same can be said of the Chinese people , but it did n’t stop the killing of 35 million of their countrymen during Mao Zedong ’s reign .
Whether most people of a country are peace - loving or not is not nearly as important as who ’s calling the shots .
Williams is arguing , in essence , that since the peace - loving people of the Soviet Union and the People ’s Republic of China were mercilessly slaughtered by their own governments , that somehow justifies the merciless slaughtering of Germans and Japanese by the Allies because what ’s important is " who ’s calling the shots , " not the peace - loving people forced to live under that tyranny .
According to Williams ’s logic , then , if I beat my wife , it is therefore okay for my neighbor Smith to go beat our mutual neighbor Jones ’s wife if he does n’t like the way Jones is behaving .
Wonderland , here we come !
" At this particular time , " continues Williams , " fanatical jihadists are calling the terrorism shots in many Muslim countries .
Their success in committing terrorist acts is in no small part the result of the actions by the millions of peace - loving fellow Muslims . "
What actions are these ?
Either Muslims fail to condemn terrorism sufficiently or they are silent about terrorists ’ activities among them , says Williams , adding : " There is no way terrorists can carry on their operations , obtain explosive materials , run terrorist training camps , raise money without the knowledge of other Muslims , whether they ’re government officials , bankers , family members , friends or neighbors . "
Let ’s do the math on this .
Williams says that of 1.2 billion Muslims in the world , " [ w ] e ’re told it ’s only that 1 percent . . . are fanatical jihadists . "
That means there are 12 million potential Islamic terrorists in the world , a number that seems extraordinarily high , but we ’ll take Williams at his word for the purposes of this exercise .
Now those 12 million jihadists may know quite a few people , but let ’s say that on average no more than 10 of their acquaintances have any inkling of their clandestine activities .
( It ’s in their interest to keep the circle of knowledge small to prevent leaks . )
Let us further stipulate that no terrorists share acquaintances with knowledge of their activities with other terrorists .
That means that at most we have 12 million terrorists plus 120 million " enablers , " giving us 132 million non-innocent Muslims , which still amounts to only 11 percent of the entire Muslim population .
Williams , however , is proposing that the other 89 percent of Muslims be treated as enemies just the same .
Even if half of all Muslims are complicit in terrorism to one degree or another , is Williams justified in threatening all of them with annihilation ?
The obvious answer is no .
Individuals commit crimes , sometimes in concert with other individuals .
The individuals involved deserve to be brought to justice ; all others ought to be left alone .
Threatening all Muslims with death because some of them are terrorists is akin to threatening all African - Americans with death because some of them are murderers , and somehow I do n’t think Williams would go for that .
Williams will have none of this bleeding - heart liberal nonsense about proportionality , however .
As far as he ’s concerned , President Bush had it right when he divided the world into those " with us " and those " against us " , and any Muslim who is n’t actively working with the West is , by definition , working against it .
He writes : " Because those millions of peace - loving Muslims do not speak out and expose terrorists and do n’t more fully cooperate with domestic and international authorities trying to stop terrorists , they become enemies of the West just as the peace - loving people in Germany , Italy and Japan became enemies of the Allied powers during World War II .
Like them , Muslims should be prepared to suffer the full might of the West in its efforts to fight terrorism . "
Has it ever occurred to Williams that the vast majority of Muslims probably have no way of cooperating with anti-terrorism efforts for the simple reason that they do n’t know any terrorists or are n’t aware that they do ?
Furthermore , those who do know terrorists may very well fear for their lives should they dare to expose them or cooperate with efforts to do so .
In America we protect witnesses against organized crime ; we do n’t threaten them with the electric chair for refusing to testify out of fear .
Why , then , should we threaten Muslims with " the full might of the West " for not helping Western governments root out terrorists ?
Would n’t offering rewards and protection be a more humane and productive approach ?
Dr. Williams appears to have a blind spot when it comes to foreign policy .
Whereas in domestic policy he insists on individuals ’ being treated as individuals and given the maximum liberty possible , in foreign policy he insists on treating people as members of groups — and woe to him who , even by accident of birth , falls into a group designated " the enemy . "
When that happens , all moral scruples , in Williams ’s view , can be tossed aside in favor of collective punishment with no limits .
Furthermore , anyone who happens to reside in a country whose government has been designated an enemy is also targeted for death in Williams ’s world .
Ironically , this is precisely the opinion of the very terrorists Williams wishes to eradicate .
The Best of Michael Tennant
The never - ending presidential campaign is enough to overload anyone ’s senses .
The themes and messages are mind - numbingly discombobulated — race , class , flag lapel pins , NAFTA , bowling photo ops , Iraq and , of course , endless promises of “ real change . ”
It is like the head - pounding noise of bad heavy metal music , but the subliminal message is n’t a satanic code — it ’s one telling us that presidential campaigns are always the most important arenas of democracy .
But this week you may hear another sound .
This one will come from ExxonMobil ’s annual meeting in Dallas .
The thrum may be quieter than the political din , but it is about something that can be more critical than even presidential elections — something called shareholder democracy .
The concept is simple :
By law , anyone owning at least $ 2,000 of company stock may file a shareholder resolution demanding a change in that company ’s behavior .
Investors then get to vote their shares of stock on the resolution .
At ExxonMobil ’s meeting on May 28 , a group of shareholders is planning to offer resolutions asking the company to invest more in renewable and alternative energy .
Though the move has garnered scant media attention , it could be far more significant than the presidential pandemonium .
According to Friends of the Earth , ExxonMobil and its predecessors ’ products are responsible for emitting roughly 5 percent of all human - generated carbon pollution since 1882 .
Forcing a company like this to even minimally change could have planetwide effects .
But , then , with the company generating $ 40 billion in annual profits , ExxonMobil ’s shareholders are making bank .
So why would any of them vote to change the business ?
Because if they do n’t , those profits could evaporate .
ExxonMobil is one of the globe ’s least diversified energy companies .
The vast majority of its resources go toward developing air - polluting fossil fuels , and it invests almost nothing in renewable or alternative energy .
That currently means big money , but if oil supplies diminish , governments regulate carbon or fossil fuel prices fluctuate , it could mean even bigger losses .
And so those shareholders demanding change are appealing to fellow investors ’ belief in capitalism , not altruism .
For example , citing their desire to “ safeguard long - term shareholder value , ” a group of shareholders with $ 5 billion in ExxonMobil stock excoriated company management in 2006 for “ not sufficiently preparing for tomorrow ’s energy ” and running “ the risk of lagging significantly behind ” competitors .
Many of these investors are expected to back this year ’s alternative energy resolution , especially considering the boost from none other than the Rockefellers — the family that originally founded what would become ExxonMobil .
The name Rockefeller has long been associated with pollution - belching smelters and landscape - scarring mines , but also with steady profits .
It is that business sense — not tree - hugger idealism — that led a group of Rockefellers this month to embrace the environmental initiative .
“ If the next 20 years of the energy business were going to be just about oil and gas , we would n’t be holding this press conference , ” said one Rockefeller kin at the event announcing the family ’s position .
ExxonMobil management could win out and defeat the resolution , but it would be a Pyrrhic victory .
Executives would keep generating publicity that not only makes the company look bad but reminds the public about the untapped power of shareholder democracy that big business would rather people ignore .
After all , through pension funds and 401 ( k ) plans , ordinary Americans collectively own a lot of stock , and consequently a big chunk of shareholder resolution votes .
These votes often go unexercised , but the more attention shareholder resolutions receive , the more citizens will “ become educated about various corporation policies ” because they will realize “ they can do something about them , ” as famed shareholder activist Saul Alinsky once said .
That is what truly scares Corporate America — and what could bring the most “ real change ” of all .
Note : David Sirota ’s upcoming book , “ The Uprising , ” includes a chapter on shareholder activists ’ long - running battle with ExxonMobil .
The book will be released on May 27 .
Sirota is a fellow at the Campaign for America ’s Future and a board member of the Progressive States Network , both nonpartisan organizations .

Some people argue that the Judiciary Committee cannot proceed with impeachment hearings because it would distract Congress from passing important legislative initiatives .
We disagree .
First , hearings need not tie up Congress for a year and shut down the nation .
Second , hearings will not prevent Congress from completing its other business .
These hearings involve the possible impeachment of the vice president - not of our commander in chief - and the resulting impact on the nation 's business and attention would be significantly less than the Clinton presidential impeachment hearings .
Also , even though President Bush has thwarted moderate Democratic policies that are supported by a vast majority of Americans - including children 's health care , stem - cell research , and bringing our troops home from Iraq - the Democratic Congress has already managed to deliver a minimum - wage increase , an energy bill to address the climate crisis and bring us closer to energy independence , assistance for college tuition , and other legislative successes .
We can continue to deliver on more of our agenda in the coming year while simultaneously fulfilling our constitutional duty by investigating and publicly revealing whether Cheney has committed high crimes and misdemeanors .
Yay !!

What was once speculation is now being confirmed by scientists : the brains of women and men are different in more ways than one .
Discoveries by scientists over the past 10 years have elucidated biological sex differences in brain structure , chemistry and function .
“ These variations occur throughout the brain , in regions involved in language , memory , emotion , vision , hearing and navigation , ” explains Larry Cahill , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California , Irvine .
While women and men struggle to communicate with each other and ponder why they do n’t think and react to things in similar ways , science is proving that the differences in our brains may have more serious implications beyond our everyday social interactions .
Scientists are looking into ways that sex - based brain variations affect the thought processes and behavior of men and women differently .
According to Cahill , “ their discoveries could point the way to sex - specific therapies for men and women with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer ’s disease , schizophrenia , depression , addiction and post - traumatic stress disorder . ”
To better understand the implications of sex differences in the brain , it is important to examine disease entities in depth .
Take Alzheimer ’s disease , for example .
Significant differences exist between men and women who suffer from the disease .
“ There are growing indications that the disease pathology , and the relationship between pathology and behavioral disturbance , differs significantly between the sexes , ” Cahill wrote in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience .
Pathology refers to the way a disease develops within the body .

“ Let us first consider Alzheimer ’s disease - related pathology .
Alzheimer ’s disease - related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women : up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology , whereas it is found in only 8 - 10 percent of age - matched women . ”
In other words , abnormalities caused by Alzheimer ’s disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms or behavioral problems for women and men with the disease .
There are several other notable differences in pathology between the sexes in Alzheimer ’s disease .
Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between pathology and how disease presentation affects men and women differently could pave the path for future sex-specific therapies .
Schizophrenia is another disease that affects men and women differently .
Differences include age of onset , symptoms and the time course of the disease .
In addition , structural brain differences are apparent .
According to Cahill , “ men with schizophrenia show significantly larger ventricles than do healthy men , whereas no such enlargement is seen in women with schizophrenia . ”
Researchers do not understand the implications of these differences yet , but the study of sex differences in the brain is advancing quickly .
Aiding researchers in their work is a new guidebook for investigating sex differences in the brain .
Published by Oxford University Press , “ Sex Differences in the Brain : From Genes to Behavior ” provides scientists with the basic tools for investigating sex differences in brain and behavior and insight into areas where important progress in understanding physiologically relevant sex differences has already been made .
The book is edited by members of the Society for Women ’s Health Research ’s Isis Fund Network on Sex , Gender , Drugs and the Brain .
“ Scientific evidence of sex differences in the brain is regularly emerging now , ” said Sherry Marts , Ph.D. , author of the book ’s preface and vice president of scientific affairs for the Society for Women ’s Health Research .
“ This book outlines current knowledge , conceptual approaches , methodological capabilities , and challenges to continued progress .
It is an important tool in the quest to turn the science of sex differences into appropriate care for all patients both male and female . ”
As researchers continue to explain how sex influences brain function , we will see more diagnostic tools and therapies that successfully account for the biological differences between women and men .
That will mean better health outcomes for all patients .
Having a flat stomach or more commonly , " washboard abs " is not just accomplished by working out daily , it has to become an all - encompassing lifestyle .
The key components are healthy diet , cardiovascular training , and abdominal exercises .
If a movie star stomach is your goal , you must realize that to achieve your goal you have to first concentrate on what you eat , not how many sit - ups you do in a day .
Of course , as with any fitness and health goal - nutrition and exercise are always the main ingredient .
1 ) Healthy Diet
The most important factor in acquiring washboard abs is eating a healthy diet .
Here is a list of recommended healthy ways to help you lose a few inches :
- Drink at least three liters of water per day ( 100 oz )
- Eat five servings of vegetables and fruits per day
- Eliminate fried foods and cheese
- Eliminate processed sugar ( for example : sodas , cookies , candy )
- Eliminate fatty red meat - only lean red meats ( 1 - 2 times weekly )
Diets like the Atkins and other high protein diets may help at first but to get rid of that last 10 - 15 pounds , it is recommended to lower calories to a range of 1500 - 2000 calories a day BUT you must exercise rigorously - both with abdominal exercises and cardio work .
2 ) Cardiovascular Exercise
Washboard abs , getting lean , and losing weight are all tied into a consistent cardiovascular workout program .
You should do 30 - 45 minutes of activities like walking , running , biking , or swimming daily 4 - 5 times per week .
It takes about four weeks before you start to see the physical benefits or your diet and exercise program .
You will see almost immediate results in your energy level , overall mental alertness when exercising daily .
Start off slowly if you have not trained with much intensity in the past several years .
A good way to get started is to walk or run with the following six weeks program :
Week # 1 - Walk / run - 1 mile a day for 5 days a week
Week # 2 - Walk / run - 2 miles a day for 5 days a week
Week # 3 - Non-impact week - bike or swim for 20 - 30 minutes a day
Week # 4 - Walk / run - 2 miles a day for 5 days a week
Week # 5 - Walk / run - 3 miles a day for 4 - 5 days a week
Week # 6 - Walk / run - 4 miles a day for 4 - 5 days a week
Note : week # 3 is non-impact due to high number of injuries that occur to legs ( knees , shins , feet , hips ) during the third week of beginning a walking or running program .
3 ) The One Simple Exercise
The Ten- second Crunch is probably one of the best beginning exercises for firming up the belly .
Simply lie on your back and lift your shoulder blades off the floor and hold for ten seconds .
Repeat this at least for ten repetitions .
Try repeating the 10 seconds crunch for 10 repetitions morning and night for starters .
Also , stretch and flex your lower back for a few minutes after each set in order to balance the muscles that support your torso .
However , a variety of abdominal exercises will help build the muscles under the fat .
Now - lose the fat by watching your diet and cardio vascular exercise and you will soon see the muscles !
Below are some beginning , intermediate and advanced abdominal exercises taken form every eBook sold on the Military.com Fitness ebook Store .
Sample ab exercises are the following :
Hanging Knee-ups
Bring your knees as high as you can as shown .
Advanced Crunch - ( Legs up )
Lie on your back with your feet straight in the air .
Keep your legs straight up in the air for the advanced crunches .
Cross your hands over your chest and bring your elbows to your knees by flexing your stomach .
( Do not do if you have previous lower back injury - place feet on the floor )
Reverse Crunch
In the same position as the regular crunch , lift your knees and butt toward your elbows .
Leave your head and upper body flat on the ground .
Only move your legs and butt .
( Do not do if you have previous lower back injury )
Double Crunch
Add the regular and reverse crunch together in one motion ... You will feel this one twice as fast ...
Right Elbow to Left Knee
Cross your left leg over your right leg .
Flex your stomach and twist to bring your right elbow to your left knee .
Left Elbow to Right Knee
Same as above just switch sides .
Cross your right leg over your leg .
Flex your stomach and twist to bring your left elbow to your right knee .
Hip Rollers
This exercise will help you build your abs , back and hips to help with long ocean swims and balance out the hip flexors exercises .
Twist to both sides keeping your shoulders on the floor and stay in the bent knee position when rotating left and right .
Note : Anytime you work your abs , you should also exercise your lower back to build balance in your torso .
Lower Back Exercise
Lie on your stomach with your arms extended over your head .
Lift your right arm and your left leg off the ground at the same time and repeat for specified number of repetitions .
Switch arms / legs and repeat .
Lower Back Exercise - Swimmers
Lie on your stomach and lift your feet and knees off the floor by flutter kicking repeatedly as if you were swimming freestyle .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced Abdominal Exercises :
Do not do if you are a beginner !
These exercises are not healthy for weak or injured backs .
If you cannot do the above swimmer exercises for 1:00 - do not attempt these exercises .
Sit-ups
Lie on your back with your arms crossed over your chest , keeping your knees slightly bent .
Raise your upper body off the floor by contracting your abdominal muscles .
Touch your elbows to your thighs and repeat .
Half Sit-ups
With your hands on your hips , lift your torso off the ground higher than a crunch but not as high as a full sit-up .
Your middle / lower back will be on the floor still at the up position .
Flutterkicks
Place your hands under your hips .
Lift your legs 6 inches off the floor and begin walking , raising each leg approximately 36 inches off the ground .
Keep your legs straight and moving .
This is a four count exercise .
Leg Levers
Lift your feet 6 inches off the floor .
Raising both legs approximately 36 inches off the ground , keep your legs straight and off the floor until specified number of repetitions are complete .
Scissors
Lay on your back .
Lift your feet 6 inches off the floor .
Open and close both legs approximately 36 inches apart , keep your legs straight and off the floor until specified number of repetitions are complete .
Atomic Sit-ups
Lift your feet 6 inches off the floor as if you were doing a leg lever .
Pull your knees toward your chest while simultaneously lifting your upper body off the floor .
This is a mix between the sit - up and the leg lever .

The researchers studied a black hole just as it was sending forth a jet Scientists say they have unlocked some of the secrets behind black holes , the gravitational fields known for sucking up light and stars from the Universe .
In a report in the journal Nature , US researchers say they have worked out how black holes emit jet streams of particles at close to light speed .
The Boston University team say the streams originate in the magnetic field near the edge of the black hole .
They say it is within this region that the jets are accelerated and focused .
Despite the fact that it is probable that a black hole lurks at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy , astronomers still know very little about these celestial monsters which vacuum up almost everything in their path , even light .
Professor Alan Marscher of Boston University and colleagues claim they have delved deeper than ever into their heart .
Using almost every type of telescope known to humankind , Prof Marscher believes he has worked out where and how the jets - or blazars - are formed .
Using an array of 10 powerful radio telescopes , aimed at the galaxy BL Lacertae , the researchers studied a black hole just as it was sending forth a blazar jet .
The astronomers had suspected that the supermassive black hole was spewing out plasma jets in a winding corkscrew , and they say that their observations have now confirmed just that .
" We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the particles actually are accelerated , " Prof Marscher said in a statement .
University of Michigan astronomy professor Hugh Aller , who worked on the project , told Reuters news agency that the process of accelerating the material to nearly the speed of light was similar to what happened in a jet engine .
" We think it is focused by a nozzle of sorts and it comes out at us , " he was quoted by Reuters as saying .
However , the BBC 's science correspondent Neil Bowdler says despite this breakthrough , scientists are no closer to finding what lies within the black hole - beyond what is called the event horizon
In fact , if the theoretical physicists are right , our correspondent says , then we will never be able to see inside these strange phenomena .

A finding of a nationwide survey by TRU , a subsidiary of Research International USA , reveals that when you ’re young and a teenager , fun takes a priority over function .
In its latest survey , TRU asked the youth and the 20 - something crowd what new care they would most like to buy .
The top pick for the teens was the Ford Mustang , while the 20 - something crowd said they would settle for something practical like the Honda Civic .
“ Mustang pops up as No. 1 among teens because it ’s a lot of fun and the parents usually pay the insurance and hand the kids their gasoline credit card , ” said TRU spokesman Rob Callender .
“ Civic pops up among the older 20 - somethings because they pay for their own insurance and gas , so function takes priority . ”
Followed by the Mustang , the other most desired cars by teens followed in this order : Honda Civic , Honda Accord , Volkswagen Beetle , Toyota Camry , Toyota Corolla , Chevy Impala , Ford Focus , Ford F - 150 pickup , Jeep Wrangler , Chevy Silverado pickup , VW Jetta and Nissan Maxima .
Maybe Ford should catering the Mustang towards teens and add a little something - something in the car for the youth .

Editor 's Note : JR Minkel is in St. Louis this week for the annual " April meeting " of the American Physical Society .
See his other blog posts on dark matter , the Higgs boson and the timeline for the Large Hadron Collider , and check back for frequent updates .
ST . LOUIS — Ten years ago , NASA researchers discovered that the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft had fallen slightly behind course during their 35 - year journeys to the outer reaches of the solar system .
In what has become known as the Pioneer anomaly , which was the subject of one of the talks this weekend at the American Physical Society here in St. Louis , nobody knows for sure why it happened .
It probably stemmed from leaking gas or heat .
But there 's also the possibility , however remote , that gravity does n't behave the way we expect .
Until recently , researchers have n't had the data to distinguish the different possibilities .
That changed in 2006 , when NASA physicist Slava Turyshev , a co-discoverer of the anomaly , was visiting a colleague at the NASA Ames Research Center .
The Moffett Field , Calif.–facility was about to throw out hundreds of magnetic disks containing the Pioneer telemetric data — temperature and power readings that the twin craft had sent back to NASA once every few minutes until they traveled out of range .
( NASA finally lost contact with Pioneer 10 in 2003 , after 31 years .
It had lost contact with Pioneer 11 in 1995 . )
Turyshev and his colleagues rescued the data , and Viktor Toth , a computer programmer in Ottawa , Ontario , volunteered to write brand new code that extracted the telemetry readings from the raw 1s and 0s encoded in the magnetic disks .
A group of some 50 researchers , including Turyshev , is now trying to match the data to a detailed computer model of the craft 's inner workings .
The model is designed to mimic the flow of heat and electricity produced by the craft 's generators , which harnessed the heat from radioactive plutonium and turned a fraction of it into electricity to power the craft .
The remaining heat [ see note below ] was lost to space or spread to other parts of the craft such as the antenna , which influenced each probe 's overall momentum .
So far the model accounts for about 30 percent of the observed anomaly for Pioneer 10 at a single distance of 25 astronomical units ( 2.3 billion miles , or 3.7 billion kilometers ) from the sun , Turyshev reported .
The group still has to extend the model to other distances and to Pioneer 11 .
The full verdict may not be in for some time .
" I 'm trying to ensure we apply every relevant piece of information , " Turyshev says .
" It is likely that the thermal explanation will explain part of the anomaly , " he says , but exactly how much is up for grabs .
He notes that the team is also expanding the original analysis that identified the anomaly from 11 years ' worth of transmissions from Pioneer 10 and four years from Pioneer 11 .
Turyshev says the group now has access to 30 and 20 years of data , respectively , and will begin examining it in the coming weeks .
If the anomaly does turn out to have a straightforward explanation , researchers could use it to improve navigation for sensitive space experiments to test gravitational effects , notes programmer Toth .
And if not ?
" If we actually had a means in the solar system here to measure deviations from Einstein 's gravity , that would be phenomenal , " he says .
Note :
This article originally stated incorrectly that modeling had explained 30 percent of the Pioneer anomaly up to a distance of 10 astronomical units ; and that heat from Pioneer 10 produced 160 watts of power .
The average heat energy emitted by the craft was more than two kilowatts .
The first study to follow lead - exposed children from before birth into adulthood has shown that even relatively low levels of lead permanently damage the brain and are linked to higher numbers of arrests , particularly for violent crime .
Earlier studies linking lead to such problems used indirect measures of both lead and criminality , and critics have argued that socioeconomic and other factors may be responsible for the observed effects .
But by measuring blood levels of lead before birth and during the first seven years of life , then correlating the levels with arrest records and brain size , Cincinnati researchers have produced the strongest evidence yet that lead plays a major role in crime .
The researchers also found that lead exposure is a continuing problem despite the efforts of the federal government and cities to minimize exposure .

The average lead levels in the study “ unfortunately are still seen in many thousands of children throughout the United States , ” said Philip J. Landrigan , director of the Center for Children ’s Health and the Environment at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York .
The link between criminal behavior and lead exposure was found among even the least - contaminated children in the study , who were exposed to amounts of lead similar to what the average U.S. child is exposed to today , said Landrigan , who was not involved in the study .
“ People will sometimes say , ‘ This is in the past .
We are cleaning up lead .
We do n’t have lead problems anymore , ’ ” said criminologist Deborah W. Denno of Fordham University in New York , who also was not involved in the study .
“ The Ohio study says this is still a big problem . ”
Nationwide , about 310,000 children between the ages of 1 and 5 have blood lead levels above the federal guideline of 10 micrograms per deciliter , and experts suspect that many times that number have lower levels that are still dangerous .

“ It is a national disgrace that so many children continue to be exposed at levels known to be neurotoxic , ” said neurologist David C. Bellinger of Harvard Medical School , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study published in the online journal PLoS Medicine .
Although some urban soil is still contaminated with lead from gasoline , 80 % of lead exposure now comes from houses built before 1978 .
Paint in such houses can contain as much as 50 % lead , and even if it has been covered by newer , lead - free paint , it still flakes or rubs off .
About 38 million U.S. homes , 40 % of the nation ’s housing , still contain lead - based paint , according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development .
The problem is particularly acute in urban areas , which typically have older housing that has not been renovated .
More recently , parents and authorities have become concerned about increasing levels of lead - based paint in toys imported from China .

Researchers have long known that lead exposure reduces IQ by damaging brain cells in children during their early years .
It is also known that lead increases children ’s distractibility , impulsiveness and restlessness and shortens their attention span , all factors considered precursors of aggressive or violent behavior .
A landmark 1990 paper by Denno linked lead to increases in criminal behavior , but the children in the study were not tested for lead levels .
The diagnoses were based on their physicians ’ evaluation , Denno said .
The Cincinnati lead study enrolled 376 pregnant women in Cincinnati ’s inner city between 1979 and 1984 , measuring their blood lead levels during pregnancy and the children ’s levels during their first seven years of life .

In the new study , environmental health researcher Kim N. Dietrich of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine studied 250 of the original group , correlating their lead levels with adult criminal arrest records from Hamilton County , Ohio .
He and his colleagues found that 55 % of the subjects ( 63 % of males ) had been arrested and that the average was five arrests between the ages of 18 and 24 .
The higher the blood lead level at any time in childhood , the greater the likelihood of arrests .
“ The strongest association was with violent criminal activity -- murder , rape , domestic violence , assault , robbery and possession of weapons , ” Dietrich said .
Blood lead levels in the children ranged from 4 to 37 micrograms per deciliter .

The researchers found , for example , that every 5 - microgram - per - deciliter increase in blood lead levels at age 6 was accompanied by a 50 % increase in the incidence of violent crime later in life .
Confirming previous findings , the effect of lead was strongest in males , who had an arrest rate 4 1/2 times that of females .
In a related study , spectroscopist Kim M. Cecil of Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center and her colleagues examined a “ representative sample ” of 157 members of the same group using whole - brain MRI scans .
They found that those with the highest blood levels of lead during childhood had the smallest brain volume .
On average , the brains of those in the study were about 1.2 % smaller than normal .
The most affected regions of the brain were those regulating decision making , impulse control , attention , error detection , task completion and reward - based decision making .
“ The most important message is that lead affects brain volume , independent of demographic and social factors that are often used to explain away poor outcomes ” in life , Cecil said .
“ This is independent biological evidence showing that the brain is affected by lead . ”

( Adds Bodman comments , background on margins )
WASHINGTON , May 23 ( Reuters ) - Significantly raising margin requirements on oil futures trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange NMX.N would not rein in speculative investors and bring down crude prices , U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said on Friday .
Many U.S. lawmakers blame hedge funds , pension fund managers and other speculative investors for pushing up prices for crude oil and other commodities to record levels .
“ I do n’t think that the margin requirements per se are going to have any impact on it , ” Bodman said in an interview on CNBC television .
Legislation is pending in the U.S. Senate that would require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates NYMEX , to significantly raise the amount of money , or margin , that speculators have to put up to trade oil futures .
The bill does not specify how high margins should be increased , leaving it up to the CFTC to decide .
However , the CFTC has told Congress that , while more speculators are doing business in the futures markets , the agency has no evidence they have caused prices to rise .
When purchasing stocks , many brokerage firms require investors to have between 30 percent and 40 percent of the market value of the securities in margin accounts .
Margin requirements for futures are generally lower , less than 10 percent for many contracts , and often change depending on the volatility of the contracts .
Separately , Bodman said he supported broadening some regulatory powers of the CFTC , which this week was given new authority from Congress to monitor and collect more information on some of the energy trading going on in exempt commercial markets , such as the Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N.

Alcohol Suppresses Brain Response To Fearful Faces
Alcohol makes us somewhat blind to the meaning of facial expressions .
Working with a dozen healthy participants who drink socially , research fellow Jodi Gilman , working with senior author Daniel Hommer , MD , at the National Institutes on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to study activity in emotion - processing brain regions during alcohol exposure .
Over two 45 - minute periods , the study participants received either alcohol or a saline solution intravenously and were shown images of fearful facial expressions .
( Previous studies have shown that expressions of fear signal a threatening situation and activate specific brain regions . )
The same group of participants received both alcohol and placebo , on two separate days .
Comparing brain activity , Gilmans team found that when participants received the placebo infusion , fearful facial expressions spurred greater activity than neutral expressions in the amygdala , insula , and parahippocampal gyrus brain regions involved in fear and avoidance as well as in the brains visual system .
However , these regions showed no increased brain activity when the participants were intoxicated .
In addition , alcohol activated striatal areas of the brain that are important components of the reward system .
This confirms previous findings and supports the idea that activation of the brains reward system is a common feature of all drugs of abuse .
Gilmans team found that the level of striatal activation was associated with how intoxicated the participants reported feeling .
These striatal responses help account for the stimulating and addictive properties of alcohol .
Does alcohol have a similar suppressive effect in reaction to a happy face ?
Or does it amplify our emotional response to happy smiling people ?
A hobbled ability to detect threats can get one into trouble .
 The key finding of this study is that after alcohol exposure , threat - detecting brain circuits cant tell the difference between a threatening and non-threatening social stimulus ,  said Marina Wolf , PhD , at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science , who was unaffiliated with the study .
 At one end of the spectrum , less anxiety might enable us to approach a new person at a party .
But at the other end of the spectrum , we may fail to avoid an argument or a fight .
By showing that alcohol exerts this effect in normal volunteers by acting on specific brain circuits , these study results make it harder for someone to believe that risky decision - making after alcohol doesnt apply to me ,  Wolf said .
Do some people have minds that naturally fail to identify threatening or fearful or angry faces ?
Can one lack this ability yet still have the ability to identify happy faces or faces that communicate other emotional states ?
My guess is that some of these facial expression reading abilities vary separately from each other .
Congress is finally moving to shut one of the more egregious forms of Iraq war profiteering : defense contractors using offshore shell companies to avoid paying their fair share of payroll taxes .
The practice is widespread and Congressional investigators have been dispatched to one of the prime tax refuges , the Cayman Islands , to seek a firsthand estimate of how much the Treasury is being shorted .
No one will be surprised to hear that one of the suspected prime offenders is KBR , the Texas - based defense contractor , formerly a part of the Halliburton conglomerate allied with Vice President Dick Cheney .
According to a report in The Boston Globe , KBR , which has landed billions in Iraq contracts , has used two Cayman shell companies to avoid paying hundreds of millions in payroll , Medicare and unemployment taxes .
Unfortunately right now there is nothing illegal about this .
The House has approved legislation to plug the dodge by treating foreign subsidiaries of defense contractors as what they are  American employers required to pay taxes .
The Senate must quickly follow suit and not buy the contractors ’ line that listing American workers at offshore companies is a cost saving passed on patriotically to the war effort .
No less insulting , the Cayman dodge has been blocking Americans from the protection of labor and anti-discrimination laws .
The House has taken on another shamefully common abuse : voting to deny future government contracts to any company that fails to pay its corporate taxes , including an estimated 25,000 defense contractors keeping billions due the Treasury .
The Senate should approve that legislation as well .
" It 's very dark .
It 's almost black . "
May Woodward , an office worker in central London , is holding an Oreo cookie in her hands .
It 's the first time she has ever seen one " in the flesh as opposed to on an American TV show , " and she 's not sure she likes what she sees .
" It 's the color of wet mud ! " she complains .
" And the bit ... looks like toothpaste rather than cream . "
She twists and turns the cookie in her fingers , staring at it from every angle with a screwed - up look on her face that seems to say , " Gross ! " not " Mmm , cookie time . "
You could be forgiven for thinking she 's handling some dangerous alien element , Cookie Kryptonite , say , rather than one of the best - known biscuits in the Western hemisphere .
She bites , chews , raises an eyebrow , chews some more .
" OK , I get it , " she says , finally .
" I can see the attraction .
It 's very sweet . "
Suddenly she seems to change her mind .
" Actually it 's too sweet ... it 's becoming mushy , " she says , alarmed as tentative chewing becomes frantic munching to wolf the cookie down .
My impromptu taste test in Leicester Square is now attracting the attention of puzzled passersby giving us weird looks .
Ms. Woodward 's verdict is that the Oreo is " too ... damp . "
I tell her that , according to the ads , it should be " dunked " before eaten .
" In tea ? " she asks .
( Dipping biscuits – we Brits call all cookies " biscuits ' – in a steaming hot cup of tea is an almost sacred ritual here . )
" No , in milk , " I reply .
" Milk ?!
A biscuit dipped in milk ?
Who does that ? "
" Apparently Americans do , " I explain .
" Well , let them , " she say dismissively .
" I wo n't be doing it anytime soon . "
And with that , she disappears into a throng of pedestrians , nonplussed by what has been labeled here as " America 's Favorite Cookie . "

The Oreo has landed in Britain .
And it is giving rise to a furious Battle of the Biscuits .
The classic sandwich cookie may be as familiar and nostalgia - inducing as , well , Mom 's apple pie for Americans , but the majority of us here have never seen or tasted one .
Until now .
Now , Kraft , the makers of what some Brits refer to as " the black - and - white biscuit " is launching it across the United Kingdom in an advertising campaign that makes it hard for anyone who lives and breathes to avoid the Oreo message .
Big blue - and - white posters on the sides of our iconic red buses implore us to " Twist Lick Dunk . "
A new TV commercial shows a young boy teaching his scruffy dog how to eat an Oreo : " First you twist it .
Then you lick it .
Mmm .
Then you dunk it , " he says , sploshing his Oreo into a glass of milk .
This will be the first time that many Brits have seen a biscuit dipped in milk .
Supermarkets nationwide are promoting Oreos right at the checkout stands where the wait gives shoppers time to contemplate the curiosity .
Kraft hopes the Oreo will capture Britain as it has America ( with 419 billion Oreos sold since they first appeared in 1912 ) .
Since its 1996 launch in China , the Oreo has become the No. 1 biscuit in that vast country .
But the Chinese Oreo is very different from the American one – it has less sugar and it is a crispy cream - filled wafer .
The version being launched in Britain is the exact same as the American one .
Only the packaging has changed .
At 74 pence ( $ 1.44 ) a go , we Brits will get our Oreos in a long , thin tube .
No biscuit in Britain is as dark as an Oreo – even the classic Bourbon , two thin chocolate biscuits with a chocolate filling , is light brown .
So admits Jocelyn McNulty , director of UK biscuits at Kraft Foods .
Some Britons might think the Oreo is strange - looking at first .
But she 's confident that they will fall for the Oreo and what she calls the " child - like , delightful ritual " of licking the cream and dipping it in milk .
Others disagree .
One tabloid newspaper has attacked those " Yanks " who are trying to " snatch the biscuit from our mouths and replace [ it ] with a tackier piece of inferior confectionary . "
Another described the Oreo as " an imperial juggernaut of a biscuit backed by one of the world 's biggest food companies . "
Blimey .
Will we Brits soon be twisting , licking , and dunking like there 's no tomorrow or erecting biscuit embargoes against the colonial cookie ?
• • •
Britain is more than just a " biscuit market , " warns Stuart Payne , author of " A Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down . "
" There is a long history and culture in the way we consume our biscuits , and Oreo will have an uphill struggle convincing us to change our ways , " he says .
We Brits are biscuit -mad .
The British Department of Trade and Industry estimates that $ 3.1 billion is spent on biscuits here annually , and one newspaper estimated that the average Briton eats 1.5 tons of biscuits and cakes in his lifetime .
There 's the aforementioned chocolatey Bourbon ; the Custard Cream , a vanilla - flavored biscuit with a baroque design stamped on it ; the Rich Tea , a plain biscuit perfect for dunking in hot tea or coffee ; the Jammie Dodger , a round shortbread sandwich of sticky raspberry jam .
( My mouth watered as I typed that sentence . )
" Some of these biscuits have a history of 150 years , " says Mr. Payne .
He describes British biscuits as " thoroughbreds " specially designed – in a Darwinian process of the survival of the dippiest – over generations to suit British tastes .
For example , he notes , " Our love of tea - dipping has influenced the selection of flour and the temperature at which biscuits are baked .
Our biscuits are built for dunking . "
Yet the Oreo , because of its high - sugar content , is " woeful " when it comes to being dunked in tea , he says .
" In my experience , it dissolves .
It 's not a survivor in tea terms like the British biscuit is . "
Eating biscuits in a certain way is part of British culture , says Payne .
It goes back to the days when lots of people worked in factories , and the only thing they could squeeze into their 10 - minute breaks was " a cup of tea and two Rich Tea biscuits . "
Biscuits had to be sturdy and satisfy hunger .
Payne 's not convinced that Oreo can take on such a deep - rooted culture in which only the toughest , tea - complementing biscuits survive , in a society where offering someone a plate of Rich Tea , Custard Creams , or Jammie Dodgers is a way of expressing friendship , love , and concern .
• • •
Yet in a taste test in Borehamwood , north London , I found plenty of Oreo fans .
" They are absolutely yummy , " said Anita Rawal , a personal assistant .
" Our whole family likes them .
My mother - in - law had to send them from Nepal before they were available here . "
It seems that younger kids not so attached to the old Rich Tea culture , are especially keen on the new black - and - white invader .
" My kid loves them he could eat them all day , " observes Shak Shakir , a sales consultant .
Still , Faizaan Sackett , a recruitment consultant , has found himself " raging " at Oreo ads on buses , seeing them as part of " the American invasion of snacks .
" Before we know it , the next generation of kids will not know the word biscuit at all , " he grumbles .
" Whether it 's fast food , TV chat - shows , or cookies , we must resist all that is American for the sake of our own souls . "

Back near Leicester Square in a small supermarket , a woman takes a tube of Oreos off the shelf , briefly reads the label , and plops it in her shopping basket .
I wonder if she knows that she has just unwittingly fired a shot in the cookie war .
Probably not .
She may just like to try a different sort of snack every now and then .
There have been minor scuffles and scattered arrests as thousands of demonstrators watch the Olympic torch relay on its way through Canberra .
Two members of the controversial tracksuited Chinese guards ran with the torch as it made its way along the route , but Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) officers initially appeared to be shepherding them as far away from the torch as possible .
There had been confusion over the attendants ' role in the run-up to the relay , with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd pledging that no Chinese personnel would be allowed to provide security and Olympic officials saying they would be on hand to act as " human shields " in the event of any trouble .
The AFP men later appeared to relent and allow the Chinese attendants to run alongside and assist with the handover of the torch between bearers .
There have been at least four arrests and one man was detained when he set fire to a Chinese flag , drawing angry protests from nearby pro-China demonstrators .
Another protester was dragged aside by AFP officers a few hundred metres from Parliament House after he threw himself on the ground ahead of a torchbearer .
Two pro-Tibet women charged the torch convoy as it neared Parliament House and were dragged away by police as one yelled : " They 're torturing my country " .
The thousands of Chinese protesters vastly outnumbered the pro-Tibetans , with Chinese flags dominating Reconciliation Place and the route of the relay .
Pro-China demonstrators waved flags and spelled out ' OneChina ' in red on a lawn alongside the relay route .
Sky News reported that Parliament House had gone into lock - down during the relay .
But security has not been as tight as it has been on international legs of the relay , with just a small number of AFP officers running alongside each bearer .
Police were forced to intervene at the start of the relay when protesters on either side threw projectiles , including full water bottles , at each other .
As the torch started its journey in the hands of 2007 Young Australian of the Year Tania Major with a trip across Lake Burley Griffin in a rowboat , the words ' Free Tibet ' were written across the sky by a skywriting plane .
Ms Major said the atmosphere at the start of the relay was overwhelming .
" I was actually a bit nervous and excited , given I had everyone in my face and screaming and the emotions around me and the security by my side , " she said .
Earlier there was a traditional welcome to country ceremony and a cleansing and smoking ceremony from the local Aboriginal community .
Local Aboriginal elder Matilda House gave the traditional welcome to the relay .
" The eyes of the world are on us , on our country here today , " she said .
" To those of you , especially those who have travelled from afar , soak up this beauty , soak up this beautiful land . "
Pro-Tibetan protesters say many of the Chinese demonstrators have been bussed in by the Chinese embassy .
The head of the Canberra torch relay committee admitted organisers were caught by surprise by organised Chinese support for the torch .
" We did n't expect this reaction from the Chinese community , " committee head Ted Quinlan admitted .

Schoolboys and man remanded over savage park murder of teenager as his family say he was the light of their lives
Beaten to death : Amar Aslam , 17 , suffered horrific injuries after being attacked in a park
Three schoolboys were remanded over the savage murder and robbery of Amar Aslam today as his family paid tribute to the boy they said had ' lit up ' their lives .
The three teenagers , all aged 15 , and another man aged 20 appeared before Dewsbury Magistrates '
Court where they were remanded in custody until June 5 .
Their hearing came hours before Amar 's heartbroken family paid an emotional visit to the place where he died .
His sisters Samreen and Zarieh and his cousin Raja Majid laid flowers in the walled garden in Crow Nest Park in Dewsbury , West Yorkshire , where his body was found on Sunday night .
Amar , 17 , was called ' Moon ' by his family because he brought such light into their lives , they revealed .
Breaking down in tears , Samreen said : ' Our Moon may have gone and without any doubt he will be missed but will never be forgotten .
May he rest in peace in heaven . '
A statement read out by Mr Majid on behalf of Mrs Aslam added : ' My Moon has gone , he has made my life darker forever , he has left me heartbroken . '
Her daughters said she was now thinking of leaving Britain because she was so devastated by the teenager 's death .
Sister Samreen said her brother was killed just two days after getting his driving licence and had been so excited about learning to drive .
A fan of music and cars , he had been saving money to buy himself a vehicle , she told reporters .
Grieving : Amar 's sisters Samreen and Zarish comfort each other today as they visit the spot where he died
She added : " Amar was a loving and special brother .
He was the baby of the family , he was very close to his sisters and his mother .
' He was so caring and sensitive , he would always look after us like a mature older brother .
' Our loving baby brother has gone forever and our lives are painful and meaningless .
' Nothing can replace our brother and we still believe he will walk through the door smiling like he always used to do .
It will never be the same without him . '
The four men accused of killing Amar will appear in court again next Thursday .
Three other youths arrested in connection with his murder have been released on police bail pending further inquiries .
Remanded : Suspects accused of murdering Amar arriving at Dewsbury Magistrates ' Court today
Family and friends packed out the courtroom as the defendants were led into the dock in handcuffs for a brief hearing today .
None of the four , who have not been named , showed any emotion as the charges were read out to the court .
The court clerk revealed Amar was allegedly killed for cash worth just £ 10 , his mobile phone and a silver chain .
The four defendants spoke only to confirm their names and addresses , which can not be released for legal reasons .
No applications for bail were made .
They were all charged early this morning after the 17 - year - old died from head injuries on Sunday .
Crime scene : Police officers search Crows Nest Park in Dewsbury , where Amar was murdered
James Taylor , 13 , performed first aid on the teenager after finding his lifeless body in a walled garden of the park .
He said : ' I just wanted to see if he was all right , if he was OK .
He was lying on his side - but not breathing .
I put my head next to his but could n't hear anything .
' My friend rang 999 and they told him how to do CPR .
I tried pushing on his chest to see if he started breathing but nothing happened .
So we waited for the ambulance and kept him in a good position . '
Amar was repeatedly struck over the head with a lump of wood after allegedly being confronted by a group of youths looking for money and drugs .
Police have been told the ' sustained and brutal ' attack was captured on mobile phone and are now trying to find the crucial evidence .
Residents have insisted Amar was not a troublemaker but a home - loving boy who spent most of his time alone .
A neighbour said : ' He did n't like confrontation , he was so shy he would cross the road to avoid speaking to you . '
' Amar was slimly built , he had some illnesses in the past and even looked frail . '
He was last seen by another teenager standing outside some shops near to the park on Sunday night .
His body was found at 7.10 pm .
Amar is the youngest of the Aslams ' four children .
His father was in Pakistan when he was told about the murder but was returning to Britain to be with his wife .
Woman sues Ohio sheriff 's deputy over ' outrageous ' strip search Adam Doster
Published : Saturday February 2 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Hope Steffey 's night started with a call to police for help .
It ended with her face down , naked , and sobbing on a jail cell floor .
Now , the sheriff 's deputies from Stark County , Ohio who allegedly used excessive force during a strip search 15 months ago face a federal lawsuit , and recently released video wont help their case .
Steffey 's ordeal with the Stark County sheriff 's deputies began after her cousin called 9 - 1 - 1 claiming Steffey had been assaulted by another one of their cousins .
When a Stark County police officer arrived , he asked to see Steffey 's driver 's license .
But instead of handing over her own ID , she mistakenly turned over her dead sister 's license , which she contends she keeps in her wallet as a memento .
That 's when the situation became complicated .
" Hope was not treated as a victim , " her lawyer told WKYC News .
" The officer said to her ' shut up about your dead sister . ' "
Eventually , Steffey was arrested and taken to the Stark County Jail , charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest .
But once in custody , her attorney says seven jail workers , male and female , forcibly removed Steffey of all her clothes , including her undergarments , while she lay face down in handcuffs .
Local news footage shows Steffey wailing , asking " What are you doing ? ! ? "
" And you have to ask yourself , what was the purpose of the strip search ? " said Steffey 's lawyer .
" What was the necessity of it ?
This was a disorderly conduct claim . "
The lawsuit says that Steffey remained in the cell for six hours and wrapped herself in toilet paper to stay warm .
During that time , she was not allowed to use a phone or seek medical assistance for injuries she accrued that night , including a cracked tooth , bulging disc , and bruises .
Although the sheriff 's policy requires officers conducting any strip search to be of the same sex , the sheriff contends that the tactic used on Steffey was not actually a strip search .
He also questions the validiy of the events leading up to Steffeys arrest .
Once shown the exclusive video , Steffeys husband was in disbelief .
" You do n't treat people like this , " he said .
" I do n't think murderers are treated like this . "

Just when you thought you ’d never find the perfect small form factor notebook for less than $ 1,000 , HP comes to the table with the all new 2133 Mini-Note .
This ultra mobile subnotebook features an impressive 8.9 - inch screen , a remarkably large keyboard , a full - sized notebook hard drive , and plenty of impressive specs .
( view large image )
Is this the perfect road warrior machine ?
Let ’s take a closer look and find out .
Table of Contents
Build and Design
The HP 2133 Mini-Note has a great design .
Everyone in our office agreed that it has a solid chassis and attractive look .
( view large image )
The brushed aluminum and plastic casing is durable and hides fingerprints well .
It also keeps the Mini-Note lightweight , only weighing in around 2.86 lbs as configured .
It has that sleek business appeal , but is targeted toward students as well .
One look at the Mini -Note and I can see why .
I mean , who would n’t want an inexpensive subnotebook to tote back and forth to class , especially one that pretty much has a full - size keyboard .
HP did n’t go wrong with the design .
The 8.9 " WXGA display is beautiful and easy to read .
It puts off a glare though because of the protective coating .
Nothing about the Mini - Note feels cheap .
I did n’t notice any signs of flex and enjoyed its good variety of ports and features .
The Mini-Note also comes with different hard drive options , so hopefully this might help in the performance section , considering the Mini-Note sports a VIA C7 - M ULV processor .
( view large image )
As I mentioned above , the keyboard is almost full size .
It is 92 % of a full sized keyboard , which is quite impressive for such a small form factor .
It is much more comfortable to type on compared to the Asus Eee PC .
The touchpad can be awkward though , especially the placement of the right and left click buttons .
It does have a neat power and Wi-Fi switch that lights up and changes from blue when on to orange when off .
While some consumers might be upset at the absence of a DVD drive in the Mini-Note , that ’s just one trade - off you have to make for such a compact design .
In truth , there simply is n’t any room left inside the Mini - Note after everything is said and done .
If you ’re interested in a quick overview of the HP 2133 Mini-Note , we ’ve provided this short video below :
Screen
Compared to the screens on other subnotebooks priced below $ 1,000 , the screen on the HP 2133 Mini-Note is beyond beautiful .
Most notebooks that we review ( regardless of size or price ) would be lucky to have a screen like this .
( view large image ) ( view large image )
Contrast is excellent , backlighting is even across the surface without any bleeding around the edges , colors are saturated and crisp , and viewing angles are relatively nice .
The 1280 by 768 pixel resolution is likewise exceptional given the small size of this notebook .
Text is a little smaller than what most consumers would prefer , but this is a minor inconvenience considering the fact that you can display a complete webpage on the LCD exactly as it was meant to be displayed .
The only issue that caused concern with the screen on the Mini-Note was the use of an additional protective layer of glossy plastic over the screen .
While this helps protect the display , the unfortunate side effect is significant reflection .
We ’re not talking about a typical glossy screen .
We ’re talking about a screen with a completely separate glossy layer applied over it .
( view large image )
When viewing the display your eyes naturally shift focus between what is being displayed on the screen and what is being reflected in the glossy surface of the second layer over the screen .
Since these images are on a slightly different focal plane you can easily develop eye strain and headaches .
I actually developed a mild headache after less than two hours of using this notebook .
To the right is a sample image to illustrate the screen reflections on the Mini-Note .
The reflections on the screen are n’t noticeable at all in a dark room , but most people do n’t use their notebooks in the dark unless they ’re just watching movies .
If you are n’t sensitive to reflections then the screen is beautiful when viewed from straight ahead .
Keyboard and Touchpad
The keyboard on the 2133 Mini-Note is great .
To put it plainly , this is the best keyboard we ’ve seen on a notebook this small .
( view large image )
The keys have a silver finish and are smooth to the touch .
There is n’t a textured feel to the keyboard .
The best thing though is how big it is .
I mean , it almost is a full - sized keyboard , so writing papers on this thing is a breeze .
No spelling errors due to hitting the wrong keys .
We did n’t notice any signs of flex and really liked that most of the keys were full sized except a few .
The tilde key and the number one key are smaller than the rest of the numbers , which was quite odd .
The space bar was relatively small too .
The touchpad was awkward .
Response time was a little slow sometimes , but it is easy to navigate with .
The right and left click buttons are what get you .
The buttons are located on the sides of the touchpad , which take some time to get used too .
I forgot what I am clicking on sometimes .
I would have liked the palm rest area to be a little bigger , so the buttons could have been relocated below the touchpad like on standard notebooks or the Eee PC .
The button above the touchpad is a convenient feature that turns the touchpad off and makes it inactive when you are typing .
Input and Output Ports
Of course , one minor compromise you have to make with the ultra-mobile form factor of the Mini-Note is that the laptop cannot accommodate the standard array of ports you ’ll find on other notebooks .
Still , HP did manage to include a reasonable number of ports .
The complete list includes :
1x ExpressCard / 54 slot
Secure Digital ( SD ) card reader
2x USB 2.0 ports
VGA out
Power connector
RJ-45/Ethernet
Stereo headphone / line out
Stereo microphone / line in
Here is a quick tour around the HP 2133 Mini-Note :

Performance and Benchmarks
After the impressive build and design of the HP 2133 Mini-Note we expected to see a likewise impressive level of performance coming out of this tiny titan .
Unfortunately , performance is one area where the Mini -Note falls short .
On paper the 1.6 GHz VIA C7 - M processor should provide excellent speed for general computing tasks .
In reality , web pages rendered slower than expected , multi-tasking was painfully slow , and most processor - hungry applications like Photoshop or video encoding software just did n’t like the VIA processor .
Our standard range of synthetic benchmark tests likewise did n’t play very nice with the VIA processor and VIA Chrome 9 integrated graphics .
While synthetic benchmarks do n’t always give you an accurate measure of a system ’s real - world performance , these benchmarks do give you a good idea of how the HP Mini-Note performs compared to other laptops currently on the market .
While the benchmark numbers certainly are n’t " bad " it ’s hard to get excited about these numbers when you factor in that this configuration of the HP Mini-Note costs more than $ 750 .
With that said , let ’s jump into the benchmarks .
PCMark05 measures overall system performance ( higher scores mean better performance ) :
Notebook PCMark05 Score HP 2133 Mini-Note ( 1.6 GHz VIA C7 - M ULV ) 801 PCMarks HTC Shift ( 800 MHz Intel A110 ) 891 PCMarks Asus Eee PC 4G ( 630 MHz Intel Celeron M ULV ) 908 PCMarks Asus Eee PC 4G ( 900 MHz Intel Celeron M ULV ) 1,132 PCMarks Everex CloudBook ( 1.2 GHz VIA C7 - M ULV ) 612 PCMarks Sony VAIO TZ ( 1.20 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 ) 2,446 PCMarks Fujitsu LifeBook P7230 ( 1.2 GHz Intel Core Solo U1400 ) 1,152 PCMarks Sony VAIO VGN - G11XN / B ( 1.33 GHz Core Solo U1500 ) 1,554 PCMarks Toshiba Portege R500 ( 1.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 ) 1,839 PCMarks
w Prime processor comparison results ( lower scores mean better performance ) :

Another factor to keep in mind when judging the overall system performance is the operating system being used .
Our pre-production review unit was using Windows Vista Business and , like most notebooks using Windows Vista , performance likely suffers as a result .
Here is a short video comparing the startup time of the HP Mini-Note with Vista against the Asus Eee PC with XP :
While you may argue our justification for comparing a notebook with Vista against a notebook with XP , this is a valid comparison because it demonstrates what consumers will experience " out of the box " with two notebooks targeted at similar customers .
Audio
( view large image )
The built - in speaker performance on the Mini-Note was quite superior compared to other notebooks in this class .
The audio is excellent for watching short video clips or web conferencing , but it ’s also loud enough to enjoy music or full - length movies with distortion - free sound using the built - in speakers .
Of course , for the best possible audio performance you ’ll want to use external speakers or headphones .
The audio output via the headphone jack is quite good and provides excellent , distortion - free sound for headphones or external speakers .
Heat and Noise
The ultra low voltage VIA processor in the HP 2133 Mini-Note generated far more heat than we typically expect from ultra low voltage processors .
Temperature readings taken from the outside of the aluminum and plastic chassis spiked above 110 degrees Fahrenheit in multiple locations , and the Mini-Note actually became uncomfortable to hold after 30 - 45 minutes of serious use .
The cooling fan ran at full speed most of the time , and clearly struggled to keep temperatures under control .
Most of the time the fan is only loud enough to hear in a perfectly quiet environment , but if you work in a relatively quiet office or classroom setting you should be prepared for co-workers and students to complain about the noise .
Below are images indicating the temperature readings from the HP 2133 Mini-Note ( listed in degrees Fahrenheit ) taken inside our office where the ambient temperature was 75 degrees Fahrenheit :
Battery Life
Overall , the HP 2133 Mini-Note did a reasonable job in terms of power management .
With the Mini-Note connected to a Wi -Fi network and browsing the web on the " balanced " power setting with the display at about 50 percent brightness , we obtained 2 hours and 15 minutes of battery life with the standard 3 - cell battery .
Using the same settings we obtained 4 hours and 11 minutes of battery life with the 6 - cell extended life battery .
Bottom line , the Mini-Note makes an excellent mobile companion with the extended life battery .
The only possible negative to using the extended life battery is that the larger 6 - cell battery sticks out from the bottom of the notebook , adding both size and weight .
However , this also provides an advantage since it provides a more ergonomic angle to the keyboard for typing .
Pricing
Pricing for the HP 2133 Mini-Note range from as little as $ 500 for the 1.0 GHz VIA processor , 512 MB of RAM and a 4 GB PATA Flash module with Linux , to $ 750 for the 1.6 GHz VIA processor , 2 GB of RAM and a 120 GB 5400 rpm hard drive running Windows Vista Business .
HP will also be offering a version of the Mini-Note with a 160 GB 7200 rpm hard drive ( which is the configuration we received for review ) but that pricing was unavailable at the time of this writing .
Still , it ’s safe to assume the price for this configuration will be more than $ 750 .
Conclusion
The HP 2133 Mini-Note is one of the most impressive subnotebooks we ’ve ever seen .
Unfortunately , the amazing design and solid range of features are diminished by a sub-par processor and a price tag that places this notebook dangerously close to far superior 12 - inch notebooks such as the HP tx2000 .
HP managed to create the single most impressive ultraportable notebook on the market … and then decided to put a lackluster processor inside .
Despite the poor processor performance , the HP 2133 Mini-Note is a remarkably solid machine that could be a perfect fit for students , teachers , or mobile business professionals .
If HP decides to replace the VIA processors with the new Intel Atom processors or alternative processors from Intel , the Mini-Note would become the undisputed champion of the subnotebook market .
Pros :
The most attractive 8.9 - inch notebook we ’ve ever seen
Excellent build quality
Great keyboard
ExpressCard slot offers fantastic expansion possibilities
Multiple configuration options
Cons :
VIA processor just does n’t perform well
Windows Vista might be too much for the VIA processor and graphics
Strange location for touchpad buttons
Screen is too reflective due to second glossy protective layer
Aluminum and plastic casing gets a little too hot
Price is a little too much for what you get

Algebrization : A New Barrier in Complexity Theory
Any proof of P!=NP will have to overcome two barriers : relativization
and natural proofs .
Yet over the last decade , we have seen circuit
lower bounds ( for example , that PP does not have linear - size circuits )
that overcome both barriers simultaneously .
So the question arises of
whether there is a third barrier to progress on the central questions in
complexity theory .
In this paper we present such a barrier , which we call algebraic
relativization or algebrization .
The idea is that , when we relativize
some complexity class inclusion , we should give the simulating machine
access not only to an oracle A , but also to the low - degree extension of
A over a finite field or ring .
We systematically go through basic results and open problems in
complexity theory to delineate the power of the new algebrization
barrier .
First , we show that all known non-relativizing results based
on arithmetization -- both inclusions such as IP=PSPACE and MIP=NEXP ,
and separations such as MA - EXP not in P / poly -- do indeed algebrize .
Second , we show that almost all of the major open problems -- including
P versus NP , P versus RP , and NEXP versus P/ poly -- will require
non-algebrizing techniques .
In some cases algebrization seems to
explain exactly why progress stopped where it did : for example , why we
have superlinear circuit lower bounds for PromiseMA but not for NP .
Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in a new model of
algebraic query complexity , which we introduce in this paper and which
is interesting in its own right .
Some of our lower bounds use direct
combinatorial and algebraic arguments , while others stem from a
surprising connection between our model and communication complexity .
Using this connection , we are also able to give an MA - protocol for the
Inner Product function with O ( sqrt ( n ) log(n ) ) communication ( essentially
matching a lower bound of Klauck ) , as well as a communication complexity
conjecture whose truth would imply NL !=NP .
Once a week , Deborah McCoy , a third - grade teacher in Donnelly , Idaho , unpacks chessboards and pieces and spends an hour teaching her 20 students how to play the game .
Mrs. McCoy does not do this because she is passionate about chess ; she barely knew how to play before this school year .
But she began teaching it as part of an unusual pilot program under way in more than 100 second - and third - grade classrooms across Idaho .
On Thursday , state officials will announce in Boise that the program will be extended in the fall to all second and third graders  making Idaho the first state to offer a statewide chess curriculum .
The state ’s $ 1.5 billion education budget , passed two weeks ago , includes up to $ 60,000 to finance the instruction .
Tom Luna , the state ’s superintendent of education , said participation by teachers would be voluntary , but if reaction to the pilot program is any measure , interest will be great .
StyleTap today officially confirmed that they plan to bring a version of its StyleTap CrossPlatform environment to the iPhone and the iPod touch platform .
The move will essentially bring thousands of Palm OS apps over to the new iPhone platform .
Back in February StyleTap released a video demo of the StyleTap running Palm OS apps on a iPod Touch .
The company says they have been overwhelmed by the level of interest and the video has been viewed over 800,000 times .
" The iPhone is one of the hottest new mobile devices out there , " said Gregory Sokoloff , CEO of StyleTap Inc. , " And the response to our video has convinced us that many , many consumers , and companies , will eagerly jump at the change to buy iPhone devices if they can continue to run their must - have applications . "
According to the company technically , StyleTap CrossPlatform is an excellent fit with the iPhone , as the powerful processor and large screen allows applications written for Palm OS devices to run at full speed and at full screen resolution .
The iPhone touch screen technology works in a very natural way with mobile applications originally designed for touch screen devices .
Further information about the product , including how it will be marketed and sold , will be made available in early July 2008 according to the company .
StyleTap will also be on hands at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , CA from June 9 - 13 , 2008 , and will be available to meet with mobile application developers interested in learning more about StyleTap CrossPlatform for the Apple devices .
Japanese scientists have designed artificial molecules that reversed liver cirrhosis in rats .
Cirrhosis is a hardening or scarring of the liver that occurs when liver cells begin producing collagen , a fibrous material found in skin and tendons .
The researchers said they designed molecules that block collagen production by the liver ’s “ stellate cells , ” which are also known to absorb vitamin A .
The scientists loaded these molecules into vitamin- A coated carriers , which tricked the stellate cells into absorbing the molecules .
“ By packaging the ( molecules ) in carriers coated with vitamin A , they tricked the stellate cells into letting in the inhibitor , which shut down collagen secretion , ” the researchers wrote in a report about their work .
During the study , the researchers injected the vitamin A - laced molecules in rats with induced liver cirrhosis .
“ We were able to completely eradicate the fibrosis by injecting this agent … we cured them of the cirrhosis , ” said Yoshiro Niitsu of Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine , during a telephone interview with Reuters .
“ The liver is such an important organ , after you remove the fibrosis , the liver by itself starts to regenerate tissues .
So liver damage is reversible , ” he added .
“ Liver is itself responsible for the production and deposition of collagen , it also secretes certain enzymes that dissolve collagen … dissolve the fibrosis which has already been deposited in the tissues , ” Niitsu said , explaining the how the damage reversal came about .
Cirrhosis is often caused by Hepatitis B and C , or by heavy drinking , and is especially serious in parts of Asia .
Until now , liver damage from cirrhosis was thought to be irreversible , and the disease cured only with transplants .
But Niitsu is optimistic that in time the molecules would provide a cure .
“ We hope it ( a drug ) will be ready for humans in a few years , ” he said .

What happened ?
How did America go from the world ’s leader to not even an also - ran in the span of just two decades ?
Equally troubling , why did no one sound the alarm bell when there was still time for action ?

" Raw Politics " on " Anderson Cooper 360 " delivers the latest political news with a wry sense of a humor and without spin .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
For decades , evangelicals have been seen as solid supporters of the Republican Party .
That could be changing .
The religious right , a cornerstone of the so - called Reagan revolution -- the battle over abortion law , and gay marriage -- wants a change .
At least some evangelicals do .
A group of influential Christian leaders are declaring they are tired of divisive politics , tired of watching fights over some issues trump all the good they could be doing .
" Our proposal in [ our ] manifesto is to join forces with all those who support a civil public square .
... a vision of public life in which people of all faiths -- which , of course , means no faith -- are free to enter and engage public life on the basis of their faith , " said evangelical leader Os Guinness .
For Democrats , the timing is good .
The party has been pushing to overcome the " faith gap , " that many feel has hurt them with church - going voters .
Candidates are appearing in more religious settings , and conversations .
" What I try to do is as best I can be an instrument of His will , " Sen . Barack Obama has said .
" I obviously was fortunate to be able to rely on and be grounded in my faith which has been anchor for me throughout my entire life , " Sen .
Hillary Clinton has said .
Mara Vanderslice of Common Good Strategies is part of that effort .
" I think the biggest thing that we 've done wrong is sort of say that we just want a separation of church and state and only speak about religion in terms of separation , " Vanderslice said .
Evangelicals are now leading public support for many issues dear to Democrats : global campaigns against AIDS , hunger and poverty .
Watch how evangelicals are reaching out »
Even Congressional Democrats can see the power of a partnership , according to the Ethics and Public Policy Center 's Michael Cromartie .
" I think there are genuinely religious people , obviously in the Democratic Party , who 've said , you know , 'we need to stop toning down how our faith relates to public policy issues , ' whether it 's the environment or whether it 's questions of the economy or war and peace , " he said .
" And we need to start framing our concerns in religious language so that it might appeal to religious believers in America . "
Some staunchly conservative evangelicals are critical of the new approach .
They are proud of the gains they have made through ties to conservative Republicans .
And if Democrats want a share of their support , some political analysts say the Democrats will have to give something in return -- a hotly - debated issue like abortion .

Janice Marie Niccoli Arrested for Sex with Teen ( Photo )
37 - year - old " team mom " for a private youth league basketball team , was arrested in her Vacaville , CA home for having sex with a 16 - year - old boy .
The alleged sexual encounters happened in Niccoli 's home in April and May .
When rumors began spreading among the team , it eventually reached one the parents , who informed police .
Niccoli was charged with two felony counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor of more than 10 years age difference .
She was booked into the Solano County jail , and released after posting bail .
Detectives say the investigation is ongoing as Niccoli 's access to young boys may reveal similar instances with other boys .
On the way to work tomorrow , as you hurry , head bowed , to the crowded bus - stop or station , or pause in the car at the red traffic light , feeling your blood pressure start to mount as you see that , on the other side of the junction , the traffic still is n't moving , do yourself a massive favour : look up .
What may swim into your line of sight is greenery .
We 've been without it for five months , do you realise ?
And now it 's back .
Those things called trees , those tall roadside posts that for the whole winter long you have n't glanced at , that have seemed no more than dark straggly alternative streetlamps without the lighting , have suddenly in the past 10 days sprouted life , and now , this week , are at their most intense .
For example , look at the horse chestnuts , the conker trees beloved of schoolboys , if you live in an area lucky enough to have them .
Go on , look .
Once you do , you 'd have to have a soul made of concrete not be stirred , for right now , at least in southern Britain , the buds have just burst and the leaves have poured forth and they are of a quite spectacular colour .
It 's green , of course , but it 's a special green , it is more than emerald , it is iridescent , as if the leaves were fresh - painted , as if they were glowing from the inside ; and in the next few days they will be joined by giant upright white blossoms , big as a bunch of bananas , commonly known as Roman candles .
The whole thing then looks like a living firework display , and it 's free , and no streetlamp ever looked like this .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It 's not just the horse chestnuts ; cherry blossom and apple blossom is out now in gardens , as are the lilacs , and in hawthorn hedges there is a green mist of leaf wrapped around the branches .
Greenery is bursting out everywhere on the trees in our towns and cities and suburbs , so much so that if you do look up from the slog to work and catch a glimpse of it , your soul will lift ; and at last , at long , long last , someone has put a value on it .
It has a boring name ( Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees ) and an acronym ( CAVAT ) , but do n't let that put you off ; it 's the thought that counts .
Developed by the London Tree Officers ' Association ( LTOA ) , the professional body for tree specialists working for the London boroughs , this is a system that , for the first time , assesses a tree 's worth , according to its size , health , historical significance and how many people live near to enjoy it .
It assesses worth in actual money terms ; that 's the point , in this age that worships cash enough to make heroes of hedge - fund managers .
The results , which were released this week , are surprising : most ordinary street trees that you might not give a second glance to ( especially hurrying to work ) turn out to be worth between £ 8,000 and £ 12,000 , but for more special trees in more special places , even in the London suburbs , the values start to soar : an oak in Southgate , North London , for example , has been valued at £ 267,000 and a plane in Epping High Street at £ 200,000 .
At the top of the list , in Mayfair 's Berkeley Square , yes , that urban oasis where the nightingale was meant to have sung ( take it from me – it was a robin ) there is a venerable plane tree on which the lads from the LTOA have stuck a value of £ 750,000 .
It has been there since Victorian times , but all the same – whew !
you whistle – that 's a lot of money for a trunk and some branches .
There are dozens of others now valued at more than £ 500,000 , too , in leafy and affluent boroughs such as Westminster , and Kensington and Chelsea .
The figures give people pause , they make them stop ; and that 's the point , that 's why the system is needed , for in recent years , local authorities have been chopping down urban trees at such a rate of knots that the phrase " chainsaw massacre " has been applied to the process .
Behind it lurk those much criticised developments of the last quarter - century , the compensation culture , and the health - and - safety culture .
There is no doubt that a big tree growing too near a building can , if it has a major root system , ultimately cause the building problems .
It can become entangled in the foundations , and its thirst for water also leads to moisture being sucked from the ground , causing soil shrinkage and sinking buildings .
( A mature deciduous growth can draw 50,000 litres of water a year from surrounding soil ) .
Furthermore , there is no doubt that if a big old branch snaps off a big old tree it could hurt somebody .
Yet there is growing evidence that healthy mature trees are being felled by risk - averse insurers and councils because of the mere suspicion that they may affect neighbouring properties with subsidence , or fall on people .
In the past five years , London councils alone have chopped down almost 40,000 street trees , including some more than 100 years old .
Some were aged , diseased or dying , but 40 per cent were removed because of insurance claims ; yet a report commissioned by the London Assembly said that only 1 per cent of tree - removals were justified .
The picture is repeated nationwide , and was illustrated vividly in February in a report to the Department for Communities and Local Government , Trees in Towns II , which was the largest - ever survey of urban trees in England , covering streets , parks , schools , churchyards , allotments and private gardens in 147 towns and cities .
It found that , despite the key role they play in combating climate change , and creating pleasant environments ( the report 's own words ) , Britain 's urban trees are under threat .
Only 11 per cent of trees in towns are now between 50 and 100 years old , the survey discovered ; only two per cent are more than 100 years old .
That means : when they get big , they get chopped down .
When the report was published , the Government put a gloss on it – " er , much has been done , but much remains to be done , " and so on – but the Opposition got nearer the point .
Eric Pickles , the Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary , warned that the leafy character of urban areas was under threat .
" Whitehall 's failure to tackle the compensation culture and the heavy - handed application of health and safety regulation is doing more harm than good , " he said .
" Trees have a vital role to play in tackling climate change and improving quality of life , yet Britain 's leafy suburbs face a chainsaw massacre under Labour . "
Tasty soundbite , eh ?
You can almost hear Mr Pickles 's lips smacking as he uttered it .
But even making substantial allowances for political point - scoring , it does seem likely that far , far too many urban trees are now coming down .
The London Tree Officers ' Association chairman , Andy Tipping , said that , too often , insurance companies facing a claim for subsidence were demanding that trees be destroyed , and councils were too willing to cave in to their demands .
The new CAVAT system his association has drawn up will change things , he hopes , because in future the high value of trees – in London alone the total value of them is now estimated at £ 6.4bn – will demand extra engineering work by insurers to prove a link between a tree and subsidence , not least because various other causes , from broken drains to drought , can be behind buildings getting that wonky look .
The higher the tree 's value , the more proof insurers will need that it is really causing problems before they can chop it down .
It is planned to roll the system out nationwide next year .
" Often an insurer will point the finger at the tree , it is chopped down and then subsidence problems in a house persist , " said Tipping , a tree officer in Barnet , north London .
" Companies pay out vast sums repairing buildings and then , some months later , new cracks appear .
Under the new scheme , there will be more on - site investigations to find the source of damage at the beginning of a claim . "
He said that in one case he was asked to remove a 130 - year - old oak that was three houses away from a property with subsidence , and there were no roots near to it .
" It 's an absurd situation , " he said .
" People still do n't understand that subsidence is a problem of buildings , not trees .
In many cases , trees are not the main culprit .
It 's other reasons instead such as Victorian drains , poorly installed double - glazing , or climate change . "
The other reason for not removing them , of course , is that people love trees .
Research published yesterday suggests that almost 10 million people intend to plant a tree in their garden this year .
( Wo n't that get the insurers worried ? )
When trees are cut down in towns and cities , nearly always by some overweening authoritarian body , like a council , or a railway company , local people often protest vigorously : they suddenly realise they are actually very fond of what they had always taken for granted .
Why do we love trees ?
We can think of many practical reasons – the wood , the shade , the shelter , the apples , the pears – but there are deeper reasons too .
Beauty is obviously one .
The horse chestnuts in young leaf this week are so striking that they pull you up short , as are the blossoming cherries , reminding us of the opening of AE Housman 's famous lyric : " Loveliest of trees , the cherry , now /
Is hung with bloom along the bough /
And stands about the woodland ride / Wearing white for Eastertide . "
It is n't only trees in spring blossom that move us ; trees in autumn colours are another still - life firework display ; indeed , the basis of a whole tourist industry in New England , where the hordes of visitors who come to look at the fall foliage are known as " leaf peepers " .
Even trees in high summer , the least interesting part of the period in leaf , can provide a spectacle , such as the beeches of the woodlands of the Chilterns , whose tall , straight trunks , combined with the light falling between them , give the appearance of leafy cathedrals .
Yet perhaps there is something even beyond beauty in our attachment to the oak and the ash , the lime and the hornbeam , the yew and the Scots pine .
In the last 20 years the new discipline of evolutionary psychology has made many suggestive interpretations of the origins of human feeling , taking them back to our distant ancestors ; the rationale is that we have been office workers for four generations , and we were farmers for about 400 generations ; but before farming , we were hunter - gatherers for 20,000 generations or more , and much of our genetic make up must have been constructed then .
There 's no proof of this , of course ; there can only be suggestions , but they are powerful ones ( why do all children like to hide ?
Because the children who did n't hide , when the predators or the attackers came , did n't survive to pass on their genes ) .
Is there perhaps something in us that goes far , far back , to account for our love of trees , something more than beauty or utility ?
Some deeper attachment formed during the aeons when we lived in the forest ?
It 's fanciful , of course it is , especially now most of us only have the street , the house , or the block of flats ; and we can never know .
But we do know that when the trees that grace our street , our road , our courtyard , are threatened with toppling , we do not like it one bit .
At least now there is a system , thanks to the London Tree Officers '
Association – that gives tree - lovers a chance to fight back when the insurance company or the council sends someone with a chainsaw .
THE BEST NATIVE TREES TO PLANT YOURSELF
Ash ( Fraxinus excelsior )
Fairly abundant across Britain , the ash is a native deciduous species known for its elegant grey bark and distinctive black buds , which are often the last to open in spring .
A large tree , it can live up to 200 years and reach a height of 45 metres .
Characterised by having delicate " leaflets " , rather than undivided " simple " leaves , the ash can be male , female or both and produces purple catkin female flowers that ripen after fertilisation into seeds or " keys " .
Given the room to grow and spread , the ash has a striking silhouette , although its lack of low branches has traditionally made it unpopular with gardeners .
The tree does best in fairly moist but well - drained fertile soils with a pH above 5.5 .
Its strong , hard timber is a natural shock absorber and can take a hard blow without splintering , so has been used to make hockey sticks , oars , paddles , billiard cues , cricket stumps , polo sticks and , until metal ones came along , truncheons .
JAMIE MERRILL
Goat Willow ( Salix caprea )
The name is thought to come from the first known illustration of the species in Hieronymus Bock 's 16th - century Herbal , where the tree is shown being eaten by a goat .
Also commonly known as a pussy willow , its buds , or catkins , bloom in March and April before the leaves appear .
It grows to 6 - 12 m and is native to Europe and western and central Asia .
Russian Orthodox , Polish and Bavarian Roman Catholics carry sprays of goat willow on Palm Sunday .
The wood is brittle , so does n't produce useful timber but the bark contains tannin , used for tanning leather , and salicin , used to make aspirin .
Goat willows usually grow in woods and hedgerows , where they provide a feeding ground for moths , but the species is also a pioneer plant found in clearings and wasteland .
REBECCA ARMSTRONG
Hazel ( Crataegus monogyna )
A member of the rose family , the hawthorn is densely leaved and thorny with a short trunk .
Some might classify it as a shrub but in the wild , it is described as a small tree .
While not the tallest example of either , the hawthorn is known for its longevity and can live up to 250 years .
The hawthorn produces fragrant white flowers in late spring , followed by glossy dark red fruit in November .
Known as " haws " , the fruit can be harvested to make haw jelly and is as an important source of food for voles , wood mice and birds .
Its thorny stems make it an ideal boundary tree .
It needs to be pruned twice a year , in summer and autumn , and regular weeding at its base will improve its growth significantly .
JM
Hawthorn ( Corylus avellana )
Loved for its tasty nuts , the hazel is native to almost all of Europe .
It 's no giant , growing to 6 m , but it is hardy .
In their natural state , hazels can live for 60 years , but coppicing them , which involves cutting the tree back to ground level to encourage new growth , can result in a lifespan of up to 600 years .
Hazelnuts are important for the survival of the dormouse , but their popularity with squirrels means trees are stripped of their nuts before they ripen .
A hazel rod is best for water divining .

Silver Birch ( Betula pendula )
A species that is native to all of Britain , but especially common in Scotland , the silver birch will colonise any area of ground left unattended .
It is a fast - growing , relatively short - lived tree that shoots up in height for its first 20 years before reaching maturity at about 40 years old .
The silver birch will tolerate a wide variety of habitats and soil types ; ideally , though , the tree will do best in a sunny spot with sandy soil and plenty of drainage and is best planted in late winter or early spring .
Once believed to be the source of twigs for witches ' brooms , the tree now serves as a much - needed source of food for the endangered red squirrel , which eats its seeds .
JM
Oak ( Quercus robur )
The common or English oak is a large deciduous tree found throughout Britain and Ireland , although it is n't ideal for a modest - sized garden – each of these leviathans can grow up to 40 m in height and live to 1,000 years .
Deep rooted , with a large girth and a wide canopy , the oak is usually found in mixed woodland in basic fertile soils with a pH of 4.5 to 7.5 .
A single oak can host up to 500 species of insects and birds .
The oak was believed to be a gateway between worlds in Celtic mythology , and the Navy built its fleets with its tough wood .
Today , the wood is used to make casks for maturing wines and spirits .
George Bull
Wild Cherry ( Prunus avium )
One sure sign of spring is the sight of the white blossom of the wild cherry or gean .
It also puts on a colourful show in autumn while it sheds its leaves .
This tree is native to the UK and most of Europe , but does not grow in northern Scotland ; its favoured soil is clay rather than chalk .
Often found growing in beech woods , the wild cherry is equally at home in gardens , although it can grow up to 20 m tall .
To make a wild cherry bear fruit , more than one tree must be planted ; alone , they are sterile .
The small red cherries look attractive , and can be sour or deliciously sweet .
Starlings and pigeons , however , particularly enjoy consuming the tree 's fruit , as do wasps and small mammals .
Impatient gardeners might note that the wild cherry is a fast - growing tree .
RA
Scots Pine ( Pinus sylvestris )
Folklore has it that Scots pines were used to mark the burial places of warriors , heroes and chieftains , while druids used to light bonfires made from the tree 's timber at the winter solstice to celebrate the passing of the seasons .
Growing up to 40 m tall , the Scots pine typically lives for 150 years ; some may survive for 300 .
The tree dislikes sea winds or high rainfall , and prefers light and sandy soils .
The younger trees tend to have the classic conical silhouette , but as they mature can range from tall and narrow , with only a few side branches , to open and spreading with multiple trunks .
It also provides a home for the red squirrel , which eats the seed from pine cones .
One of the best places to see it in the wild is Rothiemurchus in the Cairngorms .
GB
Rowan ( Sorbus aucuparia )
Also known as mountain ash , the rowan , which can grow to 20 m high , boasts white flowers which bloom in May and blood - red berries in autumn .
These are a source of food for many birds , and are also used to make a jelly that is served with game dishes .
Uncooked berries are unsuitable for human consumption .
Rowans grow throughout Europe , Asia and North Africa .
The tree 's name is believed to derive from the Norse word " runa " , meaning a charm , and rowans were traditionally planted in churchyards and outside houses to ward off spirits .
On May Day in times past , a spray of rowan leaves was hung over doors to repel evil .
RA
Common Alder ( Alnus glutinosa )
The distinctive outline of this tree 's long trunk and narrow crown is a common sight across Britain 's streams and water courses .
The common alder can grow at a rate of 0.5 m a year and has been known to reach 25 m .
A member of the birch family , the alder 's leaves are shiny and toothed , dark green on the top , with a paler downy underside .
In early spring , male flowers appear as catkins , providing nectar for bees and a sought - after blossom for flower arrangers .
In the garden , the alder is the perfect plant to use for a hedge , and is a good choice for marshy areas .
Tanners used the bark as a dye before the arrival of synthetic colours .
Used alone , the bark dyes woollens a reddish colour , known as Aldine Red , while the bark and young shoots combined produce yellow dye .

Roots to success
How to plant the perfect tree
* " Anything you plant could be there for decades or centuries , " Paul Underwood , the head gardener at the National Trust 's Blickling Hall Gardens and Park in Norwich , says , " so give them room . "
Avoid walls , buildings and places that might have extensive foundations and underground cabling .
* Tailor the tree to your " microclimate " .
Are you in a " frost pocket " – a low - lying area that encourages frost – or a coastal area , which might receive salty spray ?
* Consider the season .
You can buy either " container - grown " , " root - balled " ( roots bound into a bundle ) or " bare root " ( simply dug out of the earth ) trees .
A container - grown sapling can be planted later in the year .
Juvenile trees establish their roots quicker , but older – and more expensive – purchases have an immediate visual impact .
* Browse before you buy .
Check out the tree 's health .
The mass of roots should roughly equal the mass of leaves and stems .
* Before planting , think about whether you 'll need a stake to support the tree when growing .
Small stakes allow trees to develop good anchor roots , but a more expensive , loftier support might be required in the windiest of sites .
* Dig for success .
Mark out your area , about three to four times the size of the tree 's root ball , and lift up the turf and remove any weeds .
Excavate a hole one - and - a - half times the depth of the root mass .
Prick the sides of the cavity ( especially in a clay - rich soil ) with a fork to help the roots establish .
Remove the topsoil , put it to one side , and mix one part compost to four parts earth ( which you 'll need when planting ) .
* It 's planting time .
Hammer your stake into your hole , off centre , on the windward side of the tree , so that tree blows away from it .
Remove the tree from its container and lay it on its side to tease out its roots .
If container - grown , use a garden cane to check you are planting the tree to the same depth as it was growing in the container .
Then fill in with the soil / compost mix .
* Water the tree before and after planting , and prune off any damaged stems .
Apply compost as needed .
* Stay vigilant .
" Keep a close eye on your tree over the first two years , " warns Underwood .
" Make sure it gets enough water , especially in drought conditions . "
Give it a balanced feed , such as Vitax or Growmore , every year and prune according to preference .

The US has asked Pakistan to boost security along the border
Five shells fired by coalition forces fighting militants landed in North Waziristan region , Pakistani army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas said .
The US military said the strike was in response to an " imminent threat " .
US and Pakistani forces have been battling Taleban guerrillas along the rugged Afghan - Pakistan border .
The border is not clearly marked in many places and is frequently traversed by the ethnic Pashtun tribesmen who fill the Taleban 's ranks .
The Pakistani army spokesman said a shell fired from Afghanistan had struck a house in the village of Kangrai in North Waziristan .
" The coalition forces were firing at a group of militants when five shells landed in Pakistan , destroying a house and killing two women and two children , " Maj Gen Abbas told AFP news agency .
He said Pakistan had complained about the incident but did not believe it was intentional .
A US military spokesman in Afghanistan told the BBC the attack had taken place in response to an " imminent threat " in Pakistan .
Maj Chris Belcher also said the US had carried out similar cross - border strikes in the past .
In a separate interview with AFP , Maj Belcher said the attack had targeted militants led by a Taleban commander , Sirajuddin Haqqani .
He told the agency the Pakistani government had been notified of the attack immediately after it happened .
British air strike
According to Reuters news agency , the attack prompted some 2,000 people to take to the streets in protest in the nearby Bajaur region .
The US has stationed thousands of troops to fight Taleban and al - Qaeda guerrillas in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
Thousands of troops supplied by US allies are also operating in Afghanistan under Nato command .
British forces in the south - western province of Helmand said on Wednesday that they had accidentally killed four Afghan civilians in an air strike .
The Taleban was driven from power in Afghanistan by a US - led invasion in 2001 .
The hardline Islamist militia has since mounted a comeback , with its followers mounting bomb attacks and assassinations in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Pakistan last year accused US - led forces pursuing insurgents in Afghanistan of firing a missile that landed in North Waziristan , killing 10 people .
The US has urged Pakistan to boost security along the border and fight the militants who seek shelter there .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Wednesday called for halting the growth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and said Congress -- not judges or regulators -- should take the lead role in grappling with global warming .
Bush , who leaves office in nine months , offered no specific proposals in the address .
But he laid out a framework for future measures he said would balance the need to curb carbon emissions blamed for increasing global temperatures , with protecting the U.S. economy .
The steps were immediately dismissed as " grossly insufficient " by the Sierra Club , while a leading Democratic congressman called the speech " too little , too late . "
Bush said his administration 's support of increased fuel - economy standards and alternative fuel research is " a solid foundation for further progress . "
The next step , he said , would be to halt the growth of power industry emissions within 10 to 15 years -- steps he said depend on encouraging new technologies .
" The strategy I have laid out today shows faith in the ingenuity and enterprise of the American people -- and that 's a resource that will never run out , " he said .
Watch Bush talk of need for " vigorous debate " on climate change »
Congress this year is slated to consider several competing bills aimed at reducing the carbon emissions blamed for an increase in global temperatures .
Bush urged lawmakers to offer incentives to develop new technologies and to avoid tax increases , new mandates or demands for sudden emissions cuts .
" The wrong way is to unilaterally impose regulatory costs that put American businesses at a disadvantage with their competitors abroad , which would simply drive American jobs overseas and increase emissions there , " he said .
" The right way is to ensure that all major economies are bound to take action and to work cooperatively with our partners for a fair and effective international climate agreement . "
Bush , a onetime oil executive , was widely criticized for abandoning after he took office the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which aimed to limit greenhouse gas concentrations .
But he said his administration had reduced the " intensity " of carbon emissions -- a ratio of emissions to economic growth , which his administration adopted as its preferred standard .
Bush said Congress should make sure current U.S. environmental laws do n't get " stretched " by courts or federal agencies to cover emissions from smaller sources like schools , hospitals and small businesses .
" Decisions with such far - reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges , " he said .
" Such decisions should be debated openly and made by the elected representatives of the people they affect .
The American people deserve an honest assessment of the costs , benefits and feasibility of any proposed solution . "
Ahead of Bush 's announcement , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Illinois , said Bush 's proposals were " too little , too late . "
" Now , after seven years of denying that global warming is a problem , the president will offer a tepid announcement that only ensures that the climate crisis will continue , " said Emanuel , the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus .
The Sierra Club , one of the largest environmental advocacy organizations , said emissions need to be rolled back , not just restrained , to prevent the worst effects of an increase in global temperatures .
" The president is throwing a Hail Mary to polluters in a last - ditch effort to stave off any meaningful action on global warming , " the group 's executive director , Carl Pope , said in a written statement Wednesday .
" Under the president 's plan , we 'll need a real miracle to save us from global warming . "
But James Connaughton , the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality , told reporters the United States faces a " regulatory train wreck " under current laws .
" Let 's say , for example , a school was trying to change a couple classrooms , " he said .
If the courts or the Environmental Protection Agency decide that carbon dioxide emissions have to be restricted , " This might trigger them having to completely redo their heating and ventilation system for the entire school .
Well , maybe they do n't have the money for that .
That 's the kind of effect that 's going to come from this . "
Both Democratic presidential candidates and Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , support capping carbon emissions .
But Connaughton said the administration still opposes any effort to cap overall emissions -- a step he said would be " disastrous " economically .
" Too much of our focus often is on it's only the government that 's going to solve this , " he said .
" We have to empower the private sector to do so , as well . "

All About Global Climate Change • Sierra Club • George W. Bush • Kyoto Protocol
I have been saying it for months now , Barack Obama is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party .
And now that he has clinched a victory in pledged delegates the remaining contests in Puerto Rico , South Dakota and Montana are nothing more than a formality .
Of those three contests none appear to have a chance to play a roll in the General Election this fall ; at least at first glance .
Puerto Rico ca n’t even vote in the General , although Hillary will probably claim it can if she wins the primary there , and South Dakota has n’t gone Blue since 1964 when Lyndon Johnson destroyed Barry Goldwater .
On the surface Montana seems like an impossible pick - up for the Democrats as well , but it may be the one remaining contest to watch for signs of a potential General Election upset in Barack Obama ’s favor come November .
A poll done by Mason - Dixon Polling & Research Inc. out of Washington D.C. taken May 19th through the 21st shows John McCain with a solid 8 - point lead in Big Sky Country , 47 - 39 .
A closer look at the Mason - Dixon poll however reveals trouble for McCain .
For starters 14 % of the Montana electorate is undecided , plus there ’s a 4 % margin of error , that makes the now famous “ Keith Number ” 18 % .
14 % undecided is a huge number in one of the reddest of the red states .
In 2000 and 2004 Bush won by 25 % and 20 % respectively .
As a side note Bill Clinton was able to win The Treasure State in 1992 ... with the help of a whopping 26 % of the vote going to Ross Perot , undoubtedly costing Bush Montana ’s three Electoral Votes .
But back to the topic at hand , there should be no question as to whether or not John McCain should win in Montana on November 4th , but the Mountain West seems to be buying what Barack is selling ; change .
And in order to solidify a victory in Montana , John McCain is going to have to make sure that those 14 % of undecided voters do n’t break towards Obama .
That is a pretty tall order considering that everywhere Obama spends time his numbers improve .
As people get to know Barack Obama they like him more and more .
Montana is no different .
So if Obama and his campaign decide to make Big Sky Country a battleground it will be .
What should be of even further concern to John McCain is that the Mason - Dixon poll left out one of Obama ’s core constituencies , first time voters .
In the May 19 - 21 poll Mason - Dixon surveyed 625 registered voters who all said they regularly vote in Montana elections .
As we have seen time after time throughout this campaign Barack Obama does exceedingly well with first time voters .
Sen .
Obama inspires people who have never voted in their lives to get out and cast a ballot for hope and change .
So come June 3rd , when watching the returns from South Dakota and Montana , the real concern is not who will win .
The same Mason - Dixon poll mentioned above also has Sen. Obama beating Sen. Clinton on June 3rd by a 52 % - 35 % margin .
On top of that , Clinton has a 29 % favorable rating compared to a whopping 50 % unfavorable rating .
Those numbers give her almost no room to improve .
The real number to watch next Tuesday night is not the number that determines who wins or loses , it is the turnout , particularly among young and new voters .
If that number is higher than expected , and the percentage of young voters is higher than expected then watch out John McCain , you could be in for a surprise in Montana this November .
And that ’s before we have even considered Brian Schweitzer as Obama ’s running mate .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - China ordered authorities on Saturday to tackle hand , foot and mouth disease aggressively ahead of the Beijing Olympics after a rapidly spreading outbreak killed at least 23 children and infected nearly 4,000 .
“ Our doctors will leave hospitals to find potential patients rather than sitting in the hospitals to wait for them , ” deputy health minister Liu Qian told state television in the worst - hit area , Fuyang city in the eastern province of Anhui .
The Ministry of Health said cases of the disease might increase in coming months because its peak season was in June and July .
Cases in some Chinese provinces , as well as Taiwan and Singapore , are running above year - ago levels , it said .
It ordered health authorities across the country to report all cases within 24 hours and step up controls ahead of the Olympics in August .
Officials will visit nurseries and primary schools to educate staff on hygiene and prevention steps , and Chinese scientists will increase research into the disease .
In Fuyang , 22 children have died from hand , foot and mouth disease and 3,321 have been infected .
Fifty eight are critically ill or in a serious condition , the ministry said .
State television showed pictures of anxious mothers bringing their children to hospital and of frightened children lying in hospital beds , one of them with bandages around his head .
A child , who is infected with a kind of intestinal virus , identified as enterovirus 71 , or EV71 , receives medical treatment at a hospital in Fuyang , Anhui province , May 2 , 2008 .
Death toll from the mass intestinal virus infection rose to 22 after another child died in Fuyang , local authorities said on Friday afternoon , Xinhua News Agency reported .

STRENGTHENING SUPERVISION
The ministry said special equipment was being installed in children ’s wards of Fuyang hospitals to treat patients .
Local authorities are strengthening supervision of food safety and water quality in an effort to stop the disease spreading .
Kindergartens in Fuyang , which had been due to reopen on Monday after a holiday weekend , will stay closed until May 12 .
The disease began spreading in Anhui in early March .
But a delay in reporting it to the public until last weekend triggered heated discussion and criticism in the Chinese media , which said local government officials should be sacked .
Health officials say there was no cover - up in Anhui and the reason for the delay was that medical teams were trying to work out what the illness was .
An initial cover -up of the SARS epidemic in 2003 led to the sacking of Beijing ’s mayor and the health minister .
Hand , foot , and mouth disease , characterized by fever , sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters , is a common illness among infants and children and is usually not fatal , according to the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the United States .
The cases in Fuyang were caused by infection with the enterovirus 71 , or EV71 .
Complications due to EV71 were responsible for the deaths in Fuyang , the World Health Organization said on its website ( www.who.int).
Hand , foot and mouth disease has been reported this year without fatalities in several other eastern and central Chinese provinces , the official Xinhua news agency said .
But the death of an 18 - month - old boy in the southern province of Guangdong on Friday suggests the disease may have spread to the south .
The boy apparently died from the disease after contracting it through EV71 , Xinhua reported .
There is no vaccine or antiviral agent available to treat or prevent EV71 .
Enteroviruses spread mostly through contact with infected blisters or feces and can cause higher fever , paralysis and swelling of the brain .

Ms Rice told Mr Obama she would get to the bottom of it
Condoleezza Rice
The US Department of State has launched an investigation into repeated breaches of passport files compiled on the three main presidential candidates .
State department contractors viewed the files of Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama , while a trainee accessed Hillary Clinton 's file .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has apologised to all three candidates .
US passport files include data such as age and place of birth , foreign travel records , and a Social Security number .
That number can be used to obtain credit records and other personal information .
Two state department contractors have been fired and a third disciplined .
The case has raised suspicions that someone was digging for information that could be damaging to the candidates .
However , with breaches concerning all three contenders , the likelihood of political motivation is somewhat diminished , the BBC's Kim Ghattas reports from Washington .
Contractors
On Friday the state department said the employees who had been disciplined worked for two contractors , Analysis Corporation and Stanley .
Stanley is an IT firm that recently won a 5 - year contract to issue American passports worth more than $ 500 m ( £ 252 m ) .
Mr McCain 's file was looked at earlier this year
There are now concerns over why the state department fired two contractors before having time to question them , correspondents say .
The Department of Justice is to monitor the state department 's probe , while the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee has also said it will launch an investigation .
Mr Obama called the case " deeply disturbing " and asked for a congressional enquiry .
" When you have not just one , but a series of attempts to tap into people 's personal records , that 's a problem - not just for me , but for how our government is functioning , " he said .
Mr McCain said any breaches of passport privacy called for an apology and a full investigation .
He said " corrective action should be taken " .
Precedent Mrs Clinton 's senate office said it would closely monitor the state department 's probe .
The passport records of her husband , Bill , were breached by a Republican appointee to the state department when he was running for president against George H W Bush in 1992 .
After first revealing that Ms Rice had apologised to Mr Obama over the security breach , the state department acknowledged Mr McCain 's and Mrs Clinton 's files had been looked at as well .
It said that one contract employee had viewed the files of Mr Obama and Mr McCain , and had been reprimanded but not fired .
Mr McCormack said the breaches of Mrs Clinton 's and Mr McCain 's files were discovered on Friday after officials were informed by a reporter on Thursday of the unauthorised access to Mr Obama 's record .
He said Mr McCain 's passport file had been looked at some time earlier this year .
The Obama breaches occurred on three separate dates - 9 January , 21 February and 14 March .
The state department tracks the viewing of its passport database .

Michael Jackson 's Neverland Ranch debt has been bought out just days before the property was to go on the auction block .
Who 's bad ?
TMZ has obtained the deed with the lucky new owners - 1224 LLC .
The debt is said to be around $ 23 million - plus an additional few hundred for llama food .
For the record , Jackson is still the official owner of Neverland Ranch , he just signs his mortgage payments over to someone else now .
More to the point , he was the product marketing manager for Alan F. Shugart ’s pioneering hard disk drive when the personal computer was shifting from a hobbyists ’ niche to a major industry .
“ I remember people laughing at us and saying what a stupid idea it was to do that disk drive , ” Mr. Quinn says .
Mr. Butterfield thinks that the MicroFueler is as much a game changer as the personal computer .
He says that working with Mr. Quinn ’s microelectronics experts 
E - Fuel now employs 15 people  has led to breakthroughs that have cut the energy requirements of making ethanol in half .
One such advance is a membrane distiller , which , Mr. Quinn says , uses extremely fine filters to separate water from alcohol at lower heat and in fewer steps than in conventional ethanol refining .
Using sugar as a feedstock means that there is virtually no smell , and its water byproduct will be drinkable .
E - Fuel has bold plans :
It intends to operate internationally from the start , with production of the MicroFueler in China and Britain as well as the United States .
And Mr. Butterfield is already at work on a version for commercial use , as well as systems that will use feedstocks other than sugar .
Ethanol has long had home brewers , and permits are available through the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau .
( You must be a property owner and agree to make your ethanol outdoors . )
But there are plenty of reasons to question whether personal fueling systems will become the fuel industry ’s version of the personal computer .
For starters , sugar - based ethanol does n’t look much cheaper than gas .
It takes 10 to 14 pounds of sugar to make a gallon of ethanol , and raw sugar sells in the United States for about 20 cents a pound , says Michael E. Salassi , a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Louisiana State University .
But Mr. Quinn says that as of January this year , under the North American Free Trade Agreement , he can buy inedible sugar from Mexico for as little as 2.5 cents a pound , which puts the math in his favor .
While this type of sugar has not been sold to consumers , E - Fuel says it is developing a distribution network for it .
In addition , it ’s illegal in the United States to operate a car on 100 percent ethanol , with exceptions for off - road vehicles like Indy cars and farm equipment .
Mr. Quinn has a federal permit to make his own fuel , and believes that if MicroFuelers start popping up like swimming pools , regulators will adapt by certifying pure ethanol for cars .
Despite all the hurdles , Mr. Quinn and Mr. Butterfield may be on to something .
There are plenty of consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint and are willing to make an upfront investment to do it  consider the success of the Prius .

Why is Hillary Clinton still in the race ?
Ever since she failed to cream Barack Obama in Indiana , pundits and analysts have been chewing this over–and now that the West Virginia primary is done , even though she won by a more than two - to - one margin , the question still hovers .
After all , Obama has racked up an insurmountable lead in pledged delegates and has pulled ahead in the superdelegate count , meaning the race is essentially complete .
Clinton and her campaign advisers have argued that she can still win the nomination if she does well in the last few primaries and then persuades superdelegates she is the better candidate to do battle with John McCain .
But the superdelegates do n’t seem receptive to her case .
And the fact that she has throttled back on the anti-Obama rhetoric in recent days –she barely criticized him in her not - so - jubilant West Virginia victory speech–is a signal that she may not believe her own spin and is merely halfheartedly trudging toward the last primaries ( Montana and South Dakota ) on June 3 .
Yet there she is–an active and hard - working candidate .
And the commentators have come up with several obvious explanations :
* She wants to remain in the hunt just in case something happens .
( A video appears of Wright calling for armed revolution ?
Fox News produces Obama ’s Secret Muslim Membership card ? )
* She is staying in for one last round of fundraising .
( Her campaign is $ 20 million in debt and owes her $ 11 million . )
* She wants to end her historic campaign with a string of victories : West Virginia , Kentucky , and Puerto Rico . ( Puerto Rico ?
She is a senator from New York . )
* And the most obvious of them all : she ’s not yet ready to face the music .
No doubt , a combo of these rationales is fueling Clinton ’s impossible ride .
But let me add one more to the mix : Clinton is setting up the biggest I - told - you - so in recent American political history .
Assume Obama is the nominee and imagine that he loses to McCain in the fall .
Where would that leave Clinton ?
She would be able to wag her finger at her party , and she would n’t even have to say those haughty words .
She and her die - hard confederates would be able to note simply and smugly , We did try to warn you .
In the following four years , they would remind reporters , party leaders , Democratic voters , and everyone else , over and over , that they had said that Obama was unelectable , that they had said he could not win blue - collar ( that is , white ) voters .
This Clinton chorus would not cease singing this song for a nanosecond .
Ca n’t you just see Bill Clinton and Terry McAuliffe lecturing cable news hosts on this point ?
Hiding their schadenfreude–just barely –they would note that they had won the fundamental argument of 2008 : who understands American voters the best ?
And in this scenario , Hillary Clinton would be well - positioned for 2012 .
In fact , she would have such bragging rights as to be able to question any other Democrat ’s entry into the presidential contest .
She might even expect the party this time to hand her the nomination on a platter –accompanied with one big apology .
This is not to say that Hillary Clinton is wishing for an Obama defeat in November .
And there ’s little doubt that she will campaign fiercely and enthusiastically for Obama–if only to preserve her standing in the party and to earn good will among his devotees .
But like any good politician , she now has to consider all the possibilities , all the angles .
And as she determines what to do here and now , she must consider what an Obama loss would mean for her own political future .
Under the most reasonable set of assumptions , the 60 - year - old Clinton ’s presidential ambitions can only survive if Obama falls to McCain .
( She can run again in 2012 , but seeking the presidency in 2016 – when she would be 69 by the general election –would be rather tough . )
Consequently , she must factor into her current decisionmaking what actions would best serve her should Obama fail in November .
By staying in the race , Clinton has been–and will be–able to pocket more of those blue - collar voters .
And with a decisive win in Puerto Rico on June 1 , she could cut into Obama ’s edge in the popular vote .
Even if she has no shot at coaxing superdelegates with her blue - collar argument , she will be bolstering her you - should ’ve - listened - to - me argument , in case the voters in the general election send Obama packing .
The final third of the Democratic primary contest has been dominated by questions related to blue - collar voters .
Can Obama win them ?
If not in the primaries , then in the fall ?
Will white working - class Americans vote for a black Democrat ?
How important are they to the Democrats ’ prospects in the general election ?
Can a Democrat win without most of them ?
Are the Obama strategists correct when they assert their candidate can expand the Democrats ’ electorate –which would render white working - class voters not as important for the Democratic nominee as they have been in the past ?
The Clinton camp has contended that white , lunch - pail voters are essential to Democratic victory in critical states , such as Ohio and Pennsylvania .
And Clinton has promised that she will win West Virginia in the general election if she is her party ’s nominee , noting that no Democrat in recent decades has won the White House without bagging the Mountain State .
( As if she can make such a promise . )
But by winning West Virginia and Kentucky ( which holds its primary on May 20 ) , she can solidify her standing as the Dem preferred by white , blue - collar voters .
And if Obama falls short on November 4 , she will have all those voters standing behind her when she says …. well , you know .
So remaining in the race may be more than just a matter of pride , money , or desire .
It may be a calculation that looks past 2008 and to Hillary Clinton ’s next big thing .

ActiveState announced the release of Komodo Edit 4.3 last week , the first version of the cross - platform programming tool to be distributed as open source .
Komodo Edit is now tri-licensed under the MPL , GPL , and LGPL , just like Firefox .
Through the OpenKomodo initiative , ActiveState has been working closely with Mozilla developers and the open - source software community in an effort to create an open platform that can provide a foundation for scripting and web application development tools .
The OpenKomodo project has the potential to become for scripting what Eclipse is for Java .
Komodo leverages Mozilla 's XUL framework which makes it easy to repurpose and imbues it with a very high level of extensibility .
OpenKomodo is currently being used as the basis for Snapdragon , a web development tool for client - side scripting that integrates closely with Firefox .
Other projects based on the OpenKomodo code base will likely emerge as the project matures .
I tested Komodo Edit on Ubuntu 7.10 to determine if it is worthy of replacing Vim , which I have used religiously for the past eight years .
Komodo Edit failed to meet my impossibly high standards , but it came closer to defeating my Vim fixation than any other programming environment that I have ever tested .
Komodo Edit has a decent range of features that put it squarely between a conventional editor and a full - fledged IDE .
The feature set includes basic project management , a snippet system , effective find - and - replace with support for regular expressions , extremely robust support for plug-ins and user modification , a tab - based multiple document interface , syntax highlighting and folding , code completion and tips , and basic code validation .
The project management system is very lightweight and noninvasive .
It wo n't generate code for you , but it also wo n't force you to follow any predetermined directory structure for your programs .
When you create a project file , Komodo Edit will automatically display in the project pane the entire tree of the directory in which the project is saved .
You can also add references to files and directories that are outside of the project 's directory structure .
Editing features
Komodo edit uses Scintilla for its editing component but offers a few unique twists .
For instance , it comes with passable Vi and Emacs keybinding schemes .
The Vi scheme does n't just shift around a few key bindings , it completely changes the way the editor operates .
With the Vi scheme , you get a full command system with colon prompt as well as a normal mode , visual mode , and insert mode , just like the real thing .
It 's the margarine to Vim 's delicious butter .
Most of the standard normal mode directional commands work , even with numerical prefixes , and you can also do substitutions from the command system with regular expressions just like you would with Vim ( it works on visual mode selection blocks too ) .
Komodo Edit can replicate Vim's functionality with a level of accuracy and attention to detail that I 've simply never seen before .
I also briefly tested the Emacs mode , and it worked pretty well , but I can't really judge it accurately since I 'm not really an Emacs user myself .
The Komodo start page
One of the other impressive features of Komodo Edit is the ease with which it can be modified .
Its add - on system is very similar to that of Firefox and there are a number of intriguing third - party add - ons available online .
Support for additional programming languages and features can be added and developed without a lot of difficulty .
There are simpler ways to extend Komodo as well .
You can add new commands which can be bound to keyboard events , menu items , and toolbar buttons .
Custom commands can be external scripts or command line expressions that filter or manipulate content .
Komodo Edit also supports macro recording and allows users to create their own macro - based enhancements with either Python or JavaScript .
Your macros are even made accessible through the colon prompt when you use Vi mode .
The Komodo extension manager
Komodo Edit 's code completion is pretty much on par with Vim 's omnicomplete feature .
I tested it with Python and found that it was able to provide adequate completion in most cases , but obviously can't do it in situations where there is n't sufficient type information .
It also provides tooltips with parameter hints in some cases .
Still not quite there yet
Although I 'm very impressed with Komodo Edit 's power and extensibility , there are a few places where it falls short of my expectations .
The biggest disappointment is that it does n't support multiple split editing panes .
You can only create one split and view a maximum of two text buffers at any given time .
This is particularly frustrating for me , because I 'm used to looking at three or four buffers at once with Vim , which allows the viewing window to be split as many times as the user wants .
Another aspect that frustrated me is that I could n't find a way to move the Toolbox or Project tabs so that they are in the same column .
Having one on each side of the editing window wastes a lot of screen space , and I 'd much rather stack them vertically on the left - hand side .
The Komodo editor
For comparison purposes , I also briefly looked at ActiveState 's commercial version ( there is a free trial available ) , Komodo IDE .
The Komodo IDE has some really nice additional features , like version control functionality and an integrated graphical debugger that works with an impressive number of programming languages , including JavaScript .
Although the extra features would likely be worth the $ 295 license fee for a serious programmer who works extensively with several of the supported programming languages , it is n't a particularly good value for my limited needs .
On the rare occasions when I require a Python debugger , for instance , I 'm perfectly satisfied with using an external tool like Winpdb .
For an overview of the differences , check out the feature comparison matrix on the ActiveState web site .
A bright future for scripting tools
Dynamic scripting languages like Python , Ruby , and JavaScript are rapidly increasing in importance as developers shift away from the desktop and start moving their applications into the cloud .
Tools for that kind of development are needed now more than ever before .
Komodo Edit is good in that context , because it supports both the back - end languages and the front - end languages .
There are a few competing open source tools that do n't have quite so broad a scope but are still worth mentioning .
For Python development , I think that Eric3 ( it has an excellent graphical debugger ) and PIDA ( it has real Vim integration ) are both pretty darn good .
For web development , I think the KDE - based Quanta editor is the best open source solution .
KDE also has a pair of cool graphical debuggers for JavaScript and XSL .
Web developers might also like Mozilla 's Venkman javascript debugger ( it 's klunky , but it 's not bad when it works right ) and Firebug ( the single most useful Firefox add - on ever created ) .
Developers who work with dynamic languages will likely see tools continue to improve as the languages themselves evolve .
Python 3 , for instance , will support type annotations that will make it much easier for autocompletion systems to operate effectively and for code validation tools to preemptively find bugs .
The rate at which open source software development tools are advancing illuminates a lot of exciting possibilities that are just over the horizon .

Many Viewers ' Bitter ' About ABC Debate Blogosphere buzzes with criticism and praise for line of questions .
Apr. 17 , 2008  --
As you 'd imagine , the debate is the talk of the town here today , and not all of it is positive .
The consensus seems to be that Sen. Barack Obama had a rough night , and many are objecting to the tenor of the questions .
Today , the candidate literally brushed it all off , saying that this was simply old - style politics .
At a town hall meeting in North Carolina today , Obama shrugged off Wednesday night 's confrontation , though with evident disdain .
" When you 're running for president you gotta expect it , and so you just kind of let it ... " he said , stopping midsentence and brushing off his shoulders as the crowd applauded .
A grueling round of debate questions focused on issues such as Obama 's patriotism and his more controversial friends .
At one point , for instance , ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about his former pastor , saying , " Do you think the Rev. Wright loves America as much as you do ? "
Today , Obama said , " Forty - five minutes before we heard about health care .
Forty - five minutes before we heard about Iraq .
Forty - five minutes before we heard about jobs .
Forty - five minutes before we heard about gas prices . "
In Philadelphia 's Reading Market today , others shared those views .
Voter Wardell Quitman fumed .
" I feel like they wasted a whole hour , a good hour , talking about nothing ! "
ABC News has heard from thousands of angry viewers .
At least some of the negative reaction came from Obama supporters , among them the liberal group MoveOn , which has mounted an action campaign to send a message to the network .
One viewer wrote , " This so - called ' debate ' will be shown to my communications students as an example of what shoddy journalism looks like . "
" Shame on you , Charlie and George , " wrote another viewer .
" We deserve better . "
But some were more positive .
Among them , one viewer wrote : " Folks , if [ Obama ] can't deal with the hostile questions from George and Charlie , how do you expect him to deal with McCain and company in the fall ? "
In Haverford , Pa. , Sen .
Hillary Clinton asked her audience , " How many of you watched the debate last night ? "
Many raised their hands .
Aside from that brief mention , however , she spent most of her time talking about issues such as immigration and health care .
But her husband , Bill Clinton , who was also campaigning in Pennsylvania , could n't resist bringing it up .
" They 've been beating up on her for 15 months , " he said .
" I did n't hear her whining when he said she was untruthful in Iowa , or called her the senator from Punjab .
And you know they said some pretty rough things about me , too .
But you know , this is a contact sport .
If you do n't want to play , keep your uniform off . "
Today , Obama 's campaign did n't skip a beat .
He received the endorsement of two more superdelegates .
But the debate was the focus of much attention .
The campaign even sent out a new fundraising appeal , telling supporters that a small contribution would send a powerful message against old - style politics .
At a town hall meeting in North Carolina , Obama took a question from a fourth - grader named Cameron , who has political ambitions of his own .
He is an elected representative on the student council .
" How do I get to be president one day ? " he asked .
Obama smiled , and noted that he had n't yet won his election , but Cameron had .
" How many debates did you have to do ? " Obama asked .
" None ? Sounds great ! "

Key war on terror architect Douglas Feith has now confirmed Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz and Wesley Clark in admitting that the so - called War on Terror is a hoax .
In fact , starting right after 9/11 -- at the latest -- the goal has always been to create " regime change " and instability in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , Sudan , Somalia and Lebanon so as to protect Israel .
And the goal was never really to destroy Al Qaeda .
As stated in an article in Asia Times :
Three weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , former US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld established an official military objective of not only removing the Saddam Hussein regime by force but overturning the regime in Iran , as well as in Syria and four other countries in the Middle East , according to a document quoted extensively in then - under secretary of defense for policy Douglas Feith 's recently published account of the Iraq war decisions .
Feith 's account further indicates that this aggressive aim of remaking the map of the Middle East by military force and the threat of force was supported explicitly by the country 's top military leaders .
Feith 's book , War and Decision , released last month , provides excerpts of the paper Rumsfeld sent to President George W Bush on September 30 , 2001 , calling for the administration to focus not on taking down Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaeda network but on the aim of establishing " new regimes " in a series of states ...
*** General Wesley Clark , who commanded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombing campaign in the Kosovo war , recalls in his 2003 book Winning Modern Wars being told by a friend in the Pentagon in November 2001 that the list of states that Rumsfeld and deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz wanted to take down included Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , Sudan and Somalia [ and Lebanon ] .
***
When this writer asked Feith . . . which of the six regimes on the Clark list were included in the Rumsfeld paper , he replied , " All of them . "
***
The Defense Department guidance document made it clear that US military aims in regard to those states would go well beyond any ties to terrorism .
The document said the Defense Department would also seek to isolate and weaken those states and to " disrupt , damage or destroy " their military capacities - not necessarily limited to weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
Where does Israel come in ?
Well , the Asia Times article continues :
Rumsfeld 's paper was given to the White House only two weeks after Bush had approved a US military operation in Afghanistan directed against bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Despite that decision , Rumsfeld 's proposal called explicitly for postponing indefinitely US airstrikes and the use of ground forces in support of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in order to try to catch bin Laden .
Instead , the Rumsfeld paper argued that the US should target states that had supported anti-Israel forces such as Hezbollah and Hamas .
***
After the bombing of two US embassies in East Africa [ in 1988 ] by al - Qaeda operatives , State Department counter - terrorism official Michael Sheehan proposed supporting the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against bin Laden 's sponsor , the Taliban regime .
However , senior US military leaders " refused to consider it " , according to a 2004 account by Richard H Shultz , Junior , a military specialist at Tufts University .
A senior officer on the Joint Staff told State Department counter - terrorism director Sheehan he had heard terrorist strikes characterized more than once by colleagues as a " small price to pay for being a superpower " .
And if " terrorist strikes " were a " small price to pay for being a superpower " , and if that is the reason that the U.S. government refused to disrupt the alleged planners of the 9/11 attacks , does n't that point to the fact that the U.S. government intentionally allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur ?
In other words , is n't this statement by the Joint Staff senior officer tend to prove that 9/11 was intentionally allowed to occur as the " New Pearl Harbor " which would allow America to act like " a superpower " and re-make the Middle East in its own ( and Israel 's ) image ?
This is not an unreasonable question , especially given that Feith , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and most of the other key architects of the " war on terror " were part of the Project for a New American Century and its plea for a " New Pearl Harbor " to justify expansion of American militarism and regime change in the Middle East .
And remember that many of the key members of PNAC and architects of the " war on terror " had previously created the " Clean Break " strategy for Israel , which called for a policy of war and regime change against Israel 's enemies .
The war on terror is a hoax ( indeed , even Newsweek has now admitted that ) .
Security forces have been reinforced for the elections
Tamil Tiger rebels have sunk a naval cargo ship in eastern Sri Lanka , hours before important local elections .
The navy said a 65 - metre ( 213 - ft ) ship was hit by an underwater blast caused by a suicide diver , though no other casualties were reported .
Rebels said the ship had been loaded with munitions destined for Sri Lankan troops operating in the north .
Voting has now closed in Saturday 's local elections , the first in the region in 20 years .
The polls follow a government offensive last summer .
Troops drove the Tamil Tigers from their bases in the region , which they had controlled for 13 years .
Thousands of extra troops and police have been deployed to ensure security for the elections in the east coast towns of Batticaloa , Trincomalee and Ampara .
On Friday , at least 11 people died in a bomb attack on a cafe in Ampara , which was blamed on the Tigers .
There was no immediate comment from the rebels .
' Sea Tiger ' attack
A Sri Lankan navy spokesman , Commander DKP Dassanayake , said the cargo vessel Invisible " sank due to an underwater explosion " at around 0215 local time ( 2045 GMT Friday ) .
" We suspect the blast was carried out by a suicide diver , " he said .
He gave no details of the ship 's cargo .
A rebel statement quoted by AFP news agency said " Sea Tiger underwater naval commandos " had attacked the ship just before dawn .
The army blamed the Tigers for the attack on the cafe in Ampara , in which 36 people were also wounded .
Fighting is continuing in the north where the rebels have their main stronghold .
About 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 1983 .
The rebels want an independent state for minority Tamils in the north and east .
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Colombo says Saturday 's vote will lay the foundation for limited devolution that the government says is the answer to Tamil complaints of domination by Sinhalese - led central governments .
“ If you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . ” – Dalai Lama
By Leo Babauta
Too often the trend in our society is for people to be separated from either other , to be cut off from the great mass of humanity , and in doing so to be dehumanized a little bit more with each step .
Cars have taken us off the streets , where we used to greet each other and stop to chat .
Cubicles have taken away a bit of the humanity in working , as have factories and even computers to some extent .
Television has planted us firmly in our living rooms , instead of out with other people .
Even movie theaters , where many people get together , cut us off from true conversation because we ’re staring at a big screen .
And while I ’m not railing against any of these inventions ( except perhaps the cubicle ) , what we must guard against is the tendency of that individuality to have us focused on ourselves to the exclusion of our fellow human beings .
The tendency towards selfishness rather than giving , on helping ourselves rather than helping our brothers and sisters in humanity .
I ’m not saying we ’re all like that , but it can happen , if we ’re not careful .
So strike back against the selfishness and greed of our modern world , and help out a fellow human being today .
Not next month , but today .
Helping a fellow human being , while it can be inconvenient , has a few humble advantages :
It makes you feel better about yourself ;
It connects you with another person , at least for a moment , if not for life ;
It improves the life of another , at least a little ;
It makes the world a better place , one little step at a time ;
And if that kindness is passed on , it can multiply , and multipy .
So take just a few minutes today , and do a kindness for another person .
It can be something small , or the start of something big .
Ask them to pay it forward .
Put a smile on someone ’s face .
Do n’t know where to start ?
Here ’s an extremely incomplete list , just to get you thinking —
I ’m sure you can come up with thousands more if you think about it .
Smile and be friendly .
Sometimes a simple little thing like this can put a smile and warm feeling in someone else ’s heart , and make their day a little better .
They might then do the same for others .
Call a charity to volunteer .
You do n’t have to go to a soup kitchen today .
Just look up the number , make the call , and make an appointment to volunteer sometime in the next month .
It can be whatever charity you like .
Volunteering is one of the most amazing things you can do .
Donate something you do n’t use .
Or a whole box of somethings .
Drop them off at a charity — others can put your clutter to good use .
Make a donation .
There are lots of ways to donate to charities online , or in your local community .
Instead of buying yourself a new gadget or outfit , spend that money in a more positive way .
Redirect gifts .
Instead of having people give you birthday or Christmas gifts , ask them to donate gifts or money to a certain charity .
Stop to help .
The next time you see someone pulled over with a flat tire , or somehow in need of help , stop and ask how you can help .
Sometimes all they need is a push , or the use of your cell phone .
Teach .
Take the time to teach someone a skill you know .
This could be teaching your grandma to use email , teaching your child to ride a bike , teaching your co-worker a valuable computer skill , teaching your spouse how to clean the darn toilet .
OK , that last one does n’t count .
Comfort someone in grief .
Often a hug , a helpful hand , a kind word , a listening ear , will go a long way when someone has lost a loved one or suffered some similar loss or tragedy .
Help them take action .
If someone in grief seems to be lost and does n’t know what to do , help them do something .
It could be making funeral arrangements , it could be making a doctor ’s appointment , it could be making phone calls .
Do n’t do it all yourself — let them take action too , because it helps in the healing process .
Buy food for a homeless person .
Cash is often a bad idea if it ’s going to be used for drugs , but buying a sandwich and chips or something like that is a good gesture .
Be respectful and friendly .
Lend your ear .
Often someone who is sad , depressed , angry , or frustrated just needs someone who will listen .
Venting and talking through an issue is a huge help .
Help someone on the edge .
If someone is suicidal , urge them to get help .
If they do n’t , call a suicide hotline or doctor yourself to get advice .
Help someone get active .
A person in your life who wants to get healthy might need a helping hand — offer to go walking or running together , to join a gym together .
Once they get started , it can have profound effects .
Do a chore .
Something small or big , like cleaning up or washing a car or doing the dishes or cutting a lawn .
Give a massage .
Only when appropriate of course .
But a massage can go a long way to making someone feel better .
Send a nice email .
Just a quick note telling someone how much you appreciate them , or how proud you are of them , or just saying thank you for something they did .
Show appreciation , publicly .
Praising someone on a blog , in front of coworkers , in front of family , or in some other public way , is a great way to make them feel better about themselves .
Donate food .
Clean out your cupboard of canned goods , or buy a couple bags of groceries , and donate them to a homeless shelter .
Just be there .
When someone you know is in need , sometimes it ’s just good to be there .
Sit with them .
Talk .
Help out if you can .
Be patient .
Sometimes people can have difficulty understanding things , or learning to do something right .
Learn to be patient with them .
Tutor a child .
This might be difficult to do today , but often parents ca n’t afford to hire a tutor for their child in need of help .
Call a school and volunteer your tutoring services .
Create a care package .
Soup , reading material , tea , chocolate … anything you think the person might need or enjoy .
Good for someone who is sick or otherwise in need of a pick - me - up .
Lend your voice .
Often the powerless , the homeless , the neglected in our world need someone to speak up for them .
You do n’t have to take on that cause by yourself , but join others in signing a petition , speaking up a a council meeting , writing letters , and otherwise making a need heard .
Offer to babysit .
Sometimes parents need a break .
If a friend or other loved one in your life does n’t get that chance very often , call them and offer to babysit sometime .
Set up an appointment .
It can make a big difference .
Love .
Simply finding ways to express your love to others , whether it be your partner , child , other family member , friend , co-worker , or a complete stranger … just express your love .
A hug , a kind word , spending time , showing little kindnesses , being friendly … it all matters more than you know .
( CNN ) -- Envoys for the Dalai Lama began a series of meetings Sunday with Chinese leaders , the first time the two sides have come together since violence broke out in the Tibetan regions of China in March .
The talks began Sunday morning , said Tenzin Takhla , the secretary to the Dalai Lama , from the northern Indian city of Dharamsala .
Later in the week , the two sides will carry out further meetings , he said .
Chinese President Hu Jintao told Japanese reporters Sunday that he hopes the talks yield positive results .
" I am confident that through joint efforts by both sides , this visit will be able to achieve the expected results , " Hu said , according to a report by Japan 's Kyodo News agency .
When the talks were announced last week , China said it hoped the Dalai Lama would use his influence to stop anti-Chinese protests that threaten to disrupt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , the state - run news agency Xinhua reported .
Protesters supporting the Free Tibet Movement dogged the torch relay ahead of the Olympics as it made its way around the world .
The rest of the relay will take place within mainland China and its territories .
The torch reached the mainland from Macau on Saturday night .
The talks between the envoys are taking place in Shenzhen , north of Hong Kong .
The location within the city has n't been made public .
" During this brief visit , the envoys will take up the urgent issue of the current crisis in the Tibetan areas , " Chhime Chhoekyapa , a secretary to the Dalai Lama , said earlier .
" They will convey His Holiness the Dalai Lama 's deep concerns about the Chinese authorities ' handling of the situation and also provide suggestions to bring peace to the region . "
China has periodically invited representatives of the Dalai Lama to meetings , but none have taken place since last July .
The March protests -- initiated by Buddhist monks -- began on the anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Beijing rule , which sent the Dalai Lama into exile in northern India .
The pro-democracy protests began peacefully March 14 in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa , but turned violent as protesters set fire to vehicles and shops , tear gas filled and streets and gunfire rang out , according to witnesses , human rights groups and the Chinese state - run news agency , Xinhua .
Beijing blamed followers of the exiled Buddhist spiritual leader , and said 18 civilians and one police officer were killed .
Tibetan groups said many times that number died in the violence and subsequent crackdown .
In the wake of the violence , Beijing has been under intense international pressure to re-open its dialogue with the Dalai Lama .

San Francisco -
The FBI has withdrawn an unconstitutional national security letter ( NSL ) issued to the Internet Archive after a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
As the result of a settlement agreement , the FBI withdrew the NSL and agreed to the unsealing of the case , finally allowing the Archive 's founder to speak out for the first time about his battle against the record demand .
" The free flow of information is at the heart of every library 's work .
That 's why Congress passed a law limiting the FBI 's power to issue NSLs to America 's libraries , " said Brewster Kahle , founder and Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive .
" While it 's never easy standing up to the government -- particularly when I was barred from discussing it with anyone -- I knew I had to challenge something that was clearly wrong .
I 'm grateful that I am able now to talk about what happened to me , so that other libraries can learn how they can fight back from these overreaching demands . "
The NSL was served on the Archive -- a digital library recognized by the state of California -- and its attorneys in November of 2007 .
The letter asked for personal information about one of the Archive 's users , including the individual 's name , address , and any electronic communication transactional records pertaining to the user .
Kahle , who is also a member of EFF 's Board of Directors , decided to fight the NSL because it exceeded the FBI 's limited authority to issue such demands to libraries .
The Archive responded to the letter by handing over only publicly available documents and simultaneously filing a lawsuit challenging the letter .
This lawsuit is the first known challenge to an NSL served on a library since Congress amended the national security letter provision in 2006 to limit the FBI 's power to demand records from libraries .
The NSL included a gag order , prohibiting Kahle from discussing the letter and the legal issues it presented with the rest of the Archive 's Board of Directors or anyone else except his attorneys , who were also gagged .
The gag also prevented the ACLU and EFF from discussing the NSL with members of Congress , even though an ACLU lawyer who represents the Archive recently testified at a congressional hearing about the FBI 's misuse of NSLs .
" This is a great victory for the Archive and also the Constitution , " said Melissa Goodman , staff attorney with the ACLU .
" It appears that every time a national security letter recipient has challenged an NSL in court and forced the government to justify it , the government has ultimately withdrawn its demand for records .
In the absence of much needed judicial oversight – and with recipients silenced and the public in the dark – there is nothing to stop the FBI from abusing its NSL power . "
" A miscarriage of justice was prevented here because the Archive decided to fight the unlawful demand for information and unconstitutional gag , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" The big question is , how many other improper NSLs have been issued by the FBI and never challenged ? "
NSLs are secretly issued by the government to obtain access to personal customer records from Internet Service Providers , financial institutions , and credit reporting agencies .
In almost all cases , recipients of the NSLs are forbidden , or " gagged , " from disclosing that they have received the letters .
The ACLU has challenged this Patriot Act statute in federal court in two other cases where the judges found the gags unconstitutional : one involving an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) ; the second a group of librarians .
In the ISP case , the district court invalidated the entire NSL statute .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is expected to hear oral arguments in the government 's appeal of that case next month .
Since the Patriot Act was passed in 2001 , relaxing restrictions on the FBI 's use of the power , the number of NSLs issued has seen an astronomical increase , to nearly 200,000 between 2003 and 2006 .
EFF 's investigations have uncovered multiple NSL misuses , including an improper NSL issued to North Carolina State University .
Last year Representative Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) introduced H.R. 3189 , the " National Security Letters Reform Act of 2007 . "
Senator Russell Feingold ( D - WI ) introduced a Senate bill of the same name ( S. 2088 ) .
Both bills are aimed at narrowing the statute by enacting limits on when and how NSLs can be used and bringing the gag order provision in line with the Constitution .
In addition to Goodman and Hofmann , attorneys on the case are Jameel Jaffer and Danielle Tully of the ACLU National Security Project , Ann Brick of the ACLU of Northern California , and Kurt Opsahl of EFF .

Charles Darwin's Papers Online
For decades available only to scholars at Cambridge University Library , the private papers of Charles Darwin , one of the most influential scientists in history , can now be seen by anyone online and free of charge .
This is the largest ever publication of Darwin papers and manuscripts , totalling about 20,000 items in over 100,000 electronic images .
This vast and varied collection of papers includes the first draft of his theory of evolution , notes from the voyage of the Beagle and Emma Darwin 's recipe book .
We are extremely grateful for the kind permission of Cambridge University Library to reproduce these online .
( See the Cambridge University Library Order Form for Digital Images . )
They are presented in the same sequence as the original catalogue , which was divided mostly into bound volumes , each with a library classmark .
History of the material : The Darwin family and the Pilgrim Trust presented a magnificent collection of Darwin 's papers to Cambridge University Library in 1942 ; they were delivered after the war .
As the 1960 Handlist describes :
They were in parcels each containing small packets of manuscript wrapped in tissue paper on which the subjects had been noted in Darwin 's hand .
They were presumably just as Darwin left them , and accordingly this arrangement was preserved when they were bound , the volumes now representing as closely as possible Charles Darwin 's papers in the order in which he left them .
Beside the original papers there were copies of a large number of letters to Darwin , collections of press-cuttings , etc .
These online images are scans from copies of early black and white microfilms produced by the Cambridge University Library Imaging Service , mostly in the 1990s .
For online publication now a slight colour tint has been added to many and the brightness and contrast have been digitally enhanced .
( To compare a document with and without the colour tint click here and here . )
Please note that many of the Darwin papers have been re-catalogued since microfilming in the 1990s .
In some cases items have been re-ordered or moved to other volumes in the archive .
In such cases the electronic images may not match the current arrangement of the papers in Cambridge University Library .
The immense value of this vast collection of material far exceeds the disadvantages of the occasional unreadable image and the lack of full colour .
Several million pounds and years of production would be needed to produce colour digital images of the Darwin Archive .
Hopefully this will eventually be achieved .
In the meantime , most of the world 's finest collection of Darwin 's original manuscripts is now available for all to read , study and explore online and free of charge .
For an overview of Darwin 's papers click here .
Darwin Online cannot give permission to reproduce Darwin manuscripts ; enquiries about this should be addressed to Adam Perkins , Curator of Scientific Manuscripts in the University Library ( ajp21@cam.ac.uk or mss@lib.cam.ac.uk )

Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered a new climate pattern called the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation .
This new pattern explains , for the first time , changes in the water that are important in helping commercial fishermen understand fluctuations in the fish stock .
They ’re also finding that as the temperature of the Earth is warming , large fluctuations in these factors could help climatologists predict how the oceans will respond in a warmer world .
“ We ’ve been able to explain , for the first time , the changes in salinity , nutrients and chlorophyll that we see in the Northeast Pacific , ” said Emanuele Di Lorenzo , assistant professor in Georgia Tech ’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences .
Since 1945 , fishermen in the California current of the Pacific Ocean have been tracking temperature , salinity and nutrients , among other things , in the ocean to help them predict changes in fish populations like sardines and anchovies that are important for the industry .
Studying this data , along with satellite images , Di Lorenzo discovered a pattern of current that he named the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation .
Recent satellite data suggest that this current is undergoing intensification as the temperature of the Earth has risen over the past few decades .
" Although the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation is part of a natural cycle of the climate system , we find evidence suggesting that its amplitude may increase as global warming progresses , ” said Di Lorenzo .
If this is true , this newly found climate pattern mey help scientists predict how the ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean is likely to change if the world continues to warm , as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The research appears in the April 30 edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
At the end of last year , there were a couple of articles about Japan ’s failure to be a giant in the new digital age ( Newsweek on Why Apple Is n’t Japanese , and there were some interesting comments in a blog response Japan is no longer a leader in Electronics ) .
Unfortunately , the Newsweek article completely ignores the technical background which forms the basis for Japan ’s current position in the digital age .
In this post , I want to explore this technical background and show why business - types such as CEO ’s and Newsweek readers really do need to understand the underlying technical issues of a problem .
8 - bit Computers
The real start of the digital gulf between Japan and the western world started back in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the first 8 - bit home computers began to be released .
One of the most important factors at this time was the complexity of the Japanese language .
Put simply , an 8 - bit computer with only 64 k of memory simply does not have the capacity to edit Japanese .
As an example , the first Japanese word processor to use the modern kana - kanji text entry system was the Toshiba JW - 10 .
The JW - 10 was a dedicated word processor with no other functionality .
Released in February 1979 , the JW - 10 weighed 220kg and had a price tag of 6,300,000 yen ( around $ 30,000 ) .
Here in the west , we could get similar capabilities with a $ 300 Commodore Vic - 20 connected to a cheap 8 - pin dot matrix printer .
( In fact , you could argue that the Vic - 20 offered better functionality ) .
Before we continue with the history , let ’s look at the technical details .
( Skip this section if you do n’t care ) .
Technical Details
There are two separate technical barriers for the Japanese language .
The first is displaying the characters .
For anyone who has n’t used an Apple II , Commodore - 64 or other 8 - bit system , here is a screen - shot showing the cutting - edge 8×8 pixel fonts of 1982 .
For comparison , let ’s look at a few common Japanese characters ( these are ranked as the 35th , 64th , and 104th most commonly used characters , respectively ) :
議 選 調
It should be pretty clear that the Japanese are not getting away with 8×8 pixel characters on a 320×200 pixel screen .
The NEC PC - 9801 was one of the leading Japanese personal computers of the time , and offered a 640×400 display with 16 × 20 pixel characters .
For all 6802 characters defined in the 1978 Japanese Industrial Standards ( JIS C 6226-1978 ) , we get 6802x20x16 bits = 265 kBytes of font data .
( Compared to a mere 2 kBytes for 256 8×8 ASCII characters ) .
The second problem is the text entry process – whereby the 100 or so keys on the keyboard are used to select from the 6000 or so characters .
In the days of telegraph , this was done using a 94×94 cell table written on a sheet of paper with all of the characters listed on it .
The “ kuten ” codes were the coordinates of the characters in this table .
The modern kana - kanji conversion approach involves entering characters phonetically , and converting based on dictionaries .
The size of the dictionaries is directly related to how easy it is to enter text .
For comparison , the conversion dictionaries on Windows XP are 36 MB .
An 8 - bit system is pretty much limited to the size of a disk .
Japan 1983
Back to 1983 , and we can see the choices available to the Japanese consumer .
1 ) The Nintendo Entertainment System released 1983 .
14400 yen ( around $ 70 ) .
No keyboard .
Japanese text is displayed as graphics stored in the game ( only the font data for displayed characters need be included ) .
2 ) 8 - bit computer with “ katakana ” Japanese characters .
( Examples include the NEC PC - 8001 series .
The Mark II was released in 1983 was 123,000 yen ( around $ 600 ) ) .
Katakana is a Japanese phonetic alphabet only requiring 50 characters .
Before the advent of computers , katakana was never used to write entire sentences .
Computers that only offered katakana had no practical value to home users over the NES , except for computer enthusiasts .
Although these computers are similar to the Commodore 64 / Apple II in terms of technical capabilities , they are crippled in terms of functionality from the viewpoint of home consumers .
3 ) 16 - bit computers with special hardware for displaying kanji .
The NEC PC - 9801 was released in 1982 and became the number one selling home computer in Japan .
The first model retailed for around 300,000 yen ( $ 1500 ) .
The ROM chips containing the kanji font data were extra ( 50,000 yen – $ 250 ) , and only support Level 1 characters ( around half of the number in the Japanese standards ) .
Kanji input was by kuten code ( i.e. you had to type in the hexadecimal number of the characters you wanted to display ) .
The PC - 9801 featured a standard resolution of 640×400 , which would not be surpassed as a standard in the west until the release of VGA and Macintosh II in 1987 .
4 ) Specialist word processing systems ( i.e. the Japanese equivalent of an electronic typewriter ) .
The JW - 1 ( grandchild of the JW - 10 discussed in the intro ) was released in 1983 for 500,000 yen ( around $ 2,500 ) .
So , 6 years after the Apple II first brought computers into homes in America , the Japanese still had no reason to buy a home computer unless they wanted to type by entering hexadecimal codes .
Whereas computer manufacturers in the west could advertise under the premise of Why Buy Just a Video Game ? , Japanese households were faced with a choice between $ 1500 for a world of hexadecimal nightmare compared to $ 70 for the world of Mario Bros .
Appliances vs General Computers
Throughout the 1980s , western countries saw explosive growth in general - purpose computing platforms , with even games manufacturer Atari switching from a console to a general - purpose computer ( Atari ST ) .
Japan , on the other hand , was deeply immersed in an appliance mentality of computers .
Companies like Nintendo , Sega , and Sony dominated the games console market .
And while American developers worked on desktop operating systems such as Windows and MacOS for general purpose computers , Japanese engineers were working on embedded operating systems such as TRON and T - Kernel for running embedded devices such as fax machines and car engine control systems .
( As an aside , although the name TRON is not well - known among consumers , the number of devices running TRON is on par with the install - base of Windows ) .
The iPod
By the time the iPod was released in 2001 , Japanese mobile phones were already e-mail and internet capable .
Although personal computer numbers had grown , more Japanese were accessing the Internet through their mobile phone than through a computer , and Japanese manufacturers were locked into the appliance mindset .
As an example , consider the Sharp J- SH51 mobile phone released in 2002 which also offered a built - in MP3 player and digital camera .
Despite being one of the most advanced mobile phones in the world at the time , the J - SH51 could not be connected to a computer .
So how did you get music onto your phone ?
Well , you took an analog audio cable and plugged it into the aux .
out plug on your CD player .
In the west , the home computer was already being viewed as the central hub of the digital age .
It was obvious that devices such as digital cameras and MP3 players would need connectivity with the home computer , and that people would transfer pictures from the digital camera to their computer , or would use their computer as the central storage for music files to upload to their iPod or other music player as needed .
The iPod , for example , requires a home computer .
Without one , there is no way to get music on or off the device .
In Japan , however , things were different .
Perhaps the easiest way to understand the Japanese market at the time is to imagine that home computers did not exist .
From this perspective , the direction that the Japanese electronics industry took makes perfect sense .
Everything needed to be designed as stand - alone appliance .
The basis for much of this was the digital memory card , particularly the SD card .
Digital cameras and camera - phones stored everything on a memory stick , and offered DPOF configuration options for configuring printing options .
Color printers went on sale offering SD card slots so that these photos could be printed without a computer in the middle .
MP3 players took a similar turn , offering either analog cable connectivity or SD card slots for music transfers .
New stereo systems also offered an additional SD card slot .
The SD card was like the new cassette .
Record stores even began offering machines that sold digital music directly stored on your SD card .
3G phone handsets were released in 2001 , and Japanese telecoms envisioned a world where consumers would buy and download music directly onto their mobile phones .
It all makes sense if nobody owns a home computer , and when the mobile phone is the dominant form of Internet connectivity .
The flip - side of all this support for stand - alone appliances that do not require a home computer is that the Japanese electronics manufacturers offered virtually no support at all for home computers .
Many devices simply could not be connected to a PC .
For those that could be connected , the support software was unfriendly and extremely primitive .
Let ’s take the SD card as an example .
SD cards offered a ‘ feature ’ called SD Audio whereby music was stored protected by a DRM system .
However , only one manufacturer ever produced USB card readers that actually supported this scheme .
Even if you did manage to track down the lone card reader that supported SD Audio , you still ca n’t transfer music to your SD card .
In fact , you now had to purchase a special version of RealPlayer ( that ’s right , you had to pay for free software ) .
Of course , this kind of situation was n’t going to fly in the west , where everyone had a home computer .
Even in the Japanese market , this was n’t going to fly .
By the year 2000 , most of the technical difficulties facing computers in Japan in the 80s and 90s had been resolved , and home computers were becoming mainstream .
Japanese consumers wanted PC connectivity from their appliances , and the iPod offered a well - designed , highly functional package .
So Apple created the iPod , and Japanese electronics manufacturers were left to re-evaluate a new world where the home computer is the hub for digital media .
The Future
Japanese manufacturers are finally catching on and have started to offer PC connectivity .
Most mobile phones now come with USB cables and software for transferring photos and music to and from a PC .
While the latest music - capable phones still come with an SD card , support has been added for Apple ’s MP4 format , and files can be transferred using a generic card reader .
It ’s difficult to say whether the misjudgment of the Japanese electronics companies was a one - off falter , or if it is the start of a trend .
The Nintendo Wii is certainly a strong indicator that all is not lost , even if it is back on the Japanese strong ground of an appliance - oriented device .

Policy makers and even the voting public make the mistake of thinking that growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) is an indicator of societal progress .
In reality , though , GDP is nothing but an indicator of national spending with no distinctions between those transactions that add to our well - being and those that diminish it .
Chop the top off the mountain to take its coal , and you 'll get economic growth in the area .
Question is , if you taint the water to the point where people can't even touch it safely , can you call that progress ?
( By the way , there 's a great , new film on this subject called Burning Our Future )
If community earnings rise 20 % , but the time parents can spend with their children drops 40 % , can you call that progress ?
If the washing machine industry grows by 20 % , but that is because their products are engineered to last only 50 % as long , can you call that progress ?
All of these scenarios would contribute to a growth in GDP , but a decline in human happiness and well - being .
That 's why Redefining Progress developed the Genuine Progress Indicator ( GPI ) .
GPI starts with the same personal consumption data that GDP is based on , but then adjusts it by assigning monetary values to factors that affect human happiness and well - being .
Those factors include , among others :
The impact of economic growth on happiness , depending on how much of it actually ends up in the hands of the poor people who need it
The amount of " leisure time " available within the culture for things like childcare , housework , volunteer work , etc .
The negative costs of crime - associated legal fees , medical expenses and property damage .
Perversely , an increase in crime , because of these costs , can actually increase the GDP , a clear case of economic growth not indicating an increase in happiness .
The economic externalities like long - term environmental damage associated with carbon emissions , ozone depletion and deforestation .
The point is that if policy - makers adopted a metric like GPI , they would be guided toward adopting agendas that much more tightly focussed on the happiness of the electorate than on far - less - meaningful growth in the economy .
" We believe , " Redefining Progress says on its website , " that if policymakers measure what really matters to people — health care , safety , a clean environment , and other indicators of well - being — economic policy would naturally shift towards sustainability . "
Photosynthesis by plants , algae , and some bacteria is crucial to life on Earth .
It results in food from sunlight and in its process organisms release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide .
Scientists at the Carnegie Institution say a new discovery puts a dramatic twist on what we know - namely that certain marine microorganisms have evolved a way to break the established rules of photosynthesis .
The studies , in Biochimica et Biophysica Acta and Limnology and Oceanography , suggest these marine microorganisms get a significant proportion of their energy without a net release of oxygen or uptake of carbon dioxide .
This discovery impacts not only scientists ’ basic understanding of photosynthesis but may also impact our understanding of how microorganisms in the oceans affect rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide .
The team investigated photosynthesis in a marine Synechococcus , a form of photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria ( formerly blue - green algae ) .
These single - celled organisms dominate phytoplankton populations over much of the world ’s oceans and are important contributors to global primary productivity .
They wanted to understand how Synechococcus could thrive in the iron - poor waters that cover large areas of the ocean , since certain activities of normal photosynthesis require high levels of iron .
While others had suggested a potential role of oxygen as accepting electrons from the photosynthetic apparatus in place of carbon dioxide , the new studies show that this activity is significant in the oligotrophic ( nutrient - poor ) oceans , which cover about half the ocean ’s area .
“ It seems that Synechococcus in the oligotrophic oceans has solved the iron problem , at least in part , by short - circuiting the standard photosynthetic process , ” says Arthur Grossman .
“ Much of the time this organism bypasses stages in photosynthesis that require the most iron .
As it turns out , these are also the stages in which carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere . ”
“ We realized very quickly that there was something different about the Synechococcus that we were studying ” says Shaun Bailey , the lead postdoctoral fellow working on this project .
“ The uptake of carbon dioxide and the photosynthetic activities did n’t match , so we knew that something other than carbon dioxide was being consumed by photosynthesis , and it turned out to be oxygen . ”
The researchers have tentatively identified the enzyme involved in this process to be plastoquinol terminal oxidase , or PTOX .
They point out that this new process must be considered in understanding the net primary productivity attributed to open ocean ecosystems .
During normal photosynthesis , light energy splits water molecules .
This releases oxygen and provides electrons which are then used to “ fix ” carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and manufacture energy - rich molecules , such as sugars .
In the newly discovered process , a large proportion of these electrons are not used to fix carbon dioxide , but instead go to putting the water molecules back together , which results in much less net oxygen production .
“ It might seem like the cells are just doing a futile light - driven water - to - water cycle , ” says Bailey .
“ But this is not really true since this novel cycle is also a way of using sunlight to produce energy , while protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from damage that can be caused by the absorption of light . ”
Capturing energy by a light - driven water - to - water cycle is critical since marine cyanobacteria are constantly using energy to acquire the meager supply of nutrients in their environment .
Recently , this newly discovered phenomenon was shown to occur in nature by graduate student Kate Mackey , who made direct measurements of photosynthesis in field samples from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans .
“ The low nutrient , low iron environments account for about half of the area of the world ’s oceans , so they represent a large portion of the Earth ’s surface available for photosynthesis , ” says Mackey .
“ Our findings show that this novel cycle occurs in two major ocean basins and suggest that a substantial amount of energy from sunlight gets re-routed away from carbon fixation during photosynthesis .
This may mean that less carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere by the open ocean photosynthetic organisms than was previously believed . ”
“ This discovery represents a paradigm shift in our view of photosynthesis by organisms in the vast , nutrient - starved areas of the open ocean ” , says Joe Berry of the Carnegie Institution ’s Department of Global Ecology .
“ We had assumed that like higher plants , the goal was to make carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and store them for later use as a source of energy for any number of cellular functions or growth .
We now know that some organisms short - circuit this complicated process , using light in a minimalist way to power cellular processes directly with a far simpler and cheaper ( in terms of scarce nutrients such as iron ) photosynthetic apparatus .
We do n't know the full significance of this finding yet , but it is certain to change the way we interpret optical measurements of photosynthetic pigments in the ocean and the way we model ocean productivity . ”
Wolf Frommer , director of the Carnegie Institution ’s Department of Plant Biology , agrees about the discovery ’s ground - breaking importance .
“ If we thought we have understood photosynthesis , this study proves that there is much to be learned about these basic physiological processes .
The findings of Grossman ’s laboratory together with previous evidence reported by Greg Vanlerberghe from the University of Toronto showing that the gene encoding PTOX appears to be widespread in marine cyanobacteria will add depth and a mechanistic foundation for the modeling of primary productivity in the ocean . ”

Global warming is disrupting wildlife and the environment on every continent , according to an unprecedented study that reveals the extent to which climate change is already affecting the world 's ecosystems .
Scientists examined published reports dating back to 1970 and found that at least 90 % of environmental damage and disruption around the world could be explained by rising temperatures driven by human activity .
Big falls in Antarctic penguin populations , fewer fish in African lakes , shifts in American river flows and earlier flowering and bird migrations in Europe are all likely to be driven by global warming , the study found .
The team of experts , including members of the UN 's intergovernmental panel on climate change ( IPCC ) from America , Europe , Australia and China , is the first to formally link some of the most dramatic changes to the world 's wildlife and habitats with human - induced climate change .
In the study , which appears in the journal Nature , researchers analysed reports highlighting changes in populations or behaviour of 28,800 animal and plant species .
They examined a further 829 reports that focused on different environmental effects , including surging rivers , retreating glaciers and shifting forests , across the seven continents .
To work out how much - or if at all - global warming played a role , the scientists next checked historical records to see what impact natural variations in local climate , deforestation and changes in land use might have on the ecosystems and species that live there .
In 90 % of cases the shifts in wildlife behaviour and populations could only be explained by global warming , while 95 % of environmental changes , such as melting permafrost , retreating glaciers and changes in river flows were consistent with rising temperatures .
" When we look at all these impacts together , it is clear they are across continents and endemic .
We 're getting a sense that climate change is already changing the way the world works , " said lead author Cynthia Rosenzweig , head of the climate impacts group at Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
Most of the reports examined by the team were published between 1970 and 2004 , during which time global average temperatures rose by around 0.6C .
The latest report from the IPCC suggests the world is likely to warm between 2C and 6C by the end of the century .
" When you look at a map of the world and see where these changes are already happening , and how many species and systems are already responding to climate change after only a 0.6C rise , it just heightens our concerns for the future , " Rosenzweig said .
" It 's clear we have to adapt to climate change as well as try to mitigate it .
It 's real and it 's happening now . "
A large number of the studies included in the team 's analysis reveal stark changes in water availability as the world gets warmer .
In many regions snow and ice melts earlier in the year , driving up spring water levels in rivers and lakes , with droughts following in the summer .
Understanding shifts in water availability will have a big impact on water management and be critical to securing supplies , the scientists say .
By collecting disparate reports on wildlife and ecosystems , it is possible to see how disruption to one part of the environment has knock - on effects elsewhere .
In one study rising temperatures caused sea ice in Antarctica to vanish , prompting an 85 % fall in the krill population .
A separate study found that the population of Emperor penguins , which feed on krill in the same region , had also fallen by 50 % during one warm winter .
A loss of krill , also a dietary staple for whales and seals , was cited as a factor in recent accounts of cannibalism among polar bears in the Arctic .
In 2006 Steven Amstrup , a world expert in polar bears at the US Geological Society , investigated three cases of the animals preying on one another in the southern Beaufort sea .
A lack of their usual prey may have prompted the bears to turn on each other .
Other reports show how the early arrival of spring in Europe has far - reaching effects down the food chain .
The warmer weather causes trees to unfurl their leaves earlier , which causes a rise in leaf - eating grub numbers sooner in the year .
Blue tits that feed on the grubs have largely adapted to the shift , by giving birth to their young two weeks earlier .
" It was a real challenge to separate the influence of human - caused temperature increases from natural climate variations or other confounding factors , such as land - use changes or pollution , " said David Karoly , a co-author based at Melbourne University in Australia .
A fungus responsible for the rapid deterioration of military clothing and canvas tents during the Second World War could significantly improve the production of biofuels , say U.S. scientists .
Once the bane of soldiers fighting in the South Pacific , Tricoderma reesei is a hungry fungus that quickly digests plant fibres into simple sugars .
In a paper published Monday in Nature Biotechnology , researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute say the fungus 's genetic sequence gives important clues about how it breaks down plant fibres .
The finding could lead to processes that more efficiently and cost effectively convert corn , switchgrass and even cellulose - based municipal waste into ethanol .
Ethanol from waste products can be a more carbon - neutral alternative to gasoline .
However , there is an ongoing global debate over fuel and food production .
Groups like the Sierra Club of Canada point out that while more ethanol and less gasoline makes sense , it has to be the right kind of ethanol .
The environmental group says it takes five hectares of cornfields to produce enough ethanol to run a car for a year .
The same land could feed seven people for a year .
The Sierra Club of Canada has urged government to switch from relying on ethanol derived from corn and grains to ethanol produced from waste straw and wood chips .
It argues that producing ethanol from those sources does n't take farmland out of food production and achieves greater reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases .
Meanwhile , the Los Alamos researchers and their colleagues say they decoded the genetic sequence of T. reesei in an attempt to discover why the deep green fungus was so good at digesting plant cells .
The scientists say it could be used to secrete enzymes that can be purified and added into a watery mixture of cellulose pulp and other materials to produce sugar .
The sugar can then be fermented by yeast to produce ethanol .
" Using this information , it may be possible to improve both of these properties , decreasing the cost of converting cellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals , " Joel Cherry , director of research activities in second - generation biofuels for biotech company Novozymes , said in a release .
Denmark - based Novozymes is a collaborating institution in the study .

I love all the perfectionists in the crowd .

Thanks for the emails though .
Changelog 10/10/06
So there have been a bunch of updates in the last week or so .
And I 'd probably call the game playable with an interesting ( yet untuned ) combat system .
The technology phase ( which will be important to a strategy viewpoint ) is currently automated making the system a bit stagnant because of all the same switches .
My overall goal is to allow for combat to happen each turn and make turns fast , and one round can be very different from the next .
I 've noticed a few odd things regarding troop size and combat score , which I 'll tweak to help balance the game .
have n't decided if i think its better to have each unit able to choosing what type of tech .
The best way of doing this I think would be having an infowindow pop open with all the countries that are eligible and clicking a button to choose what type of technology is chosen .
This way , the user would not have to click on 25 countries at the end of his turn .
Also , I would like to change the interface away from using balloons for combat .
Somehow click attacker and click defender .

Being involved in lifestyle marketing really has its perks .
When GrapeThinking was in its infancy , and the only client was Tastevine.com , it was really easy to mix business and pleasure .
As a group of Millennials passionate about promoting things that bring people together , we did n’t find it too demanding to travel to major cities and throw parties promoting particular wines , and of course , the Tastevine wine community .
As the “ tech ” guy , my traveling is not quite as adventurous as say Ruarri ’s travels to Morroco , or Meghan ’s trip Paris , but I do get a chance here and there , and I always try to make the best of it .
Apparently , I ’m starting a tradition of going to a concert / music festival to complement my business trips .
Late last year , while traveling in Chicago for a meeting with the Dead Grapes Society ( an awesome group of wine - lovers ) , I discovered Lalapalooza was the same night / weekend .
After talking with a few of the locals , I found my way to Grant Park , and was just in time to see The Black Keyes , and the last show of the night , Ben Harper , where Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam made a guest appearance .
I ’ve always wanted to see Radiohead .
They are a band reveled as the modern - day Beatles , and they are currently making their way around the globe on their World Tour… Atlanta being the stop this past Thursday night .
Being in town for several business meetings , I called on some friends to see what they were doing , and as would be expected , all of my friends were on their way to the show .
After a quick call to Ticketmaster , I was relieved in knowing I could buy a ticket at the gate as there were plenty , and join my friends for what I was sure would be an awesome experience .
This is where it gets interesting .
I make it to HiFi Buys ( Lakewood ) Amphitheater , and am informed the tickets are sold out …
WHAT ?
After a moment shock , the guy behind the counter tells me he does have just one more .
I quickly pay for the ticket and rush to the gate where I ’m informed that my freshly purchased ticket has already been used …
WHAT ?
Back to the counter I go , where the guy who sold me the ticket takes a highlighter and writes OK on it .
Back to the gate , and without hesitation , they let me in .
Once inside , I navigate to where my friends are sitting , and they “ sneak ” me into the seats of the Amphitheater with them .
After catching up , I proceed to tell them the story about my ticket being OK , at which point I pull out the ticket and show them .
A few seconds later , we discover that the ticket I am holding is not the Lawn Ticket I assumed , but rather a front row ticket …
WHAT ?
Needless to say , I ended up not only getting to see Radiohead , but I was able to live the experience from the front row with a $ 66 ticket .

During the trial , Mr. Campbell , who prosecutors say has been H.I.V. positive since 1994 , denied that he had resisted arrest or spit at an officer , his lawyer , Russell Henrichs , said Thursday .
Mr. Henrichs added that his client had been indicted under a habitual - offender statute that increased the penalty in his case to a minimum of 25 years in prison , because he had been convicted of attacking two other officers in a similar manner and biting two inmates , as well as more than two dozen other offenses .
“ You can see why we thought that we needed to get this guy off the streets , ” said Jenni Morse , who prosecuted the current case .
None of the three officers attacked by Mr. Campbell contracted H.I.V. , Ms. Morse said .
After Mr. Campbell was convicted by a jury , he shouted at the prosecutor and police officers , calling them liars and telling them to “ rot in hell ” for “ railroading an innocent man . ”
He was forced to listen to the rest of sentencing from a holding cell .
Mr. Campbell waived his right to appeal and is awaiting transfer from the Dallas jail to prison .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , H.I.V. is primarily spread through sexual contact or the exchange of blood .
Although there have been rare cases of transmission through severe bites , “ contact with saliva , tears or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of H.I.V. , ” the agency reports .

Have you had problems receiving e-mail from Gmail users recently ?
If so , you 're one of thousands .
Over the past month , major anti-spam vendors have had to apply scrutiny to Gmail in a way they have n't had to before , and the result is reduced delivery performance and sometimes outright blocking of Gmail .
Some messaging hosts are being instructed to reject SMTP connections from Google .
Ars Technica has independently confirmed this .
It all began when Google 's bot - busting CAPTCHA for Gmail was defeated sometime in February .
According to sources around the anti-spam industry , the result has been a marked increase in spam originating from Gmail SMTP servers .
Some say the spam increase started even earlier , but all are in agreement on one thing : this is a serious problem .
After we learned of mail being greatly slowed by MessageLabs ' corporate filtering service , we contacted them to see what 's up .
A support analyst with MessageLabs , a major provider of software - as - a - service anti-spam filtering , told Ars Technica that " some spammers have hacked into the Gmail captcha system , and were able to relay spams appearing to come from Googlemail 's IP addresses .
This has caused many IPs of theirs to appear to be sources of spam . "
For their customers , this means a decrease in performance .
" We have a traffic - shaping system that throttles IPs that we believe to appear to be a source of spam .
The result is that for the past couple of days we have been seeing issues like this with Gmail , " the analyst concluded .
Later , once we confirmed that their servers were not only slowing the delivery of mail but sometimes outright refusing connections to some Gmail relays ( we have connection refused errors to prove this ) , another support analyst told us that " Gmail has sent out a lot of spam recently , and they are registering on our traffic shaping system . "
When spam is sent out over a Gmail relay , that relay can sometimes get completely blocked , causing problems for thousands of legitimate Gmail users .
MessageLabs then has to play whack - a- mole , trying to throttle only the SMTP relays that are spamming .
We have been able to verify the blocking problems , as well as extremely long delays in delivering messages ( delays of four hours and up to 24 hours have been seen on hundreds of emails in our investigation ) .
The problem can be maddening because not all Gmail relays are affected , and the relays effected change frequently .
Hence you may be getting some e-mail on time , while others are n't coming through .
Even some corporate Google e-mail has been blocked , we have confirmed .
Notably , the Postini anti-spam filtering service does not appear to be affected at this time .
Postini was acquired by Google last year .
Purely client - side filters such as SpamBayes are also not affected , but clients using IP - based blocking like the RBL may experience delays or blocks as well .
The real damage currently appears limited to select SaaS filtering solutions , such as MessageLabs and Antigen ( we have reports , but no confirmation from Microsoft at this time ) .
A source at another anti-spam company who wished to remain anonymous did say that Google can expect more problems if the CAPTCHA crack cannot be stopped .
His product team was already working on the issue , but they were unsure how best to handle it .
Russian scientists have obtained the most detailed pictures so far of the insides of a prehistoric animal , with the help of a baby mammoth called Lyuba found immaculately preserved in the Russian Arctic .
The mammoth is named after the wife of the hunter who found her last year .
The body was shipped to Russia in February from Japan , where it was studied using computer tomography in a process similar to one doctors use to scan patients .
" We could see for the first time how internal organs are located inside a mammoth , " said Alexei Tikhonov , deputy director of the Russian Academy of Science 's Zoological Institute , who has been leading the project .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Her internal organs were well preserved – the heart was seen distinctly with all its ventricles and atria , as well as the liver and its veins , " Mr Tikhonov said .
" This is the best preserved specimen not only of the mammoth but of any prehistoric animal . "
The mammoth species has been extinct since the Ice Age .
Tests on Lyuba showed she was fed on milk and was three to four months old when she died 37,000 years ago in what is now the Yamalo - Nenetskiy region in north - central Russia .
The scans showed her airways and digestive system were clogged with silt , indicating that she drowned .
Mr Tikhonov said : " I believe the genetic map [ of the mammoth ] will be decoded within a year or two .
Lyuba will be exhibited in Salekhard [ capital of Yamalo - Nenetskiy ] starting this summer in a case with sub-zero temperatures . "

Jennifer Butler Murray Divorcing Bill Murray Amid Abuse Allegations
, married for 11 years to actor , filed divorce papers on May 12 in Charleston County , South Carolina .
She has raised allegations against the actor which include domestic violence , sexual addiction as well as marijuana and alcohol dependency issues .
Jennifer also indicates that there were frequent instances of abandonment , alleging he would often leave without telling her and would " travel overseas where he engaged in public and private altercations and sexual liaisons . "
Bill Murray 's attorney , John McDougall , would n't comment on the allegations , but said :
The entertainer is deeply saddened by the breakup of his marriage .
He and his wife made loving parents and they are committed to the best interests of their children . "
Murray rose to fame as part of the ensemble cast of Saturday Night Live .
He is also known for his work in film , including Ghostbusters , Groundhog Day , and Caddyshack .
He is also part owner in several minor league baseball teams including the St. Paul Saints .
He and his brothers also own a chain of restaurants called Murray Bros Caddy Shack in Florida .
The couple reportedly have a prenuptial agreement that was signed in 1997 .
Jennifer stands to gain a one time payment of $ 7 million within 60 days of a divorce decree , if the prenup is not contested .
The couple have four children ; Jackson , Caleb , Cooper and Lincoln .

What Do Rats See ?
By studying rats ' eyes and behavior , scientists have a pretty good idea of how a rat sees the world .
In a nutshell , rats are dichromats : they perceive colors rather like a human with red - green colorblindness , but their color saturation may be quite faint , and color appears to be far less important to them than brightness .
Rat vision is quite blurry , around 20/600 for normally pigmented rats .
Albino rats , however , are probably blind or severely visually impaired , with about 20/1200 vision .
WHAT DO NORMALLY PIGMENTED RATS SEE ?
Color vision
Human and rat retinas have two types of light receptors : cones are sensitive to bright light and color , and rods are sensitive to dim light and cannot see color .
Human and rat retinas differ , however , in the types and density of cones in the retina , which has implications for color vision .
Color vision in the retina : Humans have three types of color cones in our retinas .
We have " trichromatic " vision , consisting of short - wavelength " blue " cones , middle - wavelength " green " cones and long - wavelength " red " cones .
Rats have just two types of cones ( called " dichromatic " vision ) : a short " blue - UV " and the middle " green " cones ( Szel 1992 ) .
The " green " cones ' peak sensitivity is around 510 nm ( Radlwimmer 1998 ) , but the " blue " cones are shifted toward even shorter wavelengths than human blue cones , peaking at 359 nm .
This means rats can see into the ultraviolet , they can see colors we can't see ( Jacobs et al. 1991 ; 2001 ) .
About 88 % of a rat 's cones are the middle " green " type , and 12 % are the long blue - UV cones ( Jacobs et al. 2001 ) , the blue - UV cones are located in a zone at the bottom of the retina ( Szel et al. 1996 ) .
For more on how ultraviolet and red - green color vision evolved , see Shi et al .
2001 ; Yokoyama and Radlwimmer 1999 , 2001 ; Shi and Yokoyama 2003 .
Color perception :
What would such vision look like ?
Animals with red - green colorblindness would be able to distinguish blues from greens , but reds would appear dark to them .
They would also have a " neutral " point in the blue - green area of the spectrum : they cannot distinguish these blue - green hues from certain shades of gray .
The rat 's color vision merges into the ultraviolet , however , so they can see ultraviolet shades that we cannot ( see flowers under ultraviolet light to get an idea of what UV looks like ) .
Rats do n't have many cones , though -- 99 % of the rat retina consists of rods , which sense only light and dark , and only 1 % consists of cones ( LaVail 1976 ) , compared to a human 's 5 % ( Hecht 1987 ) .
So the rat 's perception of color may be fainter than ours , and color cues may not be very important to rats .
In fact , brightness appears to be far more important to rats than color .
It is easy to train rats to behaviorally differentiate brightnesses , but difficult to train them to behaviorally differentiate colors ( Jacobs et al. 2001 ) .
So , while rats are physically capable of distinguishing between ultraviolets , blues , and greens , such differences may not be very meaningful to them .
This gets into the whole " just noticeable difference " vs. " just meaningful difference " concept , first introduced by Nelson and Marler ( 1990 ) .
What is the function of ultraviolet vision ?
 Urine - mark visibility : Urine is visible under ultraviolet light ( humans can see rat urine using a black light ) .
Therefore , when rodents leave urine marks in their environment , these marks may visible as well as smellable ( e.g. degus , Chavez et al.
2003 ; voles , Koivula et al. 1999 ; mice , Desjardins et al. 1973 ) .
Unfortunately , these urine marks may also be visible to predators , such as dirunal raptors .
Using ultraviolet cues from the urine marks , kestrels can discriminate between active and abandoned vole trails , thus increasing their hunting success ( Viitala et al. 1995 ) .
 The body under UV : different parts of an animal 's body may reflect different amounts of ultraviolet light .
In degus , for example , the belly reflects more UV light than the back .
Therefore , when a degu stands up on its hind legs it exposes its belly to other degus , and ultraviolet vision may come into play .
When it stands on all fours its low - reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators ( Chavez et al. 2003 ) .
 Twilight ultraviolet vision : Ultraviolet light is not available at night , but is abundantly available during the day .
Interestingly , there is a significant increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours ( Hut et al. 2000 ) .
Rats are nocturnal , but they are also active during the twilight hours , starting just before sunset and ending just before sunrise ( Robitaille and Bovet 1976 ) .
Ultraviolet vision would be advantageous at these twilight times of day .
It is therefore possible that ultraviolet sensitivity is retained in rats because it is useful during the twilight hours .
Visual Acuity
The rat 's world is very blurry .
Visual acuity is measured in cycles per degree ( cpd ) , a measurement of the number of lines that can be seen as distinct within a degree of the visual field .
Acuity of humans is about 30 cpd , normally pigmented rats is 1 cpd , and 0.5 for albino rats ( Prusky et al .
2002 , 2000 ; also see Birch and Jacobs 1979 who found 1.2 cpd for pigmented rats and 0.34 -0.43 cpd for albino rats ) .
If we translate Prusky 's cpd measurements into vision chart measurements , a normally pigmented rat has about 20/600 vision , and an albino rat has about 20/1200 vision .
Rat acuity can also be measured by examining the density of ganglion cells in the retina .
The denser the ganglion cells , the higher the acuity at that point of the retina .
In the rat , the densest area of ganglion cells ( defined as the region encompassing 75 % of maximum ganglion cell density ) is 52.8 º wide and is located slightly above and temporal to the optic disk .
The maximum density of this area is 6,774 cells / mm 2 .
This is n't very dense -- the densest area of the human retina , the fovea , has up to 38,000 cells / mm 2 ( Curcio and Allen 1990 ) .
The low density of ganglion cells of the rat 's retina suggests a maximum visual acuity of 1.5 cpd , which is consistent with the measures found in behavioral acuity experiments ( Heffner and Heffner 1992 ) .
Depth of focus : Combined with poor visual acuity , rats have an enormous depth of focus .
Depth of focus is the range of distances at which an object is in equivalent focus for an unaccomodated eye .
In humans , the depth of focus is from 2.3 meters to infinity ( Campbell 1957 ) .
In rats , the depth of focus is from 7 centimeters to infinity ( Powers and Green 1978 ) , which may be due to the small size of the rat 's eye and its poor acuity ( Green et al. 1980 ) .
One consequence of this difference in depth of focus is that humans perceive blurriness after a change of about 1/3 diopter , but rats require a 14 diopter change to perceive any blurriness ( Powers and Green 1978 ) .
Would tiny eyeglasses help a rat see better ?
To understand why , imagine that you put lenses of different strengths in front of a human 's eyes and a rat 's eyes , like the optometrist does when fitting you for glasses .
A human can perceive slight differences in the strength of these lenses : a difference as low as 0.3 diopter .
A 0.3 diopter lens is a weak lens -- it 's weaker than a 0.5 diopter lens , which would correct the vision of a slightly nearsighted person with 20 / 25 to 20/30 vision .
Therefore , a person with perfect 20 / 20 vision who puts on 0.3 diopter glasses will detect just a little blurriness .
That 's the lowest change in lens strength that humans can perceive .
A rat , however , due to its enormous depth of focus , could n't perceive such a small 0.3 diopter difference in lens strength .
So , if you put tiny 0.3 diopter glasses on a rat it would perceive no change in blurriness .
It would be the same with 2 diopter glasses , or 6 diopter glasses , or even 10 diopter glasses .
In fact , for the rat to perceive any change in blurriness at all , you would need to put thick 14 diopter glasses on it .
With such strong lenses the rat would probably perceive a slight increase in blurriness .
The upshot of this is that rat vision is naturally very poor and cannot be corrected with glasses even if you could make glasses that small .
Rat eyes are not capable of 20 / 20 vision .
Their eyes ' enormous depth of focus , combined with tiny optics , the coarse grain of the retina , their inability to change the shape of their lens to adjust focus , all add up to poor vision .
The rat 's 20/600 vision is probably as good as it gets .
Give a rat immensely strong lenses and its vision would not improve ; its vision would become , if anything , slightly blurrier .
Orientation
Field of vision vs. binocular depth perception : Rats have eyes on either side of their heads .
This position allows for a large field of vision but less binocular vision ( Block 1969 ) .
Specifically , the position of the eyes on the head represents a tradeoff between field of vision and binocular vision , which is used in binocular depth perception .
Laterally - placed eyes ( on either side of the head ) scan separate portions of the world , and the field of vision at any one point of time is enormous .
Because this position allows the animal to detect threats from many directions at once , it is most common in prey animals ( think horses , pigeons , gophers etc. ) .
Eyes placed on the front of the head have much more overlap .
This means a smaller visual field , but more binocular vision .
Depth perception is useful for predators who need to coordinate their movements to capture prey , so predators often have forward - facing eyes ( think raptors , cats , dogs etc . ) .
Here 's how binocular vision provides depth perception .
Each eye sees a slightly different image .
The closer an object is , the more different it will look to either eye .
The brain processes the disparity between the two images and this provides a sense of depth .
Also , focusing on a nearby object makes the eyes converge slightly , and the brain uses information from the eye muscles to calculate how far away the object must be .
So , the move overlap between the visual fields of the two eyes , the more binocular depth perception .
Rats do n't have as much overlap as we do : their field of binocular vision is only about 76 º , while ours is about 105º ( Heffner and Heffner 1992 ) .
Therefore , rats have a larger field of vision than we do but poorer binocular depth perception .
Depth perception using motion parallax :
An image of the object also moves across the retina .
The object 's apparent movement across the retina , combined with the amplitude of the head movement are used to calculate absolute distance between the obeserver and the object .
This is called retinal or absolute motion parallax ( Kral 2003 ) .
Rats use motion parallax to estimate depth .
Legg and Lambert ( 1990 ) counted the number of vertical head bobs before rats jumped between two platforms .
As the gap between the platforms increased , trained rats performed more , and larger head bobs before jumping .
They may be adjusting the size of their head movement until they produce a detectable amount of motion parallax ( Ellis et al. 1984 ) .
As the gap widens , larger head movements are needed .
Legg and Lambert ( 1990 ) found that that rats could jump accurately even if only the leading edge of the platform was visible , indicating that rats use absolute motion parallax to estimate depth .
However , the fact that the rats were reluctant to jump to just a leading edge indicates that they may prefer to use relative motion parallax .
Visual orientation :
Rats use their vision for shorter distances , too .
For example , rats can jump from a raised platform to another surface over a distance of 30 cm ( Lashley 1930 ) .
At very short distances , however , rats may trust their whiskers more than their eyes .
In one experiment , rats were placed on a sheet of glass .
Half the glass was over a platform , and the other half was over a void .
This is called a visual cliff experiment .
Animals that rely on visual information to perceive depth , like human children , choose to step onto the glass above the platform instead of the glass over the dropoff .
Rats , however , chose the deep and shallow side of the glass in equal amounts : they walked fearlessly on the glass suspended over a dropoff .
Their whiskers told them there was a solid surface to walk on .
In contrast , rats with clipped whiskers stayed away from the dropoff and chose the shallow side , indicating that without their whiskers they were forced to rely on vision to perceive depth ( Schiffman et al. 1970 ) .
Vision damage
Vision and aging :
As rats age beyond age two , the rat 's retina loses many of its cells , and parts of the retina become enlarged and thickened .
The capillaries that feed the retina also become greatly thickened ( Weisse 1995 ) .
Therefore , old rats probably do not see as well as young rats .
Conclusion
Normally pigmented rats have panoramic , blurry vision with faint greens , blues and ultraviolets .
These colors may or may not be meaningful to the rats .
This kind of vision probably works just fine for rats : rats can see food and other rats a short distance away , but are still sensitive to incoming hawks or dogs and distant orientation cues .
WHAT DO ALBINO RATS SEE ?
Albinos have a number of differences in their visual systems compared to normally pigmented animals .
In a nutshell , albinos have no pigment -- no melanin -- in their eyes .
This means no pigment in the iris .
That 's why the iris looks red -- the only color left comes from blood in the capillaries .
Albinos also lack pigment deeper in the eye , pigment which normally absorbs light .
Without it , light inside the eye scatters .
The consequence is that the albino 's eye is flooded with light .
Over time , the light causes retinal degeneration .
In addition to all this , albinos have abnormal neural connections between the eyes and the brain .
The end result of all this is that albino rats have very poor vision .
Here are the specifics :
Low visual acuity :
The albino rat 's inability to control levels of incoming light , the scattering of light inside the eye , and gradual retinal degeneration lead to very poor visual acuity .
Albino rats have poorer visual acuity than pigmented rats ( Prusky et al. 2002 ) , estimated at about 20/1200 vision .
Impaired vision in bright light : dazzling : Albino rats can't control levels incoming light .
Normally - pigmented animals have a pigmented iris that surrounds the pupil and controls how much light shines onto the retina .
Albinos lack pigment in their irises , so light passes through the iris , dazzling the retina .
In bright light , albinos may not see anything at all because their retinas are overwhelmed by the incoming light .
Impaired vision in low light :
 Few rods , few photoreceptors :
Rods require a melanin precursor to develop ( dopa ) .
Albinos can't make this .
Without it , about 30 % of the rat 's rods fail to develop ( Ilia et al. 2000 ) .
Not only does the albino rat have fewer rods , but even early in life the rods it does posess have fewer rod photoreceptors ( called rhodopsin ) than the rods of pigmented rats ( Grant et al. 2001 ) .
Rods and their photoreceptors are useful for detecting low levels of light , so albino rats may have trouble seeing in low light conditions .
 Delayed dark adaptation : Albino rats take longer to adapt to the dark than pigmented rats .
Specifically , pigmented rats adapt to the dark within 30 minutes , but albino rats take about three hours ( Behn et al. 2003 ) .
This delay comes from the albino rats ' lack of melanin in their eyes .
Eyes that lack melanin have reduced bio-availability of calcium ( Drager 1985 ) .
Calcium plays a key role in a retina 's ability to adapt to the low light conditions ( called dark adaptation ) ( Fain et al. 2001 ) .
 Night - blindness in albino rats : conflicting reports :
Once dark adaptation is achieved , Balkema ( 1988 ) reports that pigmented rats have a much lower dark - adaptation threshold than albinos .
In other words , Balkema reports that pigmented rats can see under conditions of much lower light than albino rats .
However , Green et al. ( 1991 ) , Herreros et al. ( 1992 ) , and Munoz et al. ( 1994 ) found no such differences in dark - adaptation thresholds between albino and pigmented rats , indicating no albino night blindness .
Problems coordinating what the two eyes see :
There are even further visual differences between albinos and normally pigmented animals , involving the eye - to - brain connection .
In normal mammals , the left side of each eye is connected to the right hemisphere of the brain , and the right side of each eye is connected to the left hemisphere .
Albinos have a much simpler connection : most of the left eye is connected to the right hemisphere , while most of the right eye is connected to the left hemisphere ( Silver and Sapiro 1981 ) .
In addition , the deeper neural projections involved in vision are disorganized ( Creel et al. 1990 ) .
The consequence is that albinos may have trouble coordinating and processing what their two eyes see .
Poor depth perception :
The albino rat 's poor visual acuity leads to poor visual depth perception .
In the visual cliff experiment by Schiffmann et al. ( 1970 ) described in the previous section , rats were placed above a sheet of glass over a ledge and dropoff .
Pigmented and albino rats with intact whiskers relied on their whiskers instead of their eyes and chose to walk on the glass over the dropoff as often as the glass over the ledge .
When the whiskers were clipped , however , the rats were forced to rely on visual cues .
Pigmented rats with clipped whiskers chose the glass over the ledge .
Most whiskerless albino rats also chose the glass over the ledge , but a large percentage of them ( 20 % - 33 % ) made no choice at all but stood stock still .
This failure to choose indicates that albino rats do not use visual information to perceive depth as readily as pigmented rats do .
Albinos appear to be more impaired by whisker removal than pigmented rats , probably because their fallback sensory system -- vision -- is so poor .
Pet owners often note that albino rats bob their heads and sway frequently .
This bobbing and swaying may be the albino 's attempt to increase its perception of depth using its greatly impaired vision .
Poor motion perception : Albino rats have greatly impaired motion perception .
They are not motion blind , but they have poor motion perception when compared to pigmented rats .
Albino rats require about twice to three times the coherence level to distinguish coherent motion patterns from dynamic noise .
Specifically , Hupfeld and Hoffman ( 2006 ) presented rats with moving dot patterns in which dots moved randomly on a screen .
A coherent moving pattern was created by a proportion of the dots moving to the right .
The percentage of dots moving to the right was called the " percentage of coherence . "
So , a 100 % coherence meant all dots moved to the right ; 70 % coherence meant 70 % the dots moved to the right while 30 % moved randomly , and so forth .
Both pigmented and albino rats could distinguish between a random pattern and a 100 % coherence pattern .
When the coherence was reduced , discrimination performance declined in both pigmented and albino rats .
Pigmented rats tended to do better , but not significanly so , down to 30 % coherence .
Below that coherence level pigmented rats did significantly better than albinos .
In sum , pigmented rats could discriminate a pattern of 12 % coherence from dynamic noise , while albino rats needed about 30 % coherence to make the distinction .
Retinal degeneration :
In addition to dazzling them , ambient light ( even at low intensities ) can cause irreversible retinal degeneration ( green light ; Noell1966 ) .
Rods , because they are so sensitive to light , degenerate more easily than cones ( Cicerone 1976 , Lanum 1978 ) , which reduces the rat 's ability to see in low light .
Twenty four hours of ambient light is enough to cause some degeneration , and a few weeks is enough to completely degenerate the outer retina ( Lanum , 1978 ) , by causing loss of photoreceptors and cell bodies ( Wasowicz et al. 2002 ) .
Retinas more easily damaged :
When the rat 's eyes are subjected to pressure , the albino rat 's retina sustains more damage than the pigmented rat 's retina ( Safa and Osborne 2000 ) .
Lens fiber anomalies : Albino rats also have abnormal lens fibers compared to pigmented rats .
When the lens fibers of pigmented and albino rats are observed under the electron microscope , pigmented rat lens fibers have many " ball and socket " joints between them , but albino rats have few of these joints .
The membranes of albino rat lens fibres are often ruptured ( Yamada et al. 2002 ) .
A note about foveas :
Many normally pigmented mammals like humans and other primates have an area of the retina that is packed with cones , called the fovea .
The fovea is surrounded by an area with many more rods than cones .
The fovea therefore has very sharp , color - sensitive vision that is useful in bright light , while the area surrounding the fovea has blurry , mostly monochromatic vision that is useful in low light conditions .
Albinos of these species do n't develop a fovea , so they are missing this patch of sharper color vision .
However , in rats , even normally - pigmented rats do n't develop a fovea ( Reese 2002 ) , so fovea hypoplasia in albinos is n't an issue in rat vision .
What if albinos are provided with a missing enzyme during developement ?
Albinos have a mutated tyrosinase enzyme .
This enzyme is essential for the complex chemical reaction leading to melanin .
This chemical reaction passes through I - tyrosine , L - DOPA , and I - dopaquinone on its way to melanin .
L-DOPA itself plays an important role in retinal development .
Lavado et al. ( 2006 ) examined transgenic albino mice that had the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase spliced in to their genome .
Tyrosine hydroxylase is an enzyme that will do part of what the missing tyrosinase does : it will oxidize I - tyrosine to L - DOPA , but it wo n't go any further toward melanin .
The resulting animals were phenotypically albino , but they did not have many of the visual problems of albinos : they had normal photoreceptors , normal neural pathways in the brain , and improved visual function .
Conclusion
Pigmented rats see a blurry world with only faint color , ranging from green to ultraviolet .
The function of such color vision , and whether it is meaningful to rats , is currently unknown .
Pigmented rats rely less on vision and more on smell and hearing than we do .
They navigate extensively by whisker touch .
Having poor vision is not as great a handicap for the rat as it is for a human .
Rats live in a rich world of sound and smell and touch that enables then to navigate effectively in their world .
Albino rats are probably severely visually impaired or blind within a few weeks of opening their eyes .
Their retinas degenerate , their brains have trouble coordinating images from their two eyes , and they see poorly in both bright and dim light .
The albino rat will therefore need to compensate for its near - blindnes by using its other senses .
Unfortunately , albino rats also appear to have an impaired sense of smell when compared to pigmented rats .
However , albinos do appear to have normal hearing .
Human vision Normally - pigmented rats have blurry dichromatic vision with a little color Albino rats may see a very blurry , light - dazzled world

GENEVA - Believe the advocates of a treaty banning cluster munitions , and the international community is about to take a decisive step toward curbing the use of a weapon that inflicts terrible suffering , particularly on civilians .
Believe the US government , and the measure they propose threatens to undermine the NATO alliance that has underpinned Western security since World War II .
Delegates from more than 100 countries will open a conference in Dublin tomorrow that will try to hammer out a treaty banning the production , use , stockpiling , or transfer of cluster munitions - bombs or artillery shells packed with up to several hundred bomblets or submunitions that are sprayed over wide areas of territory .
Major producers and stockpilers of cluster munitions , the United States , Russia , and China , will be absent and are opposed to a treaty , but disarmament specialists liken the cluster treaty to the Ottawa Treaty of 1997 banning land mines , which was shunned by the major powers but has proved influential in shaping the policies of countries outside the convention .
Support for a ban on cluster weapons has risen sharply since the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon , when , according to United Nations estimates , Israeli troops fired some 4 million Vietnam War-era submunitions , of which a quarter failed to explode .
These have reportedly caused more than 200 casualties since the end of the war and required a costly and hazardous cleanup operation by international aid agencies - often funded by Western governments .
In Laos , where the United States dropped 2 million tons of ordnance in the 1970s , including an estimated 260 million submunitions , unexploded weapons still kill and maim people and hinder economic development .
As many as 10 percent to 15 percent of cluster munitions normally fail to explode on impact but those who support the treaty say the figure could be much higher .
A study by Handicap International , a nongovernmental organization based in Belgium , found that 98 percent of recorded victims were civilians and one - third of casualties were children .
But after a series of international and regional conferences that have mapped out the broad parameters of a treaty , Dublin is the venue where negotiators have to refine rhetoric into a legally binding instrument governing a weapon system that represents a substantial part of the arsenal of the United States and some of its NATO allies .
" It 's going to be a bruising conference , " said Patrick McCarthy , coordinator of the Geneva Forum , a disarmament research body .
A handful of issues loom as key battlegrounds .
One will be the definition of what constitutes a cluster munition , with richer Western nations like Britain , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Sweden , and Switzerland pressing for exclusion of sophisticated weapons that have self - destruct mechanisms , target sensors , or a small number of submunitions .
Others , like Germany , want a transition period of up to 10 years during which they can continue to use such weapons while they find replacements .
Among the most contentious is a proposed clause that would prevent those who sign onto the treaty from engaging in joint operations with forces still employing cluster munitions .

Rachel Hoffman , 23 , had been in a pretrial diversion program after a minor marijuana arrest .
Police in Tallahassee searched her home and allegedly found marijuana and ecstasy .
Under threat of going to prison , she agreed to become a police informant .
Police sent her to buy a gun from crack dealers .
Her dead body was found two days later .
The St. Petersburg Times reported on May 14 , 2008 ( " Police informer buried , but questions linger , " that " Rachel Morningstar Hoffman was laid to rest Tuesday amid grief and questions about how and why she died .
Hoffman , 23 , was killed last week while serving as a informer for the Tallahassee Police Department .
Police say she did n't follow proper protocol on a drug sting , agreeing to meet two suspects away from the spot where police told her to stay , and that led to her death .
But friends and relatives contend authorities put Hoffman at risk in the first place .
' The Tallahassee police are trying to slander her , ' said lifelong friend Cole Altner , 22 , who spoke at the service .
' They have a responsibility for her life and death . '
More than 800 people attended the 23 - year - old's " celebration of life " service at Temple Ahavat Shalom in Palm Harbor .
In the synagogue 's foyer , scores of pictures showed Hoffman 's beaming smile as she hugged friends , posed as a child with Pippi Longstocking ponytails or snuggled with her cat Bentley . "
The Times explained that " A graduate of Countryside High School and Florida State University , Hoffman was in a pretrial drug diversion program for a February 2007 charge of marijuana possession and resisting arrest .
On April 17 , Tallahassee police served a search warrant and found marijuana and ecstasy at her apartment .
In an effort to avoid more serious charges , Hoffman agreed to become an informer .
So the young woman who aspired to be a chef met Andrea J. Green , 25 , and Deneilo R. Bradshaw , 23 , on May 7 to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills , 2 ounces of cocaine or crack , and a gun .
She had $ 12,000 to $ 15,000 in cash when she met the men , said her boyfriend , Ben Reeves .
Her body was found two days later in rural Taylor County . "
The Times noted that " Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said he has asked his inspector general to review the matter and stressed that his agency would review the ' process '
Tallahassee police use in working with informers , not the " case " involving Hoffman . "
The Tampa Tribune on May 13 , 2008 ( " Police Defend Informant 's Use " ) reported that " Before the drug deal that led to her death went down , confidential informant Rachel Hoffman called investigators to tell them the location of the meeting had changed .
Investigators explicitly told her to stay at the park location set up by narcotics officers , Tallahassee police spokesman David McCranie said Monday , Instead , he said , Hoffman hung up .
Police never saw her alive after Wednesday .
The body of the 23 - year - old , a graduate of Countryside High School in Clearwater , was found early Friday in rural Taylor County , southeast of Tallahassee .
Her funeral is today . "
According to the Tribune , " Johnny Devine , Hoffman 's attorney , said police should have spoken with him .
Legal counsel and the State Attorney 's Office were n't consulted when Hoffman became a confidential informant .
Police do n't routinely speak with the state attorney 's office about such things unless the arrest violates a person 's probation , McCranie said . "
The Tribune noted that " Mike Weiss , Hoffman 's stepfather , said he wants police to stop saying Hoffman broke protocol
He asked how Hoffman could understand how important protocol is and how an untrained civilian could understand how to protect herself in such a situation .
' The reality is , untrained civilians of any age should not be put in that position by a police force , ' he said .
' They took a 23 - year - old relatively naive person and put her in a life - threatening situation . '
Hoffman 's mother , Margie Weiss , said she is forming a foundation to push for a requirement for confidential informants to seek legal advice before consenting to undercover work .
It also would work to get marijuana convictions decriminalized .
' Her death will make history , ' she said .
' It 's a great loss .
The only way I can make sense of it is by now having her memory live on . '
So far , few details have been , released on what happened after Hoffman - hung up the phone .
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will serve as the lead agency in the homicide portion of the investigation because the case crosses several jurisdictional lines . "
In Phylogenetic Fallacies : Early Branching Must Mean Primitive
I focused on the misconception that an " early branching " lineage was necessarily " primitive " ( i.e. , very similar to a distant ancestor ) .
This time , I want to discuss something slightly more subtle , but nonetheless important , with regard to interpreting phylogenies .
Specifically , I want to note a problem with the very concept of one lineage " branching off from " another lineage .
There can be a tendency to consider evolutionary trees as reflecting a main line with a series of " side branches " .
This is especially true when the tree is " unbalanced " ( lineages are depicted with uneven amounts of diversity ) and " ladderized " ( the more diverse branches are placed on the same side of each node ) .
The following is a general unbalanced , right - ladderized tree .
This sort of diagram is often interpreted as implying that there is a " main line " leading from a distant ancestor up through time to species A , and that the lineages now represented by species H , G , F , E , D , C , and B " branched off " from this main line earlier or later , in that order .
However , one can just as accurately represent this phylogeny with several of the branch points ( nodes ) rotated with no effect on the order of branching ( topology ) , as shown in the next figure .
A is still closest to B , then C , then D , and so on , just as with the previous representation .
Looking at the most recent split , between A and B , in this version of the phylogeny , it would not make much sense to argue that one branched off from the lineage of the other -- they are both derived from a common ancestor from whom their respective lineages diverged at the same time .
Likewise , the lineage leading to H did not branch first off a main lineage leading to A , rather it and the lineage that ended up leading to G and all the other species split into two .
Looking at a real example , one can see how the main line fallacy creeps in when interpreting evolutionary trees .
Here is a phylogeny showing the relationships among several lineages of vertebrates , namely cartilaginous fishes , some bony fishes , and some tetrapods .
It might be tempting to see this as indicating that sharks branched first , then bony fishes , then amphibians , then birds .
This , like the abstract trees presented previously , is unbalanced and ladderized .
Humans are placed at one end , as they usually are ( even though this is an arbitrary decision -- birds could just as accurately assume the rightmost position by rotating their shared node ) .
However , notice what happens when we rotate some nodes and change the sampling of species presented in the phylogeny .
In this case , sharks , humans , frogs , and bony fishes are included , but the diversity of bony fishes , which make up about half of all vertebrates , is slightly better reflected .
If one were to interpret the revised phylogeny in the same way as the first one , then one would conclude that sharks branched first from the main line leading to perch , then the lineage leading to humans and frogs , then the lineage represented by trout , then the one represented by goldfish .
The point here is that one can only talk about which lineages " branched first " when one has a main line in mind from which other lineages can be considered side tracks .
In the case of the " earliest branching animals " discussed in the last post , the lineage now represented by ctenophores and the one that ended up including all the other living animal lineages would simply have split from a common ancestor , and at the time it would not have been possible to identify either line as a branch off the other .

IT IS exceptionalism week in the world of American think - tanks .
No fewer than three of them — the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution in Washington , DC , and the Manhattan Institute in New York City — have arranged discussions of a fat new book on the subject , “ Understanding America : The Anatomy of an Exceptional Nation ” , edited by Peter Schuck and James Q. Wilson .
But , as Hegel feared , do the thinkers understand a concept just as it stops being relevant ?
Does the owl of Minerva really fly only at dusk ?
All countries are exceptional .
But America likes to think of itself as exceptionally exceptional , different from other advanced industrial countries not just in its social arrangements but also in its underlying values .
America has a smaller state than other comparable countries and a more unequal distribution of wealth .
It is also more strongly committed to what Margaret Thatcher once called “ Victorian values ” — individualism , voluntarism , patriotism .
American exceptionalism has been increasing ever since the rise of the modern conservative movement from the late 1960s onwards .
The current Bush administration , with its commitment to conservative values at home and assertiveness abroad , is the most exceptional administration in recent years .
But the book raises a new question : is a new cycle , dominated by a rejection of conservatism and a convergence with West European norms , about to dawn ?
There is plenty of compelling evidence .
The Bush administration has whipped up a mighty opposition .
The Democrats are poised to increase their majorities on Capitol Hill and have a better - than - even chance of taking the White House .
George Bush has the highest disapproval rating of any president in the 70 - year history of the Gallup poll .
Nearly three - quarters of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction .
The conservative movement is suffering a collective mental breakdown .
Americans strongly favour the introduction of universal health care .
They are also desperate to improve their global image .
Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have promised to introduce the former .
All three candidates have promised to improve the latter .
The next administration will undoubtedly see significant moves , such as the closing of Guantánamo Bay or the adoption of stronger environmental regulations , that will be intended to make America less of an outlier .
But look at the 2008 election — the one that is supposed to be changing the direction of the country — and American exceptionalism seems to be as strong as ever .
Where else do primary elections go on for well over a year ?
Where else do candidates raise tens of millions of dollars a month from their supporters ?
And where else do the party rank - and - file ( as well as some non-party people ) get a chance to choose the candidate for the top job ?
Gordon Brown became Britain 's prime minister without a single ordinary Briton casting a vote .
John McCain won his party 's nomination despite the opposition of a large chunk of his party .
Mr Obama is leading an uprising against his party 's old establishment .
The various campaigns have often invoked American exceptionalism , especially the strength of its religious feeling .
Mrs Clinton has stressed her credentials as a cradle Methodist who once thought of becoming a minister .
Even before the Jeremiah Wright affair , Mr Obama spoke at length about how he found purpose in life when he discovered God .
The only odd thing about this election is the fact that the Democratic candidates both seem more comfortable with God -talk than Mr McCain .
All three candidates preach a peculiarly American style of patriotism .
Mr McCain invokes his military service in Vietnam , when he learnt to depend on something greater than himself .
Mr Obama argues that there is not a red America or a blue America but one America united by common values .
All three candidates wax lyrical about the American dream .
And by European standards all three candidates are strikingly willing to sanction the use of force .
Mr McCain sings “ Bomb , bomb Iran ” to the tune of “ Barbara Ann ” .
Mr Obama talks about sanctioning a search - and - destroy mission in Pakistan without the permission of that country 's government .
Mrs Clinton said this week that , as president , she would have no qualms about “ totally obliterating ” Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel .
More liberal is not less American
A Democratic hat - trick in November would certainly produce a more liberal America , with more government involvement in providing health care and protecting the environment .
But it will be a liberal America of an exceptionally American kind , not a facsimile of Europe .
Both candidates have rejected the “ single - payer ” health - care model popular in Canada and Europe .
Instead they advocate a very American solution — allowing people who are happy with their private health coverage to keep what they have but then using a mixture of mandates and subsidies to extend coverage .
And even modest changes will be endlessly diluted .
The world may be transfixed by the presidential campaign .
But the president 's powers , as the book stresses , are remarkably limited , qualified not just by Congress and the courts but also by the states and the localities .
The big change coming is not the end of American exceptionalism but the end of American triumphalism .
Winning the cold war left many Americans intoxicated with power .
Even Bill Clinton boasted about America as the “ indispensable nation ” — a country that stood taller and saw farther than its rivals .
The mood is very different today .
The main challenge facing the next president will not be to blunt American exceptionalism , but to make sure that American triumphalism is not replaced by a grumpy and irresponsible isolationism .
William Noguera creates art on death row
On death row at San Quentin for 20 years , William Noguera is finding a following as an artist

Every day for hours on end , William Noguera huddles over paper propped on his steel bed , stippling thousands on thousands of dots that form the images in his fine photo - realist ink drawings .
" I have a sense of urgency when I work , a drive that 's inside me .
Because I do n't know how much time I have , " said Noguera , who 's been on Death Row at San Quentin State Prison since 1988 .
" When the rhythm and flow are going , there 's no stopping me .
I go for two to three days . "
Convicted of murdering his girlfriend 's mother in 1983 when he was 18 , Noguera has had a quarter century to contemplate his life and develop the remarkable technique that lets him express himself in dreamlike montages whose style he calls " hyperrealistic , neo- cubism . "
There 's an intensity to these subtly shaded black - and - white pictures , a batch of which are on view at the Braunstein / Quay Gallery in San Francisco .
" Someone told me this was the most unbelievable use of black - and - white they 'd seen in years , " said longtime gallery owner Ruth Braunstein , who saw the work and wanted to show it .
She 'd heard Noguera was in prison but did n't know why .
" He 's an unbelievable draftsman , and I like this kind of storytelling art , " said Braunstein , standing before Noguera 's " Voices Carry . "
It 's a montage of images that speak of loss and loneliness : a little girl seen from behind , gazing out a window ( Noguera was thinking of his little sister at the time of their parents ' divorce ) , empty bar stools and tables , a pair of calla lilies , a curtain blowing in an empty room , an ice - chilled cross .
" I do n't know what the story is , but I can use my imagination .
What I love is that he 's using a very old form of mark - making , stippling , and making it work . "
Braunstein was intrigued by Noguera 's story - his appeals are exhausted at the state level but will be heard in federal court - " but I think the work holds up in and of itself . "
Taught to draw as a child
A surfer and martial artist from the Southern California town of Hacienda Heights , Noguera , who's of French Colombian ancestry , learned to draw from his parents , both artists .
From his father , a mechanic who sculpted in marble , wood and titanium , " I learned the art of patience , " said Noguera , sitting in a tiny visiting room at San Quentin .
A fit , charismatic man with a graying goatee , intelligent brown eyes and a polite , proud manner , he was brought into the room handcuffed and then released before greeting a reporter and Cassandra Richardson , his friend and art agent .
Scott Peterson , the infamous star of Death Row , sat in the next glass birdcage .
" I'm a fundamentalist when it comes to art , " said Noguera , 43 , who speaks passionately about Rembrandt , Titian , Rubens , modernists like Rothko and contemporary figures like Brice Marden and Christopher Wahl .
He studies their art in journals and prison library books .
" Da Vinci said , ' Learn to imitate the masters , and whatever else you do , people will accept it , ' " he said .
Art " is not a luxury for me , it 's a necessity , " Noguera said .
" There 's a transcendence .
I rise above the situation .
As soon as I pick up the pen , I 'm gone from this place .
Art gives me the freedom I crave .
The only thing I have is my imagination .
Art for me is about childhood , going back to when things were simple and innocent .
The man before you is just a vehicle for that little boy . "
Drawn freehand mostly from photographs , the work may look beautiful , " but there 's a lot of pain .
If I draw a beautiful woman , I miss that woman . "
He wants to " trigger an emotion for you , whatever it might be - love , hatred , passion .
I 'm not concerned if people understand my work .
My intentions are irrelevant , " added Noguera , who calls his 4 - by - 10 - foot cell his studio .
By law , Noguera can't profit financially from his work .
Forty percent of the proceeds from the sale of his drawings - which fetch between $ 5,000 and $ 12,000 - goes to Richardson 's company , Camorra Fine Art , and the rest goes to Noguera 's family ( his parents , two sisters and a son live in Southern California ) .
Richardson , who picks up the work at the prison hobby shop , first met Noguera in 2004 , when she worked for the San Francisco - based Institute for Unpopular Culture .
He 'd written asking for help getting his work out there .
Richardson fell in love with Noguera 's art .
But knowing he 'd killed somebody - Jovita Navarro , a La Habra woman whose then - 16 - year - old daughter was also convicted of murder - she was leery about speaking with him .
When they finally did talk by phone , she said , she was struck by his candor and sincerity , and eventually began visiting him in San Quentin .
Case is on appeal
He 'd been sent up by a jury that believed he killed for financial gain because Dominique Navarro stood to inherit some insurance money and the home of her mother , who'd been brutally beaten and choked .
The more she learned about it , Richardson said , she came to agree with Noguera 's appellate lawyer , Robert R. Bryan , that Noguera deserved a new trial .
" What I 'm comfortable saying is that he was in love with this girl and he never had a good relationship with her mother , " Richardson said .
" The girlfriend got pregnant and the mother basically forced her to get an abortion .
William is a devout Catholic .
He walked in and lost it and killed her . "
Noguera said he can't discuss the case because it's on appeal .
" I live with it every day , " he said .
" I have regret , remorse , and I 'm terribly sorry for what happened . "
Does he think about being executed ?
" It crosses my mind , " he said .
" Any man who told you he was n't scared would be a liar . "
The other night , about 20 people came by the Braunstein / Quay gallery to preview his show and hear from Noguera via speaker phone from San Quentin .
A taped voice informed them that the collect call would be monitored .
Painter Wilma Parker had been dazzled by the drawings that afternoon , not knowing the backstory .
Hearing it , she was intrigued .
" I wanted to hear his voice and how he feels about his art , " said Parker , who told the artist : " I was blown away by your work .
It 's very beautiful .
Could you elaborate a little more on your technique ?
It looks like pointillism . "
Noguera , who expressed thanks and gratitude - he'd told the crowd he had " 100 butterflies in his stomach " - replied : " It is a form of pointillism .
Basically , all these thousands of dots cling together to form a realistic image . "
He recounted how he'd been thrown in the hole for 27 days when first arrested , read " The Count of Monte Cristo " - which inspired his " A Stone for Edmund Dantes " - and began drawing all over the walls .
" It poured out of me like water , and I have n't stopped since . "
Touched , Braunstein , 84 , told Noguera : " This is a unique experience for me .
I 've never done anything in the gallery like this in my life .
Your work just talked to me when I first saw it . "
A few days earlier , during a phone interview , Noguera said he hoped to be seen as an artist , not an inmate doing art .
" This place where I must live is irrelevant to my art , " he said .
" It has no bearing on it .
However , I realize your audience finds it interesting .
But I would ask them to transcend this , and use their capacity to feel and truly see my work as an entity of its own , judged in isolation from me . "

Oil : One Last Head - Fake ?
( May 9 , 2008 )
It was n't too long ago ( a year ? ) that an analyst who called for $ 100 / barrel oil was accused of fear - mongering / sensationalism .
To illustrate just how flat - footed analysts have been , here is a chart from an early 2006 article in Barrons which anticipated oil staying below $ 100 / barrel all the way through 2011 .
And here we are at $ 123 / barrel and rising , in May 2008 .
Hmm .
Exactly what 's stopping the price from climbing to $ 300 / barrel by 2010 ?
The standard answer is " demand destruction , " i.e. people will drive less , fly less , car - pool , etc. as the the price increases past some " threshold of pain . "
To most observers ' surprise ( me included ) , the rise of oil from $ 60 / barrel to $ 120 / barrel has barely dented demand for gasoline , jet fuel , electricity , etc .
So where is the " threshold of pain " ?
Clearly , a lot higher than $ 130 / barrel and $ 4 / gallon for gasoline .
Frequent contributor Michael Goodfellow recently pointed me to this chart of inflation - adjusted gasoline prices going back nearly a century , and the accompanying commentary : Inflation adjusted Gasoline Prices Above all time highs ( Inflationdata.com )
Here are excerpts from the commentary : Back in 1980 - 81 we were shocked as gas prices rose above $ 1.00 for the first time .
This was especially shocking because in 1976 gas was $ 0.60 per gallon .
But by 1981 the average price for the entire year was $ 1.35 .
Obviously if that was the average some people were paying much more .
Adjusting this for inflation we get an average inflation adjusted price for a gallon of gasoline in 1981 of $ 3.17 in March 2008 dollars .
We are not dealing with peak prices but average prices .
And not only average prices over the whole year but also over the whole country , so there is quite a bit of variation .
Unfortunately , way back in 1918 when Gasoline was a luxury item and people still rode horses as their means of transportation ... gasoline in inflation adjusted terms was about $ 3.50 a gallon .
It would seem that the price point which will trigger behavioral modifications in gasoline / jet - fuel / diesel demand is quite a bit higher than $ 4 / gallon .
So what is that " threshold of pain " ?
Frequent contributor U. Doran recommended two articles on the subject : OIL SHOCK AND ENERGY TRANSITION ( Andrew McKillop ) and Thoughts on Demand Destruction : Where Is It ? ( The Oil Drum ) .
In the first piece , the author supports the notion that price does n't really lower demand -- only recession does that .
The second commentary offers evidence that the price jump to $ 120 / barrel has hardly affected demand , though there may be a lag - time between the price and the behavioral changes it triggers , such as buying more fuel - efficient vehicles .
Michael Goodfellow offered these comments on prices and demand :
The counter arguments for me on oil prices are : 1 ) Europe has been putting up with prices double ours for years .
It has n't crashed their economy .
You just get lots of smaller cars .
2 ) Since we drive so many SUV's and other low - mileage vehicles , we have plenty of slack to pull in .
Someone driving ( like me ) a 15 mpg vehicle could switch to one of those high - mileage diesels or city cars and cut our fuel consumption by 2/3 .
Back to $ 1.50 / gal gas , in effect .
There are a lot of people who 've started to do exactly that , by buying new or used compacts and trying to sell the gas guzzlers .
This all happened before in the 70's , remember .
The 80's saw lots of small cars .
It will happen again .
If government wants to help , they can slash the building permit process for inner cities , and actively remove the eyesores that drop property values , instead of " preserving " them .
And do whatever else it takes to make cities competitive with the suburbs in terms of price and convenience .
Then we would n't have to drive so much .
In support of Michael 's observation about prices in Europe , I have read accounts that demand in the EU is essentially unchanged despite $ 8 / gallon prices on the continent and $ 10 / gallon prices in the U.K .
Undoubtedly some incremental conservation efforts are underway , but the response globally appears to be more or less a shrug and a sigh , and the cutting of some other expense in order to fill the tank .
On the other hand , a deep , prolonged global recession will cut demand .
History circa 1980 - 83 certainly supports this expectation .
Commentator Downsouth observed on the Oil Drum thread :
In the last big bull oil market we saw West Texas intermediate rise from $ 3.56 per barrel in 1973 to $ 39.50 in 1980 .
World consumption peaked at 67 million BOPD in 1979 and fell to a low of 58 million BOPD in 1983 before it began rising again .
An 11 - fold increase in oil price and an eventual 13.5 % decrease in cosumption .
Here are some observations about demand and price .
1 . In the last serious recession of 1980 - 83 , as oil rose from a relative low to a relative peak ( see chart above ) gasoline prices approximately doubled .
2 . Did the price increase cause the recession ?
The most plausible answer is no , the recession was caused by macro-economic ills : stagflation , high inflation and then skyrocketing interest rates which suppressed borrowing -- the lifeblood of the U.S. economy .
Demand fell not from price but because 15 % of the U.S. was unemployed and businesses were losing money .
3 . Has the price of oil ever gone down significantly when demand fell beneath supply ?
Yes .
In the late 1990s , the price of oil fell to $ 10 / barrel despite robust demand .
4 . What could possibly cause demand to fall significantly globally , say between 10 % and 15 % ?
The same thing which caused the 13.5 % decline in the early 80s - - recession .
As I have suggested here for years ( as have many others ) , the global economy is ripe for a deep , prolonged recession as the unprecedented financial excesses of the past 25 years get worked off .
Demand destruction has a simple cause : some well - paid person loses their job .
No more corporate meetings to attend , no commute , etc. 5 . The " low hanging fruit " of job arbitrage / offshoring has been picked .
The coming recession wo n't gut manufacturing -- now a mere 9 % or less of the workforce -- it will gut the middle - class positions because that 's all that 's left to cut .
All the low - paying jobs except janitorial services , retail and leisure / hospitality have already been shipped overseas .
So yes , lower - paying jobs will be axed , but perhaps for the first time in 25 years , so will middle - class positions .
Consider that 75 - 80 % of all local government expenses are for labor / benefits .
As tax revenues fall quarter after quarter and year after year , where else can government trim expenses except payroll ?
A lot of well - paid positions will have to disappear in the process of " living within our means . "
6 . How low could oil fall in a deep global recession ?
Let 's think though some possible factors which would influence demand and supply imbalances .
7 . As Michael Goodfellow alluded to above , the U.S. has constructed an immense sprawl of suburbs and exurbs which require residents to use vehicles to get to work , school , markets , leisure activities , etc .
The only way to fundamentally restructure that demand is to move millions of people from the suburbs into or near the cities .
Yet long - standing forces of NIMBYism ( not in my backyard ) , greedy local governments demanding huge development fees and antiquated zoning codes all create resistance to increasing the density of low - density U.S. cities .
8 . The other way to reduce demand in the U.S. is to stay home : either work from home ( telecommute ) or be unemployed at home .
If 15 million people lose their jobs ( out of about 133 million jobs , an effective unemployment rate of 11 % , about the " official " rate in 1982 ) then demand will most certainly diminish .
In a recession , most companies stop making big profits .
They have to cut expenses , and air travel is an obvious discretionary luxury in the vast majority of corporate situations .
9 . The purchase of higher - mileage vehicles will have a very limited effect in the timespan of a few years .
Here is somewhat dated U.S. fleet data ( for the year 2000 ) from the Federal Highway Administration : The U.S. Vehicle Fleet .
There are roughly 220 million light - trucks ( pickups , vans and SUVs ) and automobiles in the U.S. and sales are roughly 15 million units a year , evenly divided between the light truck family and autos .
This suggests that it would take about 15 years to turn over the entire U.S. vehicle fleet to higher - efficiency vehicles .
In a recession , vehicle sales would drop considerably , significantly lengthening the time required to change over to a higher - mileage fleet .
10 . Demand in China and India may well be far more elastic than Western analysts assume .
The blistering growth of oil demand in China is repeated endlessly , yet those who recall China 's roadways as recently as 2000 may wonder just how difficult it will be for most Chinese car - owners to park the recently - acquired car and pull out the old bicycles .
Yes , those who bought McMansions in new Chinese suburbs will still have the need to drive a vehicle to get anywhere , but the number of these folks is tiny relative to China 's population .
In city after city -- Nanjing , Suzhou , etc. etc.-- residents could get around quite easily just as they did 15 years ago -- by bicycle .
So to assume that demand cannot be destroyed by recession in China is if anything an even more precarious assumption than reckoning demand cannot go down in the U.S. 11 .
What about supply ?
As we all know -- or at least those of us who follow energy do -- Peak Oil has all but been announced by declines in oil production in Mexico , Russia , Norway and the U.K. ( North Sea ) .
Yet as I have submitted here before , there are immensely powerful political forces which will attempt to boost oil production as demand falls and prices follow suit .
Most oil exporting nations have constructed two pernicious structural impediments to reducing production : a. massive gasoline subsidies to their own population , insuring rapid growth in demand and a net loss to the government , and b. immense public welfare programs entirely dependent on oil revenues to placate their poorer citizenry .
Politically , countries like Venezuela will have no choice but to attempt to raise production as prices fall in a desperate attempt to make up the shortfalls in politically essential government revenues .
Ironically , this high production will only feed the price collapse .
Am I suggesting Peak Oil is not a reality ?
Far from it .
12 .
As the global economy totters and falls , the lowly U.S. dollar might stage a comeback as a relative " flight to quality . "
This certainly seems like a tenuous thesis at the moment , but history suggests that when the U.S. sneezes , the world economy catches a cold .
A rising dollar would also act to suppress the ( dollar - denominated ) price of oil .
What I am suggesting is a gigantic head - fake in which global recession causes oil demand and price to plummet for a brief period .
This will feed a resurgent complacency about Peak Oil , setting the world up for an unprecedented shock when the global economy and demand recovers .
Here is a chart illustrating the thesis : Plausible ?
Implausible ?

While we 're celebrating the Year of the Rat , we should also take time to celebrate all the groovy developments in robotic rats we 're likely to see this year .
It 's been six years since a group of researchers figured out how to direct a rat 's movements with a brain implant and backpack controller ( pictured ) .
Recently , Chinese scientists announced they 'd extended the technique to carrier pigeons .
Now scientists have moved on to bigger and better ratbots .
Find what 's in store in the Year of the Ratbot .

The first cool thing we 've got is a robot controlled by pieces from a rat 's heart .
A couple of weeks ago , Discover magazine explained :
A team of researchers affixed heart tissue from a rat onto the body of the robot .
When the tissue contracted , the robot's six horizontally aligned legs ( see image ) pulled together .
When the tissue relaxed , the legs drew apart .
The pulses propelled the robot forward through a solution at 100 micrometers per second ( about 0.0002 mile per hour ) .
The researchers hope to make other biocompatible devices that could one day carry clot - busting agents to clogged vessels .

We 're also about to get a crop of robots controlled with rat brains , or at least simulated rat brains .
Last year , New Scientist explained :
A robot controlled by a simulated rat brain has proved itself to be a remarkable mimic of rodent behaviour in series of classic animal experiments .
The robot 's biologically - inspired control software uses a functional model of " place cells " .
These are neurons in an area of the brain called the hippocampus that help real rats to map their environment .
They fire when an animal is in a familiar location .
Alfredo Weitzenfeld , a roboticist at the ITAM technical institute in Mexico City , carried out the work by reprogramming an AIBO robot dog , made by Japanese firm Sony , with the rat - inspired control software .
When placed inside a maze , the robot learnt to navigate towards a " reward " in a remarkably similar way to real rodents , using landmarks to explore .
So in the year of the ratbot , look out for two things : robots controlled with pieces of rat bodies , and robots whose brains are modeled on those of our whiskery rodent friends .
Yesterday 's rat is tomorrow 's robot !
Authorities say a 56 - year - old woman has died , a day after her 14 - year - old daughter allegedly struck her in the head with a hammer or other blunt object .
Rebecca “ Becky ” D’Aoust died Monday .
She worked as a counselor at a San Diego elementary school .
Her 14 - year - old daughter was arrested following Sunday morning ’s attack in the family ’s Scripps Ranch home about 15 miles north of downtown San Diego .
The girl is being held on suspicion of murder .
Officers called to the home found D’Aoust on the kitchen floor with a serious head injury .
Lt. Kevin Rooney said investigators still do n’t know a motive for the attack and have not released the name of the 14 - year - old because she is a minor .
Service employees union organizes thug attack at Detroit Labor Notes conference
By Jerry White
15 April 2008
Representatives of the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) on Saturday night physically attacked supporters of the California Nurses Association ( CNA ) and others attending a conference organized by the Labor Notes magazine in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn , Michigan .
The SEIU , which is involved in a bitter jurisdictional dispute with the CNA and its affiliates over union representation for nurses in California , Nevada , Ohio and other states , sent hundreds of International staff and other members to disrupt the conference , where Rose Ann DeMoro , executive director of the CNA , had been scheduled to speak .
According to a statement posted by Labor Notes , union members and others at the conference were punched , kicked , shoved and thrown to the floor by SEIU staff members and supporters who forced their way into the conference banquet hall .
A recently retired member of United Auto Workers Local 235 , Dianne Feeley , suffered a head wound after being knocked to the ground and was hospitalized .
Dearborn police responded and evicted at least three busloads of SEIU supporters .
No arrests were made .
The CNA said DeMoro cancelled her appearance at the event after the SEIU began sending “ roving bands of staff to the homes of CNA / National Nurses Organizing Committee board members in California Thursday and Friday , stalking and harassing them ” at their places of work and their homes .
In Dearborn on Saturday night , the CNA wrote in a statement , “ at least seven busloads , carrying up to 500 SEIU staff in purple jackets and T - shirts , drove up to the Hyatt Regency Hotel ...
Upon unloading from the buses , the hundreds of picket sign - wielding staff stormed the hotel and pushed their way through doors to break into the ballroom where the event was being held .
While breaking into the building , the SEIU staff , now joined by SEIU staff inside the building , physically assaulted a group of union members and activists at the door .
“ As the SEIU staff broke into the hall , some three dozen CNA / NNOC nurses and leaders , there to attend the conference , including Malinda Markowitz , RN , a member of CNA / NNOC ’s Council of Presidents , who was scheduled to speak in DeMoro ’s place , were whisked out the back of the hall for their safety , leaving in vans .
The atmosphere was so tense that hotel cooks tried to climb into the vans to join them for fear of their own safety . ”
The assault followed a day of disruption by SEIU staff at workshops , where various CNA / NNOC members were on panels or among the participants , according to Labor Notes .
The statement posted on the Labor Notes web site said , “ Despite being welcomed to the conference earlier in the day — and given space to debate supporters of the CNA and the National Nurses Organizing Committee about neutrality organizing agreements , SEIU international and regional staff shouted down speakers at workshops and panels throughout the event . ”
“ I am deeply concerned about this heightened attack on women and nurses , directed by SEIU President Andrew Stern , ” said DeMoro .
She added , “ There is an ugly pattern here of physical abuse and tactics of intimidation that have no place in either our labor movement or a civilized society . ”
Mark Brenner , director of Labor Notes , said such violence was unacceptable and called on the national leadership of the SEIU , including Stern , to repudiate the attack .
Although Labor Notes , which advocates the reform of the trade unions , had seen its conferences picketed by United Auto Workers ( UAW ) and Teamsters officials in the 1980s , the group said this was the first time in nearly 30 years that protesters physically attacked one of its events and those attending it .
Contacted by the World Socialist Web Site to respond to the allegations , a spokesperson for the SEIU pointed to a statement on the union ’s web site , denying any violence .
The statement said union members , “ led by hospital workers from Ohio , whose union elections were recently sabotaged by the California Nurses Association , ” had engaged in a “ peaceful protest . ”
It added , “ At no time did they engage in or witness the kind of activities described by the CNA . ”
The gangster methods of the SEIU should be denounced by all working people .
There is a long and sordid history of such violence against dissidents and , above all , socialist opponents of the labor bureaucracy .
This record includes the anti-communist purges organized by the Reuther leadership against socialist and left - wing militants in the UAW during the 1940s and 1950s , the attacks against rank - and - file miners by the Boyle leadership of the United Mine Workers in the 1960s and 1970s , and goon attacks by BLAST , the Brotherhood of Loyal Americans and Strong Teamsters , in the 1980s and 1990s .
The Socialist Equality Party and its predecessor , the Workers League , have been a particular target for such provocations because of our fight to organize a socialist opposition in the working class against the betrayals of the AFL - CIO union bureaucracy .
In 2005 , SEIU leader Andrew Stern split with the AFL - CIO and , along with the Teamsters , the textile and hotel union UNITE / HERE , and the food and commercial union UFCW , formed the Change to Win coalition .
Stern claimed the new federation would revitalize the unions with new organizing drives , greater union democracy and better representation .
In fact , there were no principled differences between the two competing factions of the labor bureaucracy .
The struggle chiefly involved a turf war , as various unions competed for dues income from a dwindling membership base .
The SEIU , in particular , has sought to increase its membership among janitors , nursing home workers and nurses by signing sweetheart deals in exchange for employer backing for its union drives .
Stern has appealed to employers , saying union organization will boost productivity by reducing employee turnover and stabilizing the low - paid workforce .
Earlier this year , SEIU Vice President Dennis Rivera intervened on behalf the governor of Puerto Rico to help bust an independent union representing 40,000 public school teachers , in order to force them to affiliate with the SEIU .
Shortly after a meeting between Rivera and Governor Acevedo Vila , where the SEIU leader allegedly pledged financial backing to his long - time friend in exchange for the governor ’s support for the SEIU - affiliated union , Vila decertified the independent union and suspended its dues check - off .
This provoked a bitter strike by teachers , to which the governor responded with riot police .
In California , the SEIU struck a secret deal with a group of nursing home chains , in which the companies agreed to drop their resistance to organizing drives in return for the SEIU ’s agreement to lobby state politicians to pass a tort - reform measure that would limit patients ’ ability to sue over neglect or abuse .
The decision to attack the Labor Notes conference follows a bitter turf war between the SEIU and the CNA - affiliated National Nurses Organizing Committee over organizing Catholic hospitals in Ohio .
The CNA said a deal between the SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners to hold a snap union recognition election — excluding the participation of other unions — set “ a dangerous precedent of employer - union collusion . ”
The CNA sent representatives to Ohio to urge nurses to vote down the SEIU .
The SEIU denounced this as “ union - busting ” and said it led to the cancellation of voting at nine hospitals last month .
While the CNA has accused the SEIU of “ company unionism , ” the SEIU has countered by saying the CNA had itself signed an election agreement with Tenet Healthcare four years ago in California which barred any strikes until 2010 in exchange for organizing jurisdiction over Tenet nurses .
The CNA says its deal permitted other unions to compete in the union representation elections , and protected nurses ’ rights to publicly criticize their employer over patient conditions , unlike the SEIU ’s partnership accords .
The violent attack by the SEIU underscores the degeneration of the trade unions and the fundamental hostility of the labor bureaucracy to the workers they purport to represent .
While workers should take no side in the sordid battle over dues income , they must unequivocally oppose the gangster methods of the SEIU and take it as a sharp warning of the type of violence the union bureaucracy will use to defend its privileges against the opposition of rank - and - file workers .
The human race was divided into two separate groups within Africa for as much as half of its existence , says a Tel Aviv University mathematician .
Climate change , reduction in populations and harsh conditions may have caused and maintained the separation .
Dr. Saharon Rosset , from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Tel Aviv University , worked with team leader Doron Behar from the Rambam Medical Center to analyze African DNA .
Their goal was to study obscure population patterns from hundreds of thousands of years ago .
Rosset , who crunched numbers and did the essential statistical analysis for the National Geographic Society 's Genographic Project , said the team was trying to understand the timing and dynamics of the split into at least two separate groups .
“ We wanted to look into the ancient history of our species .
How did we live throughout most of our existence as a species ?
Did we live as one — or were we fractured into small groups ?
Until now , it was n’t really clear , ” says Rosset .
A Picture of the Ancient Past
Researchers believe that about 60,000 years ago , modern humans started their epic journeys to populate the world .
This time period has been the primary focus of anthropological genetic research .
However , relatively little is known about the demographic history of our species over the previous 140,000 years in Africa .
The current study returns the focus to Africa and thereby refines the understanding of early modern Homo sapiens history .
Rosset , who is also affiliated with IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center in New York , says the study provides insight into the early demographic history of human populations before they moved out of Africa .
“ These early human populations were small and isolated from each other for many tens of thousands of years , ” says Rosset .
The team ’s research was based on a survey of African mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) and is the most extensive survey of its kind .
It included over 600 complete mtDNA genomes from indigenous populations across the continent .
How Old Was “ Mitochondrial Eve ” ?
MtDNA , inherited down the maternal line , was used in 1987 to discover the age of the famous “ Mitochondrial Eve , ” the most recent common female ancestor of everyone alive today .
This work has since been extended to show unequivocally that “ Mitochondrial Eve ” was an African woman who lived sometime during the past 200,000 years .
Recent data suggests that Eastern Africa went through a series of massive droughts between 90,000 and 135,000 years ago .
It is possible that this climate shift contributed to the population splits .
What is surprising is the length of time the populations were separate — for as much as half of our entire history as a species .
Dr. Spencer Wells , director of the Genographic Project and Explorer - in - Residence at the National Geographic Society , said , " This new study illustrates the extraordinary power of genetics to reveal insights into some of the key events in our species ' history .
Tiny bands of early humans , forced apart by harsh environmental conditions , coming back from the brink to reunite and populate the world .
Truly an epic drama , written in our DNA . "
Adds Rosset , “ Israelis and Jews are always curious about looking into their roots .
Just in this study , we were digging deeper than we normally do . ”

A murdered boy , described as a " gentle giant " by his parents , had tried to avoid a fight minutes before he was killed at a baker 's shop .
Police say Jimmy Mizen 's attacker had ordered him to fight outside the shop in Lee , south - east London , on Saturday , but the 16 year old refused .
The youth then smashed glass in the store and delivered a fatal blow to Jimmy 's throat , police said .
Jimmy 's mother said her son died while being cradled by his brother .
Locations of teenager killings in 2008
His parents told the BBC Jimmy , who had turned 16 the day before his death , was a " wonderful " boy .
Margaret and Barry Mizen said the night before Jimmy was attacked " the last thing we did was we all cuddled " .
A Mass was held in honour of Jimmy Mizen Jimmy was one of nine children and lived in Lee.
Det Ch Insp Cliff Lyons said the attack happened at the Three Cooks Bakery , in Burnt Ash Hill .
He said Jimmy had encountered his attacker after going into the shop with an older brother having bought his first lottery ticket .
Mr Lyons said : " The youth , intent on violence , offered him [ Jimmy ] outside for a fight .
" Jimmy , being the type of man he is , declined that fight , and the aggressor was left outside the bakery .
" Not content with matters ending there , the youth then proceeded to smash down the door of the bakery , shattering the glass .
" He also picked up an advertising board and took it inside the bakery and wielded it around .
A fight ensued and Jimmy received a fatal blow to his neck , cutting his throat with some glass .
They [ parents of son's killer ] have n't got wonderful memories for their son .
All they can think about is the evil he 's done .
My prayers are with the family , that 's all I can say
Margaret Mizen " Jimmy was a person of immaculate character , as was everyone from the Mizen family , and he is a victim of an entirely unprovoked and vicious attack . "
Mr Lyons said a number of premises had been searched in the hunt for the murderer but no - one had been arrested .
Detectives later said a " significant witness " had now come forward and would be interviewed .
They had wanted to trace a middle - aged white man who they said had witnessed a significant amount of the attack .
Altar boy Earlier on Sunday , family and friends observed an emotional two - minute silence outside Our Lady of Lourdes church , where Jimmy had been an altar boy .
They also laid flowers and read out messages of condolence near the spot where Jimmy was killed .
Mrs Mizen said she first heard about the attack from a neighbour .
She said : " She rang me and said : ' Jimmy 's been attacked - quick you need to get round there . '
" I did n't expect to see what I saw and I thank God that my other two sons were there and Jimmy died in one of them 's arms .
And that 's our comfort .
What amazing children .
" Jimmy was just the sweetest boy you could ever meet .
" Just a fine young man .
Happy all the time .
Whistled as he walked down the road .
" There was a simplicity in Jimmy .
He did not have airs and graces . "
She said she had no anger for his killer .
She said : " I feel for the parents of this boy .
In the last few days we have seen the deaths of Lyle Tulloch and Jimmy Mizen and I 'm sure their parents will be in our prayers
Boris Johnson
London mayor
Boy charged after stabbing death " I do n't know why , I can't get them out of my mind because what 's happened to Jimmy is the worst thing possible , but we 've got such wonderful memories .
" They have n't got wonderful memories for their son .
All they can think about is the evil he 's done .
My prayers are with the family , that 's all I can say .
I can't , I do n't feel anger . "
Jimmy had six brothers , Danny , 30 , Billy , 28 , Tommy , 26 , Bobby , 24 , Harry , 18 and George , eight , and two sisters , Joanne , 35 , and 21 - year - old Samantha .
Mr Mizen , 56 , said : " He loved his family , his family loved him .
Jimmy was able to express that love as well .
" You could give Jimmy a hug , no problem at all .
Jimmy would give me a kiss when I dropped him off at school .
You do n't see many teenagers do that . "
" An innate decency ran through Jimmy 's body .
He was a decent , fine young fella , protective of other people , protective of maybe the weak . "
Jimmy is the 13th teenager to have been fatally attacked in London since the start of the year .
On Sunday , London 's new mayor , Boris Johnson , joined thousands of Christians praying for an end to violence in the wake of Jimmy 's death and that of Lyle Tulloch , in Borough , south London , a week ago .
Speaking at the Global Day of Prayer , held at Millwall Football Club , Mr Johnson said : " In the last few days we have seen the deaths of Lyle Tulloch and Jimmy Mizen and I 'm sure their parents will be in our prayers . "
He also said : " There are too many parents across London today who have lost their young children or young teenagers in the last year to gun crime and knife crime ... together we can do something and together we must do something and together we will do something . "

How geolocation works
MAC address ( uniquely identifies the hardware )
Signal strength ( tells how far away it is )
The exact way that geolocation works depends on the device , and its way of connecting to the Internet .
If the device is a desktop computer , without any wireless connections , the IP address is used to determine the device ’s location , and the measurement is rather crude .
To determine the location of a laptop or other wireless device , Opera may additionally send the following data from nearby Wi-Fi access points : A database of known Wi-Fi access points , along with the measured signal strength , makes it possible to give rather precise location information .
The success of this method depends largely on the concentration of known access points .
If the device is connected to a mobile telephone network , location data may include the cell IDs for the cell towers closest to you , along with their signal strength .
If the device is GPS - enabled , the location may be obtained via GPS .
Any or all of the above methods may be used to determine the device ’s location , if the device has sufficient connectivity .
In what follows , we refer to this data as the location data .
" I feel like I 'm taking care of a herd of cows , " says Bill Huber as he gently nudges his pick - up truck along muddy , gouged - out tracks to check on his precious charges , scattered through the woods .
" Every day there 's something to be done .
A problem with a drill pipe , a bearing to replace , or something wrong with a pumping jack . "
Which is not surprising , given that some of the venerable contraptions in question first started to extract oil a century or more ago , and have now been pressed back into service , even though they yield just a few gallons a day .
" You get one well going again , it may give you 10 to 15 barrels a day straight off .
Then it tapers off .
But even if it keeps going at just a third of a barrel a day , it 's still pretty good . "
Americans may wince at the ever - rising cost of petrol , a daily reminder of the grinding economic crisis that grips the country .
But Bill Huber and the other " mom - and pop " producers in this part of the world are n't complaining , not when a 42 - gallon barrel now sells for $ 135 ( £ 68 ) or so , double what it fetched only a year ago , when every day seems to bring a new record price – and when the first commercially exploited oil field on the planet is enjoying a late - life renaissance .

These steep , wooded hills of north - western Pennsylvania are the cradle of the modern , trillion - dollar , global oil industry .
Here , on the edge of the stream called Oil Creek , a well drilled by Edwin Drake first coughed up the black stuff on 27 August 1859 .
A couple of years later , the world 's oldest continuously producing well – the McClintock No 1 , housed a couple of miles north of Oil City in what looks like an ancient garden shed – went on stream , and a few years after that , the world 's first commercial oil pipeline was laid .
Here too the first oil boom - and - bust cycle happened .
From the fledgling industry , fragmented and unorganised , John D Rockefeller ruthlessly forged the monopoly of Standard Oil and became the richest man of his era .
Then came a long , genteel decline of an ancient family fallen on hard times , long surpassed by brash upstarts in Texas , the Middle East and beyond .
The last refinery in the area was pulled down a few years ago .
But the past lives on , not only in the rickety wells hooked up by rusty brown pipes , snaking through the mud and dead leaves to storage tanks from which trucks pick up the crude for refining .
There are the town names like Oil City and Oleopolis , thoroughfares called Petroleum Street , opulent late 19th century houses built by the world 's first oil moguls , even in the title of Oil City 's daily paper – you 've guessed – The Derrick .
With his slow way of talking , and oil - splatched overalls – not to mention the kennels behind his modest house – Mr Huber , 67 , is no Rockefeller .
But he has his own small place in the venerable history of Pennsylvania 's oil patch .
His great - great grandfather , a cooper by trade , came to the area in the mid-19th century and made some of the barrels used by the early local oil industry .
Mr Huber 's grandfather got into the production business proper at the start of the 20th century , drilling more than 50 wells .
Now the third generation oilman has inherited the business , and even expanded it .
Over the years he has bought up scores of other wells , mostly during the barren years when Pennsylvania 's oil industry seemed doomed .
In the late 1980s , the oil price sank to $ 10 a barrel , before recovering , only to plummet again amid the financial crises in Asia and Russia a decade later .
" Many people round here said , ' we 're done and that 's it ' .
But me and three others stayed and bought up some of the wells , dirt cheap . "
Even so , Mr Huber often needed the income from his kennels to balance his books .
But now he has his petroleum herd , 230 low - volume " stripper " wells of which some 45 are in production , yielding " 70 or 80 barrels a month , maybe 100 in a good one " .
Northwest Pennsylvania is n't Kuwait .
But 100 barrels a month provides a decent income .
Not that Mr Huber is living it up .
He 's put a new roof on his house in the woods , a few miles north - east of Oil City , and bought a new ( or rather new - er ) pick - up truck .
Soon he may get round to doing up the kitchen .
But that 's it .
Elsewhere , however , the boom is unmistakeable .
The big energy companies are back in Pennsylvania , seeking oil and , more importantly , gas .
Already Pennsylvania has more stripper natural gas wells than any other state , and its proven gas reserves are half the US total .
In the woods new wells are being drilled .
Farmers who own the " OMG " ( oil , mineral and gas ) rights are leasing land to the companies for $ 2,500 an acre a year , compared with $ 25 a decade ago , and get production royalties on top of that .
In five years , production of the waxy , paraffin - rich crude from Pennsylvania 's Appalachian basin field has shot up 50 per cent to 3.8 million barrels .
But experts reckon that two - thirds of the oil that was there when Drake drilled his way into history is still in the ground .
Once it was n't worth bothering with , but no longer .
Rock Well Petroleum , a Canadian company , has plans not only to drill scores of new wells , but to dig huge underground caverns to collect the oil and pump it to the surface .

There 's just one problem , however : what to do with the brine that comes with the oil , especially from older wells .
McClintock
No 1 , for instance , now delivers 300 barrels of brine for every barrel of oil , says Barbara Zolli , the director of the state oil museum in nearby Titusville , at the site of Drake 's first well .
The museum is about to be given a massive facelift , to mark next year 's 150th anniversary of Drake 's find .
A replica has been built at that spot , but the hole in the ground is the original .
" This place has relevance for everyone 's life .
People come here from all over the world to see it , they want to know where the oil industry started , " Ms Zolli says .
" Even now , you look at that hole and you feel goose - bumps . "
And now this Indian summer for the industry .
" It 's never been as good as this , " says Mr Huber , who remembers the bad times when he had to call the buying companies to collect oil even when the tanks were n't full , to get money to pay his bills .
" Maybe the present sky - high prices wo n't last , but from what I can see , what with the Middle East troubles and China 's huge demand for oil , they 'll never go back down too far .
And they keep telling us there 's only so much oil left . "
He has had some offers , but is n't selling .
One reason is history , a sense of obligation to his forebears .
A fourth generation Huber , Bill Jr , is set to take over the family business , and such father - to - son traditions are hard to break .
And then , of course , there 's the money .
" You may have just 20 wells and get a third of a barrel a day from each of them , " Mr Huber notes .
" But as my dad used to say , ' It all mounts up . ' "
But you can't miss the caution in his voice .
Good times are not eternal .
Drake might have launched a giant industry , but spent his later years in ill - health and poverty .
And as this tiny corner of the petroleum universe proves , booms are invariably followed by busts .
The day the Drake well came in , world production doubled .
By 1861 , oil had hit $ 20 ( $ 600 in today 's dollars ) a barrel , before crashing to 10 cents , equivalent to $ 3 now .
And then there was the story of Pithole , an incredible tale even by the wild standards of the American frontier .
Oil first gushed along Pithole Creek in January 1865 .
By October the settlement was producing a then gigantic 6,000 barrels a day , delivered to barges by a new - fangled , five - mile - long pipeline .
From nothing grew a town of 15,000 people , with 54 hotels , oyster houses , and a theatre that put on Shakespeare , most notably a louche version of Macbeth .
But in three years Pithole was gone .
The forest of wells were pumping oil from the same deposit , which ran dry just as other fields in Pennsylvania came on stream .
In 1866 , the town 's land was valued at $ 2 m .
A dozen years later , the local authority bought the lot for $ 4.37 – a real estate collapse beside which today 's sub - prime mortgage crisis pales .
The biggest hotel in town , costing $ 40,000 ( $ 1.2 m today ) to build , was sold for firewood for $ 16 .
Today , not a stone , not a shard , remains ; only a grid of mown strips between the trees , denoting where Pithole 's streets had briefly stood .
In the modern history of big oil , Pennsylvania merits little more than a similar footnote .
But in its day it taught the world .
In the 1880s , engineers from Oil City went to Baku in the southern Russian empire to develop the industry there , in the process undercutting their own business .
And a Russian connection persists .
Out inspecting Mr Huber 's wells one recent morning , we ran into John Cubbon .
An oil engineer and scion of an established Pennsylvania oil and lumber company , he has crude ( or " maybe kerosene " ) in his blood .
He worked with Shell in Russia , married a Russian woman , and was now with BP on another Russian project .
Waiting for the Russian government to give him a visa , he had come home to take a look at the mini-boom .
Pitholes come and go .
But , Cubbon noted , " there 's never been an oil field that 's been totally abandoned " .
Superconductivity was first observed when Onnes used liquid helium to cool mercury .
It was soon found that quite a few metals would superconduct when cooled to within a few degrees of absolute zero .
However , the dream of superconductivity at higher temperatures — perhaps even room temperature — has kept researchers pursuing superconductivity .
Now , new research on a class of chemicals has yielded some interesting results that may point superconductor research in a different direction : hydrogen - based compounds .
Despite the attraction of low - loss superconductors , the cooling demands have limited the application of superconductivity to very high field magnets , such as those used in magnetic resonance imaging devices .
In the 1980s , a new form of superconductivity that operated at liquid nitrogen temperatures got everyone pretty excited .
Unfortunately , these ceramics are hard to make , harder to handle , and do n't carry much current , making them even less useful than their lower - temperature brethren .
What we need is a substance that has the more robust superconductivity and handling properties of metallic superconductors while retaining the high transition temperature of the ceramics .
In short , a different kind of metal .
The ultimate choice would be hydrogen , which , under sufficient pressure , is thought to become metallic .
Calculations suggest that the structure and properties of metallic hydrogen would support superconductivity at quite a high temperature .
On the other hand , this is just so much mental masturbation , because hydrogen is n't expected to become metallic until pressures of 400 GPa — a bit of a squeeze for current lab equipment .
Nevertheless , there are several hydrogen - like alternatives , where a compound with lots of hydrogen in it is put under sufficient pressure to become a metal .
This works because the presence of the heavier atomic cores act to compress the electrons surrounding the hydrogen nucleus , meaning that it is , in effect , already under a significant amount of pressure .
This brings down the metallic transition pressure , putting it within the reach of lab equipment .
This is exactly why researchers at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry have been putting the squeeze on silane .
Silane is a silicon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms , making it one of two perfect candidates for hydrogen - based metals ( the other is methane ) .
They found that silane became metallic at around 50 GPa , which is still a pretty substantial pressure .
On cooling , the metallic silane begins to superconduct .
However , the temperature at which superconductivity occurs exhibits some interesting behavior .
It hangs around 5 - 10 K for most of the pressure range ( 50 - 200 GPa ) , but in a small range between 100 - 125GPa , it increases quite sharply .
Although the researchers only have five data points in the range and never observed a critical temperature higher than 20 K , the shape of the curve indicates that , for some small range of pressures , a very high critical temperature might be achieved .
A note of caution should be injected at this point : DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME .
Silane is a gas at room temperature and pressure .
It is a gas that you will not find naturally occurring because it spontaneously combusts in air .
In fact , one can imagine that wires and magnets based on a silane superconductor would also make wonderful pipe bombs — not something that you want in the same room as a million - dollar MRI machine .
On a slightly more serious note , the higher the required critical temperature , the narrower the pressure range for which superconductivity can be achieved , meaning that very high quality pressure control would be required to maintain silane in a useful state .
All in all , it is hard to tell if this a win for superconductivity .
It is , however , certainly a win for materials research .

Rochester 's Omega Laser , One of the World 's Most Powerful , Receives 50 - Fold Power Increase to Become ' Petawatt ' Laser
Enhancement to Fusion Laser Announced Today at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics
The University of Rochester will mark another important step in the effort toward attaining sustainable fusion , the ultimate source of clean energy , Friday , May 16 .
University President Joel Seligman , along with special guests , who include U.S. Senator Charles Schumer , U.S. Representative Thomas Reynolds , and Undersecretary and National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Thomas D'Agostino , will dedicate the new Omega EP ( Extended Performance ) laser facility at the Robert L. Sproull Center for Ultra High Intensity Laser Research at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics ( LLE ) .
The Omega EP comprises a new set of four ultra - high - intensity laser beams that will unleash more than a petawatt �a million billion watts �of power onto a target just a millimeter across .
Working in conjunction with LLE 's original 60 - beam Omega laser , the Omega EP will open the door to a new concept called " fast ignition , " which may be able to dramatically increase the energy derived from fusion experiments and provide a possible new avenue toward clean fusion power .
If successful , fast ignition could lead to the highest energy densities ever achieved in a laboratory .
" I look forward to the profound scientific contributions the Omega EP extension will bring to the University and to the world , " says Seligman .
" It is a vital component of our nation 's scientific capital and leadership , a key to strategic work on an independent energy future , and a vital part of the local economy , including $ 44 million in local expenditures just last year . "
" Over the years , the University of Rochester 's Laboratory for Laser Energetics has consistently brought Upstate New York 's high - tech sector to the forefront of energy innovation , " says Schumer .
" It is a vital national resource as well as an economic boon to Rochester and to the entire Finger Lakes region .
I was proud to secure over $ 61 million to support their efforts last year and will continue to look for ways in which the federal government can further collaborate with this dynamic laboratory in the future . "
" Employing more than 500 Western New Yorkers , the Laboratory for Laser Energetics of the University of Rochester is essential to the growth of our community and ensures Rochester is on the cutting edge of technology , " says Reynolds .
" The new Omega EP laser is truly remarkable and serves as a clear demonstration of how our region remains a leader in world - class innovation .
The Omega EP 's success is a testament to the scientists , engineers , technicians , and students who made the project possible . "
The original Omega laser fires multi-trillion watt bursts of energy �more powerful than the entire electrical generating capacity of the United States �making it among the three most powerful lasers in the world .
Yet Omega will become approximately 50 times more powerful still with the inclusion of Omega EP .
Such incredible intensities are necessary because creating electricity from fusion means heating the target fuel to a high temperature and confining it long enough so that more energy is released than is supplied to sustain the reaction .
To release energy at a level required for electricity production , the fusion fuel must be heated to about 100 million degrees , more than six times hotter than the interior of the Sun .
Fusion , nuclear fission and solar energy , which includes biofuels , are widely seen as the only energy sources capable of satisfying the growing need for power for the next century without the harmful environmental impacts of fossil fuels .
In a fusion power plant , one gallon of seawater would provide the equivalent energy of 300 gallons of gasoline ; fuel from 50 cups of water contains the energy equivalent of two tons of coal .
A fusion power plant would produce no climate - changing gases , as well as considerably less environmentally harmful radioactive byproducts than nuclear power plants currently do .
And there would be no danger of a runaway reaction or core meltdown in a fusion power plant .
Beyond clean energy production , Omega and Omega EP will facilitate research impossible to attempt almost anywhere else on Earth .
The way matter behaves in stars can be replicated on a small scale inside Omega 's target chamber .
Laser and materials technologies , electro - optics , and plasma physics will also be able to be studied under conditions never before possible .
About the Laboratory for Laser Energetics
The LLE was first established in 1970 " to investigate the interaction of intense radiation with matter . "
The initial University investment of approximately $ 10.4 million in 1975 has allowed the Laboratory to attract cumulative external funding , primarily from the federal government , of more than $ 1.3 billion , including a five - year $ 352 million commitment last year from the Department of Energy .
This support is thanks to the strong support the Laboratory receives from both the Administration and the U.S. Congress .
The funding also includes an important investment by New York State in the upstate economy by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority .
These figures do not include the contributions made by high - tech companies founded in the Rochester area whose technology or founders came from the Laboratory .
The Omega EP 's extended capabilities also will contribute substantially to the critical need to recruit and retain graduate students , postdoctoral associates , University faculty members , and National laboratory scientists �especially while the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which is designed to achieve controlled thermonuclear ignition and gain , nears completion .
The Laboratory is one of the four institutional participants in NIF .
Laboratory Director Robert L. McCrory also proudly points to the more than 190 Ph.D. recipients trained at the Laboratory , many of whom have gone on to work in national laboratories and private industry .
The Laboratory currently supports 65 graduate students conducting their doctoral research .
Research scientists from throughout the world , U.S. national laboratories , universities , and industry travel to Rochester to use the Omega laser facilities .
LLE has provided qualified researchers with a unique environment for experiments in inertial fusion and high - energy - density physics .
Because the Laboratory is located on a University campus rather than being a national laboratory , undergraduates and even area high school students are able to benefit from the Laboratory 's resources .
Approximately 45 undergraduates work each year at the Laboratory .
During the summer , approximately 15 high school students participate in a summer research program that has propelled many of them to highly placed finishes at national science competitions , including the Intel Science Talent Search , and to successful careers in science .
This weekend , Cyclone Nargis pounded the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar ( aka Burma ) , killing an estimated 60,000 people thus far .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) , a visual - infrared instrument on NASA 's Terra satellite , documented the extent of the flooding in a pair of images .
The earlier photo shows Myanmar on April 15 ; crisp boundaries separate the dark blue rivers from the green - and tan - colored landmasses .
In the later image , the cyclone has come ashore at the mouths of the Irrawaddy River [ lower left ] and swept northeast , flooding the whole southern region and dumping turquoise - tinted runoff into the Gulf of Martaban .
NASA says that images like these will aid recovery efforts by showing emergency responders where to focus .

Experts believe this image of a leaf is the world 's first photograph
It might be a little out of focus , and need a bit of work on the composition .
But this image of a leaf has been hailed as ' priceless ' by experts who believe it could be the world 's first photograph .
The red picture had previously been attributed to Henry Fox Talbot , who is credited with taking the world 's first photographs in the 1830s .
But some believe this image may have been created in the last years of the 18th century - more than 30 years earlier .
The image - created by laying a leaf on light - sensitive paper and exposing it to the sun - has now been withdrawn from sale by a leading auction house while further investigations are carried out .
Denise Bethell of Sotheby 's said : " The possibility of a definitive conclusion regarding this early photogenic drawing is very exciting .
" We were expecting £ 50 - £ 70,000 for it .
If it could be authenticated as the world 's oldest photograph , the sky could be the limit . "
Fox Talbot ( 1800 - 1877 ) was famed as the first photographer as he was thought to have created the negative - a means of duplicating an image many times over .
The leaf image was last sold as a Talbot original by Sotheby 's in 1984 and snapped up by a New York art dealer .
It was due to be sold again on April 7th in New York , but auctioneers asked art historian Dr Larry Schaaf to inspect it ahead of the sale , and were shocked at his suggestion that it was n't created by Talbot .

Dr Schaaf believes a letter ' W ' on the image may stand for Thomas Wedgwood ( 1771 - 1805 ) , a member of the china - making family .
Wedgwood was known to have experimented with photography in the 1790s , while living in Bristol , but none of his work was thought to have survived .
Dr Schaaf told Sotheby's : " Well , the first thing I would say is that this was not made by Talbot .
" That was not what they were expecting to hear , to say the least , " he added .
The question mark over the picture created great excitement in the art world , and Sotheby 's has called off the sale so the photo can be authenticated .
Early photos like the leaf were produced on paper treated with silver nitrate to make it light - sensitive and left in the sun before being developed in a dark room .
As the exposed areas of paper darkened , a pale silhouette was left of the object .
Semi-opaque objects like leaves produced great detail , as every tiny vein can be seen .
But too long in the sun darkened the images .
This was a problem Wedgwood and the photo pioneers could not fix , and many early examples were destroyed .
The first - ever photograph was thought to be that of a window at Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire produced by Fox Talbot in 1835 .
Although surviving letters show Wedgwood advised others on photography as early as the 1790s , none of his experiments have ever been located .
Sotheby 's was auctioning the leaf picture as part of Quillan collection , a collection of exhibits from the earliest days of photography to the present .
It was already expected to fetch more than some of the best - known snaps in the collection , such as Richard Avedon 's 1957 portrait of Marilyn Monroe ( £ 35 to £ 50,000 ) .
Until 1984 , the leaf was in an album belonging to descendants of Henry Bright ( 1784 -1869 ) , a Bristol MP , arts patron , and friend of Wedgwood .
Five other photogenic drawings from the album were sold in 1984 , of which four also bear a ' W ' .
Two are now privately - owned , one is in the J Paul Getty Museum and one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Both museums will be doing further tests .
Tests can be done to determine the age of the paper and to identify the chemical make - up of any substances used on it .
Dr Schaaf added : " This image of a leaf is extraordinary .
It arrests our attention as much today as it had done for at least for a century and a half , and just possibly for more than two centuries .
" Someone could obviously come along and say that these images are all in fact Talbots , but they would be wrong . "
Shameless domain registrar and web hoster Network Solutions is hijacking its customers ' sub -domains , filling these pilfered pages with a sea of money - making ad links .
And you can guess where the money goes .
Earlier this week , a man named Win Betteridge told TechCrunch that Network Solutions pulled this clever little trick with his " social gaming " site , GotGame.com .
Betteridge hosts GotGame with " NetSol , " and somewhere along the way , he realized that his unused GotGame sub - domains resolved to ad - infested " parking " pages .
" For instance , app.gotgame.com resolves to a Network Solutions page with text links , including ' Poker Tournaments ' and ' Texas Holdem Games , ' " he said .
As pointed out by ArsTechnica , the Virginia - based Network Solutions reserves the right to do this with every site it hosts .
The company 's terms of service include this :
You also agree that any domain name directory , sub - directory , file name or path ( e.g. ) that does not resolve to an active web page on your Web site being hosted by Network Solutions , may be used by Network Solutions to place a " parking " page , " under construction " page , or other temporary page that may include promotions and advertisements for , and links to , Network Solutions '
Web site , Network Solutions product and service offerings , third - party Web sites , third - party product and service offerings , and / or Internet search engines .
You agree that Network Solutions may change the content and / or appearance of , or disable any of these temporary pages at any time , in its sole discretion , and without prior notice .
Yes , you can opt out this questionable program .
But first you have to know about it .
The EULA housing the above paragraph is 59,000 words long .
Network Solutions can argue that other hosters have pulled a similar trick .
But that does n't make it right .
Of course , this is n't nearly as bad the company 's domain front running scam .
Which it continues to call a " security measure . " ®
Ain't is n't a Four - Letter Word
Dr. Goodword ( Robert Beard , PhD , Linguistics )
Teachers , please tighten your seatbelts ; this article is going to be a disturbing read .
You will just have to forgive the old Doctor .
Remember , he is a professional linguist who sees language as a physician sees the human body , as an incredibly sophisticated palimpsest of systems - sound , meaning , grammatical categories , vocabulary , each with its own rules , each with its own relationship to all the other systems .
When Dr. Goodword sees English bleeding from any injury , he , no matter how frightening the wound , must try to treat it .
Let us begin by observing the symptoms .
Would you ever say , " I are n't supposed to do that ? "
Not if you like company during coffee break .
Yet , you probably do use the grammatical equivalent of this sentence : " I 'm supposed to do that , are n't I ? "
Only in a nightmare would you ever hear yourself say , " I are n't invited to the party ! "
However , " Are n't I invited to the party ? " sounds OK even on a job interview .
Hellooooo !
What is going on here ?
Let us begin by examining how we express the same idea with pronouns other than " I . "
If the pronoun were " you , " we would say , " You 're supposed to do that , are n't you ? "
This phrase corresponds to " you are " and " you are n't " .
If " she " were the pronoun , we would say , " She is supposed to do that , is n't she ? "
Now , this sentence corresponds to " she is " and " she is n't " .
In other words , in tag questions like these , we use the negative contraction of the verb " to be " :
Uncontracted Positive Verb Contraction I am I . . . ?
you are you are n't s/he is s/he is n't we are we are n't you are you are n't they are they are n't
Notice that we have an imperfect paradigm : the negative contraction for " am not " seems to be missing .
All the pronoun forms correlate to a positive form and a negative ( contracted ) form of the verb " to be " - all except one ; there is no contractable form for " am not " .
Why not ?
The contraction of are + not is " are n't " .
The contraction of is + not is " is n't " .
Why is n't the contraction of am + not " am n't ? "
In fact , in a wide swath of English dialects , it is .
This word is common in Scotland and Ireland : " I am n't sure what he said " and " I am going , am n't I " are common in those variants of English .
English does n't like two nasal consonants like " m " and " n " together , however , and in most dialects they merged into " an't " , the spelling of which eventually evolved into " ain't " .
" Ain't " then acquired the reputation of a " four - letter " word it has had to endure over the course of the last century .
( Hmm . Actually , it has something in common with four - letter words , does n't it ? )
These rather pertinent facts of the English language were overlooked by the prescriptive grammarians who have all these years attempted to totally obliterate ( " amn't " and ) " ain't " from the English vocabulary .
" Never , never , never under any circumstances say ' ai n't ' " has been drummed in our heads since kindergarten .
Sorry , teachers and diligent mommies , but this very simple rule is linguistically wrong .
The rule that should have been drilled into the heads of English - speakers all these years is this :
Only use " ain't " with " I "
It is true that we should not say , " you ain't " , " they ai n't " , or " she ain't " but we should say , without a scintilla of shame , " ai n't I ? " rather than " are n't I " .
" Are n't I " is just as ungrammatical as " I are n't " where " ungrammatical " means that it violates the rules , the speaking conventions , of the English language .
Now , do n't go in and try to impress your teacher or your boss with this nugget of knowledge first thing tomorrow morning .
We all have to coordinate the restitution of " ain't " to its rightful position in the language .
That is n't likely to happen by daybreak but it is time to start thinking about it .
Too bad President Clinton did n't pardon " ai n 't " ; it is a much more deserving four - letter word than " Rich " .
At least it is nice to know why this word refuses to go away despite the all - out assault it has suffered over the past century .
The Texas Democratic Party charged that Sen. Hillary Clinton 's campaign " threatened " to challenge aspects of the state 's two - step nominating process , just days before Tuesday balloting , which now appears unlikely to produce the blowout victory the New York senator needs to stay in the race .
Among other things , party activists said the Clinton campaign was trying to delay the release of the results from that evening 's caucuses , where Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama is thought to have an advantage .
A delay in reporting those results ...
“ His goal is to win as many delegates as he can and have it turn into a squeaker , ” said Tony Podesta , a Democratic operative who has run several statewide campaigns in Pennsylvania and is supporting Mrs. Clinton .
“ He ’s been successful in other states , like Wisconsin , in taking an electorate that was favorable to her and through the investment of huge numbers of dollars on TV and lots of personal campaigning , has managed to turn that around . ”
The Obama campaign has been laying the groundwork to do just that .
It started with a concerted voter registration drive that ended on Monday .
Analysts said many newly registered Democrats were probably Obama voters , partly because the typical Clinton voter  older and more established  was already registered .
The Obama camp has moved to what it calls the persuasion phase of its campaign .
It has already spent more than $ 2 million on television and radio ; Mrs. Clinton , who has less money but is better known , has spent perhaps a third of his total .
One of Mr. Obama ’s commercials is biographical , with good reason .
Campaign officials say he still needs to introduce himself , while Mrs. Clinton has family roots in the state and has visited often since her husband ’s first campaign here in 1992 .
Former President Bill Clinton and their daughter , Chelsea , have made several stops in Pennsylvania over the last two weeks .
Mr. Obama also faces demographic disadvantages .
While he draws young people and those with college degrees , Pennsylvania has one of the highest concentrations of people over 65 ( 15 percent , compared with a national average of 12 percent ) and one of the lowest of people with college degrees ( 22 percent , compared with a national average of 24 percent ) .
Few doubt that Mr. Obama will carry Philadelphia , where more than 40 percent of Democrats are African - American .
It is also home to upper - income white liberals and students , two other groups that have supported him .
At the same time , the city ’s mayor , Michael Nutter , is working on behalf of Mrs. Clinton , as is the state ’s popular governor and former Philadelphia mayor , Edward G. Rendell .
Much of the city ’s white working class also supports her .
If past elections are a guide , Mr. Obama ’s success will lie in how much he can increase the turnout in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburban counties , with their pockets of affluent , educated white liberals .
The suburbs are expected to be a major battleground .
Tokyo police believe that Yuki Shiina sent 2.2 billion spam email messages .
Tokyo police believe that Yuki Shiina sent 2.2 billion spam email messages .
Experts at SophosLabs™ , Sophos 's global network of virus , spyware and spam analysis centers , have warned companies to abide by anti-spam laws following the arrest of a man suspected of sending over 2 billion unwanted commercial emails .
According to media reports , police in Tokyo , Japan , have arrested 25 - year - old Yuki Shiina following a complaint last year by an ISP that he was sending huge amount of spam emails advertising gambling and dating websites .
Police believe that Shiina bought 600,000 email addresses off the internet for 100,000 yen ( US $ 927 ) and earned over 2 million yen ( US $ 18,540 ) through the spam campaign .
It is claimed that Shiina faked the sender information on the emails in an attempt to avoid detection , breaking Japanese laws .
" Spammers believe they can escape the long arm of the law by hiding on the internet , but increasingly the authorities are cracking down on this kind of net abuse .
No -one who hears about a single person believed to have sent 2.2 billion spam emails can be in any doubt as to the scale of the problem , and it 's essential for a clear message to be sent out that the police are serious about catching the criminals responsible , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for Sophos .
" Legitimate businesses need to make sure that they are abiding by the law , and be careful not to hire firms and third - party individuals to market their websites or goods via junk email . "
Last month , in a separate case , Sophos reported on the first arrest in Japan of a malware author .
Kyoto police uncovered a plot to infect users of the P2P file - sharing network Winny with a Trojan horse that displayed images of popular anime characters while wiping music and movie files .
Sophos recommends companies protect themselves with a consolidated solution which can defend businesses from the threats of spam , spyware , hackers and viruses .
FLOURTOWN , Pa. 
The primary race between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama could be decided in places like this bedroom community in southeastern Pennsylvania , where polls show the two Democratic presidential candidates running tight .
So it was with obvious gravity that 74 fourth graders at Erdenheim Elementary School assembled this week behind the glass and tan brick walls of their classrooms to debate the campaign ’s central issues .
The children , most 9 or 10 , then signaled their preferences for the Democratic nomination in a gradewide straw poll .
“ It ’s a battle between man and the environment , and the environment ’s losing right now , ” Michael Kassabian announced to his fellow voters in Renea Boles ’s room , before explaining that he was endorsing Mr. Obama at least partly because of the candidate ’s enthusiasm for renewable energy sources .
Henry Centeno said that the candidates ’ stances on health care should take precedence , and that his support depended on which candidate would guarantee health insurance for anyone age 25 or younger .
Why 25 ?
“ If it ’s 25 , ” he said , “ Miss Boles would still have free health care . ”
( His teacher , he knew , is 24 . )
Your contact lenses of the future could be completely biodegradable .
A soft contact lens is a hydrogel - a solid , gelatinous mass consisting of water incorporated in a polymer network .
Now Berkeley researchers have developed a technique for the formation of hybrid materials from synthetic polymers and proteins , fusing the biological functions of proteins with the processing properties of plastics .
Aaron P. Esser - Kahn and Matthew B. Francis say they have successfully synthesized a green - fluorescing biodegradable gel that responds to changes in pH value and temperature .
These polymer - protein hybrid materials can also be used in sensors , nanomachine parts , or drug - delivery systems .
Previous processes for the production of hybrid materials depended on very specific coupling techniques that could not be used for some protein side - chains .
In contrast , the new method developed by the Berkeley researchers is broadly applicable because in principle it is suitable for any protein .
The coupling occurs at both ends of the protein chain — and these are the same for all proteins : one amino acid group and one carboxylic acid group .
Initially , two parallel but mutually independent ( orthogonal ) reactions are used to activate the two ends of the chain .
These are then attached to special chemical “ anchor points ” on the polymer .
The proteins thus cross -link the individual polymer chains into a three - dimensional network , forming what is known as a hydrogel .
Francis and Esser - Kahn chose to use a protein that fluoresces green to cross - link their polymer chains .
Because the protein maintains its normal folding pattern even after attachment to the polymer , the fluorescence is also maintained :
The entire gel fluoresces green .
This hybrid material has a special trait : the cross-linking of the polymer chains is achieved exclusively by means of the proteins .
Because proteins can be attacked by proteases , enzymes that disintegrate proteins , these gels are biodegradable .
The green fluorescence of the protein is pH-dependent .
The gel correspondingly also reacts to changes in pH .
It only fluoresces in the basic range ; in a lightly acidic medium , the gel no longer fluoresces .
Raising the temperature also elicits a response from the gel .
The protein denatures at about 70 °C , which quenches the fluorescence and causes the gel to shrink .

MAY 29 -- Meet Cocaine Jesus .
Federal agents last week arrested a Mexican national for allegedly paying a woman to smuggle into the U.S. a statue that was made of a dried cocaine paste .
The carefully painted religious icon , pictured here , weighed about six pounds and would have had a street value of about $ 30,000 .
The statue was confiscated at a Texas border crossing after a drug - sniffing dog alerted to it during an inspection of a vehicle driven by a Mexican woman .
The woman later told agents that she was paid $ 80 by a man who wanted the statue delivered to him at a Laredo bus station .
The man , Bernardino Garcia - Cordova , was arrested when the apparently unwitting female mule identified him for investigators , according to a felony cocaine distribution complaint filed May 27 in U.S. District Court in Laredo .
When questioned by agents , the 61 - year - old Garcia - Cordova , who is a legal permanent U.S. resident , initially acknowledged that Cocaine Jesus was his , but then claimed he was only helping to smuggle the statue on the behalf of a man known only by the nickname ' La Arana , ' or The Spider .
Cocaine Jesus , he claimed , was supposed to be delivered to The Spider in Dallas .

When you try to remove adhesive paper from a surface , you inevitably get a pointy flap , while what you want is to remove the entire piece .
A team from the Laboratoire de physique et mécanique des milieux hétérogènes ( CNRS / ESPCI / Universités Paris 6 and 7 ) , collaborating with the University of Santiago in Chile and with MIT , has explained the physics behind this frustrating experience .
The work is published in Nature Materials , and could be used in testing the mechanical properties of very fine adhesive film used in industry .
We ’ve all been faced with the famous pointy flap tear : the piece being detached gets thinner and thinner as it is being pulled off , and ends up as a pointy flap instead of coming off as a whole piece of tape , wallpaper , film , fruit peel ...
What causes the pointy shape ?
Why do the two edges seem to attract each other ?
What determines the shape of the flaps ?
With his Chilean and American colleagues , Benoît Roman , from the Laboratoire de physique et mécanique des milieux hétérogènes ( CNRS / ESPCI / Universités Paris 6 and 7 ) , has studied the problem from a theoretical and experimental point of view .
The researchers have set up a system for controlled tear experiments : an adhesive film is glued to a surface , two slits are cut , and the system then provides a steady pull on the tab .
The researchers then record the shapes of the flaps and the mechanical forces involved , for films with different adhesive and mechanical properties .
When the tab is pulled , after the two slits are cut , the flap stores elastic energy ( if let go , it will unfold ) .
The system tends to dissipate this energy by minimizing the size of the fold .
The slits are naturally drawn to the areas of the system which are the most sollicited , namely those containing the greatest amount of elastic energy .
In this case , that would be the folded part of the tab .
They are irrepressibly drawn to each other , gradually reducing the size of the tab .
By analyzing these observations , the physicists have shown that the shape of the flaps is a triangle , with an angle depending on three characteristics of the adhesive material : its adhesion , its flexibility , and its resistance to tearing .
The researchers have put together a formula which allows the characterization of one of these properties based on the other two and on a simple measurement of the angle of the triangle .
Materials engineers could use these results in industry to calculate one of the three properties when the other two are known .
This could be particularly useful for the characterization of ultra - thin films , which are difficult to manipulate and which are basic elements in micro- or nano - systems .
These are already present in our daily life ( such as shock detectors for the release of airbags , micromirrors used in second generation video projectors ) , and they will certainly have an important role to play in our future .
On Monday , 17th December 2007 , Europe narrowly avoided disaster .
A cold snap had lowered the temperature across much of continent to several degrees below average and that evening , as households across the continent switched on their heating systems , the power consumption hit critical levels .
France , Italy and Spain all set new records for power consumption .
By sheer luck , Switzerland and Germany , which were less cold , were able to provide some 1.6 GWe of spare capacity to cover the cracks in the system .
As it turned out , the rest of the winter was abnormally mild .
But had the cold snap been more widespread , the European electricity supply could have collapsed .
The problem dates from about 30 years ago when Europe ’s grid system and generating capacity was built with a huge amount of spare capacity .
Since then , as economies have boomed , politicians have had little incentive to upgrade the system .
In the meantime , consumption has been increasing at the rate of 1 - 2 per cent per year and today the spare capacity has all but gone .
With the simplest extrapolation being that demand will continue to grow at the same rate , a crisis looms .
Now the Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity , an association of power providers in Europe has issued a report detailing the system ’s shortcomings .
And analysis on the arXiv by Michael Dittmar at the Swiss Federal Institue of Technology in Zurich paints an even gloomier picture , not least because there is no clear short term path to reducing consumption or increasing generating capacity .
Europe has suffered a number of large blackouts in recent years , notably in Italy between 28 - 29th September 2003 and in France and Germany on 4 November 2006 .
But worse looks to be on the cards .
Dittmar ’s message is that the next winter of 2008/9 will test the European grid to its limits .

Android touchscreen prototype : Live pictures & video demo !
We ’re still waiting for the full details from Vincent at the Google IO Keynote , but we wanted to share these first live photos and video of the latest touchscreen Android prototype .
Things have certainly moved on since the last version of the OS we saw : back then Google basically asked us to look past the slightly clunky GUI and concentrate on the potential .
This time round , there ’s no squinting necessary !
Graphics , animations , functionality , all is slick and up to speed .
Check out the Android demo videos after the cut !
In the above demo video , you can see the Android prototype ’s built - in compass and accelerometer used to pan through a panoramic photo .
The developer team were showing this on a real , working prototype , projected up onto the big screen , remember .
The Google Maps demo , in the video above , is particularly impressive .
It really shows off the handset ’s graphics capabilities , and as you can hear in the voiceover the 3D processing should bode well for other visually - intensive apps [ we do n’t yet know what 3D processing the handset has ]
Below , you can see an entry in the Android Developers Challenge ; a version of Pacman coded for the platform :
There are dozens of photos of the touchscreen Android prototype over at Android Community .
If you ’ve the slightest interest in seeing what Apple will be going up against with iPhone v.2 , you need to check them out .
We ’ll be bringing you plenty more from the IO event , so keep reading SlashGear and Android Community !
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) 
An internal JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) memo titled " Zippy Cheats & Tricks " offers a peek into just the sort of dubious lending tactics that underpinned the housing market 's deepening downward spiral .
Originally obtained by reporters at The Oregonian newspaper , which published a story Thursday , the memo offers step - by - step instructions on how to beef up mortgage applicants ' stated incomes in order to help them qualify for home loans .
OREGONIAN STORY : Chase mortgage memo pushes ' Cheats & Tricks '
They read as follows : " 1 . Make sure you input all income in base income .
DO NOT break it down by overtime , commissions or bonus .
2 . If your borrower is getting a gift , add it to a bank account along with the rest of the assets .
Be sure to remove any mention of gift funds .
3 . If you do not get ( the desired results ) , try resubmitting with slightly higher income .
Inch it up $ 500 to see if you can get the findings you want .
Do the same for assets . "
JPMorgan says that these were the wayward actions of a rogue employee who has since been fired , and by no means represent company policy .
" Clearly it 's nothing that we condone , " said Tom Kelly , a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase .
" As soon as we learned about it , we stopped it . "
Still , in the context of a broader housing debacle , the memo does provide some clues into just what lengths bankers went to push loans through the system .
Over the past six months , rising defaults on home loans have not only battered the mortgage sector , threatening recession , but also sent the banking industry into a tailspin .
Many large banks repackaged mortgages and held them on their balance sheets as complex derivatives securities , essentially bonds backed by other types of loans .
These developments have many politicians in Washington , including Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , calling for greater regulatory oversight .
The conclusion of the JPMorgan memo , written in bright purple letters , certainly hints at a credit system gone awry : " It 's super easy !
Give it a try ! " it reads .
" If you get stuck , call me ... I am happy to help ! " Copyright 2008 Reuters Limited .

Solar shingles ( or solar tiles ) are an incredible breakthrough in the solar power market .
They look like regular roof shingles , but they contain thin film photovoltaic cells - solar cells ( PV ) , which harness solar energy .
Solar shingles are very attractive and powerful .
Solar power could meet today 's total US electricity demand by use of solar power shingles , solar panels and other PV products .
Global warming and climate changes are our reality , now .
Renewable energy sources are the only answer .
The morgue is an hour outside Dujiangyan on an isolated rural road , yet the parking lot was filled at 1:50 a.m. on Thursday .
Parents and other family members clustered around the bodies of their children .
Some burned fake money to bring their lost child good fortune in the afterlife .
In one room , 25 small bodies were scattered on the floor .
Some children had already been taken away ; an empty white body bag lay near a sneaker and a filthy pair of boy ’s trousers .
Some families had placed flowers or incense inside empty water bottles as makeshift memorials .
“ There are more in there , ” said a man , pointing to a rear door .
He walked outside to a walkway and paused .
Scores of bodies , covered with sheets , were lined in two long rows on the concrete floor .
Others were placed in an adjacent room .
Parents sobbed or sat silently beside bodies .
“ They are all students , ” said the man in the blue shirt .
“ Look , ” he said pointing to a red and white jacket folded beside one body .
“ That is the school uniform . ”
He pointed to a Mickey Mouse backpack .
“ There is a book bag . ”
The two rows of bodies came to an open door that led to the large steel furnaces used for cremation .
In China , the dead are almost always cremated fairly soon after death .
Usually , there is enough time for funeral ceremonies and rituals , but parents said that officials were worried about cremating so many bodies before they started to decompose .
So some parents have been asked if their children can be cremated with dead friends to save time .
Parents say they were only allowed to begin identifying their children on Wednesday .
The bodies had remained inside the gated grounds of Xinjian Primary School for two days until officials began transporting them to the morgue on Wednesday .
The earthquake struck at 2:28 p.m. on Monday , and many parents rushed to the school .
Xinjian had about 600 pupils , ages from roughly 7 to 12 .
When parents arrived most of the building had collapsed .
They frantically pulled away bricks and chunks of concrete with their bare hands .

Brave New Films
You may have heard of Rev. John Hagee , the McCain supporter who said God created Hurricane Katrina to punish New Orleans for its homosexual “ sins . ”
Well now meet Rev. Rod Parsley , the televangelist megachurch pastor from Ohio who hates Islam .
According to David Corn of Mother Jones , Parsley has called on Christians to wage war against Islam , which he considers to be a “ false religion . ”
In the past , Parsley has also railed against the separation of church and state , homosexuals , and abortion rights , comparing Planned Parenthood to Nazis .
John McCain actively sought and received Parsley ’s endorsement in the presidential race .
McCain has called Parsley “ a spiritual guide , ” and he has n’t said whether he shares Parsley ’s vicious anti-Islam views .
That ’s because the mainstream media refuses to ask .

Some researchers think that the evolution of languages can be understood by treating them like genomes - but many linguists do n't want to hear about it .
Emma Marris reports .
A. MARTIN
Consider a word as it tumbles through history : khun , a Nepali word for blood .
In the early twentieth century , the word fell all too often from the lips of the Gurkhas , a Nepalese brigade in the British Army , in songs describing the horror of the First World War .
To linguist Ralph Lilley Turner , who fought beside the Gurkhas by the Suez Canal , khun was one of many words transcribed phonetically for the English–Nepali dictionary he compiled in the midst of the fighting .
And then , in the 1960s , the word khun stopped being a word so much as a node of data in the work of linguist Isidore Dyen .
Working at Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , Dyen used Turner 's dictionary to assemble a list of 200 basic Nepali word meanings , including blood , and coded them onto IBM punch cards that were fed into early computers .
He used this , and similar lists from another 83 languages , to try to measure the rate at which languages change over time .
His discipline of lexicostatistics is now discredited for the crude assumptions it made .
But as Dyen worked on his monograph , he transferred his data on to computer disk and , in the late 1990s , published his data online1 .
“ We do things because they are mathematically elegant , and are delighted when they can be simplified . ”
Mark Pagel
Nearly a century after it was sung by the Gurkhas , khun became a few figures of code in the computer models of evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel at the University of Reading , UK .
Last year , Pagel used Dyen 's online data to generate trees that estimate when languages such as Nepali diverged from one another2 .
In these models , the word is stripped of much of its rich human history .
But it is exactly this type of pared - down language that speaks to researchers such as Pagel the most .
" Some linguists have spent a career studying a language that becomes a single data point in one of these analyses , " he says .
" We do things because they are mathematically elegant , and are delighted when they can be simplified . "
A new approach
In the past five to ten years , more and more non-linguists such as Pagel have used the computational tools with which they model evolution to take a crack at languages .
And one can see why .
Like biological species , languages slowly change and sometimes split over time .
Darwin's Galapagos finches evolved either large beaks or small ; Latin amor became French amour and Italian amore .
Darwin himself noted the ' curious parallel ' between the evolution of languages and species in The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex .
A. MARTIN
The advent of molecular genetics provided a new depth to the analogy .
Just as the four nucleotides of DNA can produce a staggering variety of creatures , the alphabets of the world 's languages can generate an infinite number of sentences .
These alphabets , the words they make , and the sounds and grammar rules that frame them are passed down from parent to child in a process that , at least superficially , resembles the inheritance of DNA .
Even some complications are the same .
Just as species can shade off into a maddening continuum of subspecies , populations and hybrids , languages dissolve into an untidy collection of dialects and intermediate forms .
And the rampant borrowing of words between languages resembles , graphically at least , the promiscuous horizontal gene transfer that microbes engage in .
There are limits to the analogy .
It is unclear , for example , what the ' selection pressures ' are for language , if any .
A language with a greater number of speakers is not obviously ' more fit ' than a dying language .
Although a speaker of the prevalent tongue could communicate with more people , it is not the intrinsic properties of a language that make it more widely spoken .
Instead , languages seem to rise to prominence on the coat - tails of the culture that speaks them , just as the prevalence of English traces back to the broad reach of British colonialism .
It 's no wonder , then , that mathematical biologists such as Pagel have become interested in a system that is intriguingly like , and intriguingly unlike , genes .
" I think sophisticated mathematics will increasingly become part and parcel of what we mean when we say that we have ' explained ' the phenomena of language change over time , " says Erez Lieberman , who studies mathematics and biology at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
The old school
However , there is already an old and venerable field of language - tree makers .
Historical linguists have been reconstructing languages since the 1780s .
Their tool is called the comparative method and it relies on extensive knowledge of the language group at hand , along with a broad grasp of , and intuitive feel for , the ways in which languages change .
A linguist might notice that the way a vowel is spoken has shifted in two languages when compared with an ancient one , and infer that the shift happened before the two languages split .
This will help to place the split relative to other splits but gives no information about when it happened .
Hence the comparative method produces trees , but no dates .
It is putting it mildly to say that many historical linguists find the evolutionary biologists working on language histories to be bungling interlopers who have no idea how to handle linguistic data .
It is also an understatement to say that some of these interlopers feel that their critics are hidebound traditionalists working on a hopelessly unverifiable system of hunches , received wisdom and personal taste .
And that 's just the mood between the historical linguists and the newcomers .
Lots of the newcomers do n't like each other either .
" Why get excited about it when it is still so preliminary ? " says Johanna Nichols , a historical linguist at the University of California , Berkeley .
" We are not impressed by a computational or mathematical paper per se .
We have to see that it blends well with what is known by historical linguistics and really adds to our knowledge .
Then we will be excited . "

Perhaps the most famous and controversial study3 produced by the new school is a 2003 paper by Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson at the University of Auckland , New Zealand .
The pair started with Dyen 's lists of word meanings for 84 languages from the Indian and European subcontinents , plus a few extras from extinct tongues .
The data already included Dyen 's opinion on which of these words were ' cognates ' , descended from a common word in a mother language , but the researchers converted this information into numerical code and generated trees showing how and when the languages were most likely to have branched off from one another .
This same type of likelihood algorithm is used to compare species ' DNA sequences and produce evolutionary trees .
Specifically , Gray and Atkinson dated the origin of a language family called Indo - European to around 7,800 – 9,800 years ago .
This ineffable date has been one of the most intensely studied and disputed points in all of historical linguistics and , based on archaeological and linguistic data , had previously been put at anywhere between about 6,000 and 10,000 years ago .
When Gray and Atkinson 's paper made the rounds of linguistics departments , howls of protest ensued .
Some critics took the paper as a return to glottochronology , a discredited method from the middle of the twentieth century — and cousin of Dyen 's lexicostatistics — which in most cases disastrously assumed that all languages change at a constant rate and which helped turn linguists against any quantitative analysis of their treasured subject .
But Gray and Atkinson 's statistical method does not assume uniform rates of change .
Many historical linguists also felt that similarities between words are a terrible proxy for similarities between languages .
They tend to argue that common sounds and grammatical rules are stronger evidence for common descent than individual words , which may be similar due to chance , borrowing , or even ' nursery formations ' such as mama and dada — words that mirror each other simply because all infants babble similar things .
" I think that some of these researchers think that these analyses are going to supplement or even supplant historical linguists , " says Lyle Campbell , a linguist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who was one of those unimpressed .
" So far , the ones that try to go beyond what we 've done do n't seem to work . "
Gray says that the tree does work even though it does n't take into account the subtleties of sounds and grammar , and he puts much of the criticism down to territoriality : " When people come from outside , you see a bit of hostility and suspicion . "
Although it might have been " politically more palatable " to have a linguist as one of the authors on the 2003 paper , " it would n't have changed the answers " , he says .
“ We try to find mathematical patterns in nature . ” Martin Nowak
Ultimately , many linguists felt that this type of analysis oversimplified their cherished subject more than they could bear .
Linguists love the little details that give a language personality : to them , the identifying sounds or peculiar borrowed words are nuances that tell the tale of a tongue .
The new breed brushes over these details in pursuit of generalities , trends and statistical rules .
" We try to find mathematical patterns in nature , " says Martin Nowak , an evolutionary modeller at Harvard .
" If someone works on the detailed classification , they might be dissatisfied with something that is cruder . "
Grand ambitions
A. MARTIN
That dissatisfaction looks set to grow as many in the new school pursue grander ambitions : to find quantitative laws that describe language evolution .
In a recent example , published in Science earlier this year , Pagel , Atkinson and their colleagues used word lists to build trees in three of the world 's major language families ; Indo -European , Bantu ( an African language family that includes Swahili ) and Austronesian — spoken on Pacific Islands4 .
They found that between 10 % and 33 % of divergence among these languages happened in what they called ' punctuational bursts ' , phases of accelerated language evolution just after a language splitting event .
The finding echoed the controversial ' punctuated equilibrium ' theory in which Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that biological evolution often occurred in rapid bursts amid longer periods of relatively slow change .
Pagel and his team speculate that the bursts could arise from the spoken idiosyncrasies of a small number of population founders , or a desire within a new population to sound different from the other group .
So here is one general law , perhaps : up to one - third of language evolution occurs in punctuational bursts after splitting events .
A second possible law arose from studies of word frequency .
In their 2007 study , which was published in Nature , Pagel and his team found that 50 % of the difference in language evolution rates could be explained by the frequency with which words within the language were being used2 .
Often - used words were ' stickier ' and resisted change .
" What really excites me about the frequency effect is that we are identifying a general evolutionary law , " Pagel says .
" We think it will hold and will have held since we began talking . "
In the same issue of Nature , Lieberman , Nowak and their co-workers showed that irregular English verbs become regularized more quickly if they are rarely used5 .
So the past tense of a rare verb such as ' gnaw ' would have a 50 % chance of regularizing to ' gnawed ' from the Old English form ' gnagan ' in 700 years .
By contrast , a very common verb such as ' be ' would have a 50 % chance of regularizing to ' beed ' in 38,800 years , perhaps explaining why ' was ' remains the preferred form today .
The researchers even had a precise mathematical description of the trend : a verb that is used 100 times less frequently regularizes 10 times as fast .
Different language
“ I do n't think the numbers are very exciting . ” Lyle Campbell
These findings completely underwhelmed most historical linguists .
They already knew that commonly used words change more slowly , and the fact that some aspects of this trend could be quantified did not really interest them .
" I do n't think the numbers are very exciting , " says Campbell .
" I would much rather it be relativized to ' in general , more frequent words change more slowly ' . "
One reason that many linguists have been unreceptive to such work is that they are not trained in statistics , and are unsure of how to compare and evaluate this type of numerical model themselves .
" They feel they 've been asked to just accept things , " says Tandy Warnow , a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with linguists .
And even those people , such as Warnow , who can evaluate the models say that they are too unsophisticated at this stage to pronounce firm dates or quantitative rules .
She says that the biological models need to be tailored to language and that they should incorporate the sound and grammar changes that are so important to linguists .
Better representations
Paul Heggarty , a linguist at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge , UK , is already trying to refine his models in this way .
Heggarty is building network diagrams rather than trees to show how similar languages interrelate .
He thinks that these can provide a better representation of the relationship between two languages when two cultures rub shoulders very closely and borrow words freely .
Then the links between branches of the tree — equivalent to horizontal gene transfer — become more important than the vertical branching .
" It is entirely natural for languages to stand in complex cross-cutting relationships to each other that may not be compatible with any branching genealogy at all , " he says .
As part of the network building , Heggarty is also trying to assign more subtle values to word changes than zeroes and ones .
A superficial analysis of the word ' dog ' , for example , might show that the English word is not cognate to the German word ( hund ) and score 1 , or ' changed ' for the pair .
But if the English word ' hound ' is chosen instead , it creates a match and would score 0 .
Because ' hound ' is n't the main word for ' dog ' in English , Heggarty would score it somewhere in between 0 and 1 , perhaps 0.4 .
He hopes that this type of refined method can create networks that reproduce the real relationships between very closely related languages and , by extension , reveal something about the histories of the peoples who spoke them in the past .
Getting quantitative
Such model tweaking is unlikely to win over the historical linguists , but at least some are beginning to warm to the methods .
Campbell acknowledges that the sheer number - crunching power of computer models can speed up the good old comparative method .
And he sees the appeal in getting a bit more quantitative .
If the field does not become more statistical and accountable , he points out , it may lose respect by those in other disciplines .
" I think we 'd like the legitimacy , " he says .

Another fan is Harvard University 's Steven Pinker , who famously appreciates language in all its fullness .
" There has got to be information in the statistics of language overlap that you simply can't exploit by looking at it intuitively , by eyeballing , " he says .
" Linguists have been slow in accepting that extra dollop of information that statistics provides , even if there are errors , even if there is noise . "
Noise — of the statistical kind — is not comfortable territory for many historical linguists when precious words such as khun are at stake .
So perhaps the onus now lies on the newcomers to show that their methods will not drown out languages , or their rich and idiosyncratic narrative .
" Hope , " Pinker says , " is not that the older generation of linguists will lay down their arms ; hope is that the younger generation will follow their noses to what is fruitful . "
Arson Near Daley 's Summer House Tied To Cougar ?
By Margaret Lyons in News on May 16 , 2008 4:05 PM
We knew you could n't stay out of the news for long , Roscoe Mellencamp , famously deceased locally - roaming cougar !
We just did n't really expect this .
Police are investigating a fire they say someone set last month near Mayor Daley 's vacation home in Michigan , possibly out of anger over the death of the cougar .
The fire did n't damage the Daley home , but it did destroy one of his neighbors ' houses and damaged another .

io9 got a sneak peek Star Wars : The Force Unleashed yesterday .
The untold chapter between Star Wars : Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope follows a new Sith apprentice who dodges rebels and Stormtroopers alike .
Get a sampling of the story line , meet some new characters ( and find out who 's coming back ) , and read about the overall feel of the game below .
Advertisement
The Force Unleashed takes place right where Episode III left off .
Darth Vader goes to the planet Kashyyk on a personal mission to find a hidden Jedi .
The battle on Kashyyk is all around him ( blasters coming at all angles ) , but that is not why he is there .
Interestingly enough you cannot make Vader run — because well , Vader does n't run .
As Vader , you get to use a lot of power from the force .
I do n't think it needs to be said because of the title but there are n't other weapons in this besides the force and your lightsaber .
But who needs a blaster when you can just pull the roof down on your enemies ?
Vader rips apart a ton of warrior Wookies , trees , and doors and uncovers the Jedi 's secret hideout .
In mid-strangle Vader demands the Jedi to tell him where the strong presence he feels is coming from .
Out of nowhere a little boy appears , grabs Vader 's lightsaber and the Dark Lord realizes that this kid is quite powerful .
Advertisement
Fast forward over many years of torture by Daddy V ( according to news reports ) and the little boy has grown up and is Vader 's secret apprentice .
Secret because if the Emperor found out , Vader would be in a world of lightning pain from his master .
What 's the plan ?
Send the secret apprentice out to kill all the Jedi , and then team up to kill the Emperor .
Oh yeah , and there can't be any witnesses to any of the events that take place , because remember you 're a " secret " apprentice .
Which means you get to kill everyone ( good guys and bad guys ) .
And players gain force points for the finesse in which they chose to use their force powers for slaying , so get creative .
You will be able to use the force to push and pull , the force grip ( choking ! ) , the force repulse and lightning ( which can later be used to electrify objects and hurl them as they explode ) .
As many of us know there will be a few new faces in The Force Unleashed .

Jedi Shaak Ti's Padawan , Maris Brood , is one of them .
Brood wields lightsaber tonfas , is in hiding on the planet Felucia and is scary as hell upon first look .

Master Rahm Kota is the Obi-Wan figure .
I expect lot of incredibly general predictions to come from him about the young apprentice 's future as he seems to be tied to him in some spiritual Jedi way .
Advertisement
I did n't get to see Juno Eclipse in action .
You heard her voice throughout each level guiding the apprentice along the way , and eventually getting much more personal and asking if he is injured in one scene , which must have been the first signs of their love interest .
Planet Felucia is another welcomed visual treat during the game .
Especially since you get to fight Felucian warriors and their pet Rancors .
Advertisement
And finally there 's PROXY .
Who looks like C - 3PO without his clothes and bit more slender .
PROXY is the plucky sidekick to the apprentice and can take the form into any personality profile that is loaded into it 's memory .
He takes the form of Lord Vader often when dolling out responsibilities to the apprentice .
Returning vets are Vader , the Emperor , Shaak Ti and Bail Organa , making a quickie appearance voiced by Jimmy Smits himself .
Vader was brought to life by Matt Sloan who did the voice of Chad Vader ( the Vader that manages a grocery store in all the online video shorts . )
There will be alternate endings and you can expect a lot of twists and turns .
Many of the characters warned the young Apprentice over and over that you can't trust a Sith .
Hope he watches his back .

The classic John Williams score is still intact , with an additional hour of new music from Mark Griskey .
The music complements nicely the amazing graphics and new touches .
It 's quite gratifying , when embodying the whole " evil " side to the story , to watch the new surrounding characters ' will to live .
For example if you grab a stormtrooper or another character with the force they will struggle and try to grab people or things around them , or if you impale a character with a lightsaber they will try to take it out .
With all the attention to detail combined with the twisty story it should make for one excellent movie , I mean video game .
Alas there are no online capabilities but there will be multiplayer available on PSP and DS ( up to 4 players ) and the Wii version will allow you to duel your opponents .
Sounds like a good time for the dark side .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved an additional $ 165 billion ( 83.4 billion pounds ) to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan for another year after lawmakers blocked proposed timetables for withdrawing American troops from Iraq .
By a vote of 70 - 26 , the Senate passed the new war money the Pentagon says it urgently needs to avoid civilian layoffs and the interruption of soldiers ’ paycheques within months .
The House of Representatives still must weigh in on the legislation .
Last week , it passed a drastically different bill that failed to provide any new money for the wars and would withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the end of 2009 .
The House is likely to consider its next step in early June after lawmakers return from a week - long recess .
President George W. Bush , speaking to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , repeated his opposition to Congress setting troop withdrawal schedules or other conditions on the Pentagon .
“ The United States Congress needs to pass a responsible war funding bill that does not tie the hands of our commanders , ” Bush said .
Assuming lawmakers ultimately give Bush the war funds he has requested , Congress will have appropriated more than $ 800 billion for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 .
Most of the money has gone for the unpopular war in Iraq .
As the Senate was debating the new war money , a House panel was looking into allegations that the Defence Department had failed to properly account for $ 15 billion in expenditures in Iraq , much of that for payments to contractors .
Besides the war funding , the Senate also attached expensive expansions of U.S. unemployment benefits and help for war veterans who want to get a college education .
Bush opposes those measures , as well as other domestic spending included by the Senate .
Noting that Bush has asked for money to continue rebuilding Iraq and for other foreign aid projects , Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , a West Virginia Democrat , said , “ But the president says he will veto the bill if we add funding for bridges in Birmingham or for help with the high cost of energy bills in Maine or to fight crime in U.S. towns ... ”
The two Democratic presidential candidates , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , interrupted their campaigns to cast votes against the war money .
They voted for expanding veterans ’ benefits and more jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed in the United States .
In a floor speech , Obama , who has a nearly insurmountable lead in the Democratic race , attacked Sen.
John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , who was not present to vote .
Prefacing his remarks by saying he respected McCain ’s military service , Obama added , “ But I ca n’t understand why he would line up behind the president in opposition of this GI bill ” to help veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars pay for their college educations .
McCain backs a less extensive version of the veterans education bill .
Clinton , noting lawmakers ’ penchant for giving speeches about supporting U.S. troops , also argued for the expanded veterans benefits .
“ The real test is n’t the speeches we deliver but whether or not we deliver on the speeches , ” Clinton said .
In approving the money for the wars just before the Memorial Day holiday , Democrats who control the Senate hoped to blunt Bush administration criticisms that Congress has been slow to provide money for the troops .
And in approving enough money to pay for the controversial war in Iraq for a full year , Congress would avoid another war - funding debate closer to the November presidential and congressional elections .
It also would give the new president , who takes office next January , time to come up with his or her plans for the Iraq war , which is now in its sixth year .
Berlin Ignores Verbal Attack Chavez Says Merkel a Political Descendant of Hitler
The German government has shrugged off a verbal attack on Chancellor Angela Merkel by Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez who called her a political descendant of Adolf Hitler and stopped just short of telling her to go to hell .
The two leaders might meet at an upcoming summit in Peru .
Agents Casey and Plaza approached me with this idea at the UCB Theatre office in New York .
Agent Casey is the IT guy for UCB , and had access to a whole closet full of old , barely working desktop computers and CRT monitors .
Naturally we needed to use these dinosaurs in a Starbucks .
We met on a Saturday afternoon at the office and dug through the graveyard of old machines trying to find the ones that would still boot .
Agent Shafer works on the computers
Some of the machines were so old they were still running Windows 95 .
Agent Casey was able to install a Wi -Fi card in one of the slightly more modern ones .
This would allow him to access the wireless network at Starbucks .
Whenever we film inside a place of business , we have to hide all of our cameras .
Most places will kick you out pretty quickly if they see you filming .
We had three cameras , each using different concealment methods :
Agent Adams ’ camera was hidden in a Starbucks bag
Agent Shafer ’s camera was sticking out of his duffel bag
And I used the hidden camera glasses loaned to me by the UCB ’s Matt Besser
We used three enormous pieces of black rolling luggage as our “ laptop cases . ”
As large as our cases were , they still could n’t hold the CRT monitors , so those had to be rested on top .
We had all forgotten how heavy this type of equipment would be .
It was no easy task getting these rigs down to Starbucks .
Agent Wengert struggles to get out of the building
Agent Casey on 7th Avenue
We had a nice selection of Starbucks to chose from .
There are about 4 within a 2 - minute walking distance from the UCB office , one in every direction .
We picked one that had plenty of window seats ( for street filming ) and an upstairs ( to get the overhead camera angle . )
We sent Agent Toledo and Agent Sokoler down to the Starbucks first to secure good window seats .
They would reserve the seats until the computer users arrived .
The video camera agents entered next , buying a coffee and finding a good spot to covertly film .
I pretended to read a paper while filming with my glasses
Agent Shafer films through the window
Agent Casey was the first to enter .
He bought a coffee and then quietly set up his computer at a table by the window .
Agent Casey
His computer had a Wi -Fi card which allowed him to get onto the wireless network .
He opted not to pay for the T - Mobile access , and instead visited the only site he could browse for free , starbucks.com .
We did n’t know how people would react to the computers .
The most common reaction surprised us : people assumed that they were public machines put there by Starbucks .
As Agent Casey went to pick up his coffee order , a man sat down at his computer .
Agent Casey had to repeat , “ this is mine , ” several times before the guy understood what he meant .
He got up , and then proceeded to ask a nearby woman if he could use her laptop .
Agent Plaza entered next
She set up right next to a girl using a laptop , which provided the perfect contrast .
People in the Starbucks started really reacting after she arrived .
One weirdo on a big computer was one thing , but now there ’s another one ?
Customers react to a second desktop
Agent Plaza had a newer monitor , but her computer was ancient .
She booted up Windows 95 and got to work on Word 95 .
She took the joke a step further by actually putting her keyboard and monitor ON HER LAP .
Agent Wengert was the last to enter .
He found a spot by the window in between the other two agents .
This created a real computer lab feel with three desktops ( and one customer ’s laptop ) in a row .
I sat facing the window for a few minutes , and it was really fun to watch the reactions of people on the street as they would walk by .
You ’d see them notice each computer as they passed , and by the third , everyone would do a double - take .
Most people would keep on walking , but every now and then someone would stop and take a closer look .
The Starbucks staff never gave us any trouble at all .
In fact , it did n’t seem like it occurred to them that the three computer users might have known each other .
One employee walked by me and laughed .
I asked him what was going on and he pointed at the three computer users and declared , “ They mean BUSINESS . ”
That seemed to be the going theory , that they were just very serious about getting their work done .
Our agents did seem entirely serious– everyone was excellent at keeping a straight face .
The manager told me that it must be “ midterms ” and that they were probably students from FIT , a college across the street .
At one point the manager caught Agent Adams filming , but even then he did n’t put together that we were all part of a prank .
He simply explained that , “ They are paying customers and you ca n’t film them . ”
Agent Adams claimed to be a student who just happened to have a camera on him and wanted to film this unusual thing .
The manager admitted , “ It ’s amazing .
I ’ve never seen it before , and I ’ve been with the company for four years . ”
“ This is the most insane fucking thing I ’ve ever seen .
What is the benefit ?
What ’s the most that could happen ?
You ’re saving electricity , but that ’s like minuscule .
Everybody in the place is looking .
Does every Starbucks do this ?
The strangest fucking thing I ’ve ever seen .
Have you seen that in another Starbucks ?
Is it like a new trend or what ?
What ’s the benefit ?
Do you know what the benefit is ?
If they ’ve got a computer they must have a roof over their head .
They must have electricity .
Strange .
This is very weird man .
Today is the 9th of February , the day of a new trend .
Is that the strangest thing you ’ve ever seen ?
Is that not the wildest thing ?
I thought maybe I was behind the times and it was like a fad , but I ’m glad that this is something that you have n’t seen either .
That ’s the strangest thing ever .
That is so strange . ”
The man pictured above was in the Starbucks almost the entire time .
He could n’t believe what was going on and was eager to talk to anyone else who noticed it too .
“ What ’s the benefit ? ” he kept repeating .
It made no sense that anyone would go to all the trouble to bring their desktop from home .
As he exited Agent Adams caught him on the street and asked him what was going on .
His answer is in the main video above , but here ’s a longer transcription :
We got another great reaction from the blonde woman pictured above ( with the “ benefit ” guy . )
She entered the Starbucks and actually stood in line behind Agent Wengert waiting to use his machine .
There ’s no telling how long she would have waited had he not started packing up and leaving after a couple of minutes .
The reaction she gives when she realizes what ’s going on is priceless ( you can see it in the Agent Interview video above . )
She , first tries to figure out why this guy is unplugging the Starbucks public computer , and then begins laughing when she realizes it ’spersonal computer she had been waiting in line for .
Our agents left the Starbucks one by one and met back up at the UCB office .
Despite all the heavy lifting , we had a really fun time , and it seemed like everyone who saw us had fun as well .
It ’s hard to believe , but it ’s been nearly five years since our last mission in a Starbucks .
It was good to be back .
Mission Accomplished .

Think back to the days following 9/11 , when all commercial and civilian air traffic was grounded .
People were stranded everywhere .
Only take it a step further :
Take away the trains , the buses , and the rental cars .
Imagine every gas station closed , and cars abandoned on the roadside as they too run out .
People can't get to work and the nation 's businesses can't even declare bankruptcy because there 's no way to get to the courthouse to file the papers .
The mail stops .
Supermarkets are empty because there are no delivery trucks .
And then , in a final shriek of terror , the power plants shut down , darkness falls everywhere , water pressure stops , and humanity devolves into a battlefield of hand - to - hand combat over who gets to eat the neighbor 's dog .
This is the extremist scenario painted by peak oil advocates .
Peak oil refers to the point at which world oil production must start to decline as reserves are emptied and pumps run dry .
Oil is a finite resource , and so there 's no doubt that at some point , peak oil will occur .
The world 's appetite for oil continues to grow exponentially , fueled by the explosive growth of most of the world 's population in China and India .
When the rift between increasing demand and decreasing supply gets to a breaking point , advocates say that the apocalyptic scenario described above must happen .
In some places , peak oil has already happened .
In the United States , oil production peaked about 1970 , when we produced about 3.4 billion barrels per year .
Today we produce about 1.5 billion .
The curve has followed the 1956 prediction by American geophysicist M. King Hubbert who described the oil production of any given region over time as a bell curve .
This is called Hubbert 's curve .
Every region in the world has its own separate curve .
Some , like the US , are already on the downside .
Others , like Canada , which is just beginning to exploit its oil sands , are only just now hitting the steepest climb on the upside .
In addition to Canada , the middle east and China are also still climbing their upsides .
Russia has just barely tipped past its peak .
The most pessimistic estimates for world peak oil say that it 's already happened ; the most optimistic give us another 30 years before we peak .
Oil production in any given region is not determined simply by physical factors such as the amount of reserves remaining and the technology required to develop it , but also by political and economic pressures .
For example , Russia peaked way back in the Soviet days when their economy was falling apart , but their oil industry recovered throughout the 1990's and they 've managed to find a second peak .
The same could happen in the United States , if continental shelf and rocky mountain reserves were to be developed .
They probably wo n't be , due to political pressures , but it 's nice to know that they could be , if things came down to eating your neighbor 's dog .
The biggest error made by the peak oil doomsayers is in failing to recognize the adaptive nature of the world economy .
When demand goes up and supply goes down , prices go up , and consumers look to alternatives .
As alternatives become more popular than the original , prices drop in reaction to the reduced demand , and eventually a marginalized industry disappears .
Markets react and adapt .
Currently , we have very high gasoline prices .
Consumers are reacting by clamoring for alternative fuel vehicles .
Many industrial products depend on oil , such as fertilizers , solvents , and plastics to name only a few ; and as the price of producing these climbs , industry turns to alternatives .
Alternatives become increasingly commoditized and prices come down .
Oil becomes less relevant , and eventually nobody will care when reserves finally do run dry .
If consumers and industry failed to react to oil prices that climb astronomically for decades , then yes , it could be possible that we'd have an overnight shutdown of everything and the world would turn into a tumultuous battlefield of cannibalism .
But neither consumers nor industry have ever acted this way , do n't now , and are n't likely to in the future .
Everyone wants to spend less money , and the most expensive options will always be least desirable .
Part of the reason that the doomsayers do n't see this is that what 's most visible right now is gasoline prices , and the total nonexistence of any viable alternative fuel vehicles .
That 's our worldview : Expensive gas , diminishing production , no alternatives .
But outside of this worldview , some very interesting things are happening .
Believe it or not , tremendous research is going on to develop alternative fuel vehicles : Supercapacitor technologies , fuel cells , hydrogen production .
Silicon Valley is investing into alternative energy like a bat out of hell .
And worldwide , industry is developing alternatives to petroleum based plastic like fructose .
Agricultural fertilizers can be made from seawater or atmospheric nitrogen , but they 're not in production because the market has not yet reacted that far .
Eventually , when the price gap closes , these non-oil based sources may become the inexpensive standards .
What about other resources ?
Do they peak as well ?
Yes , they do , at least non-renewable ones do .
It 's generally believed that we 're either just past or right about at the peak of gold production .
Some 150,000 tons of gold have been mined throughout history , and the US Geological Survey estimates that there 's another 90,000 tons still out there .
Considering there 's been a constant increase in gold mining efficiency , this all sounds about right .
In many countries around the world , gold production has been dropping in recent years as reserves have been tapped out .
But , do we need to expect a worldwide panic over gold ?
Probably not , since it 's largely a luxury item and its industrial uses are relatively modest .
We expect to see prices rise as supply diminishes , and probably a number of market adjustments until we settle into an eventual equilibrium of old gold being reused to meet demand .
There are other more serious resource peaks .
Peak phosphorous , for one .
Phosphorous is a crucial ingredient of both synthetic and organic crop fertilizers .
And glyophosphate is a principal ingredient in herbicides used in super - high - yield genetically modified food crops .
Both have seen dramatic price hikes in recent years as rock phosphate , the source of nearly all industrial phosphorus , is being mined out .
If I stopped talking now , this would seem an alarming , terrifying prospect , and you might see doom & gloom websites predicting global disaster the way you do with peak oil .
Peak phosphorus is a painful situation for farmers , but it 's one that 's not insoluble .
In the short term , farmers invest in the phosphorus companies , thus offsetting their production costs with dividend income .
In the long term , the fertilizer producers continue their research into alternative supplies .
High on their list is seawater , which is after all , the eventual depository of all agricultural runoff .
This proposal is essentially an accelerated leveraging of nature 's existing cycle .
Another peak that we 're starting to hear about is peak silicon .
In this case , it 's not a physical shortage of silicon ; it 's the engineering limits of what you can do with silicon to make computer chips .
Such a peak would mean that the capabilities of computers could no longer grow with our increasing demand on them .
The doomsayer pundits could make an argument here too that overnight we 'll start each eating other and burning down our cities and running around with babies on pitchforks .
But in fact what happens is that the silicon industry fades and the graphene industry rises .
Graphene is only one of numerous next - generation computer chip technologies that obsolesce silicon .
Generally , what tends to happen in any industry , is that by the time an existing resource runs out , inventive scientists have already come up with something better .
When a production peak looms ( be it oil , phosphorus , silicon , or anything ) , this provides a kick in the pants to accelerate development .
Market economies work in such a way that investors are encouraged to fund such development , and the bigger the looming problem , the bigger the investment to meet it .
Mark Twain used to speak nostalgically of the sad disappearance of the riverboat industry .
It was killed by steam trains .
Steam trains were later killed in turn by diesel electrics .
The glory days of rail travel were ended by the advent of airlines .
Eventually airliners are n't going to be able to burn jet fuel anymore .
What will happen then ?
Today , I have no idea ; much like Mark Twain had no idea that airliners would one day replace his beloved steamboat .
To assume that the current state of technology represents the last and final stage of development is a completely ignorant viewpoint .
To listen to the doomsayers is to be completely uncritical and unskeptical .
I do n't know what 's around tomorrow 's corner , but all the evidence of history tells us that it 's probably not a big scary dragon .

話は脱線するが、自分がこの業界に入ってからよく分かったことの一つは、ソフトウェアを開発している会社は、評判という意味で、とても不利な立場にいるということだ。 なぜならば、
客が原因で失敗した場合。 客が悪いと公言するわけにはいかないので、SIerは製品が悪かったことにする。 SIerが原因で失敗した場合。 自分が悪かったと公言するわけにはいかないので、SIerは製品が悪かったことにする。
製品が本当に悪くて失敗した場合。 なるべくならSIerの責任したいが、大抵は言い逃れができないので、開発ベンダ自身の責任となる。当たり前だが。
という場合分けが成り立ってしまうからなのだ。
自分が悪くても他人のせいにしたがるという性質のおかげで、

実際、ろくにシステムアーキテクトもできないような駄目なコンサルティング会社が、当然のように大型プロジェクトで失敗して、

TOKYO 
The Japanese government said on Wednesday that it would block a British hedge fund from buying a larger stake in a power company , in a case that is being closely watched as a test of Japan ’s openness to foreign capital .
The trade ministry rejected a proposal by the hedge fund , the Children ’s Investment Fund , to increase its holdings in Electric Power Development , an electricity wholesale company , to as much as 20 percent from 9.9 percent .
The ministry was acting on the recommendation of a government - sponsored panel , which said the fund ’s short - term profit horizon could hurt the company ’s ability to provide electricity .
The rejection is the latest in a series of setbacks for foreign investors in Japan that have raised questions about the country ’s commitment to welcoming foreign investment and business .
Recently , Japan has appeared adrift in economic policy , seeming to waver between embracing the global economy , and erecting barriers to keep it out .
Japanese officials have insisted that the country remains open .
They said that the electric company , commonly known as J - Power , was an exception because of its strategic role in supplying energy to Japanese homes and businesses .
In its recommendation , the committee expressed concerns about the possibility of foreign investors getting access to sensitive technology used by the company , which operates nuclear power plants .

" The Transparent Society : " Ten Years Later - CFPWiki :
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the publication of David Brin 's controversial book , " The Transparent Society " .
The book argues that in the face of the explosion of sensors , cheap storage , and cheap data processing we should adopt strategies of vision over concealment .
A world in which not just transactional information , but essentially all information about us will be collected , stored , and sorted is , Brin says , inevitable .
The only issue left to be decided is who will have access to this information ; he argues that freedom , and even some privacy , are more likely to flourish if everybody - not just elites - has access to this flood of data .
The book remains controversial and much - talked - about .
The panel will explore how Brin 's claims hold up ten years later and whether ( or how far ) we 're on the road to a Transparent Society .

Here is my presentation :
I am a sidelight .
I am here as a tame economist .
The political and sociological questions are , I think , more important .
Nevertheless I have a question to address : does turning the cameras not on Big Brother but on the other brothers -- all the other brothers that are economic actors -- help ?
The first and most important of the not -Big Brothers for you -- for each instantiation of " you " -- is your particular employer .
That is Medium - Sized Brother .
The answer is that it is n't going to help , or not much .
Employees of financial service firms will find their employers going through their trash in search of evidence of insider trading , and in the process employers will pick up every piece of information they could want and more .
Cash - register operators in grocery stores find that their scanning frequency data plus the cameras on the cash registers give the store manager information about every gossip episode -- and how costly it is in terms of items not scanned in that minute .
There will be Taylorism , Taylorism rampant , Taylorism rampant in nearly every job where you have a boss .
Now this has an upside and a badside .
The upside : My seventeen - year - old is a lifeguard .
You clock in at the start of your shift , using nineteenth - century punch - card surveillance techology .
You clock out at the end of your shift .
But you do n't clock out for breaks -- hence some lifeguards shade their thirty - minute breaks into fifty - minute breaks , and the others grumble but do n't want to be snitches , and morale falls , and the efficiency with which lifeguarding services are provided drops .
Cheap cameras and infinite videotape scanned by artificially - intelligences vast , cold , and unsympathetic will allow the boss to see which lifeguards are pulling their weight and which are not , and so produce better morale and better outcomes Taylorist regimentation and restriction of individual employees ' autonomy , discretion , and ability to goof off are , one might say , going to be used where they are good : where they lead to a lower - cost and a higher - quality outcome bosses will use them , and where they do n't bosses wo n't .
These Coasian arguments are trumps within economics , they are powerful , but they may not be right . '
The downsides of Medium - Sized Brother watching you :
First of all , corporate bureaucracies are not rational and rationalized entities -- the will to dominate and the desire to cover your butt make it certain that its surveillance powers will be badly used .
Second , the coming of surveillance tools to the boss greatly alters the balance of power between bosses and workers , and eliminates a great deal of what we might think of as capillary income redistribution from rich bosses to poorer workers .
Here David Brin 's solution to what are largely political problems -- turn the cameras on the powerful so that the hive mind can look up at Big Brother looking down -- does not , I think , apply .
Absent a strong union , the boss simply does not care .
Perhaps the hive mind looking up will be able to rank employers as to their relative desirability , and this will put some pressure on bosses to play nice .
Perhaps not .
Then there are all the call them Little Brothers -- the people who want to sell you things that you may need to be persuaded against your better judgment to buy .
And then there are the people who want to figure out whether you will be a more expensive customer to serve - - your health insurer , for example -- so that they can decide not to let you be a customer .
Here the problem is that you -- all of the yous out there -- need an aggregator .
Little Brothers can figure out how to use the raw data that the cameras spit out to determine what they want to know about how to sell or not sell to you , about how to manage you .
The yous have a harder time figuring out how to use the information the cameras spit out to figure out how to manage the Little Brothers -- you do n't have a big interest in putting in the time and analytical effort to figure out how to manage one Little Brother , even though all the yous together do .
Where these aggregators come from so that the yous can analyze the Little Brothers is not so clear ...
David Brin wrote , I think , a wonderful book .
And complaining that his solution -- turn the cameras around -- does n't solve all problems is like complaining that the portions of the free ice cream are n't large enough .
Nevertheless , I do complain .
And let me stop there .
Speaking from Japan , the Dalai Lama told reporters that he has supported the Beijing Olympics “ right from the beginning , ” but that protesters have a right to voice themselves .
His government in exile , however , released a statement in opposition to the demonstrations that have followed the Olympic torch .
New York Times :
“ We are not anti-Chinese , ” he said in a press conference at Tokyo ’s international airport in Narita .
“ Right from the beginning , we supported the Olympic Games . ”
Speaking of pro-Tibetan protesters , he said nobody “ has the right to tell them to shut up . ”
He faulted Beijing for suppressing anti-government unrest in Tibet last month , saying its use of violence was “ an outdated method ” that did not solve the underlying problems .
That unrest , the largest in the region in two decades , and the resulting Chinese crackdown have brought sympathy protests around the world where demonstrators have demanded greater freedom in Tibet .
In a separate statement on Thursday , the Tibetan government in exile , based in India , said it did not support the disruption of the Olympic torch relay .
Beijing has blamed the Dalai Lama for masterminding the recent unrest in Tibet .

6 A Damned Horn Growing Out Of Your Head ( Cornu Cutaneum )
That Sounds Fancy .
What is it ?
Not everyone can be a supermodel .
Sure , a flawless complexion and refined bone structure is a prerequisite for Cracked writers , but we understand it 's an unfair standard to hold you slobs to .
All that is important is you realize that your staggering unattractiveness makes you a unique and beautiful snowflake and the keratotic horn sprouting from your head just makes you that much more exotic .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Cornu cutaneum is more specifically an epidermal lesion common to the face , ears , nose , forearms and hands .
If the image is striking a particularly National Geographic tone with you , it 's because the horn is actually made of the same substrates that form a rhinoceros horn .
It 's pretty similar in construction to those horns as well , though of course the human equivalent is n't anchored to anything .
Remember that distinction when the other kids on the playground taunt you about your horn so you can counter with " Shut up !
Histologically , this is n't a horn because no axially positioned bone is present ! "
It 's sure to stun them into silence before they laugh and beat the crap out of you .

We 're just kidding about that last part .
You do n't have to be worried about being brutalized because of your horn .
We guarantee no one will ever dare to touch you again after seeing it .
I 'm Scared .
How Scared Should I Be ?
Think of the horns as a pop - up turkey timer .
When one erupts from the otherwise placid surroundings -- DING !-- sir , your malignant melanoma is ( probably ) ready .
In truth , over 60 percent of the lesions are benign , but 100 percent of the lesions are still associated with " Eww . "
Luckily , unlike other cancers with nondescript symptoms , odds are pretty good you 'll find your way to a dermatologist tout suite when you start growing a fucking horn .

Man , How Much Does Your Body Hate You ?
For the purposes of this article , your body 's loathing of you was quantified in the standard metric of kilojoules .
However , since this is not readily relatable for most laypersons , we have a rough illustration for each measurement .
The scale goes from absolute zero ( approximately how much Mother Teresa despised the laughter of children frolicking with puppies ) to 100 kilojoules ( the theoretical bounds of hate as defined by Mr. T confronted with jibba - jabba ) .

Organizations that own .org domains may soon find themselves paying a bit more to renew , transfer , and register new domains .
The company that operates the .org domain , Public Interest Registry ( PIR ) , has decided to raise wholesale rates from $ 6.15 to $ 6.75 per domain this year — a 10 percent fee increase , following last year 's 2.5 percent increase .
Of course , smaller registrars that buy wholesale domains wo n't want to eat that fee themselves , meaning that they will likely pass on the increase to customers .
PIR informed the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) of its plans in a letter ( PDF ) sent earlier this month .
No reason was given in the letter for the rate increase , but it stands to reason that since other domain operators have raised fees ( like VeriSign for .com and .net domains ) , that PIR does n't want to be left out when it could make more money .
The increase will go into effect on November 9 , giving those who own or want .org domains another six months to take advantage of the current price .
Although the 60 ¢ may not matter much to individual customers , groups that operate multiple domains might feel a little more pain in their wallets — especially nonprofits and small organizations that .org was once limited to .
PIR does n't require ICANN 's approval in order to raise rates , but it is limited by ICANN on how much it can raise them per year .
According to ICANN 's registry agreement for .org domains , service fees cannot be increased by more than 1.1 times the previous year 's max service fees .
The original agreement started out in 2006 at $ 6 per domain , meaning that 2007 's maximum service fees would have been $ 6.60 , and 2008 's maximum is $ 7.26 .
It looks like PIR has a ways to go before hitting the ceiling for this year , unlike its greedier counterpart VeriSign , which has raised the prices for .com and .
net the maximum allowable each year under its agreement with ICANN .
CAIRO ( Reuters ) -
The governments of the Middle East , from Iran to Israel and beyond , are increasingly ignoring the wishes of a U.S. administration which has only eight months left in office , going their own way in regional diplomacy .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad laughs while President George W. Bush addresses the 62nd United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. headquarters in New York , September 25 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
U.S. President George W. Bush ’s latest speech on Middle East policy , made in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el - Sheikh last week , shows how the gap has grown between what Washington would like and what is happening in the region .
It is part of a wider picture of Washington ’s declining clout , accelerated by its debilitating deployment of more than 100,000 troops to Iraq for the past five years .
France has had contacts with the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas , for example , and Israel has had indirect talks with Syria , which Washington is trying to isolate .
Bush said in Sharm el - Sheikh that all nations in the region should stand together against Hamas , a group which he said was attempting to undermine efforts at making peace .
But the Egyptian government , his host and a longstanding friend of the United States , was simultaneously , and with U.S. consent , trying to mediate a truce between Gaza and Israel .
Israeli commentators said the Egyptian mediation amounted to indirect negotiations between the Israeli government and Hamas , a group with which the United States refuses to have dealings .
The Islamist organization , which controls the Gaza Strip , was offering Israel a long - term truce which could make it easier for the rival Palestinian group Fatah to reach an agreement with Israel -- a goal which the United States says it is promoting .
In his Sharm el - Sheikh speech , Bush also attacked the Lebanese Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah , calling it “ terrorists funded by Iran ” and “ the enemy of a free Lebanon ” .
HEZBOLLAH’S CENTRAL ROLE
Three days later in the Gulf state of Qatar , Hezbollah and other Lebanese groups reached an agreement ending the political crisis that had paralyzed Lebanon for months .
Hezbollah had defeated its rivals in Beirut in short order this month when Washington ’s allies in the Lebanese government tried to challenge some of the privileges it enjoyed as the force which helped drive Israel out of south Lebanon .
The new political arrangement in Lebanon , symbolized by the election of Michel Suleiman as president on Sunday , tilts the balance of power significantly in Hezbollah ’s favor and underscores its central role in Lebanese politics .
Bush maintained his confrontational attitude towards Iran and Syria , saying : “ Every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in stopping these nations from supporting terrorism . ”
On the same day of the Lebanese agreement , Israel and Syria disclosed they had held indirect talks mediated by Turkey -- the closest they have come to serious negotiations since talks brokered by the United States collapsed in 2000 .
The Bush administration walked away from high - level contacts with the Syrians after the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al - Hariri in 2005 .
The United States says it suspects Syria of the killing , a charge Syria denies .
Bush ’s audience included Gulf Arab officials whose governments have maintained working relations with Iran , defying to some extent Washington ’s attempts to isolate Tehran .
Years of U.S. policy , including sanctions and a debate about the possibility of military strikes , have not persuaded Iran to abandon its ambitions to produce its own enriched uranium .
DIALOGUE WITH IRAN
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul
Gheit said that in his talk about Iran ’s nuclear program Bush had again failed to address the nuclear activities of Israel .
It is widely believed to have some 200 nuclear warheads .
Mohamed ElBaradei , Egyptian head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told the same conference in Sharm el - Sheikh that Washington was maintaining double standards on nuclear weapons , and dialogue with Iran was the right approach .
Bush argued that “ terrorist organizations and their state sponsors ” are the main opponents to democracy in the Arab world .
“ ( They ) know they cannot survive in a free society , so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effort to stop democracy from taking root , ” he said .
But civil society and human rights groups say that governments friendly towards the United States are some of the most determined obstacles to democracy , repressing peaceful Islamist groups which seek power through democratic elections .
In Egypt , for example , where Bush was speaking , the authorities prevented the non-violent Muslim Brotherhood from standing in local elections and some parliamentary elections over the past two years , ignoring occasional U.S. criticism .
Without naming names , the U.S. president did criticize his friends in the Arab world for holding political prisoners .
But five years after Bush launched his campaign for political change in the Middle East , Arab leaders have learned that the price for ignoring him on human rights is low .
“ We ’ve heard these speeches before , ” said an Egyptian official who asked not to be named .
In Cairo three years ago U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the time had come for the rule of law to replace emergency decrees .
But this week the Egyptian parliament is expected to extend for another year a system of emergency law that has been in force for more than 26 years .
In the months prior to 9/11 a flurry of activity by Israeli intelligence agents in the U.S. signaled that something big was going on  but the FBI , the CIA , and the myriad of federal agencies charged with protecting this country from terrorism had n’t a clue .
Now , why is that ?
The answer is hidden in the fog of prevarications , obfuscation , and lame excuses cooked up by our government to explain the unexplainable : how and why did a conspiracy years in the making elude the intelligence chieftains of the American security apparatus ?
Now the U.S. government , under tremendous pressure from the families of the victims of 9/11 , has yielded and agreed to an inquiry into why and how 9/11 happened .
Let the cover - up begin !
The 10 - member commission will have 18 months to come up with newer , bigger , and better excuses for why our protectors fell asleep at the wheel .
The " National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States " ( NatComTAUUS ) will consist of " nationally recognized American citizens , " the New York Times informs us , " with broad experience in national security affairs and law enforcement . "
They ca n’t be currently in office , since the idea is to mimic what a real citizens ’ commission ( or a grand jury ) might look like by limiting membership to " private " individuals , " but former office - holders are naturally the leading candidates .
With a chairman hand - picked by the White House , and limited subpoena power , the commission is born crippled , and is further disabled by the powerful influence of Senator John McCain , who has been sucking up to the families and posing as their great champion .
But McCain  who gets to choose one of the commissioners , the swing vote in a bipartisan group  is only interested in fodder for his perpetual war on the White House , and in paving the way for a possible presidential run in 2004 .
If anyone thinks he is going to allow the 9/11 commission to examine what happened in the crucial months and weeks prior to the terrorist attacks , they are deluding themselves .
Another agitator for the creation of this phony commission has been Senator Joseph Lieberman , who has the same sort of political motives .
Like McCain , he perhaps has a few other items on his private agenda that might conflict with a desire to actually discover the answer to the crucial question regarding 9/11 : what happened that allowed a ragtag band of Islamo - wackos to hijack four airliners and ram them  practically simultaneously into the two most visible symbols of American power ?
In spite of previous anti-terrorist studies , safeguards , and innumerable warnings , the alarm system was clearly turned off that day  but by whose hand ?
One of my old right - wing favorites , a tract that turned up everywhere you looked back in the 1960s , was called None Dare Call It Treason , and that about sums up the atmosphere surrounding the creation of the NatComTAUUS .
The aura of something very rotten in the state of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies at the federal level permeates the air so thickly that it is a veritable soup , and the distinguished commissioners are going to have to use an awful lot of air freshener to drown the stink out in a fine mist of flowery rhetoric .
Coleen Rowley is a veteran FBI agent whose bombshell memo drew attention to official obstructionism that blocked an effective investigation into the terror cells in our midst .
Her thinly - veiled implication of treason in high places leaps off the page at the reader :
" During the early aftermath of September 11th , when I happened to be recounting the pre-September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ , almost everyone ’s first question was " Why ? 
Why would an FBI agent ( s ) deliberately sabotage a case ?
( I know I should n’t be flippant about this , but jokes were actually made that the key FBIHQ personnel had to be spies or moles , like Robert Hansen , who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis ’ effort . ) "
Rowley backs off immediately from drawing the obvious conclusion , or even considering the option that treason is indeed the reason .
Instead , we are told that caution is built - in to any " hierarchical " organization , such as the FBI , and that " career enhancement " means going along to get along .
And , of course , the failure is attributed to " recent extreme public and congressional criticism / oversight , " which prejudiced the agency against taking any " aggressive " action .
But this is clearly nonsense , for surely the desire for " career enhancement " would lead to the exact opposite of over - caution : after all , getting the bad guys would seem to be the surest career - enhancer .
Unless , of course , somebody was protecting them  or , at least , protecting secrets deemed central to our national security .
It is going to be hard , however , for the NatComTAUUS to conduct a complete whitewash as long as Americans have access to the foreign press .
Although our own media has yet to cover the most recent revelations about the crucial period leading up to 9/11 , German and British reporters have uncovered the extent to which the hijackers were closely monitored by the Mossad during their sojourn in the U.S. Die Zeit , a respected German weekly , and the BBC , among others , have carried the story .
I reported all this in a previous column that I will not repeat here except to say this :
Israeli agents , picked up by the U.S. authorities in the weeks prior to and after 9/11 , lived " Next Door to Mohammed Atta , " as the headline in Die Zeit put it , and had them under surveillance 24/7 :
" Not until after the attacks of September 11 did the consequences of the spy ring become clear .
Apparently the agents were not interested in military or industrial facilities , but were shadowing a number of suspects , who were later involved in the terrorist attacks against the US .
According to a report of the French intelligence agency that Die Zeit examined , " according to the FBI , Arab terrorists and suspected terror cells lived in Phoenix , Arizona , as well as in Miami and Hollywood , Florida from December 2000 to April 2001 in direct proximity to the Israeli spy cells . "
The Israelis have an alibi .
They say they warned us  but that was n’t until August , and even then the warning was nonspecific .
They also handed over a list of 19 suspected terrorists , Atta and his associates , but this somehow never made it into the right hands until it was too late .
What did they know , and when did they know it ?
Will the NatComTAUUS even attempt to answer this question ?
Absolutely not .
Our government is committed to the lie that this is all an " urban myth , " and that any implication of Israeli foreknowledge of 9/11 is " anti-Semitism " akin to the frenetic ravings of the " poet " Amiri Baraka .
Political correctness demands that any examination of Israel ’s role in an event that gave it tremendous political and diplomatic leverage is impermissible .
And it sure helps to have clowns like Baraka around to delegitimize an impartial fact - oriented inquiry .
We ’ve been covering the story of the Israeli - 9/11 connection since November of last year , and I have watched it snowball from a mere suspicion on my part , at first , into a near - certainty as the evidence accumulated .
For the past year , you ’ve read about it , not only in this space , but in the " mainstream " outlets that investigated the Israeli " art student " spy operation , and eventually uncovered its strange synchronicity with the Islamist terrorist apparatus that executed the 9/11 attacks .
I ’m proud that Antiwar.com played a catalytic role in giving the pioneering efforts of Carl Cameron , of Fox News , Christopher Ketcham , and John Sugg , among others , a much wider circulation , and now it ’s time to push it even further .
What is needed is a grassroots movement to demand that the aforementioned commission take up the question of Israel ’s role in 9/11 .
Not that a commission controlled by the political parties will ever agree to any such demand  but agitation around this issue will underscore what ’s wrong with the commission .
The fix is in , and the truth will not even be approached by this claque of political appointees in spite of purported closed testimony before a committee of Congress detailing Mossad activities in this country related to the 9/11 investigation .
But why not ?
The power of the Israeli lobby , while considerable , could hardly quash conclusive evidence that the Israelis knew key details of the 9/11 plot in advance and somehow neglected to tell us .
Somebody high up is covering his ass , and , while this is admittedly speculation , the following theory fits into the known facts .
If we assume that American intelligence and federal law enforcement agents really did obey strictures against domestic spying  a huge assumption  as they aver , then it is logical to assume they would try to figure out some way around it .
What better way than to subcontract out to the Israelis ?
After all , what are friends for , anyway : a little mutual back - scratching is nothing between those who enjoy a " special relationship . "
The problem is , maybe the subcontractors did n’t follow their contract to the letter , and might have even had their own agenda  one that did n’t necessarily coincide with the best interests and safety of the United States .
What started out as a routine effort by government officials to get around the barriers imposed by legislated guidelines ended up as the biggest intelligence failure in American history  and , by the way , a turning point in that history .
The 9/11 attacks unleashed a wave of hatred against any and all Muslims that had the effect of aligning the U.S. with Israel against the entire Arab world .
The U.S. is now moving to do in the Middle East at large what the Israelis have done in miniature in the West Bank and Gaza .
The conquest and occupation of Iraq will soon be followed by other wars of " liberation . "
The overthrow of the regional governments , one by one , will either be engineered by a " revolution " in the Panamanian tradition ( i.e. one bought and paid for by the U.S. ) or , in the event of a shortage of suitable Quislings , achieved by outright conquest and subsequent occupation .
These wars will last until a vast MacArthur Regency is established by American force of arms , from Cairo to Kabul , and southward to Yemen , and the oil - rich fields of the Saudi peninsula .
And all of this will have been achieved on the momentum of a single , seminal event : the fury unleashed by 9/11 , having leveled the Arab world , may not be assuaged even then .
There is only one sure way to demolish the War Party , which has been in the ascendant since 9/11 , and that is to demythologize what happened that day .
According to the soon - to - be - official story , a bunch of really evil guys , who hated America for stuff like strip clubs , drunkenness , and prostitution , lived among us for years , completely undetected  and then , suddenly , out of the blue , ka -boom !
The World Trade Center and the Pentagon are reduced to cinders .
The Devil made them do it .
But who watched them do it ?
My new book , due out from Verso Books next year , blows the lid off this explosive story , and if you thought the intensity of the recent barrage of attacks on Antiwar.com and this author was surprising , then just wait until that little volume comes out .
In the newest fount of neoconservative vituperations , the Sunday section of the Boston Globe , Ronald Radosh proclaimed yours truly the evil mastermind behind the rise of a " red- brown " alliance against the Iraq war .
WorldNutDaily has been frothing at the mouth about us lately , but they ’re not as coherent ( or as vicious ) as Radosh , who made a special point of noting :
" As for Israel , last week Raimondo continued to proclaim the myth that ‘ Israel had foreknowledge of 9/11 , ’ a claim that puts his Web site in league with the most extreme anti-Semitic canards coming from the Arab world , not to mention the poetry of Amiri Baraka . "
Is Carl Cameron merely echoing the " poetry " of Baraka ?
Is pro-Israel pro-war Fox News , the broadcast voice of the conservative wing of the GOP , " in league with the most extreme anti-Semitic canards coming from the Arab world " ?
Salon , Le Monde , Jane ’s Intelligence , the wire services , Der Spiegel , Die Zeit , the BBC  all are in on a Vast Anti-Semitic Conspiracy , spreading " canards " in the clever guise of news stories appearing in the mainstream media .
Is this what we are supposed to believe ?
The intensity of the recent attacks  see this smear job by the wild and crazy Stephen Schwartz , a.k.a.
Suleyman Amad , a.k.a.
" Comrade Sandalio " means we ’re hitting our enemies where it hurts .
It ’s nice to be hated by the other side , but it ’s also important to be loved by your friends .
And that ’s where you come in .
The War Party is amply funded , of that you can be sure : all you have to do is take a gander at the tremendous resources made available to just one of our neoconservative detractors , and you can see what we ’re up against .
The recently - formed " Committee for the Liberation of Iraq " is being sponsored by the very same people who pushed for the creation of this phony 9/11 commission : Senators McCain and Lieberman .
And you can bet the Committee , as a quasi - governmental organization , will have considerable resources at its disposal .
They wo n’t have to worry about their phone bill .
But we do .
Our last fundraising appeal garnered some $ 15,000  a large sum , on such short notice , but not enough to get us through the end of the year .
Unless we raise another $ 15,000 in rather short order , we ’ll have to start cutting back our operations by almost half .
It is n’t going to be pretty .
So here ’s the deal .
Every contribution of $ 250 and over by December 1 will get you an autographed copy of my forthcoming book , The Terror Enigma : 9/11 and the Israeli Connection , before it even hits bookstores outside the United Kingdom .
This book is going to knock the socks off the myth of 9/11 .
It has the potential to act as a catalyst , radically re-orienting our view of 9/11  and ultimately leading to a re-thinking of the American response .
Antiwar.com had a hand in breaking this important story .
Just as we led the fight against the lies put out by the Clintonian wing of the War Party during the Kosovo campaign , so we carry on the fight against the Bush wing today .
We are reaching millions of readers around the world with our message of a peaceful noninterventionist foreign policy as the American ideal , and you do n’t want us to stop  or even slow down  now .
As the U.S. stands on the brink of the greatest foreign policy disaster ever to befall this country  as we aspire to the role of world hegemon  now is the time for our supporters to come through .
Imagine a world without Antiwar.com , and then  quick !
 click here to contribute .
Remember : we have precious little time to reach our goal of $ 15,000 .
Inside of a little over a month , the lights could begin to go out .
 while , over in the posh Washington headquarters of the Committee for the " Liberation " of Iraq ’s Assets , the lights will be burning late into the night .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has reopened a significant lead over Hillary Clinton among national Democrats and now leads by a 51 % to 42 % margin , according to Gallup Poll Daily tracking from May 14 - 16 .
Obama 's current nine percentage point lead is based on a strong showing for the Illinois senator in Gallup 's Friday night interviewing .
For the past few days , news coverage of Election 2008 has been dominated by the back and forth between Obama and the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain regarding various comments and positions on dealing with Iran and Hamas in the Middle East , and attempts by Obama to underscore the link between McCain and President Bush .
Also implicit in this news coverage has been the assumption that Obama will be the Democratic nominee , with much less news coverage of Clinton -- despite the fact that she continues to campaign against Obama as Tuesday 's primary voting in Kentucky and Oregon approaches .
Some news accounts suggest that Obama may " declare victory " after the voting next Tuesday .
Both Obama 's strong attacks on McCain and the Bush administration and the fact that Clinton has in some ways been shoved aside in news coverage of the campaign may have contributed to Obama 's strong performance among Democrats in Gallup Poll Daily tracking on Friday night .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 2 , 2008 , click here . )
Meanwhile , the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking data on the national election , from May 12 - 16 , finds McCain remaining slightly ahead of Obama , 47 % to 44 % , among registered voters , while Clinton -- despite the widespread assumption that she will not be the Democratic nominee -- is doing better than Obama against McCain , with a slight 2 - point advantage over the Arizona senator , 47 % to 45 % .
-- Frank Newport
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from May 14 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,237 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from May 12 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,385 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

ZOMG !
CNN let people other than Republicans ask questions during the debate last night !
And some of them have even declared support for DHIMMOCRATS !
Take it away , Michelle :
Update : More plant excavation … Abortion questioner is a declared Edwards ’ supporter … and the Log Cabin Republican questioner is a declared Obama supporter …and lead toy questioner is a union activist for the John Edwards - endorsing United Steelworkers .
Oh NOES !!!!!!!
Despite earlier stating that “ the questions were almost all coherent and well - framed , ” we now have a full fledged SCANDAL because not everyone who asked a question at the debate had taken the Virginia GOP Loyalty Oath !
Seriously - I ca n’t even parody these lunatics anymore .
I ’ll just leave you with this - it sure is fun watching the group that excoriated Hillary Clinton for planting friendly questioners in her appearances COMPLETELY freak out because CNN refused to make sure all the questioners in the debate last night were friendly to Republicans .
Although , if you think about it , I guess they have to bitch about the media .
We all saw their candidates last night .
I would n’t want to talk about them this morning , either .
It makes complete sense that they have worked themselves into a lather about this latest “ scandal . ”

And yes , this is the same Michelle Malkin who just the other day wrote the following ( without a hint of self - awareness ) :
If it is n’t cartoons or Western fast - food joints or Valentine ’s day cards or beauty pageants or books or speeches or Playboy magazines or soccer balls that have the Religion of Perpetual Outrage up in arms , it ’s something else .
It ’s always something .
You can never assuage the unassuageable .
You can never anticipate what pretext they ’ll use next to claim “ insult ” and demand submission .
Today , it ’s teddy bears .
Yes , teddy bears .
From here on out , Michelle Malkin will be known as “ Our Lady of Perpetual Outrage . ”
Think of her as a wingnut goddess .
MIT scientists have found a new way that DNA can carry out its work that is about as surprising as discovering that a mold used to cast a metal tool can also serve as a tool itself , with two complementary shapes each showing distinct functional roles .
Professor Manolis Kellis and postdoctoral research fellow Alexander Stark report in the Jan. 1 issue of the journal Genes & Development that in certain DNA sequences , both strands of a DNA segment can perform useful functions , each encoding a distinct molecule that helps control cell functions .
DNA works by complementarity : paired DNA strands serve as a template for each other during DNA replication , and ordinarily only a single DNA strand serves as a template to produce RNA strands , which then go on to produce proteins .
The process is similar to the way each bump or dent in a mold is paired with a corresponding dent or bump in the resulting molded object .
While many RNAs are eventually translated into proteins with specific functions , some RNA molecules instead act directly , carrying out roles inside the cell .
Certain RNA genes , known as microRNAs , have been shown to play important regulatory roles in the cell , often coordinating important events during the development of the embryo .
These microRNAs fold into relatively simple hairpin structures , with two stretches of near - perfect complementary sequence folding back onto each other .
One of the two " arms " of a hairpin is then processed into a mature microRNA .
The surprising discovery is that for some microRNA genes , both DNA strands , instead of just one , encode RNA , and both resulting microRNAs fold into hairpins that are processed into mature microRNAs .
In other words , both the tool and its mold appear to be functional .
Kellis and Stark found two such microRNA pairs in the fruit fly , and eight more such pairs in the mouse .
The idea that there could be such dual - function strands , where both DNA strands encode functional RNA products , " had never even been hypothesized , " Kellis says .
But follow - up work confirmed that they did indeed function in this way .
The work suggests that other such unexpected pairings , with both DNA strands encoding important functions , may also exist in a variety of species .
This discovery builds on a similar , earlier surprising finding about microRNA regulation .
In December , Stark and Kellis reported that both arms of a single microRNA hairpin can also produce distinct , functional microRNAs , with distinct targets .
Together , these two findings suggest that a single gene can encode as many as four different functions -- one hairpin from each of the two DNA strands , and then one microRNA from each of the two arms of each hairpin .
These recent papers are the latest example of the power of using computational tools to investigate the genomes of multiple species , known as comparative genomics .
The Kellis group has used this approach to discover protein - coding genes , RNAs , microRNAs , regulatory motifs , and targets of individual regulators in diverse organisms ranging from yeast and fruit flies to mice and humans .
" This represents a new phase in genomics - making biological discoveries sitting not at the lab bench , but at the computer terminal , " Kellis says .
Kellis is the Karl Van Tassel Career Development Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and an associate member of the Broad Institute .
He grew up in Greece and France , earned his B.S. , M.Eng. and Ph.D. from MIT , and was appointed to the faculty in 2004 .
At 30 , he has already earned numerous awards and accolades , including a place on the list of the 35 top innovators under 35 by Technology Review magazine in 2006 .
Kellis ' work is supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
Alexander Stark is supported by a Human Frontier Science Program fellowship .
On April 27 , 2007 , Estonia was attacked in cyberspace .
Following a diplomatic incident with Russia about the relocation of a Soviet World War II memorial , the networks of many Estonian organizations , including the Estonian parliament , banks , ministries , newspapers and broadcasters , were attacked and – in many cases – shut down .
Estonia was quick to blame Russia , which was equally quick to deny any involvement .
It was hyped as the first cyberwar : Russia attacking Estonia in cyberspace .
But nearly a year later , evidence that the Russian government was involved in the denial - of - service attacks still has n't emerged .
Though Russian hackers were indisputably the major instigators of the attack , the only individuals positively identified have been young ethnic Russians living inside Estonia , who were pissed off over the statue incident .
You know you 've got a problem when you can't tell a hostile attack by another nation from bored kids with an axe to grind .
Separating cyberwar , cyberterrorism and cybercrime is n't easy ; these days you need a scorecard to tell the difference .
It 's not just that it ’s hard to trace people in cyberspace , it 's that military and civilian attacks – and defenses – look the same .
The traditional term for technology the military shares with civilians is " dual use . "
Unlike hand grenades and tanks and missile targeting systems , dual - use technologies have both military and civilian applications .
Dual - use technologies used to be exceptions ; even things you 'd expect to be dual use , like radar systems and toilets , were designed differently for the military .
But today , almost all information technology is dual use .
We both use the same operating systems , the same networking protocols , the same applications , and even the same security software .
And attack technologies are the same .
The recent spurt of targeted hacks against U.S. military networks , commonly attributed to China , exploit the same vulnerabilities and use the same techniques as criminal attacks against corporate networks .
Internet worms make the jump to physically - separate classified military networks in less than 24 hours , even if those networks are physically separate .
The Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command uses the same tools against the same threats as any large corporation .
Because attackers and defenders use the same IT technology , there is a fundamental tension between cyberattack and cyberdefense .
The National Security Agency has referred to this as the " equities issue , " and it can be summarized as follows :
When a military discovers a vulnerability in a dual - use technology , they can do one of two things .
They can alert the manufacturer and fix the vulnerability , thereby protecting both the good guys and the bad guys .
Or they can keep quiet about the vulnerability and not tell anyone , thereby leaving the good guys insecure but also leaving the bad guys insecure .
The equities issue has long been hotly debated inside the NSA .
Basically , the NSA has two roles : eavesdrop on their stuff , and protect our stuff .
When both sides use the same stuff , the agency has to decide whether to exploit vulnerabilities to eavesdrop on their stuff or close the same vulnerabilities to protect our stuff .
In the 1980s and before , the tendency of the NSA was to keep vulnerabilities to themselves .
In the 1990s , the tide shifted , and the NSA was starting to open up and help us all improve our security defense .
But after the attacks of 9/11 , the NSA shifted back to the attack : vulnerabilities were to be hoarded in secret .
Slowly , things in the U.S. are shifting back again .
So now we 're seeing the NSA help secure Windows Vista and releasing their own version of Linux .
The DHS , meanwhile , is funding a project to secure popular open source software packages , and across the Atlantic the UK ’s GCHQ is finding bugs in PGPDisk and reporting them back to the company .
( NSA is rumored to be doing the same thing with BitLocker . )
I 'm in favor of this trend , because my security improves for free .
Whenever the NSA finds a security problem and gets the vendor to fix it , our security gets better .
It 's a side - benefit of dual - use technologies .
But I want governments to do more .
I want them to use their buying power to improve my security .
I want them to offer countrywide contracts for software , both security and non-security , that have explicit security requirements .
If these contracts are big enough , companies will work to modify their products to meet those requirements .
And again , we all benefit from the security improvements .
The only example of this model I know about is a U.S. government - wide procurement competition for full - disk encryption , but this can certainly be done with firewalls , intrusion detection systems , databases , networking hardware , even operating systems .
When it comes to IT technologies , the equities issue should be a no - brainer .
The good uses of our common hardware , software , operating systems , network protocols , and everything else vastly outweigh the bad uses .
It 's time that the government used its immense knowledge and experience , as well as its buying power , to improve cybersecurity for all of us .

DALLAS  Jaime Pacheco rolled out of bed at dawn last week to the blaring chorus of two alarms .
Then Jaime , a 15 - year - old high school freshman , smoothed his striped comforter , dumped two scoops of kibble for the dogs out back and strapped a G.P.S. monitor to his belt .
By 7:15 , Jaime was in the passenger seat of his grandmother ’s sport- utility vehicle , holding the little black monitor out the window for the satellite to register .
A few miles down the road , at Bryan Adams High School in East Dallas , he got out of the car , said goodbye to his grandmother and paused to press a button on the unit three times .
A green light flashed , and then Jaime headed for the cafeteria with plenty of time before the morning bell .
It was not always like this .
Jaime used to snooze until 2 p.m. before strolling into school .
He fell so far behind that he is failing most of his classes and school officials sent him to truancy court .
Instead of juvenile detention , Jaime was selected by a judge to be enrolled in a pilot program at Bryan Adams in which chronically truant students are monitored electronically .
Since Jaime started carrying the Global Positioning System unit April 1 , he has had perfect attendance .

New York , May 1 , 2008
–The Committee to Protect Journalists welcomes the release today of an Al - Jazeera cameraman who was held for six years without charge or trial at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Al - Jazeera reported late this afternoon that Sami al - Haj had been freed and was on a plane that was expected to land in Khartoum , Sudan , tonight .
The Pentagon had no immediate comment .
“ Sami al - Haj is the latest journalist to be freed by the U.S. military after spending years behind bars on the basis of secret evidence and without formal charge or trial , ” said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon .
“ We are delighted that Sami al - Haj can finally be reunited with his family and friends .
But his detention for six years , without the most basic due process , is a grave injustice and represents a threat to all journalists working in conflict areas . ”
Al - Haj , who is Sudanese , is the second journalist to be freed by the U.S. military in the last month after being held for a prolonged period without due process .
On April 16 , Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein was released from U.S. custody in Iraq , ending a two - year ordeal in which he fended off unsubstantiated accusations from the U.S. military that he had collaborated with Iraqi insurgents .
All told , 10 journalists have been held for extended periods by the U.S. military and then released without charge .
The U.S. military continues to hold Jawed Ahmad , a journalist for Canada ’s CTV , at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
Ahmad has been held without charge since October 26 , 2007 , according to CTV .
“ Jawed Ahmad should be charged or released immediately , ” Simon added .
Al - Haj , 38 , was detained in December 2001 by Pakistani forces along the Afghan - Pakistani border while covering the U.S. led - offensive to unseat the Taliban .
He was later transported by the U.S. military to Guantanamo Bay in June 2002 .
He began a hunger strike in January 2007 to protest his continued incarceration .
The only confirmed journalist held at Guantanamo , al - Haj was never charged with a crime and he never faced trial .
U.S. military authorities accused him of working as a financial courier for armed groups and assisting al - Qaeda and extremist figures .
Al - Haj ’s attorney , Clive Stafford Smith , called the accusations baseless and said that his client has committed no crime .
Stafford Smith said that al - Haj ’s detention was political and that U.S. interrogators focused almost exclusively on obtaining intelligence on Al - Jazeera and its staff .
At one point , he said , military officials told al - Haj that he would be released if he agreed to inform U.S. intelligence authorities about the satellite network ’s activities .
Al - Haj refused , he said .
In October 2006 , CPJ highlighted al - Haj ’s plight in a special report titled “ The Enemy ? “
New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s ambitious proposal to charge motorists $ 8 to enter Lower Manhattan on weekdays appeared to be all but dead after state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver announced Monday that his house would not put the measure to a vote .
For days last week , the Assembly ’s Democratic conference debated Bloomberg ’s proposal in secret .
On Monday , Silver announced that an “ overwhelming majority ” of his party members opposed the plan .
“ The congestion - pricing bill did not have anywhere near a majority of the Democratic conference and will not be on the floor of the Assembly , ” Silver said .
He has refused to offer a precise count of yes and no votes , but estimated that fewer than 25 Democratic members backed the plan .

Bloomberg lashed out at the Assembly after the announcement .
“ It takes a special type of cowardice for elected officials to refuse to stand up and vote their conscience , ” he said .
“ Every New Yorker has a right to know if the person they send to Albany was for or against better transit and cleaner air . ”
Congestion - pricing supporter Assemblyman Jim Tedisco , a Schenectady Republican , rued the fact that New York City would forgo a $ 354 - million federal grant it was slated to receive if the plan had passed .
“ We ’re going to lose that opportunity , ” he said .
“ It could be once in a lifetime . ”
The Senate did not vote on the plan , but Majority Leader Joseph Bruno , also a supporter , said his house was “ prepared to bring it to the floor if it served any meaningful purpose . ”

Another frustrated supporter was Gov. David A. Paterson .
“ Now we need to come up with innovative approaches to the challenge of funding mass transit , ” he said in a statement .
“ I will be working closely with my colleagues in the Legislature and experts both in and outside of government to arrive at such solutions . ”
In the Senate , observers doubted Bruno would have been able to muster enough votes to pass the plan .
He needed some votes from the Democratic minority conference , which is upset at Bloomberg ’s lavish support of Senate GOP campaigns .
Still , activists who backed the mayor ’s plan say they are not giving up .
“ This problem will only get worse as the city grows , ” said Kathryn Wylde of the advocacy group Partnership for New York City .
Supporters challenged opponents of the plan to find another way to fund improvements to New York ’s beleaguered subway system and strained bus service .

“ When people complain there are not enough trains and buses , you can point to all the state Assembly members , ” said Councilman Robert Jackson , a Manhattan Democrat .
“ It was right at their doorstep and they did not stand up for New York City . ”
Opponents such as Councilmen David Weprin and Lewis Fidler said the $ 8 entrance fee into bustling parts of Manhattan would have been an unjust tax .
“ It seems unfair that a small number of middle - class people and small businesses would be taxed to pay for the entire system , ” Weprin said .
Fidler said he hoped the mayor “ got the message ” that the rich should n’t be the only ones allowed to travel to Manhattan .
Council Speaker Christine Quinn , a chief supporter , expressed disappointment .
She called the Assembly ’s failure to act a setback , but said the council was committed to “ environmental responsibility and to improving and expanding our mass transit system . ”

Quinn also called for forward - looking coalitions to work together to reduce chronic gridlock and improve air quality .
Even some opponents of Bloomberg ’s plan agreed , saying the debates about it overshadowed any positive talks about alternatives .

Hopefully , many people will take the time over the weekend toview it .
There are no words to describe the complete and total rot and corruption inWashington , DC .
In the train wreck of Eliot Spitzer 's political career , there are many workplace lessons .
And lots of people are talking about Spitzer 's career .
But what about the call girl ?
Ashley Dupre , who was Kristen in bed , was no slouch in the career management department .
Sure , her breasts are plastered all over the Internet , but do n't be so ignorant as to think you can't learn from someone like her .
Here are three lessons .
1. Invest money in your career .
I write a lot about how when you do n't have disposable income , you still need to spend money on your career so you can earn more money .
I have paid for career coaching with my last dollar .
I have bought clothes on credit to look like I belong in the position I was interviewing for .
All good investments .
But when I wrote about how I got my teeth whitened for TV even though I was unemployed , so many money mavens complained to me that it was irresponsible spending .
People constantly undervalue the return on investment you get from taking risks to invest in your own career .
So , Ashley goes to New York with basically no money , and the first big money she makes , what does she do with it ?
Breast implants !
How smart of her !
The implants cost about $ 3000 , but after that , she can make $ 4000 an hour from guys like Spitzer .
She made back her investment in an hour , everything else is profit .
2 . Know what you are really selling .
You know why most people have terrible resumes ?
They can't figure out what they really bring to the table .
If you really know what you are selling , then most of your resume is not going to be relevant .
But people get mixed up about what they are selling .
And they start just selling what they think they should be selling that second instead of analyzing the situation .
So Ashley figured out that she was having sex with the Governor of New York .
In fact , a few women in her prostitution ring knew .
They could have sold their story to the New York Post , but you know what ?
They make more money as call girls .
It 's not uncommon for a call girl to bring in $ 200,000 a year , and the perks are great — trips to Paris with billionaires , for example .
Once a call girl tells on a client , her career is over .
Because , as Melissa Gira Grant points out , call girls are n't selling sex , they are selling discretion .
Of course a guy like Spitzer could get a mistress , no problem .
He 's not great looking , but being the Governor of New York makes up for that .
But the mistress is dangerous — she could talk .
In a call girl , you buy discretion .
3 . If you have two careers , make sure they have synergy .
A lot of people have two careers .
It 's a way to earn money and do what you love .
It 's a way to hedge your bets .
It 's just that you need two careers that somehow make sense together .
If you want to be a lawyer , side work as a hooker is not a good idea .
But Dupre wants to be a singer .
And it 's expensive to live in New York to build a singing career .
So the hooker / singer combination is a decent idea just on that alone .
But look at the synergy after the Spitzer fallout : everyone goes to her MySpace page to see what she looks like , and then they notice she has music .
More than four million people have heard her singing .
And at this point , she 's earned $ 200,000 in a month from downloads .
So look , it 's not great that Dupre is stuck in court right now .
But she did a lot of things right when it came to her career , and to be honest , Spitzer 's political aspirations will tank from the call - girl - brouhaha .
But Dupre 's dreams of a singing career will probably be fine .
If she had any talent to begin with .

The figurine was found 15 metres below ground
The object , which is around six centimetres in length , is shaped like a human figure , with grooves that suggest a neck , arms and legs .
On its surface are flakes of a red substance that could be remnants of paint .
The object was found 15 metres below the eroded surface of a terrace on the north bank of the River Draa near the town of Tan - Tan .
It was reportedly lying just a few centimetres away from stone handaxes in ground layers dating to the Middle Acheulian period , which lasted from 500,000 to 300,000 years ago .
Cultural controversy
The find is likely to further fuel a vociferous debate over the timing of humanity 's discovery of symbolism .
Hominids such as Homo heidelbergensis and Homo erectus , that were alive during the Acheulian period , are not thought to have been capable of the symbolic thought needed to create art .
Writing in the journal Current Anthropology , Robert Bednarik , president of the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations ( IFRAO ) , suggests that the overall shape of the Tan - Tan object was fashioned by natural processes .
But he argues that conspicuous grooves on the surface of the stone , which appear to emphasise its humanlike appearance , are partially man-made .
Mr Bednarik claims that some of these grooves were made by repeated battering with a stone tool to connect up natural depressions in the rock .
Handaxes were found close to the figurine
" It has some modifications , but they are more than modifications , " Mr Bednarik told BBC News Online .
Mr Bednarik tried to replicate the markings on a similar piece of rock by hitting a stone flake with a " hammerstone " in the manner of a punch .
He then compared the microscopic structure of the fractures with those of the Tan - Tan object .
Sceptic 's view
However , Professor Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , US , said he saw no evidence for tool marks and that , although the figure was evocative , it was most likely the result of " fortuitous natural weathering " .
" [ Mr Bednarik ] has effectively presented all the information necessary to show this is a naturally weathered rock , " Professor Ambrose told BBC News Online .
Professor Ambrose points to Mr Bednarik 's observation that some rocks in the vicinity of the figure were weathered and even rounded from transport by water .
Professor Ambrose believes that rocks and artefacts found at the site could have been disturbed by flowing water in the past .
Mr Bednarik also observes that flecks of a greasy substance containing iron and manganese on the surface of the stone could be red ochre , a substance used as paint by later humans .
" They [ the specks ] do not resemble corroded natural iron deposits , nor has any trace of this pigment been detected on any of the other objects I have examined from Tan - Tan , " writes Mr Bednarik in his paper .
A 200,000 - 300,000 - year - old stone object found at Berekhat Ram in Israel in 1986 has also been the subject of claims that it is a figurine .
However , several other researchers later presented evidence to show that it was probably shaped by geological processes .
The Tan - Tan object was discovered in 1999 , during a dig directed by Lutz Fiedler , the state archaeologist of Hesse in Germany .
Monks clashed with security forces at Sera monastery on Wednesday
We knew something was happening because there were more road checks as we got into Lhasa .
Cars were being stopped and police were writing the licence plates down .
We tried to stop at a shrine outside Lhasa but were told to keep moving .
Then we heard around Wednesday lunchtime that Drepung monastery was closed .
We did n't know why .
That afternoon we went to Sera monastery to see the debating .
It 's famous - the monks debate points of philosophy and people come to see it .
Just when it was about to start , around three o'clock , we started to hear rounds of applause coming out of a courtyard in the heart of the temple .
They were grabbing monks , kicking and beating them
We thought the debate was starting but then suddenly the clapping reached a crescendo - kind of a hooting .
Then the gate of the debating compound opened and this stream of maroon humanity poured out , several hundred monks .
It was impossible to count but I think there were at least 300 .
We thought it was part of the tradition but when you looked at the expression on their faces , it was a very serious business .
They were pumping their hands in the air as they ran out of the temple .
Plain - clothes police
The minute that happened we saw the police - two or three who were inside the compound - suddenly speaking into their radios .
They started going after the monks , and plain - clothes police - I do n't know this for sure but that 's what I think they were - started to emerged from nowhere .
There were four or five in uniform but another 10 or 15 in regular clothing .
They were grabbing monks , kicking and beating them .
If we had gone to Sera monastery an hour earlier or an hour later , no - one would have known what these monks had done
One monk was kicked in the stomach right in front of us and then beaten on the ground .
The monks were not attacking the soldiers , there was no melee .
They were heading out in a stream , it was a very clear path , and the police were attacking them at the sides .
It was gratuitous violence .
The Tibetan lay - people started rushing to get out of the temple .
Tibetan grandmothers were grabbing young kids and getting them out .
We were left behind when the monks left the temple .
About 20 minutes later we felt as if we could leave .
Riot police
Outside the monastery the road curved to the left and to the right .
We were directed left - but when we looked to the right there was a line of riot police with batons and helmets blocking off the street .
The monks were sitting in neat rows on the ground , surrounded by a phalanx of police .
It was a very clear show of force - there were maybe as many as 300 riot police and regular police there .
It could have been civil disobedience , but it looked like the monks had been put there .
They were n't moving .
As we turned left , we saw troop carriers with camouflaged army regulars arriving - those green trucks with soldiers in the back on benches .
We saw guns , large guns that looked like automatic weapons .
There were two or three of those trucks as well as others - several units of public order personnel swarming the situation .
As we left , all the roads around the monastery were blocked by police .
There was no access .
At the time , all the phones were dead - we were trying to call the hotel but none of the cell phones were working .
But within an hour the phone service was back on .
It seemed as if within half an hour the thing had been totally brought under control .
Back in Lhasa , it was eerily normal .
There were police around but not really a muscular presence .
It seemed to have been a massive localised show of force .
We realised that if we had gone to Sera monastery an hour earlier or an hour later , no - one would have known what these monks had done .
Snakes alive !
Father discovers his son's ' toy ' snake is real
Scary : Leonard with a genuine
toy snake
Ever since he was given a toy snake , four - year - old Leonard Yip has used it to strike fear into his family .
So when his father Mark saw a 3ft creature wriggling around his front room , he assumed Leonard was on the end of it .
Then he realised his son was at school - and the snake was moving on its own .
At this point a terrified Mr Yip did what most red- blooded men would do .
He slammed the door and yelled for his wife , Cindy .
She raised the alarm with the local council , who sent a dog warden to capture the intruder .
It was confirmed that the reptile was an albino Californian king snake , a non-venomous constrictor which is believed to have escaped or been abandoned by a neighbour of the family in Paignton , Devon .
Having confirmed that it was harmless to humans , 44 - year - old Mr Yip bravely handled it before it was taken away .
It is now being looked after at a pet shop until someone comes forward to claim it .
The incident happened when Mr Yip , who owns a noodle bar in the resort , returned home to get a sun hat for his six - year - old daughter Ellie and spotted the snake .

Dangerous toy : Mark Yip with the King snake that he found his son playing with
' He thought it was Leonard 's toy snake but then it started to move and he realised it was real , ' said Mrs Yip .
' Leonard loves his snake .
I bought it for him as a present and he 's always using it to scare us .
' Mark 's braver than me but when he realised what he thought was a toy snake was a real one he got a big shock . '
The reptile was taken away by Torbay Council dog warden Janice Pope .
She already owns a corn snake , which is a similar species , and planned to take the new find home to keep in her spare tank .
But when she called at a pet shop for extra supplies , manager Tim Morris offered to take it in .
Mr Morris , who runs Preston Pets and Reptiles , believes the snake must have been out of its vivarium for ' a good few weeks ' .
He said : ' It is in an awful state .
It has been drinking water for about half an hour . '
The snake was also covered in a sticky black substance which must have been there since the last time it shed its skin , which could have been months ago .
Mr Morris added : ' If they do n't eat their stomachs can shrink so I have just defrosted two medium mice for this one . '
King snakes are popular with first - time reptile owners because they are relatively easy to keep .
In the wild , they eat mice , lizards and birds , and are totally or partially immune to the venom of rattlesnakes .
This means they can kill and eat them , which has made them favoured as family pets in the U.S .
They kill their prey by grabbing them with their small teeth and smothering them .
King snakes can live for 15 years and go for two weeks without water and six months without food .
They come in many colours , including chocolate , yellow and black as well as albino .
Having recovered from her shock , Mrs Yip now hopes the incident will have a positive effect .
She said : ' In Chinese tradition we believe if a white snake comes into your house it will bring you good luck , so we hope it will . '

Storyteller Jeff Greenwald has some ' strange suggestions '
Departures
It was my first morning back in the office after the experience of a lifetime : a seven - month journey around the world .
" So , " asked a co-worker , " how was the trip ? "
" Amazing , " I said .
" I ... "
" Wonderful , great , glad to hear it , " he interrupted .
" Hey , did you hear Thompson 's moving to the copy desk ? "
To steal a line from the late , great Erma Bombeck :
No one wants to hear your travel stories .
Not your parents , who gave you life .
Not your kids , who are insecure and need your approval .
Not your priest , minister or rabbi , who are paid to be kind and forgiving .
Not even someone whose life you saved in the war and who owes you big .
One reason , I suspect , is that most travelers are really , really bad at telling stories .
What they inflict on their audiences are often just itineraries with verbs : " ... then we went to the Louvre ; then we went to the Eiffel Tower ; then we went to Café Flores and had hot chocolate ... "
It does n't have to be this way .
With some conscious effort and a little practice , we can learn to spin yarns that wo n't glaze the eyes of our listeners .
For advice I turned to the best storyteller I know , Jeff Greenwald .
People actually pay to hear his travel tales .
A prolific traveler and writer , Greenwald captivates audiences with his unique stage performance , " Strange Travel Suggestions . "
( The title comes from a line by Kurt Vonnegut : " Strange travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God . " )
In the show , audience members are invited to spin a big wheel covered with hieroglyphic - like symbols for 30 topics , ranging from " The Kindness of Strangers " to " Meals of Misfortune " to " Creature Karma . "
Each stop on the wheel triggers an improvised and usually hilarious monologue culled from a lifetime of trotting the globe .
( For details on " Strange Travel Suggestions , " see box . )
Greenwald is a confident and accomplished stage performer , but the rest of us can learn from his storytelling techniques .
I asked him for some tips , and this is what he told me :
" Everyone loves to hear a good story .
This has been true ever since humans began to sit around the fire and recount their adventures on the way to the watering hole .
" People generally want to hear travel stories if there 's something in the tale they can identify with - an episode ( like a stolen passport , cultural faux - pas or transportation nightmare ) , a severe physical trial ( food poisoning ) or a surprising encounter that changed their minds about a place or culture .
" The secret of a good story , of any story , can be summed up in three words : beginning , middle , end .
A story , as opposed to an anecdote , has a dramatic arc :
There 's a set - up , a situation and a resolution .
" The more satisfying the resolution , the better the story .
It 's kind of like telling a joke , in that timing is almost as important as content .
" One of my favorite stories from ' Strange Travel Suggestions ' took place in Iran , during my visit for the total solar eclipse in 1999 .
Just before the eclipse , I was standing in a huge public square in Esfahan .
Suddenly , a very small anti-American demonstration erupted nearby .
To my astonishment , every Iranian within sight of me - men , women and children - stood up and formed a circle around me , protecting me from any possible danger .
My guardians mocked the demonstrator and assured me that no harm would come to me .
" But the payoff of the story comes when I return home , and my friends express relief that I survived my visit .
Despite all my wonderful experiences and encounters in Iran during the eclipse , the American news showed only close - ups of the flag - burning and demonstration .
It 's a poignant example of how narrow our view of other cultures can be , unless we make the effort to visit and interact with the people .
" In telling a story , little details provide a sense of place .
In Iran , for example , I talk about how the Women 's Mosque changes color as the sun disappears behind the moon , and how the locals use small mirrors to throw the image of the eclipsed sun - an Islamic crescent - onto nearby buildings .
" Humor , as always , is a great device - like when a gruff - looking Iranian man leans toward me , squeezes my shoulder , and says , ' You see those demonstrators ?
They should get a job !'
" People also love seeing touches of the familiar in exotic places : ' Star Trek ' T - shirts on Nepalese porters , Coca - Cola machines outside of Zen monasteries , Indian mystics interrupting their discourses to answer cell phones programmed with the ' Mission : Impossible ' theme .
" Exaggeration is certainly a part of storytelling , too .
It 's hard to avoid it .
During a story set in Calcutta , for example , I mention that it was 'a million degrees outside . '
It might have been a little cooler , but I could n't tell the difference .
" The main problem most storytellers have , ironically , is talking too fast , rushing to the point .
This illustrates the most important thing any storyteller should internalize and be aware of all the time .
No matter what you are doing when you 're talking to people - on the phone , at a party and especially on stage - you 're telling a story with your voice , cadence and comfort level .
If you 're nervous , you 're telling a story about being nervous .
If you 're bored , you 're telling a story about being bored .
" The most useful thing I ever learned about storytelling for an audience came from my close friend and mentor , the performer Nina Wise .
' Your interest and delight , ' she told me , ' will delight and interest your audience . '
" I try to keep this in my heart and mind during every show .
If I love my stories , and can take myself there during the telling , the audience comes with me - and it's as if we 're all traveling companions , embarking on these adventures together . "

John McCain does n't like John Hagee 's anti-Catholic views , but he loves his Israel policy , telling CNN , " I 'm grateful for his commitment to the support of the state of Israel , and I 'm very grateful for many of his commitments around the world , including to the independence and freedom of the state of Israel . "
Ben Smith wisely points out that the actual terms of Hagee 's support for Israel are that he thinks a strong hawkish stance will help lead to Israel 's destruction as it is covered beneath " a sea of human blood . "
And what about the Jews ?
The Jews , however , will survive the battle , Hagee says , long enough to have “ the opportunity to receive Messiah , who is a rabbi known to the world as Jesus of Nazareth . ”
So Hagee supports Israel , or he supports the destruction of Israel followed by a mass conversion episode and presumably the death of whichever Jews remain Jewish , and McCain specifically sites Hagee 's views on the Middle East as praiseworthy .
That does n't sound very good to me , but Hagee 's got the AIPAC good housekeeping seal so I suppose " sea of blood " is the new pro-Israel .

A UC Berkeley paper [ PDF ] recently submitted to the IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium manages to highlight two common and seemingly unrelated themes that have come up a number of times over the past few years in my reporting on the high - performance computing ( HPC ) space : 1 ) IBM's Cell is really good at HPC workloads when you invest the time to write custom code for it , and 2 ) Intel 's Xeon platform is perennially bandwidth starved and not very power - efficient .
The researchers used a common HPC benchmark apparently known primarily by its initials , LBMHD , to test the following dual - socket , multicore platforms : Intel 's " Clovertown " Xeon , AMD 's Opteron X2 , Sun 's Niagara2 , and IBM's Cell , along with a single single - socket , single - core Itanium2 .
The main focus of the research was uncovering the bottlenecks behind the LBMHD benchmark and in exploring the use of auto - tuners for optimizing the benchmark for different multicore systems .
Along the way , though , the researchers uncovered some interesting details that support the two conclusions pointed out above .
The LBMHD benchmark is easily parallelizable and scales well with the number of threads .
Because a platform 's per -thread performance does n't affect the benchmark the way that thread count does , it was widely thought to be memory - bandwidth constrained , because it uses complex data structures with irregular memory access patterns .
In looking for bottlenecks for their auto - tuner to optimize , the researchers discovered that memory bandwidth was not , in fact , the main constraint holding back the benchmark on the platforms under examination — at least not initially .
Rather , translation look - aside buffer ( TLB ) resources , cache bandwidth , memory latency , and code scheduling were holding the unoptimized versions of LBMHD back on the different platforms .
The researchers then optimized for the above factors on each platform and ran the benchmark again to find that , in the case of Intel 's Clovertown , the bottleneck had now shifted to the memory subsystem .
It turns out that Clovertown is bottlenecked in memory bandwidth , and that the chipset can't move enough data from the single DRAM bus into both FSBs .
This problem seriously constrains Clovertown 's ability to scale with the number of threads , despite the other optimizations .
In contrast , the Operton X2's NUMA design is not bandwidth bottlenecked and gets nearly linear scaling with the TLB optimization enabled .
At the top of the benchmark heap in terms of scaling and raw performance was IBM's Cell , which achieves near - perfect linear scaling for a few reasons .
First , the LBMHD code had to be written especially for Cell , since the architecture was so unique that they could n't just compile the code and autotune it like they did for the other architectures .
So Cell had an advantage there , in that its code was optimized from the get - go .
It 's also the case that Cell 's RDRAM - based memory subsystem gives it plenty of bandwidth directly into the Cell socket , and this was an even bigger factor in the platform 's superior performance on this benchmark .
Clovertown < Harpertown < Nehalem
It bears pointing out that a lot of the blame for Clovertown 's problems can be put on its chipset .
The newer " Seaburg " chipset that goes with Intel 's latest " Harpertown " Xeons has improvements that are specifically designed to address the cache - and memory - bandwidth problems highlighted in these benchmarks .
In addition to FSB and memory bus speed boosts , Seaburg adds a 24MB snoop filter cache designed to cut down on cross - socket cache coherency traffic .
All of these factors would add up to make it a more formidable contender in these benchmarks .
But of course , no one should take these remarks as a defense of Intel 's currently dated system architecture .
Nehalem , with its QuickPath interconnect , NUMA topology , SMT support , and greatly expanded two - level TLB , will take Intel even further in its performance on these kinds of easily parallelizable , memory - intensive benchmarks .
Indeed , because of the kinds of issues highlighted in this benchmark , Nehalem should be mark a disruptive change for Intel 's fortunes in the HPC market — an " inflection point , " to use the popular buzzword .
( Personally , I 'm waiting for Nehalem before I pick up my first Mac Pro tower , because I 'll need all of that bandwidth for two things : gaming , and editing HD video clips of junior when he / she arrives in the Fall . )

After a recall on the Remington 700 trigger for unintentional discharging , finding a replacement trigger is the best option .
Finding a high quality replacement trigger for the Remington 700 will help with control , accuracy , and overall performance .
Finding the right trigger can be tricky , but this short guide should provide some pertinent information that will help point you in the right direction .
After doing some hefty research online , and in gun stores locally I have found some of the best triggers for the Remington 700 .
The Remington 700 is a reliable , accurate bolt - action rifle that has been the model upon which many other long range rifles have been built .
It is excellent for hunting , target practice , and overall tactical use .
Once the trigger is replaced with a Remington 700 aftermarket trigger , the dangerous problem of unintentional discharging will be solved .
There has been some debate as to whether this is a problem of the owner not maintaining the trigger , or an actual problem with the trigger .
Finding the best trigger replacement for a Remington 700 is a difficult task due to the popularity of this rifle .
Generally , the more popular , the more aftermarket products are available .
The market for accessories for this rifle is huge and you have countless of options , from barrels to stocks .
I went with names that I trust in the gun market to find of what I determine to be the best Remington 700 triggers available today .
To find the right trigger to replace the old one a few things should be considered .
Corrosion Resistant : A good Remington 700 replacement trigger should resist corrosion and rust .
The parts exposed to the elements are extremely important in this factor .
Take the time to see if it is nickel - coated , or made out of aluminum .
These extra additions will ensure the trigger will last .
Your trigger on any gun is very important to maintain , because an unclean , gummed up trigger can cause fatal accidents .

Your trigger on any gun is very important to maintain , because an unclean , gummed up trigger can cause fatal accidents .
Weight : Any Remington 700 trigger that is after - market will have different weights , and are adjustable .
The weight of the trigger refers to how hard you have to pull the trigger to shoot the gun .
Different types of guns require different weights , and the use of the gun will also determine which is best .
2.5 - 3lb pull weight is a good standard for hunting rifles , but it is determined by the shooter ’s preferences , and what type of rifle they are using .
Generally , the lighter the weight ( to a certain degree ) , the better the accuracy .
Some Remington 700 owners claim that the malfunctioning trigger is due to owners tinkering with the weight without having the proper knowledge of how to do it .
If you are unsure of this , than bringing it to a gunsmith is a good idea .

Style :
This is not as big of issue , but if you are not familiar with taking guns apart , and putting them back together than a drop - in style trigger will work best .
If you are capable of doing that , and setting the weight of your Remington 700 trigger upgrade , then it may be cheaper to use another style .
Drop-ins are a convenient , quick way to fix the trigger .
Again , if you are not versed in this kind of work of changing a trigger , than finding a qualified gunsmith is a good course of action .
The Best Triggers For Remington 700
Although there are many styles and brands , there are some that out do others .
Finding the best trigger for a Remington 700 should follow the guide I have outlined above .
The guide is small , but includes all the basics you have to know .
Among other things , the best style for you might be linked to your use of the gun .
Below you will find the four triggers I found to stand out among the rest .
These can be purchased from any gun store , online or locally .
Remington 700 Calvin Elite Trigger
This easy to install drop - in trigger is made by Timney .
More specifically , a man by the name of Mr. Calvin , who has been designing triggers for Timney for quite some time , made this Remington 700 replacement trigger to his own liking .
It is a single piece drop in model making it easy to replace .
It ’s weight starts at a incredibly light eight ounces , and tops out at only two and a half pounds .
Its price is reflective of its ingenuity .
The parts more prone to corrosion are nickel plated to give them resistance to it .
For hunting specifically , this trigger ’s weight is a bit light .
At two pounds there is noticeable creep .
There have been reports of the let off being inconsistent due to changes in pull weight with each fire .
Overall , the Calvin Elite is a great trigger , but it seems there are a few minor changes that could make it even better .
Overall , it is possibly the best trigger for Remington 700 if you are using it for tactical purposes , or target practice .
For hunting I would not recommend it because the pull weight is just too light .
Pros Drop - in style
Adjustable from 8 oz to 2lbs
Easy to install
Nickel plated for corrosion resistance
Great for tactical use
Adjustable over travel and sear engagement
Designed by a top person , Mr. Calvin , in the trigger industry Cons Inconsistent let off
Not great for hunting
Creeps at higher weights

Shilen Trigger
This is another one of the best trigger replacements for the Remington 700 .
For hunting and competitive shooting this trigger provides consistent pull pressure .
The stainless steel sears have been polished and grounded , and all the moving internal parts are heat treated , making it much more durable than the stock trigger that comes with the Remington 700 .
This trigger comes in two different types ; standard and competition .
The biggest difference between the two is the pull weight .
Standard will work for most types of situations and adjusts between 1.5 lbs to 3 lbs .
One thing to note is that this trigger comes with no safety , so this you will have to keep from your original factory trigger .
Over travel , sear engagement , and weight of pull can all be adjusted on this trigger .
It is wise to have a gunsmith do this unless you are familiar with these adjustments as it can lead to a safety issue .
Another issue with some of these triggers is that the firing pin can drop when cycled too quickly .
Other issues reported have been that the pull weight adjustments just do n’t hold up , only getting to 8 oz . of pull weight .
Pros Consistent pull pressure
Stainless steel inside
Heat treated for durability and reliability
Two trigger options ; standard and competition
Adjustable from 1.5lbs to 3 lbs
Over travel , sear engagement , and pull weight are all adjustable Cons No safety
Firing pin drops when cycled quickly

Jewell HVR
Almost anytime a conversation comes up about Remington 700 aftermarket triggers , this name gets mentioned .
This trigger is another drop - in system that is somewhat easy to install , has pull force adjustment and over travel adjustment .
It is designed to keep friction to a minimum .
The thing that really makes this one of , if not the best Remington 700 triggers is its versatility .
Most triggers for this rifle are either good at tactical use , target practice , or hunting .
This trigger , with its three springs , can fill any role .
It can adjust from just 8 oz to 4 lbs in pull weight with the three different springs that come with it .
With this adjustable versatility , switching from tactical to hunting is as easy as changing a spring .
Said system makes this Remington 700 trigger one - of - a kind .
All internal parts are made with stainless steel , which is the best choice for resisting corrosion with proper maintenance .
One of the best features for many shooters is the ability to adjust weight , over travel , and sear engagement without having to remove the stock or anything else .
The price really is the only hard thing to swallow with this trigger , but considering the quality , it is well worth it .
Pros Drop - in system
Force and over travel adjustments
Minimal friction
Three trigger springs to fill any role
Adjustable from 8 oz to 4lbs
Used for hunting , tactical , and target
Adjust weight , over travel and sear engagement without removing anything Cons Price

Timney Remington 700 Trigger
This Timney classic is another great choice for a Remington 700 replacement trigger .
It is a drop - in design , and is one of the easiest triggers to install .
If you are not skilled at taking their rifle apart , this is probably one of the best choices for you .
The trigger itself is a wider design , giving you more surface area to connect your finger to , and making it great for hunting if you are wearing gloves .
The safety is has a whole new design that actually blocks the trigger and not the sear .
The internal components are all heat treated steel , while the outer components are nickel plated .
The pull weight is adjustable with an adjustment from 1.5 lbs to 4lbs , which is more suitable for a hunting rifle , or target practice , but is not bad for tactical use either .
This is by far the most economical out of all the Remington 700 Aftermarket triggers I have reviewed so far .
Most are two hundred dollars or above , while this one can be bought for around one hundred and fifty dollars .
It is aesthetically pleasing , which is of little importance for most , but a nice addition to an already great trigger .
The bolt release mechanism sometimes has issues of sticking .
The installation , while stated that it is very easy , can be challenging .
On some models , modification of the stock was necessary to fit it properly .
Pros Drop -in design
Easy to install
Wider trigger for more contact
New safety design
Adjustable from 1.5 to 4 lbs
Price Cons
Bolt release sticks sometimes
Installation deceivingly harder than presented

Amnesty International denounces war crimes by US - backed forces in Somalia
By Barry Grey
8 May 2008
Amnesty International , the London - based human rights organization , issued a report Tuesday documenting widespread atrocities against Somali civilians by Ethiopian occupation forces and troops of the US - backed Somali government .
The report , entitled “ Routinely Targeted : Attacks on Civilians in Somalia , ” presents a harrowing picture of a humanitarian disaster compounded by terror against the civilian population in the form of summary executions , torture , rape and arbitrary detention .
While the report says all sides in the civil war have carried out crimes against civilians , it places greatest emphasis on the actions of forces armed , financed and backed militarily and politically by the United States — the Ethiopian military and the Transitional Federal Government .
( TFG ) .
The Amnesty International report includes interviews with Somali refugees who describe Ethiopian and TFG troops routinely slitting the throats of civilians , carrying out gang - rapes , conducting house - to - house searches in the war - devastated capital Mogadishu and summarily killing residents , and blasting entire neighborhoods suspected of being sympathetic to Islamist insurgents .
The rights organization charges that the terror campaign by government and Ethiopian troops is a major factor in a humanitarian catastrophe that threatens millions of Somalis with starvation .
In the concluding section of the report , Amnesty writes :
“ There is a dire human rights situation in southern and central Somalia , which has largely contributed to the current humanitarian emergency .
One million Somalis are internally displaced ; hundreds of thousands are newly displayed refugees ; journalists and human rights defenders fear each day for their lives and many are fleeing the country ; some 6,000 civilians were killed in attacks in 2007 ; and the entire population of Mogadishu carries the scars of having witnessed or experienced egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .
In addition , all parties to the conflict have committed human rights violations or abuses , which included unlawful killings , extrajudicial executions , torture and other ill - treatment , including rape and beatings , arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances . ”
The rights group had recently accused Ethiopian forces of killing at least 21 people , seven of whom had their throats slit , inside a Mogadishu mosque on April 19 .
This nightmare of human suffering and social disintegration is the outcome of the illegal invasion and occupation of Somalia by tens of thousands of Ethiopian troops , prepared and launched with the full backing of the US government , in December of 2006 .
The US military supplied air and naval power to support its proxy Ethiopian invasion force , as well as Special Forces units on the ground in Somalia , in order to topple the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) , whose militia had taken control of virtually the entire country , including Mogadishu , leaving the US - and United Nations - backed Transitional Federal Government isolated in its enclave of Baidoa .
The US defends it role in the invasion and its ongoing military support for the Ethiopian occupation as part of the “ war on terror , ” accusing the ICU of links to Al Qaeda .
This , in fact , is a pretext for Washington ’s drive to install a client regime in a Horn of Africa country whose 1,800 mile coast overlooks strategic shipping lanes between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean that are used for Middle Eastern oil shipments .
The TFG is led by CIA - backed clan warlords who had earned the hatred of the Somali people for looting the country over a period of nearly two decades .
The ICU , based on Islamic courts , businessmen and local and regional officials , had won substantial popular support by virtue of its offensive against the warlords and its record in establishing civil order and the provision of food and basic services .
Since the December , 2006 invasion , the TFG and Ethiopian occupation forces have failed to secure control over any significant part of Somalia , including Mogadishu .
Instead , an insurgency led by Islamist forces linked to the ICU , such as the Shabaab militia , has gained strength .
Amnesty International reported there was a marked increase in executions of civilians by Ethiopian troops in the last two months of 2007 .
The rise appeared , in part , to have been in retaliation for an ambush of Ethiopian soldiers in early November in which the bodies of several Ethiopians were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu .
The human rights group said it obtained scores of reports of killings by Ethiopian troops in which Somali civilians were , according to witnesses , “ slaughtered like goats . ”
“ The people of Somalia are being killed , raped , tortured .
Looting is widespread and entire neighborhoods are being destroyed , ” Michelle Kagari , Amnesty ’s deputy director for Africa , said in a statement from Nairobi that accompanied the report .
The report quotes testimony from some 75 witnesses as well as scores of workers from non-governmental organizations .
In one testimony , Haboon , 56 , says her neighbor ’s 17 - year - old daughter was raped by Ethiopian troops .
The girl ’s brothers tried to defend their sister , but the soldiers beat them and gouged their eyes out with a bayonet .
Amnesty reports that “ a young child ’s throat was slit by Ethiopian soldiers in front of the child ’s mother . ”
The report quotes Butaaco , aged 30 , who fled Mogadishu in October 2007 , as saying : “ I saw girls get raped in my neighborhood and on the streets .
I saw people get slaughtered .
I saw people killed in their houses , their bodies rotting for days .
It happened to my neighbor ’s two girls . ”
In another account , a witness named only as Ceebla ’a says she saw Ethiopian soldiers rounding up three men , whose bodies were found in the street the next morning .
One had been strangled with an electrical wire , another had his throat cut , while the third had been chained ankle to wrist , his testicles smashed .
Not surprisingly , the Amnesty International report has received little coverage in the American media , and no mention by any of the presidential contenders of the two major political parties .
Just as the political and media establishment has sought to cover up the scale of the mass killing and destruction in Iraq , it is intent on concealing from the American people another immense war crime committed by US imperialism .
The release of the report coincided with the second day of protests in Mogadishu against soaring food prices .
On Monday , government troops fired into tens of thousands of people who marched and rioted to demand that food traders accept old 1,000 - shilling notes .
At least two demonstrators were killed and several others were wounded .
The protesters , including many women and children , jammed the narrow streets of the bombed - out capital , shouting , “ Down with those suffocating us ! ”
“ First we have been killed with bullets , now they are killing us with hunger , ” said Halima Omar Hassan , a demonstrator who works as a porter , carrying goods for people on her back .
In Mogadishu , the price of corn meal has doubled since January .
Rice has increased to $ 47.50 from $ 26 this year for a 110 pound sack .
The Somali shilling is valued at roughly 34,000 to the dollar — less than half what it was a year ago .
The United Nations food security unit warned recently that half of Somalia ’s 7 million people face famine , pointing to drought as well as food prices .
Last week , on May 1 , the US fired missiles into a housing compound in the central Somali town of Dusa Marreb , killing Aden Hashi Ayro , a leader of the Shabaab Islamist militia that is fighting the US - backed government and Ethiopian occupation troops .
Washington claims that Ayro was one of Al Qaeda ’s top operatives in East Africa .
ICU leaders deny any ties to Al Qaeda .
Shabaab was added to the US government ’s terror list in March of this year .
At least four Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a Navy ship or submarine off the Somali coast slammed into a compound of single - storey buildings in Dusa Marreb .
US officials said Ayro was killed along with several top lieutenants , but witnesses said at least 30 people were killed , including civilians living in surrounding houses .
The missile strike leveled an area about the size of two city blocks .
Islamist fighters said a second US air strike blasted a remote area of central Somalia hours after armed civilians met there .
The US military denied the claim .
The missile strikes were carried out in advance of a UN - sponsored meeting set for May 10 in Djibouti , at which TFG officials and ICU leaders were to negotiate a possible truce .
In an interview on the “ Democracy Now ! ” radio program , Professor Abdi Samatar , a professor of geography and global studies at the University of Minnesota and author of several books on Somali history , said of the missile strikes and food riots :
“ It ’s as if there has been a calculated decision made somewhere in the world , maybe in Washington , maybe in Addis Ababa , maybe in Mogadishu itself , to starve these people until they submit themselves to the whims of the American military , in this instance , and the Ethiopians , who are acting on their behalf . ”
The May 1 attack was the fifth US air strike in Somalia since the beginning of 2007 .
On March 3 of this year , the US Navy fired two Tomahawk missiles from a submarine off the coast of Somalia at Dobley , a town in southern Somalia , killing at least three women and three children and wounding another twenty people .
The death and destruction inflicted on the Somali people at the hands of the United States and its proxy forces is an object lesson on the role of US imperialism in Africa and around the world .
In December of 1992 , the United States sent 30,000 troops , a naval armada , planes , tanks and attack helicopters to Somalia in the guise of a humanitarian mission to relieve a famine in the country .
“ Operation Restore Hope , ” launched by the outgoing administration of the senior George Bush and continued by the new Democratic administration of Bill Clinton , was carried out to regain control of Somalia following the fall of the US - backed regime of longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre .
The US invasion was quickly directed to smashing the power of warlords considered to be obstacles to American domination of the country and the Horn of Africa as a whole .
The US military was subsequently driven out of Somalia in 1993 in the well - known “ Black Hawk down ” incident , which claimed the lives of 19 American troops .
It is now being employed in alliance with some of the same warlords that US forces were fighting 15 years ago .
On December 4 , 1992 , the Workers League , the forerunner of the Socialist Equality Party , published a statement explaining the real nature and aims of the US intervention .
This statement , which has been fully confirmed by subsequent events , declared : “ ... the American people are being overwhelmed by a hypocritical and cynical media barrage which depicts the invasion as a noble act of humanitarian aid to the starving Somali people ...
“ In reality , the United States is preparing to carry out the military occupation of Somalia so it can install a puppet regime and establish American military and economic hegemony over the region .
“ What is involved here is not simply an isolated military adventure , but the drive of American imperialism to recolonize Africa and large parts of Asia and Latin America . ”
ROCK PORT , Missouri ( Reuters ) -
At 265 feet tall , four gleaming white wind turbines tower over the tiny farm town of Rock Port , Missouri , like a landing of alien intruders .
The full moon sets behind a wind farm in the Mojave Desert in California , January 8 , 2004 .
While only 1 percent of U.S. electricity comes from wind , it is attracting so much support these days that many in the industry believe it is poised for a growth spurt .

But despite their imposing presence and the stark contrast with the rolling pastures and corn fields , the turbines have received a warm welcome here .
As Eric Chamberlain , who manages the wind farm for Wind Capital Group , eats lunch in a local restaurant , local people greet him with a “ Hey Windy ! ” and many say they are happy to be using clean electricity .
“ It does n’t pollute the environment , it provides tax revenue , creates jobs .
I do n’t see a downside , ” said Chamberlain , who is something of a celebrity in this town of 1,400 people .
While growth in ethanol use as an alternative fuel has had a big impact on rural America , wind power has also been growing steadily for the past three years , with wind farms like this one springing up all over the windy expanse of the Great Plains and beyond .
While only 1 percent of U.S. electricity comes from wind , it is attracting so much support these days that many in the industry believe it is poised for a growth spurt .
“ These are pretty heady times , ” said Randall Swisher , executive director of the American Wind Energy Association , which held an investment conference April 30 in Iowa that drew more than 600 attendees .
“ People are finally starting to see the data about what is happening to the world ’s climate and that is really having an impact , ” said Swisher .
Last year , a record 3,100 turbines were installed across 34 U.S. states and another 2,000 turbines are now under construction from California to Massachusetts .
In all , there are about more than 25,000 U.S. turbines in operation , an investment of $ 15 billion .
On May 12 , the U.S. Energy Department said wind power could provide 20 percent of U.S. electricity by 2030 , or 304 gigawatts , up from the current 16.8 gigawatts .
Achieving that will require that wind turbine installations rise to almost 7,000 a year by 2017 , the department said .
The industry appears poised to comply .
In March , GE Energy announced it had secured a $ 1 billion deal to supply 750 megawatts of wind turbines -- enough to power about 200,000 households .
In April , Nebraska officials broke ground on a wind farm that would be the largest in that state , providing power for an estimated 25,000 homes .
Also in April , the electric company Wisconsin Public Service Corp. won approval from state regulators to construct a $ 251 million wind farm in Iowa to help it meet a state mandate that it boost its supply of renewable power .
In Texas , legendary oil man T. Boone Pickens has announced plans to invest in a wind farm that would provide enough electricity for about 1 million homes .
Pickens ’ company , Mesa Power , this month ordered more than 600 wind turbines from GE to get started .
And , this year , Kansas became the first state in the nation to reject expansion of coal - fired plants specifically because of global warming worries .
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius is recommending wind energy as an alternative and successfully fought legislative efforts to overrule her .
Wind Capital , based in St. Louis , Missouri , is a relatively small player .
It operates three wind farms in Missouri and has plans for projects in 10 U.S. states .
Among its backers are Irish renewable energy company NTR Plc , which invested $ 150 million in April , and a unit of Deere & Co , with a $ 200 million investment .
The firm leases land from farmers on which to build its turbines .
In Rock Port , homes and businesses getting power from the municipal utility are now using wind energy , backed by conventional electricity supplies from the Missouri Joint Municipal Utility system .
Increasingly , states are mandating that utilities obtain a portion of their power through such renewable sources .
Wind energy is also benefiting from a Production Tax Credit federal subsidy of 2 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity produced .
According to the American Wind Energy Association , this amounts to $ 4.5 billion over 10 years .
That is still far less than the $ 3.57 billion in annual subsidies enjoyed by the ethanol distillers under a 51 cents per gallon Ethanol Excise Tax Credit .
GLOBAL WARMING WORRIES
Supporters say along with helping the nation break a dependence on costly oil , natural gas and coal , they see wind energy as part of a base for “ green - collar ” employment , with jobs in manufacturing towers , blades and other components .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president , has proposed investing $ 150 billion over the next decade for investments in alternative energy , including wind , solar and biodiesel .
His rival for the nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton is also proposing a $ 150 billon ten - year investment in a “ new energy future . ”
Sen .
John McCain , the Republican Party ’s presumed nominee for November ’s presidential election , has also said he supports wind energy .
McCain even chose a wind - energy facility in Portland , Oregon , as the setting for a May 12 policy speech on global warming .
Critics argue that imposing wind turbines spoil landscapes and disrupt wildlife habitats , and such worries have dogged what would be the first U.S. offshore commercial wind - powered electricity generator , proposed to cover 28 square miles of shallow waters off the Massachusetts coast .
As well , there is the reality that sometimes the wind just does n’t blow .
That means wind turbines cannot be relied on as a sole power source , but rather as a supplement .
And transmission lines and grid systems have yet to be established across much of the windblown prairie .
But the greatest concern currently for the wind energy industry is that for all the public support , the Production Tax Credit is set to expire in December .
U.S. lawmakers and President Bush have repeatedly failed to agree on how to fund an extension .
“ We continue to push ahead because we believe that renewable energy does make a lot of sense and even policy makers at some point will have to realize something has to be done with $ 120 a barrel oil , ” said Michael Polsky , CEO of Invenergy LLC , a Chicago - based wind developer .
Since the $ 90 million Loess Hill wind farm in Rock Port came online in April , it has been a point of pride for residents that , over a year , the farm should generate enough power to exceed the town ’s consumption .
Farmer Todd Herron , who receives $ 5,000 a year from Wind Capital Group for hosting a spinning turbine on one of his corn fields , said there should be no argument against using wind to make electricity instead of coal or natural gas .
“ This is a rural farming community , ” said Herron .
“ Our lives depend on the Earth .
We ’ve got to keep it in as good a shape as we can . ”
