RIVERSIDE , Calif . 
The Jordanian business partner of a prominent Florida businessman , who has raised more than $ 500,000 for Senator John McCain , appears to be at the center of a cluster of questionable donations to his presidential campaign .
Campaign finance records show Mr. McCain collected a little more than $ 50,000 in March from members of a single extended family , the Abdullahs , in California and several of their friends .
Amid a sea of contributions to the McCain campaign , the Abdullahs stand out .
The checks come not from the usual exclusive coastal addresses , but from relatively hardscrabble inland towns like Downey and Colton .
The donations are also startling because of their size : several donors initially wrote checks of $ 9,200 , exceeding the $ 2,300 limit for an individual gift .
Making matters murkier , some couples in the family who contributed more than $ 9,000 to Mr. McCain also gave the maximum in December to either Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton or Rudolph W. Giuliani , or both , totaling in the case of at least one family more than $ 18,000 .
Goa Tourism Goa , a tiny emerald land on the west coast of India , a magnificent place for tourism in india , a place of sun sand and sea , squeezed between the seas and the lush forested hills .
Goa tourism offers glistening sands , swaying coconut palms , and ultra fresh seafood .
With its natural scenic beauty , abundant greenery , attractive beaches and temples , churches & even mosques with a distinctive style of architecture , colorful and lively feasts , festivals & above all , hospitable people with a rich cultural milieu , has an ideal tourist profile .
Tourism in Goa is an opportunity to see the magnificent beauty of nature in a completely new way and to explore a new and highly interesting culture .
Variously known as “ Rome of the East “ , “ Tourist Paradise “ and “ Pearl of the Orient “ , the state of Goa is one of the premier locations for tourism and is located on the western coast of India in the coastal belt known as Konkan .
Tourism in Goa is famous for some special reasons -
The magnificent scenic beauty and the architectural splendours of its temples , churches and old houses have made tourism in Goa a firm favourite with travellers around the world .
But then , Goa is much more than just beaches and sea .
It has a soul which goes deep into unique history , rich culture and some of the prettiest natural scenery that India has to offer .
The vast green expanse of the Sahyadri mountain range ensures that Goa has an abundance of water .
The sea and rivers abound in seafood – prawns , mackerels , sardines , crabs and lobsters are the most popular with the locals and the visitors .
Tourism in Goa is an excellent opportunity which must be completely devoured .
Along with English which is widely spoken all over Goa , Konkani and Marathi are the state languages .
The national language Hindi is also well understood in most areas around the state .
Goan cuisine is a blend of different influences the Goans had to endure during the centuries .
The staple food in Goa is fish and rice , both among the Hindus and the Catholics .
Unlike the Christian food the Hindu Goan food is not strongly influenced by the Portuguese cuisine .
The tourism is high in tourist season in Goa which begins in late September and carries on through early March .
The weather in these months is usually dry and pleasantly cool .
Tourism in Goa in these months is well known and highly popularized all around the world .
Weather :
The average temperature varies between 25 ? C – 30 ? C ( 67.96 F – 81.56 F Approx ) .
The average rainfall is approximately 325 cms , the average daily hours of sunshine is nine to ten hours in summer and three to five hours during the monsoon .
Then the weather gets fairly hot around May and by end of June , Goa receives the full blast of the Indian monsoon with sudden downpours and tropical thunderstorms during which tourism is a little lower scale .
However it is also during the monsoon that Goa is probably at its most beautiful , with greenery sprouting all around – a perfect place for tourism to grow , expand and make one ’s tour in Goa an experience of lifetime .
Lifestyle : Goans as the people from Goa are known around the world , have a unique lifestyle which reflects the perfect blending of the cultural influences that they have experienced over the centuries .
By nature , Goans are warm , friendly , easy going and large hearted .
They live life in style and at a leisurely pace .
They are passionate about dance , music and art which is in their blood and they love their food and feni .
Goans attitude to life is best described by the word Susegad which means taking life at a relaxed pace and enjoy it to the full .
This unique philosophy of life originates from the Portuguese word Socegado which literally meant quiet .
The people of Goa have taken that to heart , quite wholeheartedly while leading quiet and relaxed lives in their peaceful land , in spite of the heavy tourism Goa attracts every year .
How to get there .
Air : Goa ‘s international airport is 29 km from Panjim at Dabolim .
Rail : Goa has two main stations at Margao and Vasco da Gama .
The 760 km long Konkan Railway project between Mangalore ( Karnataka ) and Mumbai has given a major boost to train travel to Goa Road :

Choosing business insurance coverage for your company is a balancing act between securing the coverage you need and getting a fair price .
To find good coverage for an affordable price , you need to be an educated consumer – and you need an agent or broker you can trust to help .
Once you know what questions to ask , it ’s much easier to select optimal small - business insurance coverage and business liability insurance rates .
It ’s also important to understand that business liability insurance rates will vary depending on your business ’s needs .
If your business is like most small businesses , you probably do n’t have a full - time risk manager to answer your business liability insurance or workers ’ compensation insurance questions .
So where to start ?
It may make sense to focus your research on three common types of small business insurance coverage : general liability , property and workers ’ compensation insurance .
Property insurance
Property insurance covers your business ’s property and inventory against physical loss or damage by accident , theft or some other cause .
Your property is covered even if it ’s away from your business location at the time of the loss .
Eligible businesses can purchase property insurance packaged together with general business liability insurance coverage in a single policy called a Business Owner ’s Policy , or BOP .
Such combined policies are generally available at reasonable small - business rates .
Business liability insurance
To protect against the most common types of claims , most small businesses elect to purchase two types of business liability insurance coverage : general liability and professional liability .
Comprehensive general liability insurance coverage protects you in the event of claims of bodily injury or physical injury or damage to property .
As noted above , general liability insurance coverage is often offered in a BOP along with property coverage , providing comprehensive protection in the event of an accident at your workplace or another location where you conduct business .
For companies that provide professional services , such as medical care , accounting or computer consulting , liability insurance for professionals is critical coverage .
Often referred to as “ errors and omissions ” coverage , professional liability protects your business should a customer claim that you committed negligent acts or made errors or omissions when performing your professional services .
This type of insurance is particularly crucial because professional liability claims can be very costly compared with general liability claims .
Workers ’ compensation insurance
Most states demand that businesses carry workers ’ compensation insurance .
But that ’s not the only reason why it ’s a good idea to have it .
This type of business insurance coverage pays for medical and disability expenses for employees who suffer injuries or illnesses related to their jobs .
Business insurance rates for workers ’ compensation are based on your company ’s payroll and services .
Many states allow owners , partners and officers of a company to exclude themselves from workers ’ compensation coverage , saving the company money on premiums .
Employer ’s liability insurance is generally offered as a component of a worker ’s compensation policy .
Employer ’s liability protects companies should a worker make a claim that an accident or illness was the result of unsafe working conditions .
If you ’re not sure what ’s in your policy , ask your agent to be sure you have employers ’ liability insurance .
It can be difficult to determine just which business insurance coverages you need , and what an affordable rate may be .
This is where a good agent can be a big help .
While requirements differ from state to state , it ’s a good bet that you ’ll need workers ’ compensation insurance for all of your employees .
Premiums are typically based on payroll , and may vary depending on whether or not employer ’s liability coverage is included .
It ’s a good idea to check out multiple insurance providers ’ quotes and policy limits .

Only Japan has the broadband quality to cope with next - generation internet applications , a new study has revealed .
Sweden and the Netherlands have Europe 's best broadband , according to the 42 - nation study sponsored by internet equipment maker Cisco Systems .
The UK , Spain and Italy fell just below the quality threshold for today 's web .
The study aims to highlight each nation 's ability to cope with next - generation web applications such as high - quality video streaming .
It was carried out by a team of MBA students from the Said Business School at the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo 's Department of Applied Economics .
They developed a " Broadband Quality Score " for each nation based on internet speed both downloading and uploading , the loss of packets of data and latency - a measure of the delays in information routing .
The study focused on countries in Europe , North America , the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , Brazil , Russia , India and China ( Brics ) .
Their research found that more than half of those countries had broadband connections good enough to deliver consistent quality for most common web applications today .
Top quality broadband nations 1 . Japan 2 . Sweden 3 . Netherlands 4 . Latvia 5 . Korea 6 . Switzerland 7 . Lithuania 8 . Denmark 9 . Germany 10 .
Slovenia
Broadband speeds around the world Researchers put the success of Sweden and the Netherlands in Europe down to those countries ' " increasing investments in fibre and cable network upgrades , coupled with competition diversity , and supported by strong government vision and policy " .
They said Japan 's early commitment to investing in broadband made it the only country prepared to deliver the necessary quality for next - generation web applications over the next three to five years .
The study used nearly eight million records from broadband speed tests conducted by users around the world during May , 2008 , through www.speedtest.net.
Alastair Nicholson , of the Said Business School , said the study was based on the premise that the next generation of web applications would need better broadband .
" Average download speeds are adequate for web browsing , e-mail and basic video downloading and streaming , " he said .
" But we are seeing more interactive applications , more user - generated content being uploaded and shared , and an increasing amount of high - quality video services becoming available . "
Consistent experience Fernando Gil de Bernabe , managing director of Cisco 's internet business solutions group , told the BBC that there was no link between broadband penetration and broadband quality .
I thought it was interesting to see that only one country is ready for these applications that are not really that futuristic
Fernando Gil de Bernabe " We created a threshold for today 's most popular applications and then for the future applications - which are only three to five years away - based on how much quality you need on average to get a consistent experience with these applications .
" When we checked which countries had the threshold for today , actually most countries did OK .
Notably the UK , Spain and Italy did n't cut that threshold , even for today 's applications .
" For tomorrow 's applications only Japan is future - ready .
I thought it was interesting to see that only one country is ready for these applications that are not really that futuristic . "
He added : " This study gives broadband stakeholders - from governments through to telecom and cable operators and vendors like Cisco - as well as consumers a better understanding of the importance of quality broadband connections .
" Without high - quality broadband , we will not be able to take full advantage of the next wave of productivity , collaboration and entertainment that can be gained from the web . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A dwarf planet orbiting beyond Neptune has been designated the third plutoid in the solar system and given the name Makemake , the International Astronomical Union said on Saturday .
The red methane - covered dwarf planet formerly known as 2005 FY9 or “ Easterbunny ” is named after a Polynesian creator of humanity and god of fertility .
Just last month the IAU , which names planets and other heavenly bodies , decided to create a new class of sub-planets called plutoids .
Pluto , demoted from planet status , and Eris are the other two plutoids .
A fourth dwarf planet named Ceres has been excluded from the plutoid club because it orbits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .
Makemake is just slightly smaller and dimmer than Pluto and was only discovered in 2005 .
“ The orbit is not particularly strange , but the object itself is big , probably about two - thirds the size of Pluto , ” said Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology , who discovered and named Makemake ( pronounced MAH - keh MAH - keh ) .
It was the discovery of these trans -Neptunian objects that led the IAU to re-designate just what it meant to be a planet .
Brown said the name came to him when he was looking for a mythological god and thought of the South Pacific ’s Easter Island .
Makemake was the chief god among people who settled the island .

The Anti-Obama Hate - Fest The Republican Party , which has defined modern - day negative politics , was back at it again , bashing Barack Obama and the news media in an ugly display that rivaled the old days of Nixon - Agnew – or George W. Bush ’s last convention where GOP operatives passed out “ Purple Heart Band - Aids ” to mock John Kerry ’s war wounds .

After a slow start because of Hurricane Gustav , the convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , has turned into an anti-Obama hate - fest with a nearly all - white gathering laughing at and mocking the nation ’s first African - American presidential nominee of a major party .
However , beyond the pulsating contempt visible on the faces of the GOP delegates , many of the nasty attacks on Obama – as well as the effusive praise for the Republican ticket – were blatantly false , as if testing the depths of American gullibility and bigotry .
In speech after speech , Republicans did n’t so much as tell the Big Lie as they deployed Wholesale Lies .
The Associated Press , which mostly had been recycling the Republican spin about the supposedly “ maverick ” ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin , was so struck by the litany of distortions that the AP produced a special fact - checking article describing how Republicans had “ stretched the truth . ”
For instance , Palin said about Obama , “ it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate . "
However , as the AP noted , Obama “ worked with Republicans to pass legislation that expanded efforts to intercept illegal shipments of weapons of mass destruction and to help destroy conventional weapons stockpiles .
The legislation became law last year . ”
Plus , the AP reported , “ In Illinois , he was the leader on two big , contentious measures in Illinois : studying racial profiling by police and requiring recordings of interrogations in potential death penalty cases .
He also successfully co-sponsored major ethics reform legislation . ”
The AP ’s fact - checking article noted , too , that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee ’s slap at Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden – that Palin " got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States " – was a “ whopper .
”
The AP wrote that “ Palin got 616 votes in the 1996 mayor 's election , and got 909 in her 1999 re-election race , for a total of 1,525 .
Biden dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucuses , but he still got 76,165 votes in 23 states and the District of Columbia where he was on the ballot during the 2008 presidential primaries . ”
Parallel Reality The Republican National Convention also acted as if the Republicans had not controlled the White House for the past eight years and the Congress for most of that time .
" We need change , all right , ” declared former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , “ change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington !
We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington - throw out the big - government liberals , and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin . "
Beyond this parallel universe of who runs Washington , there was fanciful puffery about the GOP “ reformer ” ticket – dubbed “ maverick squared ” – that does n’t square with reality at all .
For instance , the AP cited Palin ’s claim that " I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending ... and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
I told the Congress ' thanks but no thanks ' for that Bridge to Nowhere . "
The reality , of course , was much different .
As the AP noted .
Palin , as mayor of the tiny town of Wasilla , hired a lobbyist and made annual treks to Washington seeking earmarked spending that totaled $ 27 million , and then as Alaska ’s governor for less than two years , she sought nearly $ 750 million in special federal spending , “ by far the largest per-capita request in the nation . ”
And as for that $ 398 million bridge from Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents , the truth is that Palin enthusiastically supported the project before she reluctantly opposed it , rejecting the “ Bridge to Nowhere ” only after it had become politically indefensible .
The Los Angeles Times discovered that Sen. McCain had specifically cited several of Palin ’s earmarks on his annual list of wasteful pork - barrel spending .
In 2001 , for instance , McCain 's list included a $ 500,000 earmark for a public transportation project in Wasilla , and in 2002 , he criticized $ 1 million targeted for an emergency communications center that Palin sought but local law enforcement said was redundant and a source of confusion .
Remaking Palin Now , however , Palin has been transformed into a maverick reformer .
McCain ’s campaign even cites her experience as an abuser of the earmark process as part of the reason she supposedly understands why it must be scrapped .
McCain spokesman Taylor Griffin said Palin ’s successes in getting earmarked funds “ was one of the formative experiences that led her toward the reform - oriented stance that she has taken as her career has progressed . "
Nevertheless , Palin wrote in a newspaper column just this year that " the federal budget , in its various manifestations , is incredibly important to us , and congressional earmarks are one aspect of this relationship . "

Beyond the GOP 's reality - challenged speeches , there was the startling image of a nearly all - white convention – where only 36 of the 2,380 delegates were black , the smallest number in at least 40 years – rollicking in ridicule and bristling with animosity toward Obama , an African - American .
With their loud chants of “ drill , baby , drill ” regarding energy policy and boisterous shouts of “ USA , USA ” about “ victory ” in Iraq , there was a sense that St. Paul was hosting a convention of American Falangists , rather than that of a modern national party .
The whiff of authoritarianism extended to outside where demonstrators and journalists were swept off the streets in indiscriminate arrests .
What ’s less clear about the GOP convention is whether the Republicans are on to something , that perhaps the United States has crossed over into a post-rational society that cares little about facts and reality or serious policy ideas and respectful debate , but rather is a nation moved by anger and ridicule , fear and nationalism .

Is this why people say “ you ’d have to pay me to live in Alaska ” ?
In addition to being # 1 in pork barrel spending , Alaska is the only state that has neither a state sales tax nor any personal income or capital gains taxes .
A few weeks ago , Gov. Palin arranged a special $ 1200 payment to every Alaskan resident .
This is in addition to the roughly $ 2000 each resident already receives from the state .
This money comes from taxes on the oil industry in Alaska .
Tax and spend ?

The AIM profile is a dying art .
In this day and age of facebook and myspace , there is n’t much of an incentive to invest all kinds of time in creating a unique AIM profile .
I try to keep mine short and sweet : the link to my blog , list of sports teams I support , where I went to school , and a little shout out to where I live .
I would say my AIM profile is pretty typical of most other guys my age in its lack of insight into who I really am as a person .
I often find that girls ’ profiles on AIM , on the other hand , seem to make a more concerted effort at individuality .
The sad truth to the matter , however , is that every girl ’s AIM profile is exactly the same .
Be on the lookout for these indispensable elements of a woman ’s AIM profile :
Completely Unnecessary Variety of Fonts & Colors : I understand the idea that color adds variety to things .
A Monet would be utter garbage in plain old black and white .
But dear god , is it really necessary to have no less than six different font colors to prove your “ creativity ” ?
( Sidebar : it is a rule that girls have to change the default font style for chatting .
I dare you to name me ONE guy that has done this . )
At Least Two of These Four Quotes :
“ Dance like no one ’s watching , sing like no one ’s listening … ” Every single girl that has ever logged onto AIM has had this in their profile at some time or another .
Love Quote –
If she ’s single : “ If you ca n’t handle me at my worst , then you do n’t deserve me at my best . ”
If she ’s in a relationship : it ’ll probably be some Jack Johnson line like “ It ’s always better when we ’re together . ”
Obligatory Sex &
The City Quote – self explanatory I ’m a Whore or I ’m Desperately Lonely Quote –
If the girl is slutty , then she will have “ You are only as strong as the tables you dance on , the drinks you mix , and the friends you have . ”
If she is lonely and desperate , this will be something like “ The best way to love is to love like you ’ve never been hurt . ”
Obvious Indication of Relationship Status :
If a girl is committed to someone , she will list their initials usually followed by the date that they met and possibly a ❤ ( bonus points for another quote from above listed here ) .
If she is single , she will write a line about how much she “ lovessssss her < insert town name > girls ! ”
Blatant Stab at Her Ex That She Thinks is Discrete :
The way this is presented can come in a variety of forms , and yet the results are still the same ( and ever so obvious ) .
“ Never again ” or “ no looking back ” is common , although is often trumped by the song lyrics ripped from the latest pop heartbreak ballad ( Kelly Clarkson ’s “ Since You ’ve Been Gone ” works great here ) .
Word of advice ladies : just call the motherfucker out or just accept the fact that the internet world could n’t care less .
Token Mention of Local Sports Team(s ) :
This , much like the fairly widespread practice of girls watching football , is simply a tool to garner more male attention .
What she thinks – “ If I pretend to show interest in sports , he will want to spend even more time with me ! ”
What he thinks – “ If she likes sports , that probably means she ’ll blow me without me having to stop watching the game . ”
Third party observers are well aware that neither of these statements are anywhere approaching the truth .
Extensive Calendar List of “ Important Events ” : Going to visit that best friend from college ?
Do n’t worry , everyone on your buddy list will know !
Moving into that new apartment ?
Thank god I knew the exact date , I SO wanted to help you .
Spring Break in Cabo ?
OMG , I ’m sooooooooooo jealous of your impending pantie dropping marathon !
Plan on shitting in a bag five months from now ?
Thank god , I can start planning my future around your meaningless itinerary !
I ’m just surprised that this has n’t progressed to the point where girls post the date of their period in their profiles ( wait , that could actually come in handy ) .
I do n’t mean to be so harsh on all of the women out there .
I ’m pretty sure a very similar post could be written on the typical guy ’s AIM Profile .
But hey , let ’s face it , this blog is pretty much here for me to complain about things that suck .
For the small percentage of girls out there that do n’t fall into the cookie cutter AIM profile I have described here , my hat is off to you .
Although your uniqueness probably means that you are n’t very attractive , at least I actually enjoy reading your profile while I check away messages every three and a half minutes .
Just like every good teacher , after a lecture I ’ll open it up for comments and Q&A .
Am I missing any crucial elements of the typical girl ’s AIM profile ?
This would also be a great time for any women out there to shed some insight on what the typical guy ’s AIM profile looks like .
Typical away messages for either gender will receive extra credit and one of those awesome “ Great Job ” apple stickers on your paper .

HNEFATAFL
The Viking Game
Article by Sire Bohémond de Nicée
I can play at Tafl ,
Nine skills I know ,
Rarely forget I the runes ,
I know of books and smithing ,
I know how to slide on skis ,
Shoot and row , well enough ;
Each of two arts I know ,
Harp - playing and speaking poetry .
- Earl Rognvaldr Kali [ 1 ]
These were the accomplishments of the noble of Viking Age Scandinavia .
Before the introduction of Chess ( Old Norse Skak - Tafl ) in the XIth and XIIth centuries , Scandinavians sharpened their wits by playing a game known as Tafl [ 2 ] .
Tafl in Old Norse means " table " and by the end of the period referred to a variety of board games , such as Chess ( Skak - Tafl or " check - table " ) , Tabula ( the medieval ancestor of Backgammon , introduced from the French as Quatre and thus Kvatru - Tafl [ 3 ] ) , Fox and Geese ( Ref - Skak , " fox chess " , Hala - Tafl or Freys - Tafl ) , Three Men's Morris ( Hræ_ - Tafl " Quick - Tafl " [ 4 ] ) and Nine Men's Morris [ 5 ] .
However , the term Tafl was most commonly used to refer to a game known as Hnefa - Tafl or " King 's Table " [ 6 ] .
Hnefatafl was known in Scandinavia before 400 A. D. and was carried by the Vikings to Greenland , Iceland , Ireland , Britain , Wales and as far east as the Ukraine .
The Saxons had their own variant , derived from a common Germanic Tafl game , which was apparently the only board game known to them prior to the introduction of Chess [ 7 ] .
COMPONENTS
Board
Hnefatafl and its numerous variants were played on odd - sized boards as small as 7 x 7 and as large as 19 x 19 .
Usually wooden , they sometimes had holes drilled in the center of each playing square , the pieces being pegged - this made for easy storage or even for traveling boards .
Most boards had the starting positions of the pieces marked in two distinct patterns to facilitate setting up .
In some cases , the board is drawn Go-style , the pieces standing at the intersections of the lines rather than at the centers of the squares .
The board itself is sometimes mentioned as Tafl or Tann - Tafl [ 8 ] ( " tooth - table , " a Tafl - board inlaid with walrus ivory ) .
A beautiful carved board with 13x13 squares was found at Gokstad in Norway .
This is a double sided board with a Nine Men 's Morris layout carved on the reverse side as with other less impressive examples .
Many other wooden
Tafl boards have also been found throughout the Viking and Anglo - Saxon world , but some of the boards were much simpler affairs being only marked out with charcoal or scratched onto the surface of slices of rock .
The Scottish ( Ard - Ri , " High King " ) and Irish ( Fidchell , Fitchneal or Fithcheall ) variants were both played on a seven by seven board , with slightly different starting layouts .
Fitchneal is mentioned in the Mabinogion and in Cormac 's Glossary ( IXth century ) ; the descriptions are scanty , so there is an element of speculation in assigning these games to the Hnefatafl family .
Tablut , the Finnish variant , was played on a nine by nine board .
Ard -Ri Fitchneal Tablut The King is the crossed piece ( ) ;
the central and corner squares are marked by an X
Hnefatafl , the Norse variant , was played either on an eleven by eleven board or a thirteen by thirteen board .
Two variant Hnefatafl boards
Tawlbyund ( or Tawl Bwrdd , " Throw Board " ) , the Welsh variant , was played on an eleven by eleven board .
It dates back at least to the Xth century .
The Welsh also played the seven by seven Irish game of Fitchneal , which they called Gwyddbwyll .
Two variant Tawlbyund openings
( as described by Robert ap Ifan in a 1587 manuscript )
Alea Evangelii ;
the gray pieces are the elite King's Guard
( from C. C. C. Oxon. 122 , a manuscript dating from the reign of King Æthelstan )
Alea Evangelii , finally , was the Saxon variant and used a nineteen by nineteen board - it was apparently the only board game played by the Saxons .
It takes its modern name from the opening line of the Xth century manuscript it is documented by : " Incipit alea evangelii quam Dubinsi " .
Some commentators suggest that this arrangement represents a sea-battle , with a King 's ship defended by twenty - four white ships and a fleet of forty - eight dark attackers .
Dice
The game was sometimes played with dice ( Tawlbyund , for example ) , which would either indicate the maximum distance a piece could move or whether the player could move at all or not ( move on an odd roll , miss a turn on an even roll ) .
The Irish called the dice variant Brandubh .
As a true game of skill , Hnefatafl is best played without dice [ 9 ] .
Pieces
The King piece was called Hnefi ( " King " , Old English has Cyningstan " King - Stone " ) ; the pieces Hunns ( " knobs " ) , Tæflor ( " table - men " ) or Tæfelstanas ( Old English " table - men " ) .
The Lapps call their Tablut pieces " Swedes " and " Muscovites " ( they were very similar to modern stylized chessmen , the Swedish King resembling a King , the Swedish Hunns pawns and the Muscovites bent rooks ) .
They sometimes had pegged bottoms that fit in holes drilled in the board .
The King was bigger and more ornate .
With the larger boards ( e.g. Alea Evangelii ) , the King 's pieces were sometimes differentiated , with a small , elite " King 's Guard " of uncapturable pieces .
There are many finds of board games and gaming pieces from Scandinavia and from the British Isles .
Gaming pieces were often hemispherical and made of antler , amber , bone , clay , glass , horn , stone , jet , wood or even horses ' teeth [ 10 ] .
Finds of several light and several dark pieces together have been made sometimes with a single piece being a different shape , like a sea urchin , in the same area .
For 9x9 boards , sixteen dark pieces surrounded eight light pieces with an additional King .
Boards with more squares typically had twelve light pieces and a King facing twenty - four dark pieces .
The colors were often switched .

The King ( large white piece ) goes on the central square ( Throne - Konakis in Finnish ) , surrounded by his men ( other white pieces ) .
The enemy ( black ) pieces are set up around the edges of the board .
Black moves first - except in the case of Alea Evangelii , where White moves first .
PLAYING HNEFATAFL
Turns alternate between the players .
All pieces move in the same way , like modern rooks at Chess .
That is , on his turn , a player may slide a single piece of his color any number of squares in either orthogonal direction ( up - down or left - right , no diagonal moves ) as long as it does n't jump over another piece of either color .
The Throne and the four corner squares are off - limits to all pieces except the King .
With the smaller board variants , pieces of either color may pass over the Throne ; with the larger board variants , only the King may do so .
The White player is trying to have his King escape his assailants by reaching a corner square .
If the White player moves so that his King ends up with a clear path to any of the four corner squares , he must announce that he has an escape route open .
The Lapps use the word Raichi ( " Check " ) to announce a single route and Tuichi ( " Checkmate " ) to announce a double route .
On his next turn , if he can still do so , the King may be moved to a corner square and escape .
White then wins .
If the Black player inadvertently opens an escape route for the King , the White player may take advantage of it immediately !
If the moved piece ends up sandwiching an opposing piece between itself and another piece of the moving color or a corner square , the sandwiched piece is removed from the board .
This is called custodial capture .
It is possible to capture several pieces in a single move .
White captures both black pieces
The King must be sandwiched along both axes to be captured .
The Throne , corners and edges count as Black pieces for purposes of sandwiching the King , so Black needs only three pieces to capture the King on the edge of the board or if he is right beside his Throne , two if the King is right beside a corner square .
When the King is in danger of being captured on Black 's next move , he must announce " Watch your King " to the White player ( this is reminiscent of Chess ' prohibition against moving one 's King into check ) .
Black wins by capturing the King .
The King can also be captured if he and no more than one defender are surrounded on all sides and incapable of moving .
In all cases Black captures the King and wins
A piece may safely move to place itself in sandwich between two opposing pieces ( or a corner square ) .
White can safely move in between the black pieces
WINNER
The winner is the White player if he manages to reach a corner square with his King , the Black player if he manages to capture the King .
Because the game is uneven , it is good etiquette to play two games , switching sides .
Each player keeps track of how many pieces he lost or took from his opponent and this score is used to determine the ultimate winner .
VARIANTS
STRATEGY
The King 's forces usually possess a slight advantage , despite being outnumbered .
Tactically , the defender ( King 's men ) must arrange for the King to escape the board .
Therefore , the defender should try to capture as many attackers as possible to clear an escape route , while not trying too hard to protect his own men since they , too , can block the King 's escape .
The attacker 's object is not only to prevent the King 's escape , but also to capture him .
The best way to do this is to avoid making captures early in the game , instead scattering the attackers to block possible escape routes . [ 11 ]
HISTORY
Hnefatafl started to decline in the XIth century with the rise of Chess .
It disappeared from Wales in the late XVIth century and from Lappland in the early XVIIIth .
Although the recorded rules are all post - period , there are no significant differences between variants of widely separate geographic location .
We owe the record of Tablut to the diary of the young Linnaeus , the Swedish botanist , who visited Lappland in 1732 .
Writings of the times mention various board games but it can be quite difficult to work out exactly how the game was played .
Among the many names for games known from literature we have Brannan - Tafl , Hala - Tafl , Hnefa - Tafl , Hnot - Tafl , Hræ_ -Tafl , Kvatru - Tafl and Skak - Tafl , although the rules for many of these remain unclear .
In any case the rules may have differed from place to place .
There are many references to Hnefatafl in Old Norse literature , from sources ranging from the poems of the Poetic Edda to saga references such as Orkneyinga Saga , the Greenland Lay of Atli , Hervarar Saga , Fridthjof 's Saga and more .
Most frequently these references are to the game pieces .
The earliest mention of the game appears in Voluspa 60 [ 12 ] :
Then in the grass the golden tæflor , the far - famed ones , will be found again , which they had owned in older days .
Rigsthula speaks of the noble child Earl learning to swim and play Tafl [ 13 ] .
From Hervarar Saga [ 14 ] come two riddles in the riddle - game between Odinn and King Heidrek :
Who are the maids that fight weaponless around their lord , the brown ever sheltering and the fair ever attacking him ?
Answer : the pieces in Hnefatafl ( in this case the brown pieces occupy the center , attacked by the white pieces ) .
And :
What is that beast all girdled with iron which kills the flocks ?
It has eight horns but no head ?
Answer : the Hnefi or King .
We know that women also played Hnefatafl from the reference in Gunnlaug 's Saga Ormstunga in which Gunnlaug plays Tafl with Helga Thorsteinsdatter , the granddaughter of Egil Skallagrimsson [ 15 ] .
Fridthjof 's Saga Ins Fraeki [ 16 ] has a game between Fridthjof and Bjorn , where comments ostensibly made about the game are actually answers to King Helgi 's man Hilding :
But as their troops seemed but few to them , they sent Hilding , their foster - father , to Fridthjof , and asked him to join the troops of the kings .
Fridthjof was sitting at Tafl when Hilding came .
He said : " Our kings send word to thee , and they would have thy fighting men for the war against King Hring , who wishes to fall upon their kingdom wrongfully and tyrannously " .
Fridthjof made no answer , but said to Bjorn , with whom he was playing , " That is a weak point , brother :
But thou needest not change it .
Rather will I move against the red piece to know if it is protected " .
Hilding spoke again : " King Helgi bade me tell thee , Fridthjof , that thou shouldst go on this raid , else thou wilt suffer hardship when they come back " .
Bjorn said , " Thou hast a choice of two moves , brother : two ways of saving it " .
Fridthjof said , " First it would be wise to move against this Hnefi and that will be an easy choice " .
Hilding received no other answer to his errand .
He went back quickly to the kings and told them of Fridthjof .
They asked Hilding what sense he made of these words .
Hilding said : " When he spoke of the weak point , he meant this raid of your ; and when he said he would move with the fair piece , that must refer to your sister Ingebjorg .
Therefore look to her well .
And when I promised him hardship from you , Bjorn called that a choice , but Fridthjof said that the Hnefi had first to be attacked , and by that he meant King Hring " .
Several things are lacking in these brief references : the arrangement of the board , initial placement of the playing pieces , and the rules of the game .
Archaeology provides some additional clues .
There have been numerous grave finds of game pieces .
One runestone from Ockelbo , Sweden , shows two men balancing a boardgame on their knees , which reflects the saga references where arguments over the game frequently cause one or both players to leap to their feet , upsetting the Tafl - board and scattering the pieces [ 17 , 18 ] .
Fragments of actual game boards have been excavated as well .
One board from the Gokstad ship has a 15 x 15 ruled board on one side for Tafl , and what appears to be a Nine Men 's Morris board on the reverse side [ 19 ] .
A magnificent Tafl board thought to have been manufactured on the Isle of Man was found in a crannog excavation in Ballinderry , West Meath , Ireland [ 20 ] .
Archaeologists had long recognized the similarities of these boards to those used for Fox and Geese , but this was not enough to reconstruct the Viking Age game .
Further clues were provided by an English manuscript from King Æthelstan 's court ( c. 925-940 A. D. ) which describes a game known as Alea Evangelii , which attempts to give the board and the arrangement of the pieces upon it scriptural significance as a harmony of the gospels [ 21 ] .
Again , no rules for movement of the men are given , but the manuscript provides a diagram showing the initial arrangement of the game pieces .
Robert ap Ifan in 1587 described [ 22 ]
Tawl - bwrdd as follows :
The above board must be played with a King in the center and twelve men in the places next to him ; and twenty - four lie in wait to capture him .
These are placed , six in the center of every end of the board and in the six central places .
Two players move the pieces , and if one belonging to the King comes between the attackers , he is dead and is thrown out of the play ; and if one of the attackers comes between two of the King 's men , the same .
The final clue to reconstructing the rules of Hnefatafl was provided in 1732 by Linnaeus , the Swedish botanist , in his diary of his travels among the Lapps ( Lachesis Lapponica ) .
In the entry for 20 July 1732 , Linnaeus described [ 23 ] a game known among the Lapps as Tablut , which is a derivative of Hnefatafl :
The Tablut board is marked out with 9 x 9 squares , the central one being distinctive and known as Konakis or throne .
Only the Swedish king can occupy this square .
One player gas eight blonde Swedes and their monarch ; the other has sixteen dark Muscovites .
The king is larger than the other pieces .
The Muscovites are placed on the embroidered squares .
( The board was made of reindeer skin ornamented with needlework as the Lapps had no cloth ) .
Rules : 1 . All the pieces move orthogonally any number of vacant squares ( the move of the rook in Chess ) .
2 . A piece is captured and removed from the board when the opponent occupies both adjacent squares in a row or column .
This is the custodian method of capture .
A piece may move safely onto an empty square between two enemy pieces .
3 . The king is captured if all four squares around him are occupied by enemy pieces ; or if he is surrounded on three sides by enemy pieces and on the fourth by the Konakis .
When the king is captured , the game is over and the Muscovites are victorious .
4 . The Swedes win if the king reaches any square on the periphery of the board .
When there is a clear route for the king to a perimeter square the player must warn his opponent by saying " Raichi ! "
When there are two clear routes he must say " Tuichi ! "
This is the equivalent of " checkmate " since it is impossible to block two directions in the same move .
THE ROMAN CONNECTION
Hnefatafl may be related to the Roman game of Ludus Latrunculorum ( " The Game of Soldiers " , Latrunculi for short ) .
During the Roman era , the Persians played a game known as Nard which may have been identical to Latrunculi .
It should not be confused with the unrelated medieval Nard , which is a member of the Backgammon family .
Many Latrunculi boards were found in Roman Britain , including some near Hadrian 's Wall , dating back to between the IInd and IVth centuries .
The theory is that the Celts picked it up from the Romans and modified it .
Their key innovation was to make the game uneven , with one side trying to escape the other .
The Latrunculi boards found vary somewhat in size : 7x8 , 8x8 and 9x10 .
The number of playing pieces found with them also varies ; there seems to have been simply a lot of them - Juvenal uses the word " mandra " , which simply means " cattle herd " .
Ludus Latrunculorum is first mentioned by Varro ( 116-27 B.C. ) but is probably much older .
It may in fact be in turn a descendant of the Ancient Greek games of Penta Grammai and Petteia .
Latrunculi are last mentioned by Macrobius around 400 A. D. , when he rebukes those that " played at Tabula and Latrunculi " .
Oddly , Latrunculi does not seem to have been played by the Byzantines .
Ovid tells us that the pieces were of different colored glass , sometimes precious stones .
He also states that a piece is taken by custodial capture and that " backward moves " were allowed .
Our chief source , however , is an obscure account in a poem known as Laus Pisonis which was written by Saleius Bassus during the middle of the Ist century A. D. :
Cunningly the pieces are disposed on the open board and battles are fought with soldiery of glass , so that now White blocks Black , now Black blocks White .
But every foe yields to thee , Piso ; marshaled by thee , what piece ever gave way ?
What piece on the brink of death dealt not death to his enemy ?
Thousand - fold are thy battle tactics : one man in fleeing from an attack himself overpowers him , another , who has been standing on the look - out , comes up from a distant corner ; another stoutly rushes into the mêlée and cheats his foe now creeping on his prey ; another courts blockade on either flank and under feint of being blocked , himself blocks two men ; another 's objective is more ambitious , that he may quickly break through the massed phalanx , swoop into the lines and , razing the enemy 's rampart , do havoc in the walled stronghold .
Meantime , although the fight rages fiercely , the hostile ranks are split , yet thou thyself are victorious with serried lines unbroken or despoiled maybe of one or two men and both thy hands rattle with the prisoned throng .
It is just possible some of the pieces may have been differentiated with increased power - some archaeological finds imply pieces in at least three colors .
These " super - pieces " would have been the inspiration for the Tafl King .
Dice may have been involved too - the Romans were avid gamblers .
SEEGA
Another clue to how Latrunculi were played is to be found in Egypt and Somalia , where Seega is still played today .
Remember that Egypt was within the borders of the Roman Empire and Somalia just outside .
Seega is played thus :
Each player has 12 pieces .
A 5x5 board is used .
The game starts with each player alternating placing two pieces anywhere on the board except on the central square .
Each square may be occupied by no more than one piece .
No captures may be made during that phase .
A Seega board after all of the players ' pieces have been placed
Once all 24 pieces are on the board , all pieces move one space orthogonally in any direction , as long as the destination square is empty .
The player who placed the last two stones goes first .
Enemy pieces are taken by custodial capture - by being sandwiched between two of one 's own pieces along one axis .
Multiple captures may result from a single move .
A piece may sandwich itself between enemy pieces without being taken .
A piece on the central square is safe from capture .
Whenever a player captures an enemy piece , he may move the capturing piece again if this leads to another capture .
If a player is without any possible moves , his opponent must move again and make an opening for him .
The winner is the player with the most pieces left on the board once each player has built an impregnable barrier or a player is wiped out .
Draws are frequent .
Variants are played on 7x7 or 9x9 boards , with each player having then 24 or 40 pieces .
High Jump is a variant of Seega where the capture is by jump , just like in Checkers .
RECONSTRUCTED RULES FOR LATRUNCULI
Each player has 16 pieces ( black and white ) .
An 8x7 board is used , the players sitting with the short distance between them .
Option : Use an 8x8 board .
The game starts with each player alternating placing a piece anywhere on the board .
Each square may be occupied by no more than one piece .
No captures may be made during that phase .
Option : Each player starts with his pieces in the two rows of his end of the board .
A Latrunculi board using the fixed set - up ( without Ducis )
All pieces move one space orthogonally in any direction , as long as the destination square is empty .
Option :
All pieces move as chess rooks , sliding any number of spaces orthogonally as long as it does n't jump over another piece .
Further Option : Dice are used to indicate how far the piece may move .
Enemy pieces are taken by custodial capture - by being sandwiched between two of one 's own pieces along one axis or by being sandwiched in a corner of the board between two of one 's own pieces .
Multiple captures may result from a single move .
A piece may sandwich itself between enemy pieces without being taken .
Whenever a player captures an enemy piece , he moves again .
The game ends when a player loses all of his pieces or when a situation develops where neither player can capture any opposing piece ( within 30 moves ) .
The winner is then the player with the most pieces left on the board .
Ducis Variant :
Each player exchanges two normal pieces for a special piece , a Dux ( blue and yellow , respectively ; plural Ducis ) .
The board is now oriented so that the long distance lies between the players .
The Ducis are placed last .
When using the fixed set - up , each player 's
Dux goes in the middle square of the third row , whilst the second row 's extremities are left vacant .
A Latrunculi board using the fixed set - up ( with Ducis )
A Dux may jump over a single enemy piece , landing on an empty square beyond .
This does not constitute a capture unless the Dux sandwiches an enemy piece between its landing square and one of its own men .
The Ducis ' jumping power allow them to penetrate a defensive position and possibly start a series of captures from within a walled stronghold .
Ducis can be captured normally .
CONSTRUCTION OF AN HNEFATAFL BOARD
The board I made was designed as a small , portable version .
Wooden components were obtained from a hobby supply store .
The pegged pieces of the dark player were stained .
The board had holes drilled into it , then a grid was outlined in pencil , along with decorations , before being graven by my Lady .
The engraved lines were then painted .
A coat of varnish was applied to board and pieces .
A minimal set of rules was glued to the back of the board and felt pads applied .
Finally , a bag was prepared by my Lady to contain the game board and pieces .
The decorative pattern of fighting dogs was inspired by Celtic animal knotwork .

Contrary to what many books say , neither Chess nor Checkers ( a. k. a. Draughts ) were commonly played in the early medieval period .
Chess did not become popular until brought back by Crusaders after the first Crusade ( 1096 - 99 ) and Checkers was not played until much later in the medieval period , following the wave of Arab expansion .
The Lewis chessmen [ 2B ] , although Viking , date to the mid twelfth century .
However , recent excavations at Dublin and York have revealed playing pieces shaped like Arabic Chess pieces , but with pre-Conquest style Scandinavian style decoration .
It would not be strange if the Vikings , thanks to their trading contacts with the Arab world ( via the Russian route ) , learnt this game earlier than other Europeans , although this is just speculation .
Chess certainly did not become popular or widespread until the twelfth century .

Several wooden boards for Tabula are known from the Saxons ' Germanic homeland , and metal fittings for boards of this type have been found from the Viking Age in Germany and Denmark .
The only known surviving British example of a Tabula board was found in Gloucester ; dating to the XIth century .
The decorated bone plates that once covered the now rotted wooden board and the playing pieces , beautifully carved from bone and antler , can be seen in the Gloucester city museum .
Playing pieces suitable for this game are a more common find .
[ 4 ]
Three Men's Morris is a close relative of Tic - Tac - Toe ( a. k. a. Noughts and Crosses ) .
Once each of the players ' three pieces have been placed , they move one square in any direction until someone wins by forming a mill ( row , column or diagonal of three pieces ) .
In a variant , pieces are allowed to jump over other pieces .
The Romano - Byzantine game of Rota ( Latin for " Wheel " ) is another close relative .
[ 5 ]
From the earliest times ( it was played in Ancient Egypt ) Nine Men 's Morris ( and its close relatives , Six Men 's Morris and Twelve Men's Morris ) has been known as ' the game on the other side of the board ' .
Several boards found in both Viking and Anglo - Saxon contexts have had Hnefatafl on one side and Nine Men's Morris on the other .
However the game has also been found in rather unexpected places - ship 's timbers , loose boards , benches , lumps of rock and , later , even on church pews and tiles .
We do not know which of the ' Tafl ' names was used for this game ( Brannan - Tafl or Hnot - Tafl ? ) , but the word Merels or Merelles ( from the low Latin Merrelus , ' a token , counter or coin ' ) is often used for this game just after Anglo - Saxon times .
The Old Norse is Mylta , " Mills " .

Dice were made of antler for the most part , although examples of bone , walrus ivory and jet are also known .
More perishable materials , such as wood and horn , were also likely to have been used .
They were often parallelepipeds , with the 1 and 2 on either end and the 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 on the four long sides .
These ' long dice ' are usually found in sets of two or three ; it has been suggested they were used for Tabula ( Kvatru - Tafl ) .
Others types were also found including modern shaped and numbered examples .
Although the numbers on opposite faces do not always add up to seven ( as on a modern dice ) , this arrangement is the most common .
One curious die found in Viking Dublin is a cubic die that has the number combination of 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 .
Its use is unknown but it is reminiscent of ' averaging ' dice used in some modern wargaming ( where the numbers are 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 ) .
The nature of the games played with dice is unknown , but simple games such as ' who can get the highest number ' were probably common ( and are suggested by some of the sagas ) , as were games similar to Liar 's Dice and Yahtzee .

Another type of gaming piece was made from slices of hart 's pedicle ( which must have been taken from a fully grown male deer carcass since this would not have been available with fallen antler ) .
In some cases these have been beautifully carved and decorated and often have a hole in the centre where the porous heart of the pedicle has been removed .

The Game Cabinet - editor@gamecabinet.com - Sire Bohémond de Nicée
There are many regions of a website which are necessary to be optimized if it is planning to rank better on search engines , visiting search engines use hundreds of ranking tips to check a site whether it ’s worth showing to searchers .
Though a significant portion of that usually comes down to the way the website is well - structured for ease of use and availability for search crawlers .
I have always believed that on - site optimization is 80 percent concerning value because it ’s a huge aspect that makes a site or its content usable to searchers ( if they are finding your articles useful or highly relevant to what they have been looking for ) .
I would say no if you asked me if this notion has changed over my two years practicing search engine optimization .
But irrespective of “ significance , ” a lot of facets are increasingly becoming more commonplace from the marketing procedures of a website , like optimizing it to get speed , sociability , usability , and conversions .
Therefore , I would desire to talk about with you some methods which might assist you in fortifying your search ranking plan by optimizing the website arrangement to increase its usability in addition to conversions .
1. URL Should Match Site Structure
You should also ensure the URL structure fits with your hierarchy .
For Instance , If You ’re currently selling a pink summer dress onto your own garment ’s website , your URL might look like that :
www.apparelstore.com/dresses/winter-dresses/red-winter-dress
The URL is broken down into Category → Sub-Category → Product .
This is easy for the crawlers to read and easy for your users to navigate .
2. Use HTML or CSS for Navigation
Avoid when designing your own navigation Ajax or JavaScript .
The best approach to generate the life span of search crawlers simpler to use HTML tags that are plain along with CSS for formatting .
Do n’t use images to make your navigation links but utilize text .
It usually means that if you ’d like to link in the own homepage into a category page , do not merely add an image and link it into but have a text link as well .
3 . Make use of Breadcrumb Menus
Breadcrumb menus are all crucial for search engine optimization .
Google has lots of times noted they must own a list on your pages so that users may browse the website .
When triggering menus on your website , make sure that the bread crumb menu displays your site structure accurately .
For example , when you activate a breadcrumb menu on a product page , it should have the following elements :
Homepage > Product Category > Subcategory >
Product page
In other words , the menu should display all levels until you go back to the homepage .
4. Create a Low Depth Website
Yet another factor of one ’s structure would always be to get a shallow website .
It indicates is that every page on your website can obtain in a couple of clicks .
For search engine optimization , you ought to be seeking to produce your website less or deep .
It ’s more straightforward for the site to straight , and the easier your crawlability , the more accessible Google will get your content and even rank it .
The cause of a shallow website will be really for fantastic User experience .
When a user is having trouble locating the information that they desire they proceed and could become frustrated .
As we understand , good search engine optimization meant by a lower bounce rate .
5 . Have a 3 Click - Maximum from the Homepage
The website is to make use of proper internal linking , ” says Colin Mosier of JSL Marketing “ One great tip to help Maximize the Search Engine Optimization structure of a Navigate around your website properly . ” & Web Design .
“ Internal linking helps link your website and allows users to navigate . ”
“ If you ’re linking your site , plus it takes too many clicks from the homepage to get to your subpage , this can have a truly negative impact on the user experience along with search engine optimization . ”
6. The Header Should Have the Main Navigation Pages
The header should list the main pages .
You may accomplish whatever you desire by doing so and adding any other menu elements becomes unnecessary and distracting .
Even though drop - down menus with CSS effects that disappear will give an exciting user experience , they do not affect SEO .
Do not make use of structure - based images .
The most reliable type of SEO continues to provide text links utilizing appropriate page sourcing .
Where a footer using menu links can use , duplicate the links of the most effective navigational menu at the footer .
Adding additional category lists or changing the arrangement of links will simplify the user experience and serves absolutely no function .
7. Use Internal Linking
Even though creating a depth website is just a fantastic strategy , this is sometimes hard , especially for a large site with tens of thousands of pages .

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the running mate for GOP presidential candidate John McCain , wrote e-mails that harshly criticized Alaska state troopers for failing to fire her former brother - in - law and ridiculed an internal affairs investigation into his conduct .
The e-mails , never before made public , were shown to the Washington Post by a former public safety commissioner , Walter Monegan , whom Palin fired in July .
Monegan has given copies of the e-mails to state ethics investigators to support his contention that he was dismissed for failing to fire Trooper Mike Wooten , who at the time was feuding with Palin 's family .
" This trooper is still out on the street , in fact he 's been promoted , " said the Feb.
7 , 2007 , e-mail sent from Palin 's personal Yahoo account and written to give Monegan permission to speak on a violent - crime bill before the state Legislature .
" It was a joke , the whole year long ' investigation ' of him , " the e-mail said .
" This is the same trooper who 's out there today telling people the new administration is going to destroy the trooper organization , and that he'd ' never work for that bitch , Palin . ' "
Asked about the e-mails , Palin 's campaign spokeswoman Maria Comella said that Palin was merely alerting officials to potential threats to her family and that there is no evidence that Palin ever ordered Wooten to be fired .
Bipartisan probe
Palin is under investigation by a bipartisan state legislative body that was authorized last month to look into whether Palin pressured Monegan to force Wooten from the state police force and whether his failure to do so led to his dismissal .
Palin had promised to cooperate with the legislative inquiry , but this week she hired a lawyer to fight to move the case to the jurisdiction of the state personnel board , which Palin appoints .
Her attorney , Thomas Van Flein , challenged the jurisdiction of Stephen Branchflower , the retired prosecutor hired to investigate and report back to the Legislature by the last week of October .
When Palin entered the governor 's office in late 2006 , Wooten already had been reprimanded , reassigned and suspended for five days for incidents reported by Palin 's family .
They had filed complaints in April 2005 after her younger sister 's marriage fell apart and the couple battled in a bitter child - custody dispute .
Palin has said that she discussed Wooten with Monegan only in the context of security concerns for the family .
Monegan has said Palin never directly told him to fire Wooten but that the message was clearly conveyed through repeated messages from Palin , her husband and three members of her Cabinet .
" To allege that I , or any member of my family ... directed disciplinary action be taken against any employee of the Department of Public Safety , is , quite simply , outrageous , " Palin said in a statement in mid-July after Monegan 's dismissal .
In August , Palin acknowledged that " pressure could have been perceived to exist , although I have only now become aware of it . "
During an interview Wednesday , Monegan said that as Alaska 's top law enforcement official , he took his duties seriously .
" I would willingly die for the governor , but I would never lie for her , " he said .
He showed two e-mails he received from Palin but declined to give copies .
The first e-mail arrived Feb. 7 , 2007 , after the governor 's husband , Todd , met with Monegan to press the case for disciplinary action against Wooten .
Palin 's family had accused the trooper of shooting a cow moose without a permit , Tasering his stepson , and drinking while driving a trooper vehicle .
After her husband met with Monegan , Palin followed up with a phone call to Monegan .
In the e-mail sent a few weeks later , Palin encouraged Monegan to testify for a bill that would require 99 - year sentences for police officers found guilty of murder .
Public trust
She cited Wooten 's case as an example of violating the public trust .
She recounted his transgressions , beginning with the killing of the cow moose using a permit obtained by his wife .
Molly McCann , who uses her name from a previous marriage , was with Wooten at the time .
" He threatened to kill his estranged wife 's parent , refused to be transferred to rural Alaska and continued to disparage Natives in words and tone , he continues to harass and intimidate his ex - even after being slapped with a restraining order that was lifted when his supervisors intervened , " the e-mail said .
" He threatens to always be able to come out on top because he's ' got the badge ' , etc. etc. etc . "
Palin wrote that the Wooten matter had contributed to " the erosion of faith Alaskans should have in their law enforcement officials . "
The second e-mail Monegan produced came from Palin's Yahoo address on July 17 , 2007 , after the local newspaper publicized a legislative proposal that would keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill .
' Double standards '
Her first thought about the bill , the e-mail said , " went to my ex- brother - in - law , the trooper , who threatened to kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this day carries a gun , of course .
" We can't have double standards .
Remember when the death threat was reported , and follow - on threats from Mike that he was going to ' bring Sarah and her family down ' - instead of any reprimand WE were told by trooper union personnel that we'd be sued if we talked about those threats .
Amazing .
And he 's still a trooper , and he still carries a gun , and he still tells anyone who will listen that he will ' never work for that bitch ' ( me ) because he has such anger and disdain towards my family .
" So consistency is needed here , " the e-mail said .
" No one 's above the law .
If the law needs to be changed to not allow access to guns for people threatening to kill someone , it must apply to everyone . "

The Russian government was facing one of the biggest tests of its market economy after it was forced to close its two main stock exchanges to halt a market rout that has led to the steepest declines since the August 1998 crisis .
The two main bourses , the MICEX and RTS , said on Wednesday they were suspending stock trading until further notice from the state ’s main financial regulator .
On Thursday MICEX said it had restarted repo trading from 0700 GMT , while the RTS exchange was trading futures contracts for goods , currency , and interest rates .
The move came after shares began to tumble again on Wednesday as investors faced a new wave of forced equity sales on margin calls and a dearth of cash .
Government and central bank officials were locked in talks with the chief executives of Russia ’s biggest investment banks throughout most of the day on ways to halt the market collapse , which has wiped nearly $ 800 bn ( £ 440 bn ) off the country ’s stock exchanges in a matter of months and sent stocks spinning down to levels last seen in 2005 .

The 200,000 processor core system known as Blue Waters got the green light recently as the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and its National Center for Supercomputing Applications ( NCSA ) said it has finalized the contract with IBM to build the world 's first sustained petascale computational system .
Blue Waters is expected to deliver sustained performance of more than one petaflop on many real - world scientific and engineering applications .
A petaflop equals about 1 quadrillion calculations per second .
They will be coupled to more than a petabyte of memory and more than 10 petabytes of disk storage .
All of that memory and storage will be globally addressable , meaning that processors will be able to share data from a single pool exceptionally quickly , researchers said .
Blue Waters , is supported by a $ 208 million grant from the National Science Foundation and will come online in 2011 .
Blue Waters will be based on what researchers called PERCS ( Productive , Easy - to- use , Reliable Computing System ) .
PERCs required research and development in new chip technology , interconnect technology , operating systems , compiler , and programming environments .
It will run a large and varied set of commercial and technical high - performance computing applications , researchers said .
According to the NSF the system may be used to study complex processes like the interaction of the Sun 's coronal mass ejections with the Earth 's magnetosphere and ionosphere ; the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe ; understanding the chains of reactions that occur with living cells ; and the design of novel materials .
The NSF said that by 2010 - 2011 , academic researchers will be able to access a mix of high - performance systems that : deliver sustained performance in the 10 teraflops to 2 petaflops range on a variety of science and engineering codes ; are integrated into a national cyberinfrastructure environment ; and are supported at national , regional and / or campus levels .
" Blue Waters will be an unrivaled national asset that will have a powerful impact on both science and society , " said Thom Dunning NCSA director and a professor of chemistry at Illinois in a release .
" Scientists around the country - simulating new medicines or materials , the weather , disease outbreaks , or complex engineered systems like power plants and aircraft - are poised to make discoveries that we can only begin to imagine . "
Blue Waters will no doubt expend on IBM 's supercomputing prowess .
IBM's $ 100 million Roadrunner system installed at the Department of Energy 's Los Alamos National Laboratory was officially named the most powerful and energy efficient supercomputer in the world in June .
Others too are building toward a petaflop generation .
NASA , Intel and SGI in May said they would team up to crank up the space agency 's supercomputing power , making it up to 16 times more powerful than it is today .
Specifically , NASA Ames , Intel and SGI will work together on a project called Pleiades to develop a system with a capacity of one Petaflops peak performance by 2009 and a system with a peak performance of 10 Petaflops by 2012 .
Back in November Facebook released a new product called Facebook Pages .
What I believed was the most important feature was the ability to add applications to Pages .
Since then thousands of pages have been created and everyday I see another friend that has become a fan of a product , person , or service .
There are still some serious issues with the Pages product though .
I experienced these first hand while launching the inaugural Social Ad Summit .
Ca n’t Send Messages
This has to be the most significant problem facing pages : you ca n’t send messages to fans !
Rather than using messages Facebook opted to use an alternative messaging system called “ updates ” .
The only problem with notifications ?
In any given day I get about 20 notifications .
The other problem ?
Most users do n’t read them .
If you create an event for your fan page , you ca n’t send messages to them either !
Instead , if you create an event for your fan page you will only be able to send them notifications with event updates .
This has to be the most backwards system ever .
I understand why Facebook does n’t want to let fan pages send unlimited messages but they should at least hold the same standard for events whether created by a fan page or a user .
Paid Promotion Only
Facebook encourages owners of Facebook pages to promote their page by purchasing Facebook advertising .
This contrasts Facebook groups in which any user ( depending on group restrictions ) can typically invite their friends to join .
This in turn contributes to groups growing virally .
Unfortunately for pages , the only viral growth comes in the form of newsfeed notifications .
It is an awkward balance that Facebook has for groups and fan pages .
Fan pages appear to receive a higher priority when it comes to news feeds .
Why is that exactly ?
Well Facebook arbitrarily decided it .
This model is also somewhat of a conflict of interest .
They want to make it easy to spread information but they want companies to pay for some of that promotion .
Ongoing Conflict
While Facebook needs to adjust their Pages product , it ’s clear that Facebook still has a lot of changes that need to be made .
As I said earlier , Facebook ’s model presents somewhat of a conflict of interest .
Imagine if Google was in the business of charging for placement of actual search results and not just ad words .
Facebook has an unbalanced emphasis on paid promotion and this is something that will have to be resolved as the company works out their monetization model .
Facebook should promote their advertising services equally throughout the site .
Whatever model Facebook plans on using for monetization , the most important thing is fully functional products .
Fewer than 3,000 English - language websites produce the bulk of child pornography images , according to the first authoritative analysis of the scale of the problem , published today .
The Internet Watch Foundation , which carried out the study , says an international effort to disrupt even a few of these " persistent top level domains " would block access to hundreds of thousands of images of child sex abuse .
Peter Robbins , chief executive of the IWF , a watchdog funded by the internet industry , said the study highlighted what was a manageable number of offenders .
" We hope that this revelation , and the analysis and intelligence behind the numbers will lead to a better understanding of the issue and justify the need for more international partnerships to pool resources and thinking in order to find solutions .
" A coordinated global attack on these websites could get these horrific images removed from the web and those responsible investigated . "
The IWF 's annual report says the scale and scope of online distribution of child sexual abuse content has been the subject of much speculation .
" We have traced less than 3,000 such websites during 2007 [ in the English language ] hosted around the world and this figure has remained relatively static for a number of years .
" The foundation processed 34,871 reports from the public which led to 2,755 top level domains with child sexual abuse content being assessed , confirmed as potentially illegal , traced and the appropriate intelligence being disseminated accordingly . "
Some IWF reports have led to prosecutions of child sex offenders .
The report says there has been a 15 % fall in the number of web pages and a 10 % drop in domains depicting child sexual abuse , mainly as a result of the internet industry 's attempt to police itself .
It claims that this shows the problem is not increasing , despite greater global internet access , faster connection speeds and the availability of sophisticated technologies .
But the increasingly extreme nature of the content makes disturbing reading .
The IWF estimates that 10 % of the child victims involved in the photographs or videos appear to be under two years old .
A further 33 % appear to be between three and six , with 80 % under 10 .
Of the websites assessed , 47 % depicted potentially illegal child sex abuse , including penetrative sexual activity involving children or animals .
Hardly any of the sites traced are based in Britain , with most located in the United States and Russia .
The study finds that only a very small proportion of the domains identified as active last year were constantly " live " , with the vast majority active for fewer than 50 days during the year .
" This shows the continuing trend for such websites to ' hop ' server regularly to avoid detection and removal , but also the effectiveness of efforts to make operations difficult , transient , costly and risky for offenders . "
About 80 % are thought to be commercial operations with the remainder made up of offenders using message boards to share abusive images .
Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said the UK internet industry 's commitment to voluntarily block their customers ' access to sexually abusive images of children online was leading to less content reported being confirmed as child sexual abuse .
" Around 95 % of those with residential broadband connections in the UK are now protected in this way , and I commend this and other positive steps taken by many companies , in conjunction with the Internet Watch Foundation , to better protect internet users , and internet services , from abuse . "
Jim Gamble , chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre , said its partnership with the IWF was crucial in tackling child sexual abuse material on the internet .
While the IWF had virtually eradicated this content from UK networks , the CEOP was able to focus on investigating those behind the distribution of such materials and safeguarding the victims , he said .

One of the premises of the bailout bill is that the banking industry must have government help to get back on its feet .
A banking industry expert , Bert Ely , who has a stellar track record in predicting crises and calling false alarms says that the banking industry can handle this mess internally and does not need subsidies .
The comments from Bert come in an interview at Institutional Risk Analytics ( the entire newsletter is wide - ranging and very much worth reading ) , First , IRA ’s recap of Ely ’s qualifications :
To get some perspective on the evolution of the last remaining large investment banks into commercial banks , we now turn to Bert Ely , one of the leading experts on banking and finance in the Washington policy community .
An accountant by training , Ely has specialized in deposit insurance and banking structure issues since 1981 .
In 1986 , he became an early predictor of the S&L crisis and a taxpayer bailout of the FSLIC .
In 1991 , he was the first person to correctly predict the non crisis in commercial banking .
In 1992 , he predicted an eventual taxpayer bailout of the Japanese banking system .
Here are the excerpts that relate to whether the banks need government intervention :
The IRA : And if our internal estimates at IRA are correct about the magnitude of the losses facing the industry , then the banks may not have the resources to deal with the problems alone .
What then ?
Ely :
That is of course the trillion dollar question .
I have run the numbers looking at the capacity of the industry to pay the tab .
Assuming that bank insolvency losses do n’t get way out of line , which I do n’t think they will , then the industry can handle it .
It ’s not going to be cheap , but the banks can handle it and clean up their own mess .
The losses will feed back through the industry to depositors and borrowers in the form of lower rates on deposits and higher cost of loans … .
The IRA : So you oppose the idea of the government putting preferred equity into solvent but troubled banks that cannot raise capital on reasonable terms ?
Ely :
Yes , it is not necessary , even now .
There is absolutely no need for the Treasury to have the authority , as you suggested , to “ inject capital into solvent banks that are temporarily unable to raise new capital . ”
If a bank truly is solvent , it can raise additional capital or sell itself , if its present owners are realistic about what their bank is worth .
The reason solvent banks have a problem raising capital , or selling themselves to a stronger bank , is that they set their price too high , as did AIG .
As an aside , I am glad to see AIG ’s shareholders getting whacked by the warrants associated with the Fed ’s taxpayer ’s loan to AIG .
There is absolutely no need for the taxpayer to subsidize banks so they can stay independent , provided no barriers are erected to prevent new entrants into bank or specific banking markets .
The IRA : Agreed .
We were referring to banks that could not be recapitalized or sold .
A sale is obviously the first , best choice .
So you would let the banks resolve their problems privately .
Would you agree with Ernie Patrikis ( ‘A Change in Bank Control : Interview With Ernest Patrikis ’ , July 9 , 2008 ′ ) that the Fed needs to loosen the restrictions on bank ownership in order to facilitate this process ?
Ely : I fully agree that restrictions limiting investors from taking significant positions in banks should be lifted .
Not only is the belief in separating banking from commerce invalid in an open , competitive economy , but we need to get ruthless investors inside troubled banks to get these banks and their bad assets cleaned up and / or sold .
That is what should have happened at AIG , but unfortunately did not .
The IRA : Precisely .
We want to see the bad assets remain in private hands , not in a government warehouse for toxic waste .
But why then should anyone support Paulson ’s proposal to place these toxic assets in the hands of the government ?
Chairman Frank seems to want to declare the jubilee and engage in mass loan forgiveness in order to ensure his permanent re-election .
Maybe we can just all stay home instead of going to work and Barney Frank will just mail everyone a check .
Ely : Look , all of the fallout we are seeing in the markets today is part of clearing the detritus from the last speculative bubble .
The housing bubble has to be allowed to collapse in order to clear the markets .
We have a very necessary correction process underway .
But this process creates a lot of pain and loss .
I do n’t like that , but we have to clean up the mess and take the pain in order to get the economy back into balance .
In collapsing bubbles you have collapsing companies .
Japan tried to muddle through and they had a lost decade .
I hope we are not going to do that …
The IRA : But that is precisely the point .
Why should Washington use taxpayer funds to rescue people who deliberately made bad business decisions ?
Ely :
This is the question that comes up frequently about Dick Fuld at Lehman and Kerry Killinger at WM .
When these guys were contemplating life , did they have any second thoughts , any doubts about these decisions ?
Did hushed discussions among the top folks in their organizations , with the senior managers and directors , include deliberations such as these or were they too arrogant , too isolated from reality ?…
The IRA : How do you see the Paulson plan unfolding ?
What should the markets expect in the next couple of weeks and months ?
Ely :
It is likely that Congress will not pass the Paulson bailout legislation this week .
However , whenever it is passed , it will be much more complex , and incorporate unwise punitive terms and conditions that will seriously impede the intent of the Paulson plan .
Further , I believe the process of pricing the assets purchased under the legislation will be much more complex and contentious than many appreciate at this time , which means that this program will get off to a much slower start than many anticipate , just as the RTC started quite slowly .
If the Paulson plan starts slowly , market forces may sweep past the plan .
It will be extremely interesting to see how this plan evolves over the next year , particularly given that a new Administration will come to power on January 20 .
Angst in Ankara Turkey Steers into a Dangerous Identity Crisis
Turkey 's highest court in Ankara ruled on Thursday that a law passed by Erdogan 's government easing the ban on headscarves at universities was unconstitutional .
The ruling is a precursor to a dramatic confrontation likely to emerge in the coming months between Erdogan 's Islamist - rooted AKP party and the country 's secularist forces , led by the powerful military .

I loved Nintendo ’s Mike Tyson ’s Punchout !
That was an amazingly fun NES game that consisted of great characters , moves , and experiences .
Each of the characters had their own story , fighting style and odd looks .
Below are a few examples of wonderful Nintendo craft of Mike Tyson ’s Punchout characters from the NES .
These were made using Perler Beads and simply look great .
Artist Justin Buonvino who also provided the Nintendo 3d Art images has made these Mike Tyson ’s Punchout characters himself .
In addition , Steven Bates , aka Zaghrenaut also has a few rendition of the famous NES characters … some also include reactions to being punched by Little Mac .
If you never played Mike Tyson ’s Punchout of the NES , or you miss it but do not have the Nintendo Entertainment System , you can play plenty of Free NES games on Firefox .
The Nintendo Characters
Art will be presented in the order Little Mac encountered them in each circuit , and the match :
1. Little Mac
The hero and fighter .
This newcomer has no fear and is challenging any foe that will join him in the ring .
Although he lacks experience , his passion and drive help him against his experienced and harming rivals .
Minor Circuit :
2. Glass Joe
The original and preliminary challenge for Little Mac. Glass Joe , named after “ Glass Jaw ” has poor offense , defense , and is just a stepping stone for Mac .
3. Von Kaiser
This German Boxing veteran was a Boxing instructor at the “ German Steel Machine ’ but provides little challenge to the hero .
Major Circuit :
4. Don Flamenco
A smooth fighter that tries to sweet talk his way to victory .
In the introduction , he dances with a rose in his mouth and seems to have a lot of charm .
In the fight , on the other hand , he tries to trick Little Mac into punching him at certain times , so he may counter with his uppercut .
5. King Hippo
This is a big competitor with an even bigger weak spot , which causes embarrassment if found .
6. Bald Bull
This Turkish fighter hails from Istanbul , and has a mean uppercut .
His most famous move is a bull charge , where he stands in the back of the ring , waits , and charges straight at his opponent .
If Mac ’s timing is off , one single uppercut can knock you right out .
World Circuit :
7. Soda Popinski
Not an easy rival , Soda is a good all - around fighter .
He employs great jabs , strong uppercuts and wonderful defense , making this fighter very difficult to beat for beginners .
8. Mr. Sandman
Mr. Sandman provide a fairly difficult challenge .
He is a not a newcomer to the ring , so he has great variety of moves to choose from .
Whether it is his great defense , many jabs , uppercuts , or combos , a fight with the Sandman is not quick or simple .
9. Super Macho Man
A bodybuilder at heart , Macho Man likes to taunt Little Mac with various muscle flexes .
He is another difficult fighter that has powerful uppercuts , easily throws in more than a few hooks , and a signature move entitled : Super Spin Punch .
Dream Bout :
10 . Mr. Dream ( Mike Tyson ’s replacement )
Mr. Dream is Mike Tyson ’s replacement in the game and revisions .
Since Mike Tyson has lost his belt to Buster Douglas many years back , his contract was never renewed , and so Mr. Dream came about .
This fighter has the same moves as the original Mike Tyson character and is a very difficult boss to beat …even for advanced players .
So which of Nintendo ’s Mike Tyson ’s character renditions is your favorite ?

Who ’s to blame for the biggest financial catastrophe of our time ?
There are plenty of culprits , but one candidate for lead perp is former Sen. Phil Gramm .
Eight years ago , as part of a decades - long anti-regulatory crusade , Gramm pulled a sly legislative maneuver that greased the way to the multibillion - dollar subprime meltdown .
Yet has Gramm been banished from the corridors of power ?
Reviled as the villain who bankrupted Middle America ?
Hardly .
Now a well - paid executive at a Swiss bank , Gramm cochairs Sen .
John McCain ’s presidential campaign and advises the Republican candidate on economic matters .
He ’s been mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary should McCain win .
That ’s right : A guy who helped screw up the global financial system could end up in charge of US economic policy .
Talk about a market failure .
Gramm ’s long been a handmaiden to Big Finance .
In the 1990s , as chairman of the Senate banking committee , he routinely turned down Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt ’s requests for more money to police Wall Street ; during this period , the sec ‘s workload shot up 80 percent , but its staff grew only 20 percent .
Gramm also opposed an sec rule that would have prohibited accounting firms from getting too close to the companies they audited — at one point , according to Levitt ’s memoir , he warned the sec chairman that if the commission adopted the rule , its funding would be cut .
And in 1999 , Gramm pushed through a historic banking deregulation bill that decimated Depression - era firewalls between commercial banks , investment banks , insurance companies , and securities firms — setting off a wave of merger mania .
But Gramm ’s most cunning coup on behalf of his friends in the financial services industry — friends who gave him millions over his 24 - year congressional career — came on December 15 , 2000 .
It was an especially tense time in Washington .
Only two days earlier , the Supreme Court had issued its decision on Bush v. Gore .
President Bill Clinton and the Republican - controlled Congress were locked in a budget showdown .
It was the perfect moment for a wily senator to game the system .
As Congress and the White House were hurriedly hammering out a $ 384 - billion omnibus spending bill , Gramm slipped in a 262 - page measure called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act .
Written with the help of financial industry lobbyists and cosponsored by Senator Richard Lugar ( R - Ind . ) , the chairman of the agriculture committee , the measure had been considered dead — even by Gramm .
Few lawmakers had either the opportunity or inclination to read the version of the bill Gramm inserted .
“ Nobody in either chamber had any knowledge of what was going on or what was in it , ” says a congressional aide familiar with the bill ’s history .
It ’s not exactly like Gramm hid his handiwork — far from it .
The balding and bespectacled Texan strode onto the Senate floor to hail the act ’s inclusion into the must - pass budget package .
But only an expert , or a lobbyist , could have followed what Gramm was saying .
The act , he declared , would ensure that neither the sec nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( cftc ) got into the business of regulating newfangled financial products called swaps — and would thus “ protect financial institutions from overregulation ” and “ position our financial services industries to be world leaders into the new century . ”
Subprime 1 - 2- 3
Do n’t understand credit default swaps ?
Do n’t worry — neither does Congress .
Herewith , a step - by - step outline of the subprime risk betting game .
— Casey Miner Subprime borrower :
Has a few overdue credit card bills ; goes to a storefront lender owned by major bank ; takes out a $ 100,000 home - equity loan at 11 percent interest Lending bank :
Assuming housing prices will only go up , and that investors will want to buy mortgage loan packages , makes as many subprime loans as it can Investment bank : Packages subprime mortgages into bundles called collateralized debt obligations , or cdos , then sells those cdos to eager investors .
Goes to insurer to get protection for those investors , thus passing the default risk to the insurer through a “ credit default swap . ”
Insurer :
Thinking that default risk is low , agrees to cover more money than it can pay out , in exchange for a premium Rating agency :
On basis of original quality of loans and insurance policy they are “ wrapped ” in , issues a rating signaling certain slices of the cdo are low risk ( aaa ) , medium risk ( bbb ) , or high risk ( ccc ) Investor : Borrows more money from investment bank to load up on cdo slices ; makes money from interest payments made to the “ pool ” of loans .
No one loses — as long as no one tries to cash in on the insurance .
It did n’t quite work out that way .
For starters , the legislation contained a provision — lobbied for by Enron , a generous contributor to Gramm — that exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight , allowing Enron to run rampant , wreck the California electricity market , and cost consumers billions before it collapsed .
( For Gramm , Enron was a family affair .
Eight years earlier , his wife , Wendy Gramm , as cftc chairwoman , had pushed through a rule excluding Enron ’s energy futures contracts from government oversight .
Wendy later joined the Houston - based company ’s board , and in the following years her Enron salary and stock income brought between $ 915,000 and $ 1.8 million into the Gramm household . )
But the Enron loophole was small potatoes compared to the devastation that unregulated swaps would unleash .
Credit default swaps are essentially insurance policies covering the losses on securities in the event of a default .
Financial institutions buy them to protect themselves if an investment they hold goes south .
It ’s like bookies trading bets , with banks and hedge funds gambling on whether an investment ( say , a pile of subprime mortgages bundled into a security ) will succeed or fail .
Because of the swap - related provisions of Gramm ’s bill — which were supported by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury secretary Larry Summers — a $ 62 trillion market ( nearly four times the size of the entire US stock market ) remained utterly unregulated , meaning no one made sure the banks and hedge funds had the assets to cover the losses they guaranteed .
In essence , Wall Street ’s biggest players ( which , thanks to Gramm ’s earlier banking deregulation efforts , now incorporated everything from your checking account to your pension fund ) ran a secret casino .
“ Tens of trillions of dollars of transactions were done in the dark , ” says University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy , an expert on financial markets and derivatives .
“ No one had a picture of where the risks were flowing . ”
Betting on the risk of any given transaction became more important — and more lucrative — than the transactions themselves , Partnoy notes : “ So there was more betting on the riskiest subprime mortgages than there were actual mortgages . ”
Banks and hedge funds , notes Michael Greenberger , who directed the cftc ‘s division of trading and markets in the late 1990s , “ were betting the subprimes would pay off and they would not need the capital to support their bets . ”
These unregulated swaps have been at “ the heart of the subprime meltdown , ” says Greenberger .
“ I happen to think Gramm did not know what he was doing .
I do n’t think a member in Congress had read the 262 - page bill or had thought of the cataclysm it would cause . ”
In 1998 , Greenberger ’s division at the cftc proposed applying regulations to the burgeoning derivatives market .
But , he says , “ all hell broke loose .
The lobbyists for major commercial banks and investment banks and hedge funds went wild .
They all wanted to be trading without the government looking over their shoulder . ”
Now , belatedly , the feds are swooping in — but not to regulate the industry , only to bail it out , as they did in engineering the March takeover of investment banking giant Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase , fearing the firm ’s collapse could trigger a dominoes - like crash of the entire credit derivatives market .
No one in Washington apologizes for anything , so it ’s no surprise that Gramm has failed to issue any mea culpa .
Post - Enron , says Greenberger , the senator even called him to say , “ You ’re going around saying this was my fault — and it ’s not my fault .
I did n’t intend this . ”
Whether or not Gramm had bothered to ponder the potential downsides of his commodities legislation , having helped set off an industry free - for - all , he reaped the rewards .
In 2003 , he left the Senate to take a highly lucrative job at ubs , Switzerland ’s largest bank , which had been able to acquire investment house PaineWebber due to his banking deregulation bill .
He would soon be lobbying Congress , the Fed , and the Treasury Department for ubs on banking and mortgage matters .
There was a moment of poetic justice when ubs became one of the subprime crisis ’ top losers , writing down $ 37 billion as of this spring — an amount equal to its previous four years of profits combined .
In a report explaining how it had managed to mess up so grandly , ubs noted that two - thirds of its losses were the fault of collateralized debt obligations — securities backed largely by subprime instruments — and that credit default swaps had been “ key to the growth ” of its out - of - control cdo business .
( Gramm declined to comment for this article . )
Gramm ’s record as a reckless deregulator has not affected his rating as a Republican economic expert .
Sen .
John McCain has relied on him for policy advice , especially , according to the campaign , on housing matters .
The two have been buddies ever since they served together in the House in the 1980s ; in 1996 , McCain chaired Gramm ’s flop of a presidential campaign .
( Gramm spent $ 21 million and earned only 10 delegates during the gop primaries . )
In 2005 , McCain told a Wall Street Journal columnist that Gramm was his economic guru .
Two years later , Gramm wrote a piece for the Journal extolling McCain as a modern - day Abraham Lincoln , and he ’s hailed McCain ’s love of tax cuts and free trade .
Media accounts have identified Gramm as a contender for the top slot at the Treasury Department if McCain reaches the White House .
“ If McCain gets in , ” frets Lynn Turner , a former chief sec accountant , “ we ’ll have more of the same deregulatory mess .
I like John McCain , but given what I know about Phil Gramm , I would n’t vote for McCain . ”
As a thriving bank exec and presidential adviser , Gramm has defied a prime economic principle : Bad products are driven out of the market .
In John McCain , he has gained an important customer , so his stock has gone up in value .
And there ’s no telling when the Gramm bubble will burst .
I recently took up bicycling , and like most people who ’ve been participating in a sport for a few months I ’ve developed many strong opinions , some of which will later make me cringe with shame .
My cycling background : in June I bought , for $ 95 , a 1987 Cannondale mountain bike .
I ’ve ridden it daily since , up and down the hills of New Hampshire .
Unfortunately , the saddle ’s a dud , making my genital area go numb .
I bought a gel saddle cover at Target , thinking it would help .
Actually , it made things much worse , and as I later learned from the late Sheldon Brown ’s website you do n’t necessarily want a soft gel saddle unless you use your bike for short outings .
I did some research and found out about tensioned leather saddles ( what they apparently used to call simply “ saddles ” before about 1985 ) .
My father did a lot of biking in the 1970s , a time when all you needed to win the Tour de France was a nice wool jersey , a wind - deflecting moustache , and a broken - in leather saddle .
As it happened , my dad kept his old road bike , complete with an Ideale saddle .
I tried it out , loved it , and ordered a Brooks Champion Flyer the next day ( Ideale , a French saddle maker , is gone ) .
Brooks is an English company that started out making saddles for horses in the 1800s , and has been making leather goods without cessation since then .
The Champion Flyer ( a name which evokes either a 1950s spaceship or a modern - day Japanese video game writer ’s idea of an American baseball team name ) is a sprung saddle , a version of Brooks ’ famous B17 with a couple of fat steel springs under the seat .
My Cannondale , because it dates back to the Reagan era , has no shock absorbers , plus it ’s aluminum ( which supposedly gives a harsh ride ) , so I ’ve been grateful for these springs .
Pre -Brooks bumps felt like getting punched in the groin ; now they feel like getting punched much more softly in the groin .
The saddle was comfortable from the beginning and after about 200 miles I do n’t notice it at all — no numbness , no horrible sores or rashes , no heat .
During my ( now much longer ) daily rides it melts into air and allows me to focus totally on my pedaling form or on the analysis of conversational gaffes I made from 1991 to 2005 .
If you search the Internet for Brooks saddles you will find a rather interesting debate : most people seem to like Brooks , but others hate them and are very vocal about why .
People who post comments about bicycles on the web fall into two categories :
1. Novices asking for advice , which they will ignore completely .
These people are extremely entertaining because they do n’t want to pay for or learn about anything , yet they supposedly want to know what they should buy and how to perform bicycle maintenance .
2 . Incredibly condescending guys who claim to bicycle tens of thousands of miles as a matter of routine yet who somehow find time to respond to questions on the Internet all day .
These people get into very entertaining fights about gear ratios or the minutia of bicycle tuning in which everyone participating in the argument will think that everyone else is completely wrong .
Anyway , these people have taken up the Brooks / no Brooks debate with a zeal and intensity rarely seen outside the rugby field .
Opponents claim that Brooks saddles require too much maintenance .
Remember that this is coming from people who routinely spend $ 40 to buy a plastic tank that cleans their bicycle chains by laving them with carcinogenic chemicals .
Surely a $ 4.50 bar of saddle soap will not tax the income or ingenuity of enthusiasts who will spend almost $ 100 for a carbon - fiber water bottle holder ?
They also bemoan the fact that leather saddles have no defense against the rain .
Apparently the technology of the plastic shopping bag eludes them .
The best part of the Brooks debate is the issue of “ break - in . ”
Apparently at some point the bicycling equipment community decided that leather saddles needed to mold to the rider ’s anatomy before they were comfortable for long distances .
It ’s true that a well - used leather saddle will conform to its rider after several hundred or thousand miles , but in my experience ( and in advice direct from the Brooks company ) the saddles should be comfortable immediately .
But bicycling nerds are n’t satisfied with Brooks ’ advice to ride the saddles diligently for a while ; no , they need performance and they need it now ( forget , for the moment , that Brooks saddles generally weigh several pounds and would be as likely to appear on a racing bike as a bell or a plastic basket ) .
So they have assembled a whole arsenal of more or less moronic methods of hastening the break - in .
These range from the benign , using a little Lexol to protect the leather and start it softening ; to the eccentric , beating the saddle with a lead pipe to make it less stiff ; and to the plainly depraved , soaking the saddle in water and going over it with steel wool , then using shoe dye to “ seal ” the pores , whatever that means .
From my somewhat naïve perspective it looks like the Brooks debate attitude pervades the coverage of biking on the Internet .
Nerds typically dominate the discussion , but I can see why they ’d be drawn to bicycles .
What other sport rewards a knowledge of math and geometry more directly than bicycling ?
My experience of bicycles for the first 26 years of my life was that they were sort of dirty pieces of furniture that could be ridden around without any specialized clothing or lubricants or technique .
But this furor over Brooks led me into a world in which people review undershirts and cereal bars with a totally straight face .
A cycling computer is considered mandatory equipment , and a bicycle weighing only 20 pounds and costing under $ 2000 rates below the “ enthusiast ” level .
I ’ve read over and over that the rider matters much more than the bike , but my god !
This fervor for a technological cure !
It ’s infectious .
I look askance at my 21 - year - old bike and I ’m sure it wo n’t be long before I shell out a car payment or two on something much fancier .
And this whole eulogy to the Brooks is , after all , praise of the technical merits of a consumer good .
Anyway , out there on the roads I adore my Brooks saddle , and bicyclists who are sort of plump , into leather , or who enjoy making their bicycle look like an old man might ride it should also look into the brand .
It wo n’t make you ride like a doped - up Spaniard , but then again , what does

CBS Reveals How Pharmaceutical Companies
Twist Arms in U.S. Congress
" If you have ever wondered why the cost of prescription drugs in the United States are the highest in the world or why it 's illegal to import cheaper drugs from Canada or Mexico , you need look no further than the pharmaceutical lobby and its influence in Washington , D.C. Congressmen are outnumbered two to one by lobbyists for an industry that spends roughly a $ 100 million a year in campaign contributions and lobbying expenses to protect its profits . "

NEW YORK , April 1 , 2007
Under The Influence
60 Minutes ' Steve Kroft Reports On Drug Lobbyists ' Role
In Passing Bill That Keeps Drug Prices High
If you have ever wondered why the cost of prescription drugs in the United States are the highest in the world or why it 's illegal to import cheaper drugs from Canada or Mexico , you need look no further than the pharmaceutical lobby and its influence in Washington , D.C .
According to a new report by the Center for Public Integrity , congressmen are outnumbered two to one by lobbyists for an industry that spends roughly a $ 100 million a year in campaign contributions and lobbying expenses to protect its profits .
One reason those profits have exceeded Wall Street expectations is the Medicare prescription drug bill .
It was passed three - and - a - half years ago , but as 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft reports , its effects are still reverberating through the halls of Congress , providing a window into how the lobby works .
The unorthodox roll call on one of the most expensive bills ever placed before the House of Representatives began in the middle of the night , long after most people in Washington had switched off C - SPAN and gone to sleep .
The only witnesses were congressional staffers , hundreds of lobbyists , and U.S. Representatives like Dan Burton , R - Ind. , and Walter Jones , R - N.C .
" The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill , " says Jones .
" The bill was over 1,000 pages .
And it got to the members of the House that morning , and we voted for it at about 3 a.m. in the morning . "
Why did the vote finally take place at 3 a.m.?
" Well , I think a lot of the shenanigans that were going on that night , they did n't want on national television in primetime , " according to Burton .
" I 've been in politics for 22 years , " says Jones , " and it was the ugliest night I have ever seen in 22 years . "
The legislation was the cornerstone of Republican 's domestic agenda and would extend limited prescription drugs coverage under Medicare to 41 million Americans , including 13 million who had never been covered before .
At an estimated cost of just under $ 400 billion over 10 years , it was the largest entitlement program in more than 40 years , and the debate broke down along party lines .
[ Editorial note : Usually Republicans are against entitlement programs while Democrats support them .
Why was it the opposite in this case ? ]
But when it came time cast ballots , the Republican leadership discovered that a number of key Republican congressmen had defected and joined the Democrats , arguing that the bill was too expensive and a sellout to the drug companies .
Burton and Jones were among them .
" They 're suppose to have 15 minutes to leave the voting machines open and it was open for almost three hours , " Burton explains .
" The votes were there to defeat the bill for two hours and 45 minutes and we had leaders going around and gathering around individuals , trying to twist their arms to get them to change their votes . "
Jones says the arm - twisting was horrible .
" We had a good friend from Michigan , Nick Smith , and they threatened to work against his son who wanted to run for his seat when he retired , " he recalls .
" I saw a woman , a member of the House , a lady , crying when they came around her , trying to get her to change her votes .
It was — it was ugly . "
When the prescription drug bill finally passed shortly before dawn , in the longest roll call in the history of the House of Representatives , much of the credit went to former Congressman Billy Tauzin , R - La. , who steered it through the house .
" It 's just a messy process , " Tauzin says .
" I mean , the old adage about if you like sausage or laws , you should not watch either one of them being made is true .
It 's a messy process . "
Tauzin says that the voting machines were open for three hours " because the vote was n't finished . "
As for arms being twisted ?
" People were being talked to , " he says .
And of Walter Jones ' comment that it was the " ugliest night " he had " ever seen in politics in 22 years ? "
" Well , he 's a young member , " counters Tauzin with a laugh .
" Had he been around for 25 years , he'd have seen some uglier nights . "
It certainly was n't ugly for the drug lobby which invested more than $ 10 million in campaign contributions during the last election and has been a source of lucrative employment opportunities for congressmen when they leave office .
Former senators Dennis Deconcini , D - Ariz. , and Steve Symms , R - Idaho , and former congressmen like Tom Downey , D - N.Y. ; Vic Fazio , D - Calif . ; Bill Paxon , R - N.Y. , and former House Minority Leader Robert Michel , R - Ill. , all registered as lobbyists for the drug industry and worked on the prescription drug bill .
" I can tell you that when the bill passed , there were better than 1,000 pharmaceutical lobbyists working on this , " says Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich .
Dingell has been in Congress for 52 years and is the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which shares jurisdiction over Medicare .
He says the bill would not have passed without the efforts of the drug lobby .
" There is probably a lotta truth in it that the bill was stacked in their benefit .
And it 's probably also true that it was written by their lobbyists , " he says .
Says Jones : " You could n't even walk to the steps of the Capitol without having somebody , maybe one or two , coming up to you to say , ' Ca n't you change your vote ?
Ca n't you vote for this bill ? ' "
Why was the drug lobby was so interested in this bill and what did it have to gain ?
Ron Pollack the executive director of Families USA , a nonpartisan health care watchdog group , says it all boiled down to a key provision in the legislation .
It prohibited Medicare and the federal government from using its vast purchasing power to negotiate lower prices directly from the drug companies .
" The key goal was to make sure there 'd be no interference in the drug companies ' abilities to charge high prices and to continue to increase those prices , " says Pollack .
Pollack says there 's no question that this was prompted by the pharmaceutical lobby .
" They were the ones who wanted to make sure Medicare could charge high prices and to continue to increase those prices , " he said .
The drug industry says that competition among private insurance plans that service the Medicare program help keep prices low .
But Families USA reported in a January study that Medicare patients are being charged nearly 60 percent more for the top 20 drugs than veterans pay under a program run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .
For example , Lipitor , a popular cholesterol drug , the cheapest Medicare price is $ 785 for a years supply — 50 percent more than the VA 's price of $ 520 .
For Zocor , another cholesterol drug , the best Medicare price is $ 1,485 for a years supply .
The same drug only costs $ 127 a year under the VA 's plan .
Pollack says the VA successfully negotiates with the drug companies on price .
" Medicare could do the same thing , " he says , " but Medicare is prohibited from doing that as a result of this new Medicare legislation . "
" What was the logic ?
Or what was the idea , the rationale behind not giving the government the ability to negotiate drug prices ? " asks Kroft .
Burton says it was simply that the drug companies did n't want it .
" They wanted to make as much as money as possible .
And if there 's negotiation , like there is in other countries around the world , then they 're gonna have their profit margin reduced , " he says .
Before the vote , Congress was told the program would cost a whopping $ 395 billion over the first 10 years .
In fact , Medicare officials already knew it was going to cost a lot more .
Burton said he and others were misled .
" Within two weeks after the bill was passed , everybody knew it was gonna cost well over $ 500 billion , " he says .
" And many members of the Congress [ who ] had voted for it said , ' I would never have voted for it had I known that . ' "
Medicare Chief Actuary Richard Foster later told Congress that he revised the cost estimate to $ 534 before the vote , but was told to withhold the new numbers if he wanted to keep his job .
During a Congressional hearing , Foster stated : " It struck me there was a political basis for making that decision .
I considered that inappropriate and , in fact , unethical . "
Foster said the person who told him to withhold Congress from getting the revised estimates was Medicare boss Tom Scully .
Scully was the administration 's lead negotiator on the prescription drug bill , and at the time was also negotiating a job for himself with a high - powered Washington law firm , where he became a lobbyist with the pharmaceutical industry .
" He was negotiating for his job at the same time that the Medicare legislation was being considered .
He wound up taking this job 10 days after the president signed this legislation , " says Pollack .
It is but one example of the incestuous relationship between Congress and the industry , and just one of the reasons the pharmaceutical lobby almost never loses a political battle that affects its bottom line .
Former Congressman Billy Tauzin , who helped push the prescription drug bill through the House , did n't disagree .
Has the bill been good for the drug industry ?
" It 's been good for the patients whom the drug industry represents … " Tauzin says .
" In terms of profits — [ for the drug companies ] and volumes , yes . "
Says Kroft : " Your old friend , John Dingell , says that of the 1,500 bills over the last 8 years dealing with pharmaceutical issues , the drug companies almost , without exception , have gotten what they wanted . "
" Yeah … I would think he 's correct .
They 've done fairly well , " replies Tauzin .
Why has this lobby been so successful ?
The former congressman says he believes it 's because they stood for the right things .
If Tauzin sounds a lot like a lobbyist for the drug industry , that 's because now he is .
Just a few months after the prescription drug bill passed , Tauzin began discussions with the pharmaceutical industry to become its chief lobbyist in Washington .
He says it was one of several lucrative offers he 's received just before he got some very bad news .
" I got a call from a doctor in Bethesda who said , ' You got cancer .
And it 's extremely rare .
And it could kill ya . '
And then everything changed , " Tauzin says .
Tauzin had a cancerous tumor removed from his intestines and was treated with a new medicine , called Avastin , that had never been used before on that form of cancer .
The treatment was successful , and as a result Tauzin says he felt he owed his life to the drug industry .
After serving out his congressional term , he accepted a $ 2 million - a- year job dollar as president of PhRMA — Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
" There was an extraordinary moment when my wife literally looked me in the eye and said , ' Look , you 're gonna do well wherever you go , Billy … You got a lot a great offers …
And maybe you oughta think about working for the people that struggle everyday to try to invent the medicines that save lives like yours . '
" And that was a pretty important moment in my life , " Tauzin says .
" And it was the moment I decided that this was the work I wanted to do — headaches and all . "
Jones and Burton agree that the perception of Tauzin 's move is not good .
" I mean , when you 're pushing so hard for a bill that 's controversial and you have to keep the machine open for three hours to get the one vote necessary to pass it , and then , within a matter of months you go to work for the industry that 's gonna benefit from it , it does cause you some concern , " says Burton .
They are not the only ones cynical about the decision .
" You push this bill through that produces a windfall for the drug companies .
And then a short time later , you go to work for the drug lobby at a salary of $ 2 million .
That does n't look good , " says Kroft .
" There was nothing I could 've done in my life after leaving Congress that would n't have had — I did n't have some impact on in 25 years in Congress …
If that looks bad to you , have at it , " Tauzin says .
" That 's the truth . "
In fairness to Tauzin and former Medicare chief Tom Scully , they were n't the only public officials involved with the prescription drug bill who later went to work for the pharmaceutical industry .
Just before the vote , Tauzin cited the people who had been most helpful in getting it passed .
Among them :
John McManus , the staff director of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Health .
Within a few months , he left Congress and started his own lobbying firm .
Among his new clients was PhRMA , Pfizer , Eli Lilly and Merck .
Linda Fishman , from the majority side of the Finance Committee , left to become a lobbyist with the drug manufacturer Amgen .
Pat Morrisey , chief of staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee , took a job lobbying for drug companies Novartis and Hoffman - La Roche .
Jeremy Allen went to Johnson and Johnson .
Kathleen Weldon went to lobby for Biogen , a Bio - tech company .
Jim Barnette left to lobby for Hoffman - La Roche .
In all , at least 15 congressional staffers , congressmen and federal officials left to go to work for the pharmaceutical industry , whose profits were increased by several billion dollars .
" I mean , they — they have unlimited resources .
Unlimited , " Burton says .
" And when they push real hard to get something accomplished in the Congress of the United States , they can get it done . "
In January , one of the first things the new Democratic House of Representatives did was to make it mandatory for Medicare to negotiate lower prices with the drug companies .
A similar measure faces stiff opposition in the Senate , where the drug lobby is spending millions of dollars to defeat it .
The president has already announced that if the bill passes , he will veto it .

Drug Company Corruption
Google co-founder Larry Page says the time for delays has passed : he wants the Federal Communications Commission to open up fallow " white space " in the TV broadcast spectrum for unlicensed use , and to do it before November 's presidential election .
Page , who spoke at a Capitol Hill event Wednesday , blasted incumbent broadcasters for lobbying " against the public interest " to block access to the unlicensed spectrum .
Calling claims of potential interference with existing broadcast stations " garbage " and " despicable , " Page charged that FCC field tests this summer had been " rigged " against spectrum - sensing technology that 's designed to enable exploitation of white space .
The event , sponsored by the Wireless Innovation Alliance , highlighted how fierce the battle between white - space advocates and incumbent broadcasters has become .
Wednesday also saw the release of a statement from the National Association of Broadcasters that attacked Google 's pro–white space petition , which Page said has attracted some 16,000 signatories to date .
The NAB argued it gives short shrift to interference concerns , but Page dismissed the interference argument as a red herring deployed by incumbents anxious to stifle competition .
" It 's just garbage , " said Page , " It 's not true . "
Brandishing one of the freshly - unveiled Android phones for emphasis , Page argued that the benefits of increasingly ubiquitous WiFi technology — he estimated that a billion WiFi- enabled devices would be produced this year — stemmed from the deregulation of " a slice of junky spectrum thought to be good only for garage door openers . "
He called the 2.4 GHz band used by WiFi devices , " the worst chunk of spectrum you could possibly use " due to its limited range , tendency to be blocked by walls , and unsuitability for bandwidth - intensive applications like streaming HDTV .
Given the success of WiFi , said Page , " why we 're debating whether we need a little more unlicensed spectrum is beyond me . "
With the United States falling to 15th place in broadband penetration among developed nations , Page lamented that all the " static " on interstitial bands represented a " wasted resource . "
There are , said Page " a billion devices that are n't being produced today because the FCC has not acted . "
But his harshest words were reserved for the broadcasters , who he faulted for stalling the exploitation of white spaces , and who he said , " all benefit directly [ from the status quo ] against the public interest . "
Testing fairness
An August FCC field test of spectrum - sensing technology that is designed to enable white - space devices to avoid interfering with existing broadcast stations was , Page claimed , " rigged deliberately " to fail .
He implied that the " despicable " influence of the broadcast lobby , which has been " very active in this , " was to blame .
The tests had aimed to determine whether spectrum - sensing devices could detect the use of low - power wireless microphones in order to avoid those bands , but Page claimed the mics had operated on channels that overlapped with local television , which would have made their signals " impossible " to detect .
An FCC spokesman declined to comment on Page 's remarks pending full analysis of the test results , which have not yet been publicly released .
Page also complained that interference - avoiding prototypes were being " treated like it 's a finished product , like it 's a phone . "
If the FCC simply opened up the spectrum subject to a non-interference requirement , Page said , " the testing will happen once someone has spent $ 100 million to make a device " that operates in white spaces .
" If they just say : ' go , you can sell any device if it does n't interfere , ' " he argued , " people will write those checks ; it will happen . "
He also noted that spectrum - sensing could be supplemented by geolocation technology keyed to existing databases of regional broadcasters .
" This phone knows where it is to three feet , " said Page , " It 's not a big deal to know where you are . "
The event also featured an unscheduled cameo by Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) , a strong supporter of exploiting unlicensed spectrum .
Inslee said it was " clear that the white hats are on the side of white spaces . "
He scorned the FCC 's cautious approach , comparing it to demanding that the Federal Aviation Administration develop flight rules for airspace before a plane could be built .
Opposition to white space use , he alleged , reduced to incumbents ' interest in " protecting turf . "
Speakers on two other panels — including a representative from perennial Google foe Microsoft — touted the potential benefits of white spaces in greater detail .
Stakeholders ranging from small business associations to rural broadband providers to civil rights groups argued that unlicensed spectrum could provide for a number of needs .
Depending on the speaker , white space was portrayed as the key to bridging the digital divide , a way of introducing genuine competition in duopolistic broadband markets , and even an aid in saving the planet , as it could enable more efficient energy use by white - space - connected devices on " smart " power grids .
Several speakers suggested that white spaces represented the " last chance " to implement a national broadband policy that would enable universal access and robust competition .
Many emphasized the analogy with the 2.4 GHz band used for WiFi , suggesting that the innovation in that space over the past decade has been possible only because the FCC did not insist on knowing in advance how device manufacturers would make use of it .
Among the panel speakers was New America Foundation scholar Michael Calabrese , who addressed an otherwise neglected argument offered against white spaces by broadcasters :
The claim that auctioning white spaces for licensed use could provide a financial windfall to a cash - strapped government .
Drawing on a freshly - released NAF working paper , Calabrese argued that industry estimates of some $ 10 billion in revenues from a white space auction were based on a flawed comparison between the " Swiss cheese " of white space bands and bands in the 700 MHz range , which are suitable for high power applications only because they are buffered by vacant " guard bands . "
While an FCC spokesman would not speculate on whether the agency would move on white spaces by the November 4 deadline set by Page , he noted that FCC Chairman Kevin Martin had addressed the question at a commissioners ' meeting earlier today , and stressed the agency 's commitment to come to a decision " as quickly as we can . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Take - Two Interactive Software Inc TTWO.O said on Friday that " Pirates of the Caribbean " director Gore Verbinski will make a movie version of " BioShock , " its hit video game about an underwater utopia gone disastrously wrong .

The movie will be made by Universal Pictures , a unit of NBC Universal owned by General Electric Co GE.N , and John Logan , the screenwriter behind " Gladiator " and " Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street , " was in talks to pen the script , Take - Two said .
“ Gore is an avid video gamer and true fan of ‘ BioShock ’ .
That was extremely important to us in deciding to move forward with this project , ” Christoph Hartmann , president of Take - Two ’s 2 K Games label , said in a statement .
Take - Two did not disclose financial terms of the deal or other details , such as when the film would be released .
The company is the target of a $ 2 billion takeover bid by rival game publisher Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O .
Released last August for Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox 360 game console , " BioShock " won praise for its complex story , haunting art deco atmosphere and creepy characters such as Big Daddies and Little Sisters .
“ BioShock ” has sold more than 2 million copies and Take - Two is working on a sequel .
The “ BioShock ” movie deal is the latest sign of the growing importance of video games in popular culture .
Earlier this week , Take - Two said its “ Grand Theft Auto 4 ” criminal action game racked up more than $ 500 million in global sales in its first week .
That handily topped Hollywood ’s biggest film debut , Verbinski ’s “ Pirates of the Caribbean : At World ’s End ” , which pulled in $ 406 million in global box office receipts in its first six days .
Microsoft made headlines when it signed " Lord of the Rings " director Peter Jackson to produce a movie adaptation of its hit " Halo " video game , but the project was put on hold in 2006 when financial backers Universal and 20th Century Fox , a unit of News Corp NWSa .
N pulled out of the deal .

The documents were found on a train heading to London 's Waterloo station
More sensitive government files were found on a commuter train earlier this week , it has been revealed .
The Independent on Sunday says it was handed the documents , which cover fighting global terrorist funding , drugs trafficking and money laundering .
The files were found on the same day as the BBC was handed top secret papers on al - Qaeda .
A Treasury spokesman said the government was " extremely concerned " .
The Tories are calling for controls to protect secret official information .
The documents , about a meeting of financial crime experts , apparently include briefing notes for a meeting of the international Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) to be held in 11 Downing Street next week .
The papers were found on train bound for London Waterloo on 11 June , the same day that another batch of papers relating to intelligence assessments of Iraq and al - Qaeda were handed to the BBC after being left by a senior official on a train .
Our enemies do n't even need to hack into our computers , they apparently just need to travel on public transport
Keith Vaz ,
Home Affairs Select Committee chairman
Previous cases of missing data
The Cabinet Office and the Metropolitan Police launched inquiries into the documents handed into the BBC - the latest in a series of blunders involving sensitive official information .
But Scotland
Yard said it was not involved in investigating the latest case .
BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said it was uncertain whether the latest documents were also top secret .
The documents seen by the BBC should not have left Whitehall but it is not yet clear if the new files were permitted to have been taken out , our correspondent added .
" Some of the information is already on the public domain , but another lapse is deeply embarrassing for the government , " she said .
A Treasury spokesman said : " We are extremely concerned about what has happened and we will be taking steps to ensure that it does n't happen in the future . "
Documents returned The Independent on Sunday said it had returned the documents and would not be divulging any details contained in them .
The confidential files were said to include details of how trade and banking systems could be manipulated to finance illicit weapons of mass destruction in Iran .
They also discussed methods of terrorist funding and the potential fraud of commercial websites and international internet payment systems .
The government needs to get a grip in order to protect this sort of sensitive information and the British public
Dame Pauline Neville - Jones
Tory shadow security spokesman Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee , Keith Vaz , said people would be " alarmed " at this latest revelation .
He said that until an inquiry had established how the leaks happened , " no official no matter how senior , should be allowed to take classified or confidential documents outside their offices for whatever reason .
" Our enemies do n't even need to hack into our computers , they apparently just need to travel on public transport . "
Dame Pauline Neville - Jones , Conservative shadow security spokesman , said : " We 've now had eight major breaches that we know of in six months .
" The government needs to get a grip in order to protect this sort of sensitive information and the British public . "
She called for " cleared and trusted " supervisors appointed to " supervise handling of government information inside the machinery of government on a daily basis " .
The FATF conference is due to begin on Monday at the QE2 Conference Centre in Westminster , opposite the Houses of Parliament .
The FATF was established by the 1989 G7 summit in Paris to spearhead efforts to counter the use of the international financial system by criminals .
It has since expanded to 34 members .

Feel free to copy and circulate this letter — the author has given his express permission for same .
Thanks to another great Pennsylvania blog , MommasforObama for this letter .
The following letter was written by a friend who is a respected physician in his field .
It is chilling .
If the likelihood that John McCain would survive one term as President is this grim , we have to take the prospect of Sarah Palin ’s ascendancy as Commander - in - Chief that much more seriously .
Sarah Palin as President is no punch line , folks — it ’s the kind of thing that could signal the end of America as we know it .
* * * * *
Dear Colleagues and Friends ,
John McCain is a 72 year old man with recurrent melanoma , hyperlipidemia , degenerative joint disease , and recurrent difficulty with certain efforts at recall .
These are the limited facts the American people have had access to .
Over 1000 pages of medical records were shown to selected journalists for 3 hours with less than 48 hours of notice .
The only medically trained journalist was Sanjay Gupta , MD from CNN .
This is the extent to which the American people have been informed .
While I am certainly sensitive to the confidential nature of medical records given the anxiety expressed by many of my patients regarding the risk of lost coverage or lost jobs in this current health economic climate , there are certain exceptions for disclosure regarding public safety .
As John McCain knows , a pilot ’s records are comprehensively available for review by a certifying agency ( the FAA , I believe ) to insure the fitness of the pilot and the safety of passengers and the public at - large .
In the election of the President of the United States of America , that certifying body is the American electorate .
A recurrence of metastatic malignant melanoma would essentially destroy John McCain ’s capacity as the Chief Executive and the American people have yet to receive a full accounting of the facts regarding his actuarial risk .
If he has had regional metastasis , his risk could be 30 % or greater for distant metastasis to the brain , bone , and lung .
As you all know , melanoma is one of the most insidious , pernicious , and aggressive malignancies our patients must deal with and that we attempt somewhat pathetically to control with interferon , interleukins , and dismally active and terribly toxic chemotherapeutic regimens .
In addition , we lack the simple data to sensibly evaluate his cardiovascular risk as we would any septuagenerian in our exam rooms .
John McCain should be held accountable by the American people and its agents , the free press , to release without restriction the entirety of his medical records .
Any hesitation to do so would clearly imply that there are significant medical concerns about his ability to fulfill the duties of the President .
Sincerely ,

During her interview with the CBS Evening News that will air tonight Sarah Palin defended her joke about listening Joe Biden speak since she was in the second grade age by saying that her stump speech joke had nothing to do with age or John McCain .
She tried to sell herself as the new fresh face , but she is more like new Coke than new politics .
Here is the video :

I really have to hand it to Katie Couric .
She asks basic questions , but she is great on the follow up .
She does n’t let anybody off the hook .
When Couric asked , “ You have a 72 - year - old running mate , is that kind of a risky thing to say , insinuating that Joe Biden ’s been around awhile ? ”
Palin had no choice but to deny it and try to spin herself as the new fresh face , but the problem with using Palin as a fresh faced agent for change is that the guy at the top of her ticket is the exact opposite of what she is trying to sell .
Palin ’s answer about being the fresh face sounded almost robotic and did n’t match the tone of the conversation .
Her answer was a talking point .
The selection of Palin has caused a sort of split personality / theme effect in the McCain campaign .
John McCain could have selected a fresh face that fit in with the themes of his campaign .
He could have selected someone who might not have been nationally known , but had experience on an issue like national security or the economy .
Instead they chose Sarah Palin , who does n’t fit in with any of the campaign ’s themes .
I do n’t think Palin is going to be able to skim through a debate with Biden by talking about him as the Washington insider on Thursday night .
Debates are about issues , which means that Palin is going to have to get off of the talking points .
A bigger problem is that every time Palin mentions Biden ’s age or experience , people think of her running mate .
As you can see from the video above , Palin does n’t bring anything to the table that helps the campaign policy wise , so they are trying to sell Sarah the personality , but that wo n’t work .
I wonder if the McCain camp wakes up everyday and wishes that they would have added an economic expert to the ticket instead of an inexperienced , political lightweight , hockey mom ?
Three years ago , Gregory Lintner walked away with only scrapes and bruises from a Metrolink train crash in Glendale that killed 11 people .
One woman , bloodied and badly injured , called the Army veteran a “ hero ” for staying by her side as they waited for emergency crews to arrive .
He was OK , Lintner told everyone afterward .
He continued riding the train .
Then on Friday , the unthinkable happened .
Lintner , 48 , was once again caught in a deadly Metrolink accident .
This time , he was among the 25 people killed when their commuter train collided head - on with a Union Pacific freight train .

“ Last time , my husband came back , ” his wife , Michelle , said in an interview Monday in her native Korean , her eyes red from sobbing .
“ It does n’t make sense that I ca n’t touch him anymore . ”
At least three people who survived the Glendale crash in 2005 were on Metrolink 111 when it crashed Friday afternoon .
Willie Castro , 67 , of Simi Valley had made a vow to himself after living through the 2005 crash :
“ I said after that , I am never going to ride the train again , ” he said .

But there he was last week , sitting not far from the wreck in Chatsworth -- his leg feeling like it was broken after two men had carried him out of the train .
Richard Myles , 58 , a supervisor with the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation , had been more sanguine .
“ I thought , ‘ That ’ll never happen again , ’ ” he said as he recovered from surgery at a Los Angeles hospital .
Still , he bargained with fate , trying to make sure he always sat in the last car , which he thought would be safer -- a practice he broke last week because the train was too crowded .
And then there was Lintner .

In the moments after the Glendale crash in 2005 , he remained with an injured passenger , Patti Hudson of Idyllwild , reassuring her that help was on the way .
“ He said , ‘ Do n’t worry .
I ’m going to stay with you , ’ ” recalled Hudson , who referred to Lintner as “ a real hero . ”
Of the 11 killed in that crash , eight were in their car .
Lintner continued to stay in touch with his fellow passengers , meeting occasionally with other survivors .
He carried newspaper clippings about the Glendale crash and closely followed the criminal trial of the man who caused the accident by parking his truck on the railroad tracks .
He could n’t put it behind him , his family said .
“ He told me he never got off that train , ” Michelle Lintner said .
It was only recently that her husband began showing signs of coming out of what she called his emotional “ coma . ”

For about a month after the Glendale crash , Lintner wondered whether it was a good idea to take the train again .
But his family said he enjoyed riding the train because of the sense of community he forged with other passengers and the time it afforded him to catch up on his reading .
So he decided to continue taking it to work .
But Michelle did n’t like it when her husband started meeting with other survivors of the crash .
She said it was unhealthy because she thought the group talked more about the crash than about healing from it .
She worried he would n’t get over the accident .
She recalled how he would have an “ allergic " - type reaction whenever he saw images of the crash on television .
She said he carried with him a newspaper clipping with a photo of Juan Manuel Alvarez , the man convicted of first - degree murder for causing the crash .
“ I do n’t know ” why he carried the photograph , she said .
“ Hate , probably .
Because that changed his life . ”

At meetings with other survivors , Hudson said , Lintner talked proudly about his 15 - year - old son , Andrew , a rabid Angels fan like his dad .
They would go to as many games as possible each summer .
A pitcher in a prep league , Andrew would practice with his father in a field behind their house in Simi Valley .
They enjoyed taking trips together to baseball stadiums throughout the nation .
One of the trips was to Wrigley Field in Chicago , a few hours ’ drive from where Lintner grew up in Beardstown , Ill. , family members said .
Souvenirs from their trips were kept in a glass case in the house .
Lintner had met Michelle in college .
He helped her with English and showed her his lecture notes .
She realized she was in love when she went on a 10 - day trip to New York and missed him dearly .
A year before graduation , he asked for her hand in marriage .
He treated her like a queen , she said .
Advertisement
“ We did n’t have money or nothing , but we just married , ” she said .
“ I thought that would be my life , forever with him . ”
After the 2005 crash , Lintner often tried to hide his pain from his wife and son .
He joked as he showed his family the dark bruises that marked the left side of his body .
There were also bursts of anger , but then Lintner would immediately put on a happy face when his son walked into the room .
“ He lied a lot to me , ” Michelle said , “ because I wanted to be back to normal . ”

WASHINGTON -- NASA 's newest observatory , the Gamma - Ray Large Area Space Telescope , or GLAST , has begun its mission of exploring the universe in high - energy gamma rays .
The spacecraft and its revolutionary instruments passed their orbital checkout with flying colors .
NASA announced today that GLAST has been renamed the Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope .
The new name honors Prof. Enrico Fermi ( 1901 - 1954 ) , a pioneer in high - energy physics .
" Enrico Fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds , " said Paul Hertz , chief scientist for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" His theory provides the foundation for understanding the new phenomena his namesake telescope will discover . "
Scientists expect Fermi will discover many new pulsars in our own galaxy , reveal powerful processes near supermassive black holes at the cores of thousands of active galaxies and enable a search for signs of new physical laws .
This all - sky view from GLAST reveals bright emission in the plane of the Milky Way ( center ) , bright pulsars and super - massive black holes .

For two months following the spacecraft 's June 11 launch , scientists tested and calibrated its two instruments , the Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) and the GLAST Burst Monitor ( GBM ) .
The LAT team today unveiled an all - sky image showing the glowing gas of the Milky Way , blinking pulsars , and a flaring galaxy billions of light - years away .
The map combines 95 hours of the instrument 's " first light " observations .
A similar image , produced by NASA 's now - defunct Compton Gamma-ray Observatory , took years of observations to produce .
The image shows gas and dust in the plane of the Milky Way glowing in gamma rays due to collisions with accelerated nuclei called cosmic rays .
The famous Crab Nebula and Vela pulsars also shine brightly at these wavelengths .
These fast - spinning neutron stars , which form when massive stars die , were originally discovered by their radio emissions .
The image 's third pulsar , named Geminga and located in Gemini , is not a radio source .
It was discovered by an earlier gamma-ray satellite .
Fermi is expected to discover many more radio - quiet pulsars , providing key information about how these exotic objects work .
A fourth bright spot in the LAT image lies some 7.1 billion light - years away , far beyond our galaxy .
This is 3C 454.3 in Pegasus , a type of active galaxy called a blazar .
It 's now undergoing a flaring episode that makes it especially bright .
The LAT scans the entire sky every three hours when operating in survey mode , which will occupy most of the telescope 's observing time during the first year of operations .
These fast snapshots will let scientists monitor rapidly changing sources .
The instrument detects photons with energies ranging from 20 million electron volts to over 300 billion electron volts .
The high end of this range , which corresponds to energies more than 5 million times greater than dental X - rays , is little explored .
The spacecraft 's secondary instrument , the GBM , spotted 31 gamma-ray bursts in its first month of operations .
These high - energy blasts occur when massive stars die or when orbiting neutron stars spiral together and merge .
The GBM is sensitive to less energetic gamma rays than the LAT .
Bursts seen by both instruments will provide an unprecedented look across a broad gamma-ray spectrum , enabling scientists to peer into the processes powering these events .

MPGuino : Open - source , DIY Fuel Economy Instrumentation for under $ 50
NOTE : The above readout may seem a bit unclear at first glance , but from left to right , top to bottom , here ’s what the information means : Instantaneous MPG , Speed , Trip MPG , Distance .
I took this photo after a short drive .
By now , we know about devices like the PLX Kiwi and the Scangauge II , but what about those of us who do n’t have 1996 or newer cars ?
How about those who do n’t want to spend $ 170 - $ 300 on instrumentation or prefer to support open - source projects ?
Well , the MPGuino is the answer !
A few months ago , Darin posted on the forums looking for someone to help him build an open - source MPG gauge for all fuel injected cars .
From there , forum member dcb stepped up to the plate and has taken the reigns in a really big way .
Nowadays , on release v0.66 , the MPGuino is a fully functioning , useful display that anyone with a bit of soldering kills can put together .
Building the MPGuino
The MPGuino is based on the arduino platform , and for it ’s tiny footprint I chose to base my build around the iDuino , even though lots of folks use the freeduino .
Since the iDuino does n’t accept the car ’s 12 v , I used a cell phone charger to convert to 5v and wired directly to the board .
Everything else , down to the LCD , which I bought on ebay , is pretty standard to the build .
For more of the basic , check out the release one thread .
Anyway , here was my parts list and aproximate prices :
– iDuino : $ 20
– HD 44780 LCD : $ 10
– Parts from ratshack : $ 6 - 7
– Auto cell charger : $ 5 ( at the dollar store )
Total : $ 42-43
It ’d be a bit cheaper with a freeduino and some parts you might have laying around or found online , but I was trying to slap this together quickly .
Anyway , on to the assembly !
The first thing I did was follow the iDuino assembly instructions , posted and annotated by the makers of the kit .
However , I did n’t insert the jumper pins because I found it easier to just run the wires I would be connecting through the holes and soldering directly .
From there , go ahead and follow the wiring instructions from this image :
My button and component board is a little ugly , but here ’s what it ended up looking like :
The next step from here would be to find a project box and try to clean up the mounting a bit , but I have n’t quite gotten to that part yet .
Anyway , with the physical unit put together , go ahead and download the arduino 11 platform to your computer and then test out some of the sample programs .
If it is n’t broken ( hopefully it is n’t ! ) , go ahead and upload the latest MPGuino software and make sure that everything is working .
That ’s about it !
The next is to wire it into the car .
I disassembled the cigarette lighter cell charger like this and wired it into one of the spare spots on my fuse box so that it would be powered whenever the key was in I or II .
From there I simply tapped into the speed sensor wire and fuel injector wire , which I ’ll leave up to you to find on your own car , though some suggestions can be found here .
The next step is to power up the MPGuino in your car and figure out how to use it .
Using the MPGuino
Luckily , there ’s really not much to using the MPGuino .
The first thing you need to do is go ahead and figure out the calibration figures for your car .
I ’m told that most Japanese makes will use 8204 for the speed sensor and that many American makes will use 10000 .
However , it ’s easy enough to compare the distance on the MPGuino to your odometer in order to see if any adjustments need to be made .
The fuel variable is a bit trickier .
Some of them have been figured out , so I would search and then ask , but if your car has n’t seen the likes of the MPGuino before , you might be the pioneer who figures out the numbers for a perfect calibration .
The trick here is to simply keep track of your tank mileage on the MPGuino and then compare it to a standard fill up and make adjustments based on the percentage you ’re off from the pump fill .
I ’ll be the first to admit calibration can be a pain in the ass , but luckily it ’d already been done for me .
After that ’s out of the way , you can check out your mileage by simply using your three buttons to scroll through the screens .
See more about that here .
Personally , I tend to use the instant / current screen the most , and when I ’m on longer trips or trips where the sun will hurt visibility on the screen , I use the big instantaneous numbers .
Anyway , this is really were the fun begins .
The MPGuino in conjunction with your EcoDriving skills will net some good numbers ( see first image ) .
Limitations of the MPGuino
As of writing ( v0.66 ) , the MPGuino has a few issues , the biggest of which is that you have to do all the assembly yourself .
That ’s not a problem for a lot of us , but for the MPGuino to go more mainstream we ’ll have to figure out how to make it more accessible to your average ecomodder .
What ’s more , the LCD leaves a little to be desired in terms of readability in the sunlight .
However , a solution is currently being worked on .
For more issues , and more up - to - date issues , check this thread or more generally look around the MPGuino forum .
Places for MPGuino Improvement
Luckily , the MPGuino ’s faults all play into it ’s biggest asset : open - source .
Sure , I may want an AFR display , but all that means is that I ’ll have to do it or find someone smarter to do it for me .
Though limited by hardware ( but only to a small degree , platform changes are always a possibility ) , everything else is up in the air with the MPGuino and anyone can edit the code .
If you ’re interested , check it out for yourself in the Arduino 11 environment .
Well , I hope you ’ll find this useful .
If you have any questions or knowledge , do n’t hesitate to post in the forums , open - source relies on all you to test and help improve the project !

... contrary to the White House 's contention , this plan does not help Main Street .
" This is Wall Street in big trouble and sucking in Main Street , now , and dumping all the bills on Main Street .
...
And you can't solve the problem of inflation , which is the creation of money and credit out of thin air , by more money and credit out of thin air , and not changing policy .
We have to change basic policy .
" Yes , it would be painful , but it would n't last so long .
What they 're doing now , they 're propping up a failed system so the agony lasts longer .
They 're doing exactly what we did in the Depression . "
" So , yes , there are going to be losses , but everybody lived beyond their means when the prices of houses were going up .
Nobody cared about it .
They kept borrowing against it .
Oh , yes , that was fine and dandy .
Everybody was making money , and the owner of the home kept borrowing and living beyond their means .
Now they have to live beneath their means .
" What the government is doing now -- and this new program is trying to prop up prices .
You want the price structure to adjust .
You want the price of houses to go down .
You do n't want to fix the price of housing .
You can't price - fix .
We 've had too much of that .
" We need a market economy .
We need to believe in ourselves .
We need to believe and understand how the economy got us -- how the government got us into this mess .
And believe me , it would n't be that tough .
It would be a bad year .
But , this way , it 's going to be a bad decade . "
While the Republicans were nominating Sarah Palin  who reportedly believes the Bush - Cheney war of aggression against Iraq was inevitable , part of " God ’s plan "  French President Nicolas Sarkozy was in Damascus , warning the " leaders of Syria , Turkey and Qatar " that an Israeli attack on Iran also appears to be inevitable .
In comments broadcast on Syrian television , Sarkozy said
" One day  whatever the Israeli government  we could find one morning that Israel has struck .
" The question is not whether it would be legitimate , whether it would be intelligent .
What will we do at that moment ? "
Now , it is somewhat encouraging that Sarkozy apparently does n’t agree that illegitimate irrational acts are parts of " God ’s plan . "
But , according to Sarkozy , there seems to be nothing we mortals can do to prevent an Israeli attack on Iran .
However , the Russians just may have seriously upset their plans .
According to UPI 's Arnaud de Borchgrave , the special relationship Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has with the Cheney Cabal and with certain Israelis resulted in a secret agreement " earmarking " two military airfields in southern Georgia for regular use by Israeli unmanned aircraft for spying on Russia and Iran , and for special use by U.S. - supplied Israeli fighter - bombers , in the event the paranoid Israelis decide to launch an illegitimate ( under international law ) attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , all currently subject to a Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
But , in driving Georgian invasion troops out of Ossetia , pursuing them back into Georgia , proper , the Russians briefly occupied those two military airfields and reportedly destroyed most of the U.S. and Israeli equipment they found there ( and elsewhere ) , perhaps creating serious obstacles to the near - term implementation of the Israeli " bomb - bomb Iran " game - plan .
You see , the new " sovereign " state of Iraq had prohibited the Israelis from penetrating Iraqi airspace in order to attack Iran .
However , if the Israelis could launch and recover their fighter - bombers from airfields in Georgia , they could avoid Iraq and the distance they would have to cover to their targets would be sharply reduced .
Of course , to utilize the Georgian airfields , the Israelis would have to over - fly Turkey .
However , the Turks did n’t lodge a formal complaint when the Israelis penetrated their airspace last year to destroy  in violation of international law  a site in Syria where the Israeli paranoids suspected ten - foot - tall North Korean scientists and engineers had been busy since 2001 , replicating their Soviet designed / supplied nuclear reactor , in order to produce plutonium for the Iranians .
The IAEA has since visited the site in Syria the Israelis destroyed and  as of this writing  have no reason to suppose the Israelis are anything but paranoid .
Here are excerpts from UN Security Council Resolution 487 , condemning the attack on , and destruction of , Iraq ’s IAEA Safeguarded facilities by Israeli paranoids back in 1981 ;
" Fully aware of the fact that Iraq has been a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons since it came into force in 1970 , that , in accordance with that treaty , Iraq has accepted IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear activities , and that the agency has testified that these safeguards have been satisfactorily applied to date …
" Strongly condemns the military attack by Israel  in clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international conduct ;
" Calls upon Israel to refrain in the future from any such acts or threats thereof ;
" Further considers that the said attack constitutes a serious threat to the entire IAEA safeguards regime , which is the foundation of the non-proliferation treaty . "
Of course , the entire IAEA Safeguards regime  which serves as a guarantor to all signatories to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has been under sustained attack ever since the Cheney Cabal came to power .
In a letter of March 25 , 2008 sent by the Foreign Minister of Iran to the Secretary General of the United Nations , and forwarded to the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Iran challenged the legality under the UN Charter of certain resolutions passed by the UN Security Council  at the insistence of the Cheney Cabal  which relate to certain resolutions improperly passed by the IAEA Board of Governors , also at the insistence of the Cheney Cabal .
In particular , on March 3 , 2008 , the UN Security Council  allegedly " Acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations "  perversely proceeded to " reaffirm " its " decision " of 23 December 2006 that Iran " shall , without further delay , suspend "
" a ) all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities , including research and development , to be verified by the IAEA ; and
" ( b ) work on all heavy water - related projects , including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water , also to be verified by the IAEA "
Which prompted the Iranians to send that March 25 , letter to the Secretary General , explicating the largely successful efforts of the Cheney Cabal to not only corrupt the IAEA Board of Governors and UN Security Council , but to undermine the IAEA Statute , the NPT and UN Charter , itself .
In particular , Iran correctly notes that
" Involvement of the Security Council in the Iranian peaceful nuclear program is in full contravention with the organizational , Statutory and safeguards requirements governing the IAEA practices and procedures .
" Furthermore , the substantive and procedural legal requirements , that are necessary for engaging the Security Council in the issues raised by the Agency , have been totally ignored in this regard .
" The Security Council has never determined Iran 's Nuclear Program as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39 of the UN Charter and , thus , it could not adopt any measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter .
" The Security Council , as a UN organ created by Member States , is subject to legal requirements , and is obliged to comply with the same international normative rules that the Member States are bound to .
" The Council shall observe all international norms , in particular the UN Charter and the peremptory norms of international law , in the process of its decision making and in its taking actions .
" Needless to say that any measure adopted in contradiction to such rules and principles will be void of any legally binding effects . "
Now comes a statement from the Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  which includes Afghanistan , Algeria , Bahrain , Bolivia , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Iraq , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Libya , Oman , Pakistan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Syria , Turkmenistan , United Arab Emirates , Uzbekistan , Venezuela , et al .  wherein the Ministers
" reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all states "  including , by name , the Islamic Republic of Iran  to the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , " without discrimination "
" recognized the IAEA as the sole competent authority for verification of the respective safeguards obligations of [ NPT ] member states "
" reaffirmed the inviolability of peaceful nuclear activities , " whether operational or under construction , against " attack or threat of attack , " either of which " constitutes a grave violation of international law , principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and regulations of the IAEA . "
Okay , the rest of the world is in Iran ’s corner on this issue .
So , the question is  what will they do if the paranoid Israelis attack Iran and " we " are viewed as having enabled them ?
September 9 , 2008
It is difficult to find out what is really going on in Afghanistan .
The focus of the mass media is almost entirely on the military activities of the Canadian and NATO forces .
There is absolutely no coverage of political developments .
The news on the economy is limited to the state of the poppy industry .
This is no accident .
The North American media , including the CBC , has strongly supported the U.S. / NATO strategy and the administration of President Hamid Karzai .
Contrary to the mainstream message , things are not going well .
Rise in civilian casualties
Over the past few weeks NATO forces have killed civilians in a number of incidents , and popular opposition to the western military effort is increasing .
On August 22 the United States bombed the village of Azizabad in Herat province ; the result was the death of 91 civilians , including over 60 children .
Rockets and missiles were also used .
Many homes were destroyed .
Local citizens stoned the Afghan army when they tried to distribute supplies .
NATO forces in Paktika province launched an artillery attack on a village on September 1 as part of a general sweep - and - destroy mission against Taliban forces .
Three children were killed and seven injured .
That same day U.S. and Afghan forces carried out an overnight raid in Hud Kheil , east of Kabul .
A family of four , including two children , were killed when hand grenades were thrown into their house .
In Kabul hundreds blocked the main road out of town protesting the military practices of the international forces .
Afghan government and NATO attacks
In response to the steady increase of civilian deaths this year , the Afghan parliament passed a resolution in August calling on the Karzai administration to negotiate a new status - of - forces agreement with NATO and United States , making it consistent with Afghan and international law .
President Karzai�s cabinet demanded " an end to air attacks in civilian areas , illegal detentions and unilateral house searches . "
There is growing opposition to the presence of the occupying forces .
The Senlis Council reported in June 2008 that in their most recent recent public opinion survey " more than six out of ten of those interviewed ... said that foreign troops should leave . "
This is the position taken by many of the democratic parties in Afghanistan .
Malalai Joya , the outspoken critic of the Karzai government , has called for all foreign troops to leave the country .
She argues that Afghans can settle this dispute better on their own .
The approaching famine
However , the most important current issue in Afghanistan is the drought , the crop failure , and the prospect of famine .
This story has received no coverage in the North American media .
Over the last winter Afghanistan received well - below normal rainfall and mountain snow pack .
The spring runoff was light , and crop yields from irrigated agriculture have been significantly reduced .
There are conditions of drought throughout the country .
In many areas there are no crops and livestock has perished from lack of pasture .
Wheat provides the staple food , and production is 60 percent below average .
Recent rains have brought flooding , as the land has been hardened by the drought .
Floods are more common because over the past few decades 60 % of the woodland has been removed by the population seeking fuel for cooking and winter heating .
The jump in fuel prices has raised the cost of the delivery of food from neighbouring countries .
Food prices are rising .
The price of a 50 kg bag of wheat flour is now $ 35 .
One half of the population in Afghanistan lives on less than $ 2 per day .
The government of Afghanistan reports that 42 % of the population lives in " extreme poverty " , defined as a per capita income of less than $ 120 per year .
The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan reported in August that " at least four million most vulnerable people have already been pushed into the ' high - risk food - insecurity ' category . "
Children are the most vulnerable .
One in five children die before the age of five , mainly due to malnutrition .
In response , the United Nations and other food agencies have called for an emergency fund of $ 404 million in order to purchase food .
To date less than 20 % has been forthcoming from donor countries .
What is happening to women�s rights ?
Supporters of the U.S. project in Afghanistan always point to how many girls are now going to school .
But as Ann Jones points out , the number cited ( 5 million ) is fewer than half the children of school age .
In Kabul 85 % are in school ; in the Pashtun south , less than 20 % and " near zero for girls . "
Radio Free Afghanistan�s Jan Alekozai recently toured eastern Afghanistan .
He noted that there were schools but no teachers , no chairs and tables , no electricity or water , no books , and no labs .
" The participation of women is zero in the provinces , " he argued .
While some are going to school " they cannot walk , for example , in a park - or with their families . "
In February 2008 Womankind Worldwide ( UK ) released a survey of the status of women in Afghanistan .
They found that 87 % of Afghan women report domestic violence , 60 % of all marriages are still forced , and 57 % of all recent marriages involved girls under the age of sixteen , which is contrary to the law .
Ann Jones , who spent a number of years in Afghanistan working for women�s rights , is not surprised .
President Karzai� wife is a qualified gynecologist but does not practice her skills .
She remains locked up in the presidential fortress , the Arg , and is not seen by the general public .
Since the onset of the 20th century , she is the first wife of a state leader who has not publicly championed women�s rights .
Change of regime in Afghanistan
Few Canadians would know that there is a presidential election scheduled for Afghanistan in 2009 .
Hamid Karzai has announced that he will run again .
After his tour of eastern Afghanistan , Jan Alekozai reported strong opposition to the local warlords and the Karzai government .
He judged that Karzai would have a hard time getting 20 % of the votes in the 2009 election .
The people blame the Americans and NATO for the increase in the power of the warlords .
The main opposition to Karzai will come from the United National Front , which is largely a coalition of the warlords and Islamist leaders based in the parliament .
They have demanded a change in the constitution to bring in a parliamentary system of government with political parties and elections by proportional representation .
The Front is dominated by the Islamist forces from the Northern Alliance .
The Front has called for a new international meeting to settle the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan .
This would be hosted by the United Nations and include all neighbouring states as well as representation from Afghanistan�s political groups , including the armed opposition .
In late August Fazel Sangcharaki , speaking for the Front , stated that many foreign envoys have supported this proposal .
But the problem is the opposition of the U.S. government .
Canadian government stresses militarism
The policy of the Canadian government since 2001 has been to put the highest priority on its military role in Afghanistan .
In support of the Afghan " war on terrorism " , the Canadian government has been spending around $ 1 billion per year on the military and only $ 100 million on humanitarian assistance and economic development .
Much of the military budget has been spent on acquiring new military hardware , needed for counter - insurgency warfare ..
Just before Stephen Harper forced a fall election , polls emerged which showed that Canadians remain skeptical of the role in Afghanistan .
A poll by Ipsos Reid for the Department of National Defence revealed that the majority of Canadians still want Canada to emphasize peacekeeping .
A CBC poll done by Environics reported that 56 % of Canadians disapprove of Canada�s military role in Afghanistan .
Since the March 2008 agreement by the Conservatives and Liberals to extend Canada�s mission to 2011 , Afghanistan has largely disappeared from political discussion .
The challenge for Canadians is to make this disastrous war in Afghanistan an issue in the current election .
John W. Warnock is a Regina political economist and author of Creating a Failed State : the US and Canada in Afghanistan .
( Winnipeg : Fernwood Publishing , May 2008 ) .
A swath of bedrock in northern Quebec may be the oldest known piece of the earth ’s crust .
In an article appearing in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science , scientists report that portions of that bedrock are 4.28 billion years old , formed when the earth was less than 300 million years old .
“ These rocks paint this picture of an early earth that looked pretty much like the modern earth , ” said Richard W. Carlson of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and one of the authors of the paper .
Other scientists are intrigued , but not yet entirely convinced that the rocks are quite that old .
“ There is a certain amount of healthy skepticism that needs to play a role here , ” said Stephen J. Mojzsis , a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado .
Dr. Mojzsis said the new research was well done , but that he thought these were younger sedimentary rocks , pressed together out of the remnants of earlier rocks that were indeed 4.28 billion years old .

How SEC Regulatory Exemptions Helped Lead to Collapse
>
The losses incurred by Bear Stearns and other large broker - dealers were not caused by " rumors " or a " crisis of confidence , " but rather by inadequate net capital and the lack of constraints on the incurring of debt .
-- Lee Pickard , former director , SEC trading and markets division .

Is Financial Innovation just another word for excessive and reckless leverage ?
Apparently so .
As we learn this morning via Julie Satow of the NY Sun , special exemptions from the SEC are in large part responsible for the huge build up in financial sector leverage over the past 4 years -- as well as the massive current unwind
Satow interviews the above quoted former SEC director , and he spits out the blunt truth :
The current excess leverage now unwinding was the result of a purposeful SEC exemption given to five firms .
You read that right -- the events of the past year are not a mere accident , but are the results of a conscious and willful SEC decision to allow these firms to legally violate existing net capital rules that , in the past 30 years , had limited broker dealers debt - to - net capital ratio to 12 - to - 1 .
Instead , the 2004 exemption -- given only to 5 firms -- allowed them to lever up 30 and even 40 to 1 .
Who were the five that received this special exemption ?
You wo n't be surprised to learn that they were Goldman , Merrill , Lehman , Bear Stearns , and Morgan Stanley .
As Mr. Pickard points out that " The proof is in the pudding — three of the five broker - dealers have blown up . "
So while the SEC runs around reinstating short selling rules , and clueless pension fund managers mindlessly point to the wrong issue , we learn that it was the SEC who was in large part responsible for the reckless leverage that led to the current crisis .
You could n't make this stuff up if you tried .
Here 's an excerpt from The Sun :
" The Securities and Exchange Commission can blame itself for the current crisis .
That is the allegation being made by a former SEC official , Lee Pickard , who says a rule change in 2004 led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch .
The SEC allowed five firms — the three that have collapsed plus Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to more than double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets and remove discounts that had been applied to the assets they had been required to keep to protect them from defaults .
Making matters worse , according to Mr. Pickard , who helped write the original rule in 1975 as director of the SEC 's trading and markets division , is a move by the SEC this month to further erode the restraints on surviving broker - dealers by withdrawing requirements that they maintain a certain level of rating from the ratings agencies .
" They constructed a mechanism that simply did n't work , " Mr. Pickard said .
" The proof is in the pudding — three of the five broker - dealers have blown up . "
The so - called net capital rule was created in 1975 to allow the SEC to oversee broker - dealers , or companies that trade securities for customers as well as their own accounts .
It requires that firms value all of their tradable assets at market prices , and then it applies a haircut , or a discount , to account for the assets ' market risk .
So equities , for example , have a haircut of 15 % , while a 30 - year Treasury bill , because it is less risky , has a 6 % haircut .
The net capital rule also requires that broker dealers limit their debt - to - net capital ratio to 12 - to - 1 , although they must issue an early warning if they begin approaching this limit , and are forced to stop trading if they exceed it , so broker dealers often keep their debt - to - net capital ratios much lower .
Chalk up another win for excess deregulation . . .

American Banker excerpt after the jump .
Lee A. Pickard , former director , SEC trading and markets division , on Leverage and Net Capital exemptions :
A brutal combination of bad financial decisions and serious misjudgments about the inherent value and liquidity of securitized instruments , coupled with the use of excessive leverage , contributed to the demise of Bear Stearns and seriously weakened the capital structure of other major broker - dealers .
The Securities and Exchange Commission oversees the financial condition of all broker - dealers , and it used from 1975 to 2004 a " net capital rule " as its primary tool to ensure that broker - dealers had adequate capital bases and sufficient liquidity .
The rule , which I participated in formulating , required that every broker - dealer compute its net capital daily by doing two things .
First , it had to value all liquid assets at market prices and then subject that value to a " haircut " of a specified percentage , depending on the assets ' expected market risk .
( A 30 - year Treasury bond was carried for net capital purposes at 94 % of its market value because changes in interest rates would affect its market value ; riskier securities were subject to bigger haircuts . )
Second , the broker - dealer was limited in the amount of debt it could incur , to about 12 times its net capital , though for various reasons broker - dealers operated at significantly lower ratios .
The SEC 's basic net capital rule , one of the prominent successes in federal financial regulatory oversight , had an excellent track record in preserving the securities markets ' financial integrity and protecting customer assets .
There have been very few liquidations of broker - dealers and virtually no customer or interdealer losses due to broker - dealer insolvency during the past 33 years .
Under an alternative approach adopted by the SEC in 2004 , broker - dealers with , in practice , at least $ 5 billion of capital ( such as Bear Stearns ) were permitted to avoid the haircuts on securities positions and the limitations on indebtedness contained in the basic net capital rule .
Instead , the alternative net capital program relies heavily on a risk management control system , mathematical models to price positions , value - at - risk models , and close SEC oversight .
As the SEC itself has noted , this alternative program requires significant judgment , as contrasted with the numerical tests and capital charges ( the haircuts ) imposed on broker - dealers under the basic net capital rule .
The alternative approach also requires substantial SEC resources for complex oversight , which apparently are not always available .
The SEC has maintained that the Bear Stearns collapse was precipitated by rumors and an unprecedented crisis of confidence , driven by lack of liquidity for the large securities positions it held .
If , however , Bear Stearns and other large broker - dealers had been subject to the typical haircuts on their securities positions , an aggregate indebtedness restriction , and other provisions for determining required net capital under the traditional standards , they would not have been able to incur their high debt leverage without substantially increasing their capital base .
The losses incurred by Bear Stearns and other large broker - dealers were not caused by " rumors " or a " crisis of confidence , " but rather by inadequate net capital and the lack of constraints on the incurring of debt .
The SEC should reexamine its net capital rule and consider whether the traditional standards should be reapplied to all broker - dealers .
Moreover , broker - dealer losses should give the SEC pause regarding its recent proposal effectively to abandon the objective debt ratings of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in favor of " subjective " tests of broker - dealers in determining adequate levels of regulatory net capital .
As the Bear Stearns collapse showed , no broker - dealer is " too big to fail " — unless the federal government comes to the rescue .

Singer Sheryl Crow and Whole Foods Market have teamed up to create a limited - edition reusable shopping bag , called " A Better Bag " .
" I am a big believer in doing what you can , even if it 's something as small as reducing the amount of plastic we each use daily that ends up in landfills , whether it is plastic bags , water bottles or product packaging , " Crow said .
The bag design features a charcoal sketch of a tree with words written by Crow for the project .
The bag is made from 80 % post - consumer recycled plastic bottles .
Whole Foods said it hopes the bag launch will also raise awareness of the Natural Resources Defence Council 's Simple Steps programme , which calls on people to make small changes to help the environment .
“ This is more evidence that Obama ’s politics of hope is just empty words , ” Mr. Conant said in a statement .
Mr. McCain ’s choice of Ms. Palin  and the resulting jolt of energy among Republican voters  appears to have caught Mr. Obama and his advisers by surprise and added to concern among some Democrats that the Obama campaign was not pushing back aggressively enough against Republican attacks in a crucial phase of the race .
“ Our ads have been pretty tough .
I just have different philosophy : I ’m going to respond with the truth , ” Mr. Obama told a voter on Friday , responding to a question about whether Democrats would suffer the same fate they have in previous presidential campaigns .
“ I know there are a lot of Democrats and some independents and some Republicans who really want change and are getting really nervous because they have seen this movie before . ”
The new tone is also to be presented in television interviews with local stations in five swing states , backed up by the new ads and appearances throughout the country by supporters .
Anotheradvertising theme will be pay equity for women , an issue that has particular resonance as the campaigns battle for female voters .
Despite the shift in intensity , Mr. Obama ’s aides said they were confident with the course of the campaign .
They said that , other than making some alterations around the edges , particularly in response to Mr. McCain ’s effort to seize the change issue from Mr. Obama , they were not planning any major deviation from a strategy that called for a steady escalation of attacks on Mr. McCain as the race heads toward the debates .
In the debate over gay marriage , opponents have many arguments that profess their belief that it should not be legal .
These include many moral and religious reasons that point to a threat to the sacred institution of marriage .
Yet , is a marriage a religious rite or a civil right ?
This debate brings up many questions .
In an attempt to understand the issue , let 's examine common arguments against same - sex marriage and why they may not stand up in modern America .
What 's The Point of Marriage , Gay or Straight ?
Is there even a point to same - sex couples getting married ?
Why would they want to bother ?
Whether a marriage is between a man and a woman or two people of the same sex , the reasons behind getting married are the same .
There are , of course , the legal , property , and financial benefits of being married .
These include the right of one partner to make medical decisions for the other and the joint ownership of a home or other property .
Married couples can also handle their financial affairs , from banking to taxes , jointly .
Fundamentally , the point of marriage — whether gay or straight — is to start a family .
It may include children or be the couple on their own .
Either way , a marriage certificate is the foundation of a family unit and this is extremely important to many people .
What is a Marriage Between a Man and a Woman ?
Opponents of marriage equality usually insist that marriage is only legitimate when it 's between a man and a woman .
Where does that leave people who are not quite either male or female - at least according to the definitions ordinarily employed ?
Defining marriage in terms of sex begs the question of how we define a person 's sex in the first place .
What is a " man " and what is a " woman " ?
Using strict terminology , there are people for whom marriage to anyone might be permanently denied .
Marriage : Religious Rite or Civil Right ?
Almost every opponent to gay marriage tends to rely on the belief that marriage is essentially and necessarily a religious rite .
For them , marriage is conceived of almost exclusively in religious terms .
This means that gay marriage amounts to a form a sacrilege , not to mention an intrusion of the state into a religious matter .
It 's true that religion has traditionally played a role in sanctifying marriages .
In the end , this belief is simply incorrect .
The contract of marriage is also a compact between two individuals , a promise to care for one another .
Marriage has never been dependent on a single religion and is , instead , a result of human desire which is supported by the community as a whole .
For this reason , marriage is far more a civil right than it is a religious rite .
Marriage is Sacred and a Sacrament
Closely connected with the idea that marriage is necessarily religious is the belief that marriage is sacred or even a type of sacrament .
This argument is rarely made explicit .
This is perhaps one of the most important and fundamental arguments for opponents of gay marriage .
It seems to lie at the heart of almost all of their other arguments .
It also motivates much of their vehemence in a way that would be hard to explain otherwise .
Indeed , if it were n't for the idea that marriage is sacred , it seems unlikely that ongoing debate would be as rancorous as it is .
Marriage is for Raising Children
The idea that gay couples should n't be allowed to marry because they can't procreate is extremely popular .
At the same time , it 's also probably the weakest and least credible argument .
If marriage only exists for the purpose of having children , then how can infertile couples be allowed to marry ?
The simple fact is that this argument depends on using a standard that is not applied to straight couples .
Gay Marriage Will Undermine the Institution of Marriage
The argument that something new or some change would undermine or destroy a valued institution is almost inevitable .
It 's no surprise that opponents of gay marriage frequently complain that such marriages would undermine the institution of marriage .
A marriage between members of the same sex is a self - contradiction , according to opponents , so their unions will somehow harm marriage itself .
Just how much damage could gay unions do , though ?
And how ?
Gay Couples are Unnatural & Unnatural Unions Cannot Be Marriage
This objection to gay marriage does n't even try to pretend to be objective and fair .
It focuses instead directly on people 's animus towards gays and lesbians .
Homosexual relationships are treated explicitly as abnormal and unnatural .
This easily leads to the conclusion that said relationships should not be given any sort of legal or social status .
Perhaps the only good thing that can be said about this argument is that it 's the most directly honest one that opponents are likely to make .
Incompatible with Religious Liberty
Opposition to equal civil rights for gays comes in many forms .
When all of the arguments that gay marriage is an intrinsically bad fail , religious conservatives move to argue that such marriages will somehow infringe on their own civil rights .
It 's an appealing tactic since no one wants to be tarred as an opponent of religious liberty .
However , thus far conservatives have failed to explain how or why treating gays like fully equal citizens and human beings is incompatible with anyone 's religious liberty .
Since when did the preservation of religious rights require treating minorities like second - class citizens ?
It Can't Be a Real Marriage
The most simplistic argument against gay marriage is to look at a dictionary .
Many choose to marvel at the discovery that it only mentions men and women marrying , then sagely conclude that gays can't possibly marry .
This approach ignores the fact that the nature of marriage has changed in definition and makeup quite often over the centuries .
Marriage today is n't at all like what it was two millennia or even two centuries ago .
Given how broad and fundamental the changes in the nature of marriage have been , what exactly are traditionalists trying to defend , and why ?
What is truly " traditional " about modern marriage ?
Marriage as a Cultural Symbol
The debate over the legalization of gay marriage in America is about more than just the status of gay couples .
It 's also about the future of American civil law .
Either the civil law is defined by the needs and rights of citizens and gay marriage will be legalized , or civil laws will be placed under the dominion of religious laws and gay marriage will be banned .
Opponents of gay marriage try to offer legal and social reasons for their position .
Yet , it always comes back to religion and religion - based animosity towards gays .
For Christian Nationalists , legalized gay marriage would represent a defeat for their religion in the fight to define the boundaries of American culture and law .
Gay marriage furthermore represents a threat to established norms of authority , identity , and power .
Those who possess that authority and power and who have used them to create their identities are thereby threatened by the perspective changes .
One thing that has often puzzled many people is the argument from so many religious and political conservatives that same - sex marriages " threaten " and " undermine " traditional heterosexual marriages .
The same is said even about domestic partnership laws which would give same - sex partners a few of the same basic rights as married couples .
Why is this ?
How can one relationship threaten or undermine someone else's ?
Marriage is not just an institution , but also a symbol representing our culture 's ideas about sex , sexuality , and human relationships .
Symbols are important ; they are a common cultural currency which we each use to help create our sense of self .
Thus , when the traditional nature of marriage is challenged in any way , so are people 's basic identities .
By asking legislatures to pass " Defense of Marriage " acts , voters use the law to create the cultural equivalent of a copyright or trademark on the institution of marriage to prevent it from being challenged too much .
Backers of a promarijuana ballot initiative charged yesterday that 11 district attorneys violated campaign finance laws and twisted the truth about the question .
Whitney Taylor of the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy said the district attorneys raised and spent money to oppose the question before forming their Coalition to Save Our Streets .
Campaign finance laws require groups to form a committee before raising and spending money .
Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone brushed aside the group 's criticism , calling it a ploy to distract attention from critics of the ballot question .
Leone attended a rally on the steps of the Statehouse with other district attorneys , police , clergy , and community organizers to call for the measure 's defeat .
" I 'm not sure what the proponents of this question were smoking when they brought this to our state , " said the Rev. Jeffrey Brown .
The question would make possession of an ounce or less of marijuana a civil offense rather than criminal offense , and would make it punishable by a $ 100 fine .
Opponents say such a change in law would essentially normalize use of marijuana , while supporters say it would reduce a burden on the criminal justice system by sparing those found with small amounts from facing a criminal record and jail .
Taylor 's group has filed complaints with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance and the attorney general 's office against the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association and the public relations firm hired to handle opposition to the question .
" This was an attempt to keep their organization as covert as they could for as long a possible , " Taylor said .
Taylor said state records show the district attorneys began raising money as early as July 18 , but did n't file a statement of organization with the state until Sept.
5 .
Taylor also faulted the district attorneys for using their state website to urge voters to oppose the question , and for misrepresenting the initiative .
A statement on the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association website says that if the question is approved , " any person may carry and use marijuana at any time . "
Taylor said that if the question passed , possession of marijuana would still be illegal , and that anyone carrying or using marijuana would face a $ 100 fine .
Leone called Taylor 's accusations " a weak ploy to try to derail the public 's attention " about the negative fallout if the question failed .
He said district attorneys are free to use money from their campaign accounts to support or oppose ballot questions .
At the State House event , speakers said easing penalties would threaten recent positive trends in marijuana use among teenagers .

The momentum now seems to be shifting away from outsourcing to the Far East , with one in five Germany companies pulling production out of the country .
Chinese workers , they say , are getting too expensive .

Osama bin Laden was a few decades late .
“ We are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy .
Allah willing , and nothing is too great for Allah , ” bin Laden declared from the grave back in 2004 , or rather from the video studios of the CIA .
According to Osama , the “ real loser is … the American people and their economy . ”
Back in 2004 , they dragged out Osama and ascribed blame .
Now as the banker engineered destruction of America is approaching terminal velocity , they may blame the dead nemesis again .
Over the last few weeks , like victims of a drive - by shooting , we have witnessed the ongoing process of this bankruptcy as it now reaches terminal velocity .
The Evil and Elusive One may have taken credit for wrecking the economy and thus taking down the U.S. government , but in fact this process began when the government was dissolved on March 9 , 1933 by the Emergency Banking Act .
On June 5 , 1933 , the 73rd Congress passed a joint resolution to suspend the gold standard and abrogate the gold clause and thus dissolved the sovereign authority of the United States and the official capacities of all United States governmental offices , officers , and departments .
Since that fateful day , the U.S. government has existed in name only .
Before Democrat James Traficant was thrown in prison , he said :
The receivers of the United States Bankruptcy are the International Bankers , via the United Nations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
All United States Offices , Officials , and Departments are now operating within a de facto status in name only under Emergency War Powers .
With the Constitutional Republican form of Government now dissolved , the receivers of the Bankruptcy have adopted a new form of government for the United States .
This new form of government is known as a Democracy , being an established Socialist / Communist order under a new governor for America .
This act was instituted and established by transferring and / or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund .
In other words , Hank Paulson , former chairman of Goldman Sachs , takes his marching orders from the World Bank , the IMF , and the international bankers .
The banker bailout that supposedly went down in flames the other day — soon to rise cosmetically modified like Phoenix from the ashes — will eventually herald the next phase of the takedown : privatization .
Bankers have engineered the crushing federal deficit and will use it as a truncheon to usher in wholesale privatization of social security , medicare , prisons , schools , water , the Federal Aviation Administration , Amtrak , welfare services , public power utilities , the federal postal service , etc. , on and on .
How to best accomplish this ?
Get us all in hock up to our eyebrows .
The banker bailout plan — coupled with the massive price tag of the neocon invasions and occupations — will do this magnificently .
Now they want to add a “ New Deal ” to this staggering debt .
It ’s a New Deal for the bankers , a New Serfdom for the rest of us .
“ Like any other debtor , the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan , ” explains Traficant .
“ Since the federal United States did n’t have any assets , they assigned the private property of their ‘ economic slaves ’ , the U.S. citizens as collateral against the un-payable federal debt .
They also pledged the unincorporated federal territories , national parks forests , birth certificates , and nonprofit organizations , as collateral against the federal debt .
All has already been transferred as payment to the international bankers . ”
It ’s a feudal system engineered by the international bankers and their instruments — the IMF , the World Bank , Bank for International Settlements , and the Federal Reserve System .
Thomas Jefferson ’s admonition is coming true : “ If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
It is a sick joke they dragged out the dead CIA sock puppet , Osama bin Laden , and ascribed blame to him and al - Qaeda .
Chances are they will blame him again before it is all over .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan has appointed a new chief for the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) Directorate , months after U.S. officials had questioned the reliability of the military ’s premier spy agency in the war against terrorism .

A military statement issued around midnight Monday announced a major overhaul of Pakistan ’s top brass by army chief General Ashfaq Kayani .
The reshuffle will be closely scrutinized by the intelligence community in the United States and neighbors in the region .
A September 20 suicide bomb attack that killed 55 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad underscored concern al Qaeda - linked militants and Taliban fighters could destabilize the nuclear - armed Muslim nation of 170 million people .
Lieutenant - General Ahmed Shujaa Pasha , formerly head of military operations , has been appointed Director - General of the ISI , replacing Lieutenant - General Nadeem Taj .
Kayani , who had been ISI chief until a year ago , also replaced four of the nine corps commanders and appointed a new chief of general staff .
Often referred to by critics as a “ state within a state , ” the ISI is feared by neighboring Afghanistan and India , as well as Pakistan ’s civilian politicians whose governments have been overthrown by military coups .
The ISI helped the United States eliminate hundreds of al Qaeda fighters after the 2001 attacks on U.S. cities .
But U.S. officials suspect that some Pakistani agents still view the Afghan Taliban and some jihadi groups as long term assets to gain leverage in Afghanistan and Indian Kashmir .
U.S. fears that the ISI might be playing a double - game came to a head after a suicide bomber killed 58 people outside India ’s embassy in Kabul in July .
The New York Times reported then that U.S. officials also believed Pakistani agents tipped off militants ahead of missile strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Pakistan .
After halting prior notification and increasing missile strikes , the United States went a step further in early September , carrying out a commando raid on a Pakistani village on the Afghan border that provoked a storm of protest in Islamabad .
The United States has privately urged Pakistan ’s six - month - old civilian government to exert more control over the ISI , according to officials who requested anonymity .
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani ’s government made a botched attempt to bring the ISI under the ambit of the Interior Ministry in July , but backed off to avoid a backlash within the army .
While Kayani has been supportive of Pakistan ’s return to civilian - led democracy , senior officials say he has made clear the army will look after its own affairs , while the government gets on with the business of running the state .
NEW BROOM
President Asif Ali Zardari , according to the New York Times , met with Michael Hayden , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , during a visit to the United States in the past week .
“ The ISI will be handled , that is our problem , ” Zardari , the widower of slain two - time prime minister Benazir Bhutto , told the newspaper in an interview released Sunday .
Sworn in earlier this month , Zardari was scathing about the policies of his predecessor , former army chief Pervez Musharraf .
“ We do n’t hunt with the hound and run with the hare , which is what Musharraf was doing , ” Zardari said .
In his previous post , Pasha oversaw offensives against militants in the tribal lands bordering Afghanistan , and deployments to guard against cross - border militancy .
He is expected to overhaul the ISI and heads of sections dealing with domestic politics and media have been replaced , according to officials .
“ Two heads have been changed and some rapid reshuffling is expected soon , as these have been due for long time , ” a senior military security official , who requested anonymity , said .
Taj had been ISI chief for less than a year , having been promoted to the sensitive post by Musharraf , who was forced to quit as president in August to avoid impeachment by parliament .
Taj , who was seen as close to Musharraf , was appointed as commander of Gujranwala Corps rather than sidelined .

While Barack Obama has struggled to capture Jewish votes , it turns out that one of his wife ’s cousins is the country ’s most prominent black rabbi .
FUNNEYE : The country ?s most prominent black rabbi .
Michelle Obama , wife of the Democratic presidential nominee , is a first cousin once removed of Rabbi Capers Funnye , spiritual leader of a mostly black synagogue on Chicago ’s South Side .
Funnye ’s mother , Verdelle Robinson Funnye , and Michelle Obama ’s paternal grandfather , Frasier Robinson Jr. , were brother and sister .
Funnye ( pronounced fuh - NAY ) is the chief rabbi of the Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in southwest Chicago .
He is well known in Jewish circles for acting as a bridge between mainstream Jewry and the much smaller , and largely separate , world of black Jewish congregations , sometimes known as black Hebrews , or Israelites .
He has often urged the larger Jewish community to be more accepting of Jews who are not white .
In this presidential campaign , Funnye ’s famous relative gives an unexpected twist to the much analyzed relationship between Barack Obama and the Jewish community .
On the one hand , Jewish political organizers , voters and donors — including some of the city ’s wealthiest and most prominent families — played an essential role in Obama ’s rise to power in Chicago .
But the Illinois senator has struggled to overcome suspicions in some parts of the Jewish community , including skepticism about his stance on Israel , and discredited but persistent rumors that he is secretly a Muslim .
Funnye , who describes himself as an independent , said he has not been involved with the Obama campaign .
He noted , however , that he has donated money and that he was cheering Obama on .
“ I know that her grandfather and her father and my mom and all of our relatives that are now deceased would be so very , very proud of both of them , ” Funnye told the Forward .
Michelle Obama and the Obama campaign did not respond to requests for comment .
Funnye , 56 , has known Michelle Obama ( born Michelle Robinson ) , 44 , since she was born .
Both grew up on the South Side of Chicago , and Funnye ’s mother and Obama ’s father enjoyed a close relationship .
“ Her father was like the glue of our family , ” Funnye said .
“ He always wanted to keep the family very connected and to stay in touch with each other . ”
Funnye and Obama saw each other several times a year when they were growing up , mostly at family functions and on occasional visits to each other ’s homes .
Obama ’s mother , Marian Robinson , recalled Funnye and his family coming over for visits and said that he and her children were “ as close as cousins could be . ”
The two fell out of touch when they grew older , but they reconnected years later when Obama was working for the University of Chicago and Funnye was leading a local social service organization called The Blue Gargoyle .
Funnye also worked with Barack Obama , who , as a state senator , came and spoke at events for the organization .
When Barack and Michelle Obama married , Funnye and his family attended the wedding .
Funnye said that he and the Obamas have not been in touch since the presidential campaign began .
Although Funnye ’s congregation describes itself as Ethiopian Hebrew , it is not connected to the Ethiopian Jews , commonly called the Beta Israel , who have immigrated to Israel en masse in recent decades .
It is also separate from the Black Hebrews in the Israeli city of Dimona , and from the Hebrew Israelite black supremacist group , whose incendiary street harangues have become familiar spectacles in a number of American cities .
Funnye converted to Judaism and was ordained as a rabbi under the supervision of black Israelite rabbis .
He then went through another conversion , supervised by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis .
Funnye has worked to connect his own congregation with the rest of Chicago ’s Jewish community .
He serves on the Chicago Board of Rabbis and is vice president of the Israelite Board of Rabbis , the rabbinical association for black Israelite rabbis .
He has also traveled around the country , encouraging the mostly white Jewish establishment to be more welcoming of non-white Jews around the world .
Last July , Funnye attended the installation of Gershom Sizomu , the new chief rabbi of Uganda .
The news of Funnye ’s family connection may add a new gloss to the racial complexities of his own work and to those of the current presidential campaign .
“ I think it tells us everything we need to know about modern America and modern Judaism that a biracial candidate has been nominated by the Democratic Party and he ’s related to an African - American rabbi , ” said Gary Tobin , president of the Institute for Jewish & Community Research , which has worked for greater acceptance of Jewish minorities .
Funnye ’s relationship with the Obama family was reported in the Chicago Jewish News .
Last April , a Wall Street Journal article reported that the aspiring first lady had a cousin ( whom the paper mistakenly referred to as a second cousin ) who is a prominent black rabbi , but the paper did not mention Funnye by name .
Though a few acquaintances of Funnye and the Obamas said they knew of the connection , the news came as a surprise to most members of the Chicago Jewish community .
Neither Funnye nor the Obamas have made a point of mentioning their family ties .
In Funnye ’s synagogue , however , the rabbi’s link with the Democratic presidential nominee is a matter of common knowledge .
“ He really jumped on everyone ’s radar after the 2004 convention , ” Funnye said .
“ That ’s when some people said , ‘ Is n’t he related to you or something ? ’
I said , ‘ Yeah , he ’s married to my cousin , and she ’s making him everything that he is . ’ ”

From Amensty International USA : Urge Clemency for Troy Davis
Troy Davis came within 24 hours of execution in July , 2007 before receiving a temporary stay of execution .
But the Georgia Supreme Court denied Mr. Davis ’ motion for a new trial and now he faces execution on September 23 .
Troy Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of Police Officer Mark MacPhail in Georgia .
The case against him consisted entirely of witness testimony which contained inconsistencies even during the trial .
Since then , all but two of the state ’s nine non-police witnesses from the trial have recanted or contradicted their testimony .
Many of these witnesses have stated in sworn affidavits that they were pressured or coerced by police into testifying or signing statements against Troy Davis .
From Amnesty International USA : Troy Davis : Finality Over Fairness
On Monday , March 17 , 2008 , the Georgia Supreme Court decided 4 - 3 to deny a new trial for Troy Anthony Davis , despite significant concerns regarding his innocence .
This stunning decision by the Georgia Supreme Court to let Mr. Davis ’ death sentence stand means that the state of Georgia might soon execute a man who may well be innocent .
Background Restrictions on Federal appeals have prevented Troy Anthony Davis from having a hearing in federal court on the reliability of the witness testimony used against him , despite the fact that most of the witnesses have since recanted , many alleging they were pressured or coerced by police .
Troy Davis remains on Georgia death row , and may be scheduled for execution in the near future .
Troy Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of Police Officer Mark Allen MacPhail at a Burger King in Savannah , Georgia ; a murder he maintains he did not commit .
There was no physical evidence against him and the weapon used in the crime was never found .
The case against him consisted entirely of witness testimony which contained inconsistencies even at the time of the trial .
Since then , all but two of the state ’s non-police witnesses from the trial have recanted or contradicted their testimony .
Many of these witnesses have stated in sworn affidavits that they were pressured or coerced by police into testifying or signing statements against Troy Davis .
One of the two witnesses who has not recanted his testimony is Sylvester Red Coles — the principle alternative suspect , according to the defense , against whom there is new evidence implicating him as the gunman .
Nine individuals have signed affidavits implicating Sylvester Coles .
I have a couple of things to add .
First , I should say that , as a matter of fact , it does not matter to me — and it should not matter to you — one bit whether or not Troy Davis really is responsible for the killing he ’s alleged to have committed , or , if he is responsible , whether or not the prosecution legitimate proved their case in the midst of what appears to have been a very dirty bit of business by the Gangsters in Blue .
There seems to be good evidence for massive police misconduct , and for the likelihood of Davis ’s innocence .
This evidence is important , and let ’s go ahead and scream about it as much as possible to the men and women sitting in the court and corrections system , if it will save Troy Davis from the gallows .
But , just between us , we need to remember that even if he were obviously guilty as hell , the State has no right to commit premeditated murder in order to make him pay for it .
The penalty of death is the ultimate , definitive expression of the State ’s cold and sadistic violence , exercised with no defensive purpose and against women and men who no longer pose any threat to any living soul , on the theory that in the end your body and your life belong to the State , and can be mutilated and destroyed by it , at its pleasure , for its own special purposes — whether to exact blood vengeance , or to send a message to unrelated third parties , cut into your body by the Harrow of the criminal justice system .
It is nothing more and nothing less than State - sanctioned murder , and it ought to be abolished immediately , completely , and forever .
Second , you should also note , from this story , that in the view of the Georgia Supreme Court , final arbiter that it is , getting all the paperwork settled once and for all is apparently more important than whether or not an innocent man will be slaughtered on the basis of lying testimony extracted by intimidation and coercion at the hands of an overzealous police department , desperately seeking a black cop -killer to lynch .
You may find this appalling ; but it should not be surprising .
This approach to The Law is essential to the very nature of the State and its legal system .
Authority is held to take precedence over fact and evidence ; imposed finality is held to take precedence over justice , even when it comes to punishments that are utterly irreversible , destroying forever any hope of appeal .
Otherwise , anyone might just go around any old time and prove somebody ’s innocence and spring them from the prisons or the gallows , a judge ’s say - so notwithstanding ; a journalist ’s expose or an ad hoc committee ’s discoveries and reasoned decisions might be just as good as that the Nine .
Without sovereign authority to stand between the people and justice , doing justice would be nothing a mere human institution , open to anybody who can do some research and submit facts to a candid world .
Why , it ’d be Anarchy !
So instead , paying due deference and having the right stamp on the right papers and uttering the right ritual incantations is held to be more important than somehing so paltry as a man ’s life .
That is the Majesty of the Law ; that is its morality ; that is its justice .
The Final Arbiter
O.K .
Now please write or FAX the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles to urge clemency for Troy Davis .

This is the story of how I successfully refused to accept a Social Security Number for my child .
I simply said ' no . '
Really .
That 's how easy it was .
I just said no , again , and again .
On the Texas Application for Birth Certificate , which I was unable to get a copy of for this article , there is a check box down at the bottom of the page .
It says , and I 'm paraphrasing , ' Check here to have your child assigned a Social Security Number . '
A day or two after my daughter was born , a girl walked into our recovery room with a folder of papers and brochures .
There were all kinds of release forms and medical advice and , of course , the birth certificate application .
I had a pretty good idea which forms were required for our insurance .
We filled those out , leaving off everything but the barest minimum required information .
Then we got to the birth certificate , with the incongruous SSN checkbox stuck into a corner at the bottom of the second page .
I left it blank , of course .
I suspected what was going to happen , and when the hospital admin returned the forms to us to put our final signatures on , someone had very considerately checked the box for us .
My wife pointed out that we deliberately left the checkbox blank and that we did not want our child assigned a Social Security Number .
The hospital admin blinked .
That funny look came across her eyes .
You know the one ; that purple confusion that occurs when someone who is accustomed to people doing what she says suddenly slams into a brick wall of opposition ?
That was she .
' I ' I do n't know how to do that , ' she stammered .
Of course she knew how to do it .
When you get to that matching field on the computer screen , you leave it blank !
She just never had an opportunity to try .
Her lucky day to learn something new !
I shrugged .
' Not my problem , ' my shrug implied .
She gathered up the papers , frustrated and annoyed , and left .
We had obviously tossed a minor foible her way .
Damn new parents .
Always wanting everything just the way they want it .
I turned around to see my mother - in - law , who is the quintessential ' Patriotic American ' ' , trying to burn holes through me with her eyes .
She had overheard the quibble about the Social Security Number and her patriotic duty was flying full mast ( this was not too long after the September 11 massacre ) .
Her cultural upbringing prevented her from actually voicing the question , so I just answered without waiting for her to speak .
' It 's her choice , ' I said , turning my head to my newborn .
' Social Security is voluntary .
It 's a contract .
She 's not old enough to understand it or make an informed decision .
So , we believe it 's a decision that should be left to her .
She can always sign up when she 's older , and knows what she 's getting into . '
' But what if you die or get sick ?
Who will take care of her ? ' my mother - in - law demanded .
' I opened a half million dollar policy at work this week , ' I countered .
' If I die , she gets a half - million bucks .
That 's a lot more than Social Security will ever pay her .
Ever .
I 'll also put her on my health insurance .
She 's covered .
I do n't need Social Security to take care of her .
We 'll decide soon on setting up guardianship in the event we both die .
And besides , there 's always you . '
My wife voiced her support .
' Mom , it 's our decision to make .
Social Security is just bad .
There wo n't be any money left when I retire , much less her , so we do n't see the value in it .
It 's something we 've discussed and agreed on and it's our decision to make , okay ? '
My mother - in - law quietly accepted our decision .
Or at least tolerated it .
Or at least realized it was futile to argue any further .
A while later the room phone rang and I answered it .
' Mr. Allen ?
I understand you refused the Social Security Number for your child ?'
' That 's right . '
It was an older woman , obviously a supervisor of some kind .
The razor in her voice was barely concealed .
' You do realize that without a Social Security Number she can't go to school or get a driver 's license ? ' she menaced .
' Well , ' I said as friendly as possible , ' it 'll be a few years before she goes to school and even longer before she needs to drive .
And I can always get her one later , right ? '
I knew I could , but I wanted to play the ' innocent ' as much as possible .
This lady was too close to government institutions for me to really want to piss her off .
She conceded that yes , my daughter could always get one later and abruptly hung up .
My mother - in - law had taken to staring out the window without blinking .
Chinese for disapproval , I suppose .
A few minutes later the same hospital admin returned with our paperwork .
The checkbox was blanked with whiteout , and a handwritten note authorized the correction .
I signed my paternity ( but left off my own SSN ) and my wife finalized .
We were n't out of the woods yet .
People in government are so conditioned to habit that I knew there was a strong possibility that someone would key in the SSN application in spite of the very explicit note .
If we received a Social Security Card in her name in spite of our wishes , it would be almost impossible to have it rescinded .
It requires essentially suing the hospital administration for misrepresentation and forgery , and once that victory is achieved , the results ram - rodded through the SSA .
Good luck .
The only other option I know of is to burn the card immediately and assume it never existed , something that may not be a bad idea for most adults as well .
It takes two to three weeks for a new Social Security card to be mailed to an applicant .
My daughter has recently had her first birthday party and we have not received any contact from the SSA .
It was easy , far easier than I expected .
Confidence defeats the habitual bully .
But there were other ramifications beyond snotty hospital administrators .
The health insurance was a bigger worry of mine than the hospital papers or the birth certificate .
For the birth , I printed out and packed our state laws regarding the form of the birth certificate .
They are very specific about which sections are required .
Interestingly enough , the section dealing with the parents ' Social Security Numbers and application for a child 's Social Security Number are explicitly deemed ' not a part of the legal birth certificate . '1
I knew that was in the bag ( and highlighted for easy pointing out to administrative automatons ) .
But the health insurance was a big worry .
I found nothing preventing a health insurer from refusing coverage to a dependent without a Social Security Number .
In the end , I applied for the change of benefits and left my child 's SSN field blank .
In the course of conversations with agents to set up her benefits , only one even mentioned that she had no SSN .
I simply said my daughter did n't have one yet .
That seemed fine and I have so far had no issues or difficulties with either the insurance , doctors , or licensed child - care .
Let me repeat that to make sure it sinks in .
I have heath insurance , a pediatrician , and licensed child - care without my child needing an SSN .
Interestingly enough , since then I have received computer generated documents on my daughter with the SSN filled in as 000 - 00 - 0001 .
Since then , various family members have circulated our SSN choice through the grapevine , and I occasionally get messages from people asking how it is legal , or being angry with me for ' stealing ' from America ( as if American has more claim over my child than I do ) .
The SSN conditioning is so deep even people who are old enough that one would think they remember not having an SSN believe that it is a requirement of citizenship in the United States from birth .
As with many things in the freedom movement , being an example prompts more questions and interest than debating about it ever could .
I 've been able to educate dozens of people on the fact that a Social Security Number is not required for natural born citizens simply because I would n't accept one for my own child .
This in itself is a great victory and a building block to spreading the freedom meme .
But I have had to be very careful about my reasoning .
Obviously many people I talk to are shocked that my daughter does not have an SSN .
Inevitably the conversation comes around to taxes .
' But how do you claim her as a dependant on your taxes ? ' they ask .
' I do n't . '
And then the saddest part of the Social Security scheme rears its ugly head .
' But does n't that cost you more money ? '
Yes .
Yes , it does .
Not claiming a dependent on your taxes is your right .
You always have the ' right ' to pay more taxes .
You always have the right to refuse a deduction .
At our income , I figure not claiming my daughter costs me between $ 300 and $ 400 every year in tax deductions that I do n't get back .
Most people reply with , ' Is that all ? '
I shrug and say , yeah , that 's all .
Three or four hundred dollars a year and my daughter is free from Social Security for as long as she wants to be .
And a few say , ' But that 's a lot of money ! '
And this is when I have to bite my tongue and refrain from replying .
My child is worth more to me than a couple of hundred bucks a year .
The condemnation in that statement is best left implied , rather than openly spoken .
It 's a conclusion that needs to be reached gently by the listener , rather than slapped in the face like a leather glove .
But without exception , no one who has pursued that line of questioning with me has ever broached the subject again .
So that 's it .
My daughter is not a number .
It will be her choice to enter the system if she wants .
If she chooses , she can be self - employed and never pay income tax .
She can keep the fruits of her labors for herself , or she can sign up for the social trough when and if she thinks it is appropriate .
She will be educated on what it entails and how it works .
She may have to learn to drive without a driver 's license .
She may have to learn to save for health expenses .
She may have a more difficult life than many people , but she will have an opportunity of freedom that most people in America never receive .
I can't make her take it .
I can't make her embrace the difficult life of freedom in America .
But I can give her the chance .

Barack Obama surrogates fanned out on various TV interview shows today to discuss the dominant issue of the moment -- energy -- and to press the case that their candidate rose to the occasion Monday in laying out a comprehensive policy in a high - profile speech in Michigan .
We have to wonder , though , if the much - vaunted Obama campaign team anticipated that print coverage would focus so heavily on his latest change of position in the energy debate -- his support for tapping the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to drive down the cost of gasoline .
Here were the leads from the big three dailies :
" With the politics of energy shifting as rapidly as gasoline prices , Democrats , led by presidential candidate Barack Obama , are retreating from long - held positions and scrambling to offer distressed voters more immediate relief from spiraling costs . "
( Los Angeles Times ) " Sen. Barack Obama altered his position on Monday to call for tapping the nation ’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gasoline prices as he outlined an energy plan that contrasts with Sen .
John McCain ’s greater emphasis on expanded offshore drilling and coal and nuclear technology . "
( New York Times ) " Sen. Barack Obama called Monday for using oil from the nation 's strategic reserves to lower gasoline prices , the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues , as he and Sen .
John McCain seek to find solutions to a topic that is increasingly dominating the presidential race . "
( Washington Post )
The first - day Associated Press story by Tom Raum , which no doubt was widely used by medium - sized and smaller newspapers , quickly drew attention to both Obama 's shift on the petroleum reserves and his surprise support late last week for a compromise that would ease the long - standing federal ban on offshore oil drilling .
Obama 's new proposal , Raum wrote , " includes two significant reversals ...
Rumor : Halo Wars Dev Ensemble Shutting Down , Non-essential Employees Already Axed ( Updated )
Original Story : Shacknews has learned via multiple independent reports that developer Ensemble Studios ( Age of Empires ) will shut down operation following the release of its upcoming title Halo Wars .
According to sources , employees not associated with Halo Wars have been laid off today .
Those attached to Halo Wars have been offered incentives to stay on the project until completion .
Halo Wars , an RTS based on the Halo franchise , was announced in September of 2006 .
The Xbox 360 title is currently slated for release sometime in the first half of 2009 .
Ensemble Studios was founded in 1995 .
The Microsoft - owned company is best known for the Age of Empires series of RTS games .
Shacknews has contacted both Microsoft and Ensemble for comment , but has not yet received a reply .
The Church wants its convicted bishop to serve his penance in a holy place
The Greek Orthodox Church says it wants to convert a 17th Century monastery into a prison for convicted clerics .
The Holy Synod has applied for permission to turn the Hrysopighi monastery in the southern Peloponnese peninsula into a correctional facility .
It hopes the recently convicted Bishop of Attica , Panteleimon , will be able to serve out his six - year sentence for embezzlement in the monastery .
The plan could later be extended to other errant priests , officials said .
Panteleimon , who is in his 70s , was convicted a month ago of embezzling around 200,000 euros ( $ 317,000 ; £ 158,000 ) from a monastery under his jurisdiction .
Greek news reports say he is currently having a tough time in the country 's top security Korydallos prison , suffering from taunts by fellow prisoners .
But the proposal to move him to what the Synod calls more " appropriate surroundings " has aroused considerable opposition from people who believe that convicted priests should endure the same conditions as other law - breakers , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens .
Panteleimon is the most high - profile cleric in jail , but another influential priest is facing trial for allegedly bribing judges , while the authorities have accused members of a rebel monastery on Mount Athos - Greece 's semi-autonomous religious enclave - of embezzling Church property .
They deny the allegations against them .
There 's probably going to come a point when Straight Talk McCain 's seeming inability to tell the truth devolves into farce .
Maybe we 're already there .
FactCheck.org is objecting to a McCain ad that attacks Obama using FactCheck.org as a source .
The problem is , FactCheck never said what McCain claims they said .
A McCain -Palin ad has FactCheck.org calling Obama 's attacks on Palin " absolutely false " and " misleading . "
That 's what we said , but it was n't about Obama .
Our article criticized anonymous e-mail falsehoods and bogus claims about Palin posted around the Internet .
We have no evidence that any of the claims we found to be false came from the Obama campaign .
The McCain - Palin ad also twists a quote from a Wall Street Journal columnist .
He said the Obama camp had sent a team to Alaska to " dig into her record and background . "
The ad quotes the WSJ as saying the team was sent to " dig dirt . "
One would think that if you 're going to lie about someone , lying about a fact - checking organization -- that uses " FactCheck " as their own freakin ' name -- is probably not the best of choices .
But what do I know ?

Some feared firing up the LHC would doom the Earth
The internet needs a way to help people separate rumour from real science , says the creator of the World Wide Web .
Talking to BBC News Sir Tim Berners - Lee said he was increasingly worried about the way the web has been used to spread disinformation .
Sir
Tim spoke prior to the unveiling of a Foundation he has co-created that aims to make the web truly worldwide .
It will look at ways to get the web into mobiles and into nations where net use is languishing .
Future proof Sir Tim talked to the BBC in the week in which Cern , where he did his pioneering work on the web , turned on the Large Hadron Collider for the first time .
The use of the web to spread fears that flicking the switch on the LHC could create a Black Hole that could swallow up the Earth particularly concerned him , he said .
In a similar vein was the spread of rumours that the MMR vaccine given to children in Britain was harmful .
Sir Tim told BBC
News that there needed to be new systems that would give websites a label for trustworthiness once they had been proved reliable sources .
" On the web the thinking of cults can spread very rapidly and suddenly a cult which was 12 people who had some deep personal issues suddenly find a formula which is very believable , " he said .
" A sort of conspiracy theory of sorts and which you can imagine spreading to thousands of people and being deeply damaging . "
Sir Tim and colleagues at the World Wide Web consortium had looked at simple ways of branding websites - but concluded that a whole variety of different mechanisms was needed .
Sir
Tim wants to help get the web to people who are cut off from it .
" I 'm not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ rating because like people they can vary in all kinds of different ways , " he said .
" So I 'd be interested in different organisations labelling websites in different ways " .
Sir
Tim spoke to the BBC to publicise the launch of his World Wide Web Foundation which aims to improve the web 's accessibility .
Alongside this role it will aim to make it easier for people to get online .
Currently only 20 % of the world 's population have access to the web " Has it been designed by the West for the West ? " asked Sir Tim .
" Has it been designed for the executive and the teenager in the modern city with a smart phone in their pocket ?
If you are in a rural community do you need a different kind of web with different kinds of facilities ? "
Creative medium
The Web Foundation will also explore ways to make the web more mobile - phone friendly .
That would increase its use in Africa and other poor parts of the world where there are few computers but plenty of handsets .
The Foundation will also look at how the benefits of the web can be taken to those who cannot read or write .
" We 're talking about the evolution of the web , " he said .
" Perhaps by using gestures or pointing .
When something is such a creative medium as the web , the limits to it are our imagination " .
The Foundation will also look at concerns that the web has become less democratic , and its use influenced too much by large corporations and vested interests .
" I think that question is very important and may be settled in the next few years , " said Sir Tim .
" One of the things I always remain concerned about is that that medium remains neutral , " he said .
" It 's not just where I go to decide where to buy my shoes which is the commercial incentive - it's where I go to decide who I 'm going to trust to vote , " he said .
" It 's where I go maybe to decide what sort of religion I 'm going to belong to or not belong to ; it 's where I go to decide what is actual scientific truth - what I 'm actually going to go along with and what is bunkum " .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) -
Sex on the beach or drunken trysts may not raise eyebrows in many cities , but a recent case in Dubai has exposed a growing cultural divide between native Muslims and Western residents seeking fun in the sun .

Sex on the beach or drunken trysts may not raise eyebrows in many cities , but a recent case in Dubai has exposed a growing cultural divide between native Muslims and Western residents seeking fun in the sun .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
The story of a British pair facing possible jail terms on charges of having drunken sex on the beach made headlines around the world , but in Dubai , reports are frequent of hapless foreigners falling foul of local laws that strictly control drinking and ban homosexuality or kissing in public .
Dubai ’s foreign population has expanded rapidly in recent years , dwarfing the native population , as the Gulf Arab trade and tourism hub tries to put itself on the international map with a promise of tax - free earnings and year - round sunshine .
But balancing its Muslim identity in what remains a deeply conservative Gulf Arab region with the lifestyles of expatriates who comprise over 90 percent of its population is no mean feat .
“ Everybody who lives in this country , whether they are citizens or expats , can sense how massively difficult it is to be a minority in your own country and feel such pressure on your habits , your language , your religion , ” said Abdel - Khaleq Abdullah , an Emirati political scientist .
Residents from the Indian subcontinent , mainly labourers , almost certainly comprise the largest group in Dubai but the issue is so sensitive that the government of the United Arab Emirates did not release a breakdown of national origins in the results of its last census .
“ We are at the point where we need to talk about this frankly , ” said Abdullah .
“ We feel that our identity and all its components are under threat ...
The fundamentals of the entire growth model need to be rethought to fit our demographic needs . ”
Dubai has nurtured an image as a glamorous , cosmopolitan city with ambitious projects such as the world ’s tallest tower , yet its 80,000 or so nationals feel their values are eclipsed .
Expatriates live and work on three - year visas , with little prospect of ever attaining citizenship or political say .
Many Westerners work in free zones that are akin to economic enclaves and live in newly developed suburbs , rarely mixing with locals .
The contrasts are stark .
Nationals receive free housing , education and healthcare in what analysts say is a tacit understanding whereby rulers redistribute oil wealth in return for political loyalty .
The UAE held limited elections to an advisory body in 2006 but is still ruled by dynasties .
Bikini - clad tourists sunbathe on the beach , watched by women draped in black robes .
“ There are now so many foreigners they feel they have collective security .
Western behaviour has become the norm and does not fit in with the culture of the indigenous population , ” said Durham University ’s Christopher Davidson , author of two books on the United Arab Emirates , which includes Dubai .
“ Though the indigenous population is small ... it is only them who matter politically . ”
CONTRASTS
The differences in the lifestyles of Dubai ’s divergent communities are visible all over the city .
Muslims are banned from drinking , non-Muslims who carry the right licence can buy alcohol from special shops , yet at weekends the beach bars and open air clubs heave with hard - drinking revellers .
Use of synthetic drugs like ecstasy is also rising in Gulf nations , according to a recent United Nations report .
The British couple arrested on the beach had met at one of the many champagne brunches held in Dubai ’s top hotels on Friday , the Muslim holy day .
They now face possible jail terms when they return to court for the next hearing on Oct.
7 .
“ The problem is that people are ignorant of the laws here , ” Hassan Mattar , the British pair ’s lawyer , told Reuters .
“ This is an Islamic country and the problem is not with the law , but with the people . ”
Yet the more such cases make headlines outside the UAE , the more it raises concerns for Dubai ’s efforts to keep growing its economy and population .
The British man charged with having sex on the beach came to Dubai to start a business , abandoning his plans on his arrest .
Tourism , a fast - growing sector which according to the World Travel & Tourism Council is expected to contribute more than 20 percent of the UAE ’s economy in 2008 , may also be affected in a city promoting itself as a luxury destination .
“ These cases are greatly damaging to Dubai ’s economy , ” said Durham University ’s Davidson .
“ They make people ask themselves ‘ why go to Dubai for a sun and beach holiday if you can get arrested for kissing ? ’
Just go to Florida instead .
There are so many alternatives . ”
Yet nationals who already feel like foreigners in their own city do not want Dubai rules relaxed , saying police already turn a blind eye to all but the most blatant transgressions .
If the law changed to suit Westerners , said one Emirati woman , it would be her who lost her freedom .
She already forbids her daughters from going to Dubai ’s malls and hotels .
“ It is up to the person who comes here to be informed , ” said the woman , who like most declined to be named on a topic which they feel is too sensitive to discuss in public .
“ If there is an open trading system which draws people from all over the world , it is not fair to ask why they are not free .
You have to follow the rules of wherever in the world you go . ”

Death by Embracing the Reflection of the Moon
Chinese poet Li Po ( 701 - 706 ) is regarded as one of the two greatest poets in Chinaâ€™s literary history .
He was well known for his love of liquor and often spouted his greatest poems while drunk .
One night , Li Po fell from his boat and drowned in the Yangtze River while trying to embrace the reflection of the moon in the water .
Death by Beard
Austrian Hans Steininger was famous for having the worldâ€™s longest beard ( it was 4.5 feet or nearly 1.4 m long ) and for dying because of it .
One day in 1567 , there was a fire in town and in his haste Hans forgot to roll up his beard .
He accidentally stepped on his beard , lost balance , stumbled , broke his neck and died !
Death From Holding a Pee In
Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe [ wiki ] was one interesting fellow .
He kept a dwarf as a court jester who sat under the table during dinner .
He even had a tame pet moose .
Tycho also lost the tip of his nose in a duel with another Danish nobleman and had to wear a “ dummy ” nose made from silver and gold , but thatâ€™s another story .
It was said that Tycho had to hold his pee during one particularly long banquet in 1601 ( getting up in the middle of a dinner was considered really rude ) that his bladder , strained to its limits , developed an infection which later killed him !
Later analyses suggested that Tycho died because of mercury poisoning but thatâ€™s not nearly as interesting as the original story .
Death by Conductorâ€™s Cane
While conducting the hymnal Te Deum for French King Louis XIV in 1687 , Jean - Baptiste Lully was so focused in keeping the rhythm by banging a staff against the floor ( this was the method before conductorâ€™s baton came into use ) , that he struck his toe hard but refused to stop .
The toe developed an abscess , which later turned gangrenous , but Lully refused to have it amputated .
The gangrene spread and killed the stubborn musician .
Ironically , the hymn he was conducting was in celebration of the recovery of Louis XIV from an illness .
Death by Dessert
King Adolf Frederick [ wiki ] of Sweden loved to eat and died from it too !
The “ King Who Ate Himself to Death ” died in 1771 at the age of 61 from a digestive problem after eating a giant meal consisting of lobster ,
caviar , saurkraut , cabbage soup , smoked herring , champagne and 14 servings of his favorite dessert :
semla [ wiki ] , a bun filled with marzipan and milk .
Death by Jury Demonstration
After the Civil War , controversial Ohio politician Clement Vallandigham [ wiki ] became a highly successful lawyer who rarely lost a case .
In 1871 , he defended Thomas McGehan who was accused of shooting one Tom Myers during a barroom brawl .
Vallandighamâ€™s defense was that Myers had accidentally shot himself while drawing his pistol from a kneeling position .
To convince the jury , Vallandigham decided to demonstrate his theory .
Unfortunately , he grabbed a loaded gun by mistake and ended up shooting himself !
By dying , Vallandigham succeeded in demonstrating the plausibility of the accidental shooting and got his client acquitted .
Death from Biting Oneâ€™s Tongue
Allan Pinkerton ( 1819 - 1884 ) [ wiki ] ,
famous for creating the Pinkerton detective agency and developing investigative techniques such as surveilling a suspect and doing undercover work , died of an infection after biting his tongue when he slipped on a sidewalk !
Death from Stubbing Oneâ€™s Toe
Famous Tennessee whiskey distiller Jack Daniel [ wiki ] decided to come in to work early one morning in 1911 .
He wanted to open his safe but couldnâ€™t remember the combination .
In anger , Daniel kicked the safe and injured his toe , which later developed an infection that killed him !
Moral of the story ?
Donâ€™t go to work early .
Death by Orange Peel
Bobby Leach wasnâ€™t afraid to court death : in 1911 , he was the second person in the world to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel .
The daredevil went on to perform many other death - defying stunts , so his death is especially ironic .
One day while walking down a street in New Zealand , Leach slipped on a piece of orange peel .
He broke his leg so badly it had to be amputated .
Leach died due to complications that developed afterwards .
Death by Overcoat Parachute Failure
In 1911 , French tailor Franz Reichelt decided to test his invention , a combination overcoat and parachute , by jumping off the Eiffel Tower .
Actually , he told the authorities that he would use a dummy , but at the last minute decided to test it himself .
It was no surprise that he fell to his death .
Death by 1 ) Poison , 2 ) Gunshot Wound ( 4x ) , 3 ) Beating by Clubs , 4 ) Drowning .
According to legends , Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin ( 1869 -1916 ) was first poisoned with enough cyanide to kill ten men , but he wasnâ€™t affected .
So his killers shot him in the back with a revolver .
Rasputin fell but later revived .
So , he was shot again three more times , but Rasputin still lived .
He was then clubbed , and for good measure thrown into the icy Neva River .
Rasputin was finally dead for good .
Death by Baseball
Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman [ wiki ] was the only man ever killed by a baseball pitch .
At that time , baseball pitchers dirtied up a ball before it was thrown at the batter to make it harder to see .
On August 6 , 1920 in a game against the New York Yankees , Carl Mays pitched such a ball towards Chapman that fatally hit his skull .
Death by Scarf
“ Mother of modern dance ” Isadora Duncan [ wiki ] was killed in 1927 by her trademark scarf she loved to wear :
As the New York Times noted in its obituary of the dancer on 15 September 1927 , “ The automobile was going at full speed when the scarf of strong silk began winding around the wheel and with terrific force dragged Miss Duncan , around whom it was securely wrapped , bodily over the side of the car , precipitating her with violence against the cobblestone street .
She was dragged for several yards before the chauffeur halted , attracted by her cries in the street .
Medical aid was summoned , but it was stated that she had been strangled and killed instantly . ”
Death by Garbage
Homer and Langley Collyer [ wiki ] were compulsive hoarders .
The two brothers had a fear of throwing anything away and obsessively collected newspapers and other junk in their house .
They even set up booby - traps in corridors and doorways to protect against intruders .
In 1947 , an anonymous tip called that there was a dead body in the Collyer house , and after much initial difficulty getting in , the police found Homer Collyer dead and Langley no where to be found .
About two weeks later , after removing nearly 100 tons of garbage from the house , workers found Langley Collyerâ€™s partialy decomposed ( and rat - chewed ) body just 10 feet away from where they had found his brother .
Apparently , Langley had been crawling through tunnels of newspapers to bring food to his paralyzed brother when he set off one of his own booby - traps .
Homer died several days later from starvation .
Death at a Talk Show
Jerome Irving Rodale [ wiki ] was a proponent of healthy eating .
He was an early advocate for organic farming and sustainable agriculture , founder of Organic Farming and Gardening magazine and Rodale Press .
After bragging that he would “ live to 100 , unless Iâ€™m run down by a a sugar - crazy taxi driver ” , Rodale died of a heart attack while being interviewed on the Dick Cavett Show in 1971 .
Appearing fast asleep , Dick Cavett joked “ Are we boring you , Mr. Rodale ? ” before discovering that his 72 - year - old guest had indeed died .
The show was never aired .
Death by Suicide During a Live TV News Broadcast
Christine Chubbuck [ wiki ] was the first and only TV news reporter to commit suicide during a live television broadcast .
On July 15 , 1974 , eight minutes into the broadcast , the depressed reporter said “ In keeping with Channel 40 â€ ™s policy of bringing you the latest in blood and guts ,
and in living color , you are going to see another first : an attempted suicide . ”
With that , Chubbuck drew up a revolver and shot herself in the head .
Death on the Toilet
There are several examples of death on the toilet , but that of Elvis Presley ( 1935 – 1977 ) was the most famous .
The King of Rock â€˜n Roll was found lying on the floor of his Graceland mansionâ€™s bathroom after throwing up while being seated on the toilet , taking care of business .
Doctors attributed his death to a heart attack from weight gain and taking too many prescription drugs .
Death by Robot
Robert Williams [ wiki ] was the first man ever killed by a robot .
On January 25 , 1979 , Williams climbed into a storage rack at the Ford Motorâ€™s Flat Rock casting plant to retrieve a part because the parts - retrieval robot malfunctioned .
Suddenly , the robot reactivated and slammed its arm into Williamsâ€ ™ head , killing him instantly .
The second death by robot happened just a couple of years afterwards in 1981 .
Kenji Urada [ wiki ] , a 37 - year - old Japanese maintenance engineer was working on a broken robot at a Kawasaki plant when he failed to turn it off .
The robotâ€™s mechanical arm accidentally pushed him into a grinding machine .
Death by Decapitation by Helicopter Rotor Blades
Actor Vic Morrow [ wiki ] died on the set of Twilight Zone : The Movie when a helicopter spun out of control due to special effect explosions , crashed , and decapitated him with its rotor blades .
Two other child actors also died at the event , which triggered a massive reform in US child labor laws and safety regulations on movie sets .
Death by Cactus
In 1982 , 27 - year - old David Grundman and a roommate decided to do a little “ cactus plugging , ” by shooting the desert plant with a shotgun .
The first one , a small cactus , went off without a hitch and Grundman was encouraged to try a larger prey : a 26 - foot - tall Saguaro cactus , probably a 100 - year - old plant .
Unfortunately , Grundman blasted off a large chuck of the cactus that fell on him and crushed him to death !
Death by Bottle Cap
American playwright Tennessee Williams [ wiki ] died in 1983 after he choked on a bottle cap in his hotel room .
Yes , he had been drinking .
Death by Drowning at a Lifeguardsâ€™ Party .
In 1985 , to celebrate their first drowning - free season ever , the lifeguards of the New Orleans recreation department decided to throw themselves a party .
When the party ended , a 31 - year - old guest named Jerome Moody was found dead on the bottom of the recreation departmentâ€™s pool .
We suppose when itâ€™s your time to go , then itâ€™s your time to go : there were four lifeguards on duty and more than half of the 200 party - goers were themselves lifeguards !
Death on Stage , While Telling a Joke
Dick Shawn ( 1924-1987 ) was a comedian who had a heart attack and died during a joke that seemed strangely appropriate :
He was making fun of politicians by saying campaign cliches ending with “ I will not lay down on the job ! ”
Shawn then laid down on the floor face down .
At first , the audience thought that it was all part of the show , until some time later a theater employee checked him for a pulse and began administering CPR .
The paramedics then arrived , and the audience were told to go home – Dick Shawn was dead .
Death by Belly Slam .
British pro wrestler Mal “ King Kong ” Kirk died underneath the big belly of Shirley “ Big Daddy ” Crabtree .
In August 1987 , during the final moments of the match , Crabtree delivered his signature “ Belly - Splash ” move ( basically jumping up and down , slamming his belly onto a guy ) on Kirk , who then had a heart attack and died .
Crabtree was cleared after it was revealed that Kirk had a serious heart condition prior to the match .
However , Crabtree blamed himself for Kirkâ€™s death and retired from pro wrestling .
Before the match , Kirk had told his friends : “ If I have to go , I hope it is in the ring . ”
Death by Giant Umbrellas
In 1991 , artists Christo and Jeanne - Claude put up an environmental installation art of thousands of giant yellow and blue umbrellas in California and Japan .
The giant umbrellas , which measured about 20 foot ( 6 m ) in height , 28 foot ( 8.7 m ) in diameter and weighed about 500 lb , became a huge tourist attraction .
Less than two months after the installation opened , Lori Rae Keevil - Mathews , a 33 - year - old woman drove out to see the umbrellas in California .
A wind gust uprooted one of the umbrellas and blew it straight at her , crushing her against a boulder and killing her .
Christo immediately ordered all of the umbrellas taken down .
The umbrellas , however , took another life – this time in Japan .
Crane operator Masaaki Nakamura was electrocuted when the machineâ€™s arm touched a 65,000 - volt high - tension line when removing the umbrellas .
Death by Re-creation
In 1991 , a 57 - year - old Thai woman Yooket Paen was walking in her farm when she accidentally slipped on a cow dung , grabbed a naked live wire and got electrocuted to death .
Soon after Paenâ€™s funeral , her 52 - year - old - sister Yooket Pan was showing her neighbors how the accident happened when she herself slipped , grabbed the same live wire and also got electrocuted to death !
Death by Sheep
In 1999 , Betty Stobbs , 67 , of Durham , England , took a bale of hay to feed her flock of sheep on the back of her motorcycle .
Apparently , the sheep were very hungry .
About forty of them rushed the hay and knocked her off a cliff into a 100 - feet deep quarry .
Stobbs survived the fall only to be killed when the motorcycle , which was also knocked off the cliff , tumbled down after her .
Death by Necklace Bomb
On the afternoon of August 28 , 2003 , pizza deliveryman Brian Wells [ wiki ] tried to rob a bank with a home - made shotgun disguised as a cane .
When he was caught by the police , Wells revealed that he had been forced by some people he delivered pizza to earlier to rob the bank .
A necklace with an explosive device was attached to his neck .
The necklace bomb blew up before the bomb squad could deactivate it ( indeed , there was controversy whether the police took his story seriously and delayed calling the bomb squad ) .
Until today , itâ€™s unclear whether Wells was a victim , a co-conspirator or the lone perpetrator of the robbery and subsequent death .
Death by Stingray
In 2006 , Australian wildlife expert and TV personality Steve “ The Crocodile Hunter ” Irwin
died when he was stabbed in the heart by a stingray spine while filming a documentary Oceanâ€™s Deadliest .
Death by Bookcase
Mariesa Weber was reported missing by her family for nearly two weeks before they found her in her bedroom , wedged behind a bookcase .
“ Iâ€™m sleeping in the same house as her for 11 days , looking for her , ” her mother , Connie Weber , told the St. Petersburg Times .
“ And sheâ€™s right in the bedroom . ”
Both Weber and her sister had previously adjusted the television plug by standing on a bureau next to the shelf and leaning over the top .
Her family believes Weber , who was 5 - foot - 3 and barely 100 pounds , may have fallen headfirst into the space .
I had successfully avoided checking out NASA 's in depth " multimedia feature " celebrating their 50th anniversary since they launched it earlier this month .
But today when their promo featured Astronaut Snoopy – my Achilles heel – I caved .
Adobe awarded them " Site of the Day " August 18th , but could it stand up to Wired Science scrutiny ?
The feature is divided up by decade and you default to the 1950's with the jukebox playing and everything in back and white .
I jumped to the 1960's to look for Snoopy and was rewarded with the seven original cartoons that Charles Shultz ran in March 1969 when Snoopy became the first beagle on the Moon .
The 60's have vinyl playing in the background and if you do n't like the song that is on just fast forward to a better track .
They have the Stones , Jefferson Airplane , and The Mamas & the Papas to name a few .
Do n't miss Cronkite 's recollecting of Apollo 11 – it 's worth getting choked up over .
The 70's move onto 8 - tracks of ABBA , Aerosmith , and Pink Floyd ( go
NASA ) .
There is an avatar of Carl Sagan that talks about the great
Voyager missions and while he may look stiff the authentic Sagan audio track is as melodic and entrancing as ever .
In the 80's there are some great moments , like a tribute to Sally
Ride , the first American woman in space .
The footage is all original from 1983 with the original voice overs too .
It is wonderful to see history in its original context and not skewed through the lens of current events .
Each decade features a theater of such gems .
It 's a lot of fun for those of us who were not there to see and I am sure a nostalgic romp for those who were .
Michael Jackson 's
Thriller is included in the cassette soundtrack along with The Breakfast Club favorite , " Do n't You Forget About Me . "
The 90's jump to CD's of Lenny Kravitz and Pearl Jam .
The DJ's of
NASA 's virtual radio station spice up the intros to most songs with sound bites about the decades current events and NASA news .
For a
Twitter - length attention span it is a great way to get people to learn about NASA 's past achievements as they bee bop through the landscape .
The 2000 's finish with an iPod of Green Day , Nelly Furtado and the
Foo Fighters .
Although none of the other rockets take you anywhere , I do recommend the big finish of clicking on the Ares I rocket , if only to see the cool bubble city at the lunar south pole .
I think that is one of the things missing in NASA 's visions of the future– not enough bubble cities .
So I can't say I am the biggest fan of Automa , the robotic tour guide , and the feature reminds me a lot of a website where you regret clicking the less desirable links , but all in all you can see that a lot must have gone into making it and that they actually had someone with an ear for music involved too , which I can always appreciate .
So jump in , check it out , you might even come out with some great Snoopy cartoons you can hang in your cubicle .

A potential merger between Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) and Lloyds TSB would create a banking colossus .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The combined group would have a dominant role in the key markets of mortgages , savings and current accounts .
HBOS is already the UK 's biggest mortgage lender , writing one in five of all new home loans , while Lloyds TSB through its Cheltenham & Gloucester brand is the third biggest lender overall , and wrote 24 per cent of new mortgages during the second quarter of the year .
If a merger was to go ahead , the two groups would have a combined mortgage book of £ 335.1bn , dwarfing their next nearest rival Nationwide , which had outstanding mortgages of £ 118.9bn at the end of 2007 .
The two groups also dominate the savings market , with HBOS the biggest savings provider and Lloyds TSB the third largest , with retail balances of £ 139bn and £ 65 bn respectively .
Lloyds TSB is the UK 's biggest current account provider , and 22 per cent of all new current accounts that were opened during 2007 were with Halifax or Bank of Scotland .
But despite the potential size of the combined operations , the move is unlikely to be good news for consumers .
There are currently five big high street banks , namely Barclays , HSBC , HBOS , Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland , and a merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS would shrink this to just four .
Ray Boulger , senior technical manager at John Charcol , said : " Clearly it would create an even bigger major player than we already have .

" But it is bad news for consumers , any reduction in competition is nearly always bad news for consumers . "
He said the big concern would be that most of the brands at HBOS , which includes Halifax , Bank of Scotland and Birmingham Midshires , would be collapsed into the brands of the company that was taking it over .
He said that while Cheltenham & Gloucester 's mortgage rates generally had the edge over the ones being offered by Halifax , the HBOS group had a far wider product portfolio and was still lending to people with just a 5 per cent deposit , whereas Cheltenham & Gloucester demands a 10 per cent one .
He added that HBOS 's savings rates , particularly through its Birmingham Midshires brand , were more competitive than ones offered by Lloyds TSB .
Mr Boulger also said that while the Competition Commission was likely to raise concerns about the deal if a merger between the two groups was announced , it was unlikely that it would block it .
He said : " In a normal market if Lloyds TSB was looking to take over HBOS , I think the Competition Commission would be interested .
" But in the current environment and when the talks are because HBOS , or the Financial Services Authority , or the Bank of England feel they should engage in talks , the Competition Commission will be told to shut up . "
Kevin Mountford , head of banking at moneysupermarket.com , said : " A shotgun marriage of HBOS and Lloyds TSB would not be in the best interests of British consumers . "
He said with Alliance & Leicester being taken over by Abbey 's parent Santander , and Nationwide taking over two building societies , there was a large reduction in competition and choice for consumers .
He said : " It is the likes of A&L and Halifax that have been the most competitive for current accounts and many other products .
" HBOS can survive and prosper independently and in the medium to long - term this is the better option for consumers . "
The feeling is familiar .
I had it four years ago and four years before that : a sinking feeling in the stomach .
It 's a kind of physical pessimism which says : " It 's happening again .
The Democrats are about to lose an election they should win - and it could not matter more . "
In my head , I 'm not as anxious for Barack Obama 's chances as I was for John Kerry 's in 2004 or Al Gore 's in 2000 .
He is a better candidate than both put together , and all the empirical evidence says this year favours Democrats more than any since 1976 .
But still , I can't shake off the gloom .
Look at yesterday 's opinion polls , which have John McCain either in a dead heat with Obama or narrowly ahead .
Given the well - documented tendency of African - American candidates to perform better in polls than in elections - thanks to people who say they will vote for a black man but do n't - this suggests Obama is now trailing badly .
More troubling was the ABC News - Washington Post survey which found McCain ahead among white women by 53 % to 41 % .
Two weeks ago , Obama had a 15 % lead among women .
There is only one explanation for that turnaround , and it was not McCain 's tranquilliser of a convention speech : Obama 's lead has been crushed by the Palin bounce .
So you can understand my pessimism .
But it 's now combined with a rising frustration .
I watch as the Democrats stumble , uncertain how to take on Sarah Palin .
Fight too hard , and the Republican machine , echoed by the ditto - heads in the conservative commentariat on talk radio and cable TV , will brand Democrats sexist , elitist snobs , patronising a small - town woman .
Do nothing , and Palin 's rise will continue unchecked , her novelty making even Obama look stale , her star power energising and motivating the Republican base .
So somehow Palin slips out of reach , no revelation - no matter how jaw - dropping or career - ending were it applied to a normal candidate - doing sufficient damage to slow her apparent march to power , dragging the charisma - deprived McCain behind her .
We know one of Palin 's first acts as mayor of tiny Wasilla , Alaska was to ask the librarian the procedure for banning books .
Oh , but that was a " rhetorical " question , says the McCain - Palin campaign .
We know Palin is not telling the truth when she says she was against the notorious $ 400 m " Bridge to Nowhere " project in Alaska - in fact , she campaigned for it - but she keeps repeating the claim anyway .
She denounces the dipping of snouts in the Washington trough - but hired costly lobbyists to make sure Alaska got a bigger helping of federal dollars than any other state .
She claims to be a fiscal conservative , but left Wasilla saddled with debts it had never had before .
She even seems to have claimed " per diem " allowances - taxpayers ' money meant for out - of - town travel - when she was staying in her own house .
Yet somehow none of this is yet leaving a dent .
The result is that a politician who conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan calls a " Christianist " - seeking to politicise Christianity the way Islamists politicise Islam - could soon be a heartbeat away from the presidency .
Remember , this is a woman who once addressed a church congregation , saying of her work as governor - transport , policing and education - " really all of that stuff does n't do any good if the people of Alaska 's heart is n't right with God " .
If Sarah Palin defies the conventional wisdom that says elections are determined by the top of the ticket , and somehow wins this for McCain , what will be the reaction ?
Yes , blue - state America will go into mourning once again , feeling estranged in its own country .
A generation of young Americans - who back Obama in big numbers - will turn cynical , concluding that politics does n't work after all .
And , most depressing , many African - Americans will decide that if even Barack Obama - with all his conspicuous gifts - could not win , then no black man can ever be elected president .
But what of the rest of the world ?
This is the reaction I fear most .
For Obama has stirred an excitement around the globe unmatched by any American politician in living memory .
Polling in Germany , France , Britain and Russia shows that Obama would win by whopping majorities , with the pattern repeated in Africa , Asia , the Middle East and Latin America .
If November 4 were a global ballot , Obama would win it handsomely .
If the free world could choose its leader , it would be Barack Obama .
The crowd of 200,000 that rallied to hear him in Berlin in July did so not only because of his charisma , but also because they know he , like the majority of the world 's population , opposed the Iraq war .
McCain supported it , peddling the lie that Saddam was linked to 9/11 .
Non-Americans sense that Obama will not ride roughshod over the international system but will treat alliances and global institutions seriously : McCain wants to bypass the United Nations in favour of a US - friendly League of Democracies .
McCain might talk a good game on climate change , but a repeated floor chant at the Republican convention was " Drill , baby , drill ! " , as if the solution to global warming were not a radical rethink of the US 's entire energy system but more offshore oil rigs .
If Americans choose McCain , they will be turning their back on the rest of the world , choosing to show us four more years of the Bush - Cheney finger .
And I predict a deeply unpleasant shift .
Until now , anti-Americanism has been exaggerated and much misunderstood : outside a leftist hardcore , it has mostly been anti-Bushism , opposition to this specific administration .
But if McCain wins in November , that might well change .
Suddenly Europeans and others will conclude that their dispute is with not only one ruling clique , but Americans themselves .
For it will have been the American people , not the politicians , who will have passed up a once - in - a - generation chance for a fresh start - a fresh start the world is yearning for .
And the manner of that decision will matter , too .
If it is deemed to have been about race - that Obama was rejected because of his colour - the world 's verdict will be harsh .
In that circumstance , Slate 's Jacob Weisberg wrote recently , international opinion would conclude that " the United States had its day , but in the end could n't put its own self - interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race " .
Even if it 's not ethnic prejudice , but some other aspect of the culture wars , that proves decisive , the point still holds .
For America to make a decision as grave as this one - while the planet boils and with the US fighting two wars - on the trivial basis that a hockey mom is likable and seems down to earth , would be to convey a lack of seriousness , a fleeing from reality , that does indeed suggest a nation in , to quote Weisberg , " historical decline " .
Let 's not forget , McCain 's campaign manager boasts that this election is " not about the issues . "
Of course I know that even to mention Obama 's support around the world is to hurt him .
Incredibly , that large Berlin crowd damaged Obama at home , branding him the " candidate of Europe " and making him seem less of a patriotic American .
But what does that say about today 's America , that the world 's esteem is now unwanted ?
If Americans reject Obama , they will be sending the clearest possible message to the rest of us - and , make no mistake , we shall hear it .

Functional Testing of GUI Applications
It 's Worth the Pain
This is an article on the functional testing of desktop ( GUI ) applications .
It started life as a talk given at PyCon UK 2008 .
There is video of me giving this presentation as a 45 minute talk at PyCon 2009 : Functional Testing of Desktop Applications
This article goes through both the why and how ( the infrastructure and processes involved in testing ) of functional testing , and then moves onto some specific examples with a simple application called MultiDoc .
MultiDoc is the example application from chapters 3 - 6 of IronPython in Action ) .
Introduction Introduction and a look at if it is even possible to test desktop applications .
Why and How Why bother , and the processes and infrastructure around automated functional testing .
User Stories
The eXtreme Programming technique for specifying and testing individual application features is done using ' User Stories ' .
Testing MultiDoc Part I
An introduction to some real functional testing with MultiDoc and unittest .
Testing MultiDoc Part II
Having setup the functional tests we need to interact with the application .
A look at some techniques to do this , by testing the ' New Tab Page ' dialog of MultiDoc .
Problems
It is n't always straightforward of course .
There are many difficulties and potential frailties in GUI tests .
In the conclusion we look at some of the problems and some of the ways you can mimimise the pain .
If you 'd like to play with the examples then you can download the full MultiDoc example with test framework and example unit tests and functional tests .
Halving global poverty by 2015 is one of the UN's key goals Billions of dollars will be wasted unless there is a radical overhaul of the system of giving aid , a report from a leading aid agency warns .
Care International says too much money is being spent on short - term fixes during emergencies , rather than on longer - term prevention work .
The number of people living " on the edge of emergency " has nearly doubled to 220 million in two years , Care says .
The report comes ahead of a high - level UN meeting on poverty goals next week .
Halving poverty and hunger around the world by 2015 are key objectives of the UN's Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) .
Co-ordination call Care says a failure to resolve the underlying issues trapping people in extreme poverty has left millions now unable to cope with surging food prices .
In countless previous emergencies , aid has often arrived too late , was short - term , and policies were targeted too heavily on saving lives rather than building resilience in the population , the report says .
It 's much more cost effective to respond when you know people are vulnerable ... than fire - fighting , when you have to manage an emergency response
Vanessa Rubin
Care International Vanessa Rubin , a hunger adviser for Care , told the BBC it was much more cost effective to support people who were on the brink of a disaster , rather than " fire - fighting when you have to manage an emergency response " .
" If we take the example of Niger , in west Africa .
In 2005 , it was costing about $ 80 ( £ 44 ) to save a malnourished child at the height of the crisis , " she said .
" Months before that , at the point where children were vulnerable , the equivalent intervention would have been about $ 1 a day . "
She said it was time to take stock , " admitting that business - as - usual has n't worked , and agreeing to change mind - sets , and really change the way that everyone works " .
" That 's a big call for the agencies , for donor governments , for governments in the big countries where there are hungry people , and for the UN , " she said .
Acute hunger
The report , Living on the edge of emergency : Paying the price of inaction , urges donors to better co-ordinate their emergency aid and long - term development commitments .
It also calls for more focus on food production and support for the world 's poor , as well as developing early warning systems for disasters .
Next week 's meeting of the MDG is aimed at boosting international commitment to halve the number of people whose income is less than $ 1 ( 55 p ) a day by 2015 .
The Care report comes a day after the head of the UN's food agency , Jacques Diouf , said the number of people suffering from acute hunger rose by 75 million to an estimated 925 million last year .

[ AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED :
Text version below transcribed directly from audio ( 2 ) ]
Program Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen , we take pride in presenting a thoughtful address by Ronald Reagan .
Mr. Reagan :
Reagan :
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you and good evening .
The sponsor has been identified , but unlike most television programs , the performer has n't been provided with a script .
As a matter of fact , I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks .
I have spent most of my life as a Democrat .
I recently have seen fit to follow another course .
I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines .
Now , one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity .
The line has been used , " We 've never had it so good . "
But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity is n't something on which we can base our hopes for the future .
No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income .
Today , 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector 's share , and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in .
We have n't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years .
We 've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months , and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world .
We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury ; we do n't own an ounce .
Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars .
And we 've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value .
As for the peace that we would preserve , I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely .
Do they mean peace , or do they mean we just want to be left in peace ?
There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us .
We 're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars , and it 's been said if we lose that war , and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours , history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening .
Well I think it 's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers .
Not too long ago , two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee , a businessman who had escaped from Castro , and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said , " We do n't know how lucky we are . "
And the Cuban stopped and said , " How lucky you are ?
I had someplace to escape to . "
And in that sentence he told us the entire story .
If we lose freedom here , there 's no place to escape to .
This is the last stand on earth .
And this idea that government is beholden to the people , that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people , is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man 's relation to man .
This is the issue of this election : whether we believe in our capacity for self - government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far - distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves .
You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right .
Well I 'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right .
There 's only an up or down : [ up ] man 's old -- old - aged dream , the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order , or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism .
And regardless of their sincerity , their humanitarian motives , those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course .
In this vote - harvesting time , they use terms like the " Great Society , " or as we were told a few days ago by the President , we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people .
But they 've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves ; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print .
These are not Republican accusations .
For example , they have voices that say , " The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism . "
Another voice says , " The profit motive has become outmoded .
It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state . "
Or , " Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century . "
Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded .
He referred to the President as " our moral teacher and our leader , " and he says he is " hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document . "
He must " be freed , " so that he " can do for us " what he knows " is best . "
And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania , another articulate spokesman , defines liberalism as " meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government . "
Well , I , for one , resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me , the free men and women of this country , as " the masses . "
This is a term we have n't applied to ourselves in America .
But beyond that , " the full power of centralized government " -- this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize .
They knew that governments do n't control things .
A government can't control the economy without controlling people .
And they know when a government sets out to do that , it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose .
They also knew , those Founding Fathers , that outside of its legitimate functions , government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy .
Now , we have no better example of this than government 's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years .
Since 1955 , the cost of this program has nearly doubled .
One - fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 % of the farm surplus .
Three - fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 % increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce .
You see , that one - fourth of farming -- that 's regulated and controlled by the federal government .
In the last three years we 've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we do n't grow .
Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater , as President , would seek to eliminate farmers .
He should do his homework a little better , because he 'll find out that we 've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs .
He 'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress [ an ] extension of the farm program to include that three - fourths that is now free .
He 'll find that they 've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who would n't keep books as prescribed by the federal government .
The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals .
And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil .
At the same time , there 's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees .
There 's now one for every 30 farms in the United States , and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore .
Every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy , but how -- who are farmers to know what 's best for them ?
The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program .
The government passed it anyway .
Now the price of bread goes up ; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down .
Meanwhile , back in the city , under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on .
Private property rights [ are ] so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be .
In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy , we see such spectacles as in Cleveland , Ohio , a million - and - a - half - dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a " more compatible use of the land . "
The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands , where heretofore we 've only built them in the hundreds .
But FHA [ Federal Housing Authority ] and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they 've taken back through mortgage foreclosure .
For three decades , we 've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning , and the more the plans fail , the more the planners plan .
The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency .
They 've just declared Rice County , Kansas , a depressed area .
Rice County , Kansas , has two hundred oil wells , and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks .
And when the government tells you you 're depressed , lie down and be depressed .
We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one .
So they 're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning .
Well , now , if government planning and welfare had the answer -- and they 've had almost 30 years of it -- should n't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while ?
Should n't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help ?
The reduction in the need for public housing ?
But the reverse is true .
Each year the need grows greater ; the program grows greater .
We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night .
Well that was probably true .
They were all on a diet .
But now we 're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty - stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year .
Welfare spending [ is ] 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression .
We 're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare .
Now do a little arithmetic , and you 'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families , we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year .
And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty .
Direct aid to the poor , however , is only running only about 600 dollars per family .
It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead .
Now -- so now we declare " war on poverty , " or " You , too , can be a Bobby Baker . "
Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we 're spending , one more program to the 30 - odd we have -- and remember , this new program does n't replace any , it just duplicates existing programs -- do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic ?
Well , in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that is n't duplicated .
This is the youth feature .
We 're now going to solve the dropout problem , juvenile delinquency , by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps [ Civilian Conservation Corps ] , and we 're going to put our young people in these camps .
But again we do some arithmetic , and we find that we 're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year .
We can send them to Harvard for 2,700 !
Course , do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency .
But seriously , what are we doing to those we seek to help ?
Not too long ago , a judge called me here in Los Angeles .
He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce .
She had six children , was pregnant with her seventh .
Under his questioning , she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month .
She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise .
She 's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program .
She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who 'd already done that very thing .
Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do - gooders , we 're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals .
They say we 're always " against " things -- we 're never " for " anything .
Well , the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they 're ignorant ; it 's just that they know so much that is n't so .
Now -- we 're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age , and to that end we 've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem .
But we 're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings , when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood .
They 've called it " insurance " to us in a hundred million pieces of literature .
But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program .
They only use the term " insurance " to sell it to the people .
And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government , and the government has used that tax .
There is no fund , because Robert Byers , the actuarial head , appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole .
But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax , they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble .
And they 're doing just that .
A young man , 21 years of age , working at an average salary -- his Social Security contribution would , in the open market , buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65 .
The government promises 127 .
He could live it up until he 's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security .
Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis , so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they 're due -- that the cupboard is n't bare ?
Barry Goldwater thinks we can .
At the same time , ca n't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years ?
Should we not allow a widow with children to work , and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband ?
Should n't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program , which we can not do ?
I think we 're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds .
But I think we 're against forcing all citizens , regardless of need , into a compulsory government program , especially when we have such examples , as was announced last week , when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt .
They 've come to the end of the road .
In addition , was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate , planned inflation , so that when you do get your Social Security pension , a dollar will buy a dollar 's worth , and not 45 cents worth ?
I think we 're for an international organization , where the nations of the world can seek peace .
But I think we 're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two - thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world 's population .
I think we 're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony , while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations .
I think we 're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs , but we 're against doling out money government to government , creating bureaucracy , if not socialism , all over the world .
We set out to help 19 countries .
We 're helping 107 .
We 've spent 146 billion dollars .
With that money , we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie .
We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers , extra wives for Kenya [ n ] government officials .
We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity .
In the last six years , 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold , and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country .
No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size .
So , governments ' programs , once launched , never disappear .
Actually , a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we 'll ever see on this earth .
Federal employees -- federal employees number two and a half million ; and federal , state , and local , one out of six of the nation 's work force employed by government .
These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards .
How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man 's property without a warrant ?
They can impose a fine without a formal hearing , let alone a trial by jury ?
And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine .
In Chico County , Arkansas , James Wier over - planted his rice allotment .
The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment .
And a U.S. marshal sold his 960 - acre farm at auction .
The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work .
Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota , Norman Thomas , six - times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket , said , " If Barry Goldwater became President , he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States . "
I think that 's exactly what he will do .
But as a former Democrat , I can tell you Norman Thomas is n't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration , because back in 1936 , Mr. Democrat himself , Al Smith , the great American , came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson , Jackson , and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx , Lenin , and Stalin .
And he walked away from his Party , and he never returned til the day he died -- because to this day , the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party , that honorable Party , down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England .
Now it does n't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people .
What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the -- or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property ?
And such machinery already exists .
The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute .
Every businessman has his own tale of harassment .
Somewhere a perversion has taken place .
Our natural , unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government , and freedom has never been so fragile , so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment .
Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues .
They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men -- that we 're to choose just between two personalities .
Well what of this man that they would destroy -- and in destroying , they would destroy that which he represents , the ideas that you and I hold dear ?
Is he the brash and shallow and trigger - happy man they say he is ?
Well I 've been privileged to know him " when . "
I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office , and I can tell you personally I 've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing .
This is a man who , in his own business before he entered politics , instituted a profit - sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it .
He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees .
He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program , a pension plan for all his employees .
He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and could n't work .
He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores .
When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande , he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there .
An ex-GI told me how he met him .
It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War , and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas .
And he said that [ there were ] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes .
And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said , " Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona , go to runway such - and - such , " and they went down there , and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane .
Every day in those weeks before Christmas , all day long , he 'd load up the plane , fly it to Arizona , fly them to their homes , fly back over to get another load .
During the hectic split - second timing of a campaign , this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer .
His campaign managers were understandably impatient , but he said , " There are n't many left who care what happens to her .
I 'd like her to know I care . "
This is a man who said to his 19 - year - old son , " There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness , and when you begin to build your life on that rock , with the cement of the faith in God that you have , then you have a real start . "
This is not a man who could carelessly send other people 's sons to war .
And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I 've discussed academic , unless we realize we 're in a war that must be won .
Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory .
They call their policy " accommodation . "
And they say if we 'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy , he 'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us .
All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers .
They say we offer simple answers to complex problems .
Well , perhaps there is a simple answer -- not an easy answer -- but simple :
If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right .
We cannot buy our security , our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain , " Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins , we 're willing to make a deal with your slave masters . "
Alexander Hamilton said , " A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master , and deserves one . "
Now let 's set the record straight .
There 's no argument over the choice between peace and war , but there 's only one guaranteed way you can have peace -- and you can have it in the next second -- surrender .
Admittedly , there 's a risk in any course we follow other than this , but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement , and this is the specter our well - meaning liberal friends refuse to face -- that their policy of accommodation is appeasement , and it gives no choice between peace and war , only between fight or surrender .
If we continue to accommodate , continue to back and retreat , eventually we have to face the final demand -- the ultimatum .
And what then -- when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be ?
He has told them that we 're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War , and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum , our surrender will be voluntary , because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually , morally , and economically .
He believes this because from our side he 's heard voices pleading for " peace at any price " or " better Red than dead , " or as one commentator put it , he 'd rather " live on his knees than die on his feet . "
And therein lies the road to war , because those voices do n't speak for the rest of us .
You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery .
If nothing in life is worth dying for , when did this begin -- just in the face of this enemy ?
Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs ?
Should Christ have refused the cross ?
Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard ' round the world ?
The martyrs of history were not fools , and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis did n't die in vain .
Where , then , is the road to peace ?
Well it 's a simple answer after all .
You and I have the courage to say to our enemies , " There is a price we will not pay . "
" There is a point beyond which they must not advance . "
And this -- this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater 's " peace through strength . "
Winston Churchill said , " The destiny of man is not measured by material computations .
When great forces are on the move in the world , we learn we 're spirits -- not animals . "
And he said , " There 's something going on in time and space , and beyond time and space , which , whether we like it or not , spells duty . "
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny .
We 'll preserve for our children this , the last best hope of man on earth , or we 'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness .
We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us .
He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny .
Thank you very much .

' Bloodbath ' in global markets as Wall St. has worst day since 9/11 Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008
Print This Email This by Rob Lever
WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Troubled Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers sought bankruptcy protection Monday after a frantic weekend of talks failed to find a buyer for the firm ravaged by credit and real estate woes in a shaken financial system .
In a surprise for some analysts , Lehman said it was seeking reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code , a sign that it was still holding out hope for survival in some form .
The massive bankruptcy filing in US federal court in New York listed 639 billion dollars in assets at 613 billion in debts .
The news of Lehman 's collapse prompted a bloodbath in global financial markets as traders flocked to safer Treasury bonds on fears of more dominoes falling in the banking system .
Some analysts said the Federal Reserve , which took a series of steps Sunday and Monday to boost liquidity available to the financial system may need to cut interest rates at its Tuesday policy meeting .
" The sudden bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers over the weekend has led to another dangerous escalation of the crisis in the US financial markets , " said Brian Bethune , economist at Global Insight .
" The economy is very weak , the recession wolves are pounding down the door and the financial system faces new deflationary threats from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
This is an emergency situation and an aggressive response from the Fed is needed . "
Lehman shares plunged 94 percent to 21 cents after the news .
Meanwhile American International Group , one of the world 's biggest insurance companies , slid 60 percent to 4.76 dollars on fears it may too face a cash crunch and credit downgrade .
Merrill Lynch , another white - shoe Wall Street firm , managed to get a lifeline over the weekend with a deal to sell itself for 50 billion dollars to Bank of America .
Merrill shares rose 0.06 percent to 17.06 dollars .
The news came after a weekend of crisis talks involving US Treasury and Federal Reserve officials failed to head off a collapse of Lehman Brothers which some say could send shockwaves through the global financial system .
" The remaining Wall Street firms are scrambling to match as many of Lehman 's offsetting positions as possible to avoid a complete liquidation wipeout , " said Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research .
" Another potential calamity would be a fire sale of Lehman 's distressed assets -- such as commercial real estate .
This would push prices even lower and potentially force other firms to mark down once again the value of their own holdings . "
Lehman Brothers said its filing was to exclude the broker - dealer operations , the company , said , adding that operations of the brokerage arm and its Neuberger Berman asset management division would continue to trade .
The statement said Lehman was " exploring the sale of its broker - dealer operations and , as previously announced , is in advanced discussions with a number of potential purchasers to sell its investment management division . "
Lehman Brothers was the fourth - biggest US investment bank , dating back to 1850 with a staff of some 27,000 people but that counted for naught , after writedowns of 13.8 billion dollars on the US subprime or higher risk home loan crisis .
Under steadily mounting pressure , especially after rival Bear Stearns was bailed out earlier in the year , Lehman Brothers tried to find a savior too but a quarterly loss of 3.9 billion dollars and planned radical asset sales made buyers reluctant to step in without US government backing .
Yet some said that despite the turmoil , Lehman 's failure may serve to purge the financial system of its troubles and set the stage for recovery .
" The darker view is that this will be the catalyst for a chain of failures or bankruptcies throughout the financial system , exacerbating the credit crunch and the recession , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Economy.com .
" A more upbeat perspective sees these events as a catharsis that will make the financial system more resilient .
Bank of America 's acquisition of Merrill Lynch testifies to this more optimistic view . "

John McCain , a proponent of abstinence - only education programs , is at odds with 80 percent of the American public who support comprehensive sex education .
He can sensationalize the issue , but the fact remains that this is an issue of public health and safety .
John McCain recently released an ad attacking Barack
Obama ’s education agenda , including his support for comprehensive sex education .
The announcer says that Obama supports " learning about sex before learning to
read . "
Well , I hope so .
If we are not giving our children age - appropriate
education throughout their lives , we are not doing our best to protect
them .
Earlier this year , the Religious Coalition for
Reproductive Choice put out a request for people to tell us the story of how
they learned about sex .
We received well over 400 responses from individuals
around the country age 17 through 94 .
These replies offer thoughtful reflections
and often intimate , sometimes painful , glimpses into personal lives .
Quite a few
responders said they learned about sex " the hard way " — from being abused as a
child .
If I had known
what sex was , I would have understood what was happening to me when I was
molested by a male relative beginning at age 8 . – Stephanie ,

derided is to learn about inappropriate touching .

Boffins preparing to fire up the most powerful particle - smasher ever built have released another reassuring report which says that their machine will definitely not destroy the universe - nor even the planet Earth .
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , a titanic 27 - kilometre doughnut made of ultra-chilly superconductor magnet pipe , is situated in hollowed - out caverns deep beneath the Franco - Swiss border .
The machine functions essentially as a kind of enormous , outrageously powerful subatomic billiard cue , the idea being that it will smash protons into swarms of other protons at large fractions of the speed of light .
Even though hadrons are much more strongly put together than ordinary billiard balls , banging them together at warp speed will blow them violently to bits .
Quite apart from this being beezer fun in itself , the exploding hadrons should scatter outrageously bizarre sub-subatomic debris in all directions .
It 's planned that teams of top - bracket boffins , operating extremely complicated machines situated as it were at the pockets of the relativistic proton billiard table , will be able to snare - or at least snap a few pics of - the hurtling hadro - chunk weirdness .
It 's particularly hoped that Higgs Bosons , dark matter and other sundry theoretical gubbins - which may or may not be in fact the basic building blocks of life , the universe and everything - will appear or conclusively fail to .
This will permit the whole of physics and perhaps therefore all knowledge to be rendered invalid , and allow many shouty , arm - waving , incomprehensible arguments to take place in front of blackboards .
That 's all good clean fun .
But others worry that in fact the mighty atom - smasher may do damage to other things than applecarts in physics faculties .
Some people worry , for instance , that an overly aggressive hadron rim - shot manoeuvre at the LHC might create a teeny , microscopic black hole .
This might then expand to gobble up the entire Earth , packing the human race down inside its swelling event horizon and possibly cramming us through an interdimensional portal into a hostile universe where life as we know it could n't exist .
( There might not be any hops , for instance ; or low gravity might mean that ice cubes would n't reliably stay in one 's glass . )
The new report from the independent LHC Safety Assessment Group is having none of that , however .
According to the proton - cannon safety boffins :
Any microscopic black holes produced at the LHC are expected to decay by Hawking radiation before they reach the detector walls .
If some microscopic black holes were stable , those produced by cosmic rays would be stopped inside the Earth or other astronomical bodies .
The stability of astronomical bodies constrains strongly the possible rate of accretion by any such microscopic black holes , so that they present no conceivable danger .
The argument is that cosmic rays are always smacking into the upper atmosphere at the same sort of speeds as protons shot from the LHC 's magno - doughnut cannons .
If that kind of thing led to planet - gobbling black holes , the boffins argue , the Earth ought to have vanished already ; and other planets and stars should be winking out of existence all the time as well .
As it has n't , and they are n't , it 's clearly OK to fire the thing up .
Other worries include the possibility that LHC boffins might absent - mindedly convert the Earth - and indeed , if they were n't careful perhaps the entire universe - into " strangelet soup " , monopole custard or some other kind of fearful hypothetical - particulate semolina , Angel Delight , squirty cheez™ etc.
Again , the Safety Assessment Group gives these notions short shrift .
In the case of strangelets , the good agreement of measurements of particle production at RHIC * with simple thermodynamic models constrains severely the production of strangelets in heavy - ion collisions at the LHC , which also present no danger .
According to the official LHC reassurance webpage , " It is difficult for strange matter to stick together in the high temperatures produced by such colliders , rather as ice does not form in hot water " .
Although soup can be made in hot water , it seems that strangelet soup can't , or anyway not this kind of hot water .
It ought to be called strangelet gazpacho , really ; that would avoid confusion .
( Perhaps not , as the LHC is actually kept very cold in order to maintain its superconductor magnets in top shape .
When the boffins say " high temperature " , they seem to be speaking about the immediate vicinity of an exploding proton . )
The LHC chaps say people have also been bugging them about a mysterious catastrophic phenomenon called a " vacuum bubble " - not , apparently , anything as simple as an actual bubble of vacuum - which might be called into existence by meddling subterranean boffinry chiefs .
That 's cobblers too , the safety - assessment team reckon .
There have been speculations that the Universe is not in its most stable configuration , and that perturbations caused by the LHC could tip it into a more stable state , called a vacuum bubble , in which we could not exist ...
Since such vacuum bubbles have not been produced anywhere in the visible Universe , they will not be made by the LHC .
Although presumably you could n't observe a vacuum bubble if it ever happened , as you would cease to exist ?
Or maybe the wavefront of nonexistence would spread out only at light speed , so allowing you millennia to see your doom bearing down ?
It 's all jolly difficult .
Anyway , no need to worry - again , if the LHC was going to flip the universe into a more stable state and incidentally wipe out humanity , cosmic rays would be bound to have done it already .
The Safety Assessment Group concludes that they have checked " all the proposed speculative scenarios for new particles and states of matter that currently raise safety issues " , and the LHC is All Right .
And do n't be coming to them with some new wackjob notion , either :
Since our methodology is based on empirical reasoning based on experimental observations , it would be applicable to other exotic phenomena that might raise concerns in the future .
All in all , we here on the Reg crazy - science desk feel much better following the LHC release .
Its message is basically this :
Be reassured .
Very reassured .
The waiting will be over soon , anyway .
The magno - tunnel doughnut was chilled down to hadron - headbang operating temperatures last month , and will generate its first circulating beam next Wednesday .
Shortly thereafter an opposing stream will be fired up .
Then it 'll be time to start loosing off the twin proton cannons into each others ' muzzles on full auto and watch the chunks of weird - o - frag fly .

Applicative translucent functors in Haskell
ML is known for its sophisticated , higher - order module system , which is formalized in Dreyer - Crary - Harper language .
A few months ago Ken Shan showed a complete translation of that language into System Fw : http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~ccshan/xlate/
Ken Shan has concluded that languages based on Fw , such as Haskell with common extensions , already support higher - order modular programming .
In fact , his paper showed a sample Haskell translation of the most complex and interesting ML module expression : a translucent , applicative functor .
Different instantiations of the functor with respect to type - compatible arguments are type - compatible ; and yet the functor hides the representation details behind the unbreakable abstraction barrier .
Dreyer - Crary - Harper language and System Fw are deliberately syntactically starved , to simplify formal analyses .
Therefore , using the results of Ken 's paper _literally_ may be slightly cumbersome .
This message is an attempt to interpret some of Ken 's results in idiomatic Haskell with the full use of type classes .
We will also show that type sharing constraints can be expressed in a scalable manner , so that the whole translation is practically usable .
Thus we can enjoy the sophisticated , first - class higher - order module system in today 's Haskell .
No new extensions are required ; furthermore , even undecidable instances ( let alone overlapping instances ) are not used .
This message has been inspired by Ken Shan 's paper and has greatly benefited from several conversations with him .
Throughout this message we will be using an example of polymorphic sets parameterized by an element - comparison function .
Our example is an extended version of the example in Ken 's paper .
We will also be using OCaml syntax for module expressions , which , IMHO , makes a little bit more sense .
We abuse the terminology and use the word ' module ' to also mean what ML calls ' structure ' .
This message is both Haskell and OCaml literate code .
It can be loaded in GHCi or Hugs - 98 as it is .
To get the OCaml code , please filter the text of the message with " sed -n -e '/ ^}/ s/^} //p ' " > {-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts #-} > module Functors where
Our goal in this message is to produce implementations of a SET interface : } module type SET = sig } type element } type set } val empty : set } val add : element -> set -> set } val member : element -> set -> bool } end ; ;
This is the OCaml declaration of a type of a collection made of two type declarations and three value declarations .
Such collections are called structures ( or , modules , by abuse of the terminology ) and their types are called signatures .
The concise description of the OCaml module language can be found at http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual004.html
We should point out that the types ' element ' and ' set ' are abstract -- the right - hand side of the corresponding type declarations is empty .
In ML , a single colon adds a type annotation whereas a double colon is a list constructor -- in Haskell , it is just the opposite .
The corresponding SET signature in Haskell is well - known : > class SET element set | set -> element where > empty :: set > add :: element -> set -> set > member :: element -> set ->
Bool
We shall build an implementation of SET parameterized by the element comparison function .
The comparison function 's interface is to be described by its own signature , ORD .
We shall define two different instances of ORD and instantiate the SET functor with those two instances .
To make the game more interesting , our implementation of the ORD interface will itself be parameterized by the ENUM interface , which maps elements in a totally ordered domain into integers .
So , the comparison function will use that mapping to derive the element comparison .
Thus our game plan is : - introduce the ENUM interface , - define two implementations of the ENUM interface , - introduce two different ENUM ->ORD transparent functors , - instantiate the functors yielding four implementations of the ORD interface , - introduce a translucent ORD -> SET applicative functor , - instantiate it obtaining different implementations of SET - run a few tests , to illustrate applicativity of the functor and the abstraction barrier
We start with the ENUM interface : } module type ENUM = sig } type e } val fromEnum : e -> int } end ; ; and its two implementations .
One of them is } module IntEnum : ( ENUM with type e = int ) = struct } type e = int } let fromEnum x = x } end ; ;
We wrote a module expression -- a collection of one type definition and one ( functional ) value definition , and told the compiler its explicit type , ENUM .
The stuff after ' with ' is a type sharing constraint : the type of IntEnum is ENUM such that the type ENUM .e is int .
The explicit type annotation can be dropped : } module CharEnum = struct } type e = char } let fromEnum x = Char.code x } end ; ;
The corresponding code in Haskell is < empty >
Indeed , the standard Enum type class in Haskell serves our purpose .
The class declaration plays the role of the signature declaration , with instances providing the implementation .
It 's all part of the Prelude , so we have nothing to write here .
One may ask -- what if I want several instances that correspond to the same type ?
How to do that in Haskell ?
Please read on .
We use the ENUM module to build element comparison functions -- or modules of the signature : } module type ORD = sig } type el } val compr : el -> el -> bool } end ; ;
The interface includes the type ' el ' and the value of the comparison function .
Our comparison function is actually an equality predicate -- but this is enough for our purposes here .
This message is n't about the efficient implementation of sets .
We promised to build two implementations of ORD , both of which parameterized by ENUM .
The first implementation is : } module Ord_LR ( Elt : ENUM ) : ( ORD with type el = Elt.e ) = struct } type el = Elt.e } let compr x y = ( Elt.fromEnum x ) = ( Elt.fromEnum y ) } end ; ;
The type sharing constraint became more interesting : the result of the Ord_LR functor ( a mapping from modules to modules ) is the module of the signature ORD whose type 'el ' is not explicitly specified and remains abstract .
Yet the type is constrained to be the same as the element type of the argument ENUM module -- whatever that happens to be .
The other functor is : } module Ord_LE ( Elt : ENUM ) = struct } type el = Elt.e } let compr x y = ( ( Elt.fromEnum x ) mod 2 ) = ( ( Elt.fromEnum y ) mod 2 ) } end ; ; Now , our ML code gives two different implementations of ORD , both of which may have the same element type .
How can we do that in Haskell ?
Very simple : by introducing a discriminator label type .
> class ORD label elem where > compr : : label -> elem -> elem ->
Bool
We translate Ord_LR and Ord_LE into the following Haskell code : > -- Labels > data LR = LR > data LE = LE > instance Enum a => ORD LR a where > compr _ a b = fromEnum a == fromEnum b > instance Enum a => ORD LE a where > compr _ a b = even ( fromEnum a ) == even ( fromEnum b)
As before , a class declaration corresponds to an ML signature , and instances correspond to implementations of the signature .
The two Haskell instances above are actually parameterized implementations -- that is , functors -- parameterized by Enum .
The type sharing constraint ENUM.e = ORD.el is expressed by using the same type variable ' a ' in the instance declarations .
We thus observe that an abstract type of ML corresponds to a type variable ( here : uninstantiated type variable ) and the type sharing is expressed by sharing of the type variable names .
Our goal , the ORD -> SET functor , is as follows : } module SETF ( Elt : ORD ) : ( SET with type element = Elt.el ) = struct } type element =
Elt.el } type set = element list } let empty = [ ] } let member element set = List. fold_left } ( fun seed e -> Elt.compr element e || seed ) false set } let add element set = if member element set then set else ( element : : set ) } end ; ; Recall that the signature SET had two abstract types : ' element ' and ' set ' .
The type sharing constraint makes the former to be the same as ORD.el .
The type SET . set remains abstract .
Here 's the complete type that OCaml infers for SETF module SETF : functor ( Elt : ORD ) -> sig type element =
Elt.el and set val empty : set val add : element -> set -> set val member : element -> set -> bool end Although our implementation of the functor used " element list " for the type set , in the result of the functor , ' set ' remains abstract .
The precise implementation of ' set ' is hidden behind the abstraction barrier .
The functor SETF is therefore translucent -- the user can see SET. element ( if he can see ORD.el ) -- but SET . set is hidden .
The functor SETF is also applicative -- if Ord1 == Ord2 , then SETF ( Ord1 ) == SETF ( Ord2 ) .
Applications of an applicative functor to type compatible arguments yield type - compatible results .
Let us illustrate that point first , before considering the Haskell implementation .
} module Set1 = SETF ( Ord_LR( IntEnum ) ) ; ; } module Set2 = SETF ( Ord_LR( IntEnum ) ) ; ;
We create two Sets , by instantiating SETF over ORD , which , in turn , are instantiated over IntEnum .
We have nested functor applications .
Both functors are applicative , so that Set1 and Set2 are type compatible .
That is , we can freely use the methods of Set1 on Set2 , and vice versa : } let s1 = Set1.add 1 Set1.empty ; ; } let s2 = Set2.add 2 s1 ; ; } let r1 = Set1.member 1 s2 ; ; Set ' s1 ' was created by the module Set1 -- and yet we use Set2.add to add more elements to it .
We then have Set1. member check for membership in the resulting set .
Of course if we apply the functor to type - incompatible modules , the results are n't type - compatible either .
Given } module Set3 = SETF ( Ord_LE( IntEnum ) ) ; ; } let s3 = Set3.add 3 Set3.empty ; ;
An attempt to evaluate let r2 = Set1.member 3 s3 ; ; ^^ This expression has type Set3.set = SETF ( Ord_LE( IntEnum ) ) . set but is here used with type Set1.set = SETF ( Ord_LR( IntEnum ) ) . set leads to a type error .
And so does this : } module Set4 = SETF ( Ord_LE( CharEnum ) ) ; ; } let s4 = Set4.add ' a' ( Set4.add 'b ' Set4.empty ) ; ; } let r4 = Set4.member ' c ' s4 ; ; let rw = Set1.add 1 Set4.empty ; ; ^^^^^^^^^ ^
This expression has type Set4.set = SETF ( Ord_LE( CharEnum ) ) . set but is here used with type Set1.set = SETF ( Ord_LR( IntEnum ) ) .set
The error message itself is remarkable .
It says that the type SETF ( Ord_LR ( IntEnum ) ) .
set is different from SETF ( Ord_LE ( IntEnum ) ) . set and from the type SETF ( Ord_LE( CharEnum ) ) .
set .
And yet SETF ( Ord_LR ( IntEnum ) ) . set produced in two different applications of SETF ( Ord_LR ( IntEnum ) ) is the same .
However , ' set ' itself remains abstract .
Indeed , if we attempt to break the barrier and access ' set ' as if it were a list ( which it is , operationally ) , we get a type error : List.length Set1.empty ; ; ^^^^^^^^^ ^
This expression has type Set1.set = SETF ( Ord_LR( IntEnum ) ) . set but is here used with type 'a list How can we implement such an applicative and translucent functor in Haskell ?
As Ken Shan pointed out , we need higher - ranked types , and skolemization .
First , we introduce an auxiliary class , over a higher - ranked type parameter : > class SETE r where > lempty :: r l elem > ladd :: ( ORD l elem ) => elem -> r l elem -> r l elem > lmember : : ( ORD l elem ) => elem -> r l elem ->
Bool
The class describes the signature of a transparent functor : notice the parameterization by ORD .
Now we have to claim that the result of applying SETE to the ORD `module ' is a SET .
In Haskell terms , we have to make the result of `applying ' SETE an instance of the class SET : > newtype SetESet a = SetESet a > instance ( SETE setlabel , ORD ordlabel element ) => > SET element ( SetESet ( setlabel ordlabel element ) ) where > empty = SetESet $ lempty > add e ( SetESet s ) = SetESet $ ladd e s > member e ( SetESet s ) = lmember e s
This is clearly the boilerplate .
One may hope that it could be automated , eventually .
It is worth pointing out the sharing constraint : the fact that ' element ' type of a set is the same as the element type of ORD is expressed here by using the same type variable ' element ' in both places .
So , the type sharing constraint of ML is expressed by sharing a name in Haskell .
Now , we need to make the ' set ' type hidden while at the same type making sure we do not hide the element type : > data SETFE = forall f. SETE f => SETFE ( forall a b. ( SetESet ( f a b ) ) )
As before , an abstract type of ML corresponds to a type variable in Haskell -- only here it is an explicitly quantified type variable .
The existential quantification provides the unbreakable abstraction barrier .
As Ken Shan repeatedly emphasized in his paper , the insight here is skolemization , needed to universally quantify _under_ the existential quantification .
And for that , we need a higher - ranked type .
We have n't yet provided the implementation for the functor SETE : > newtype SLE l e = SLE [ e ] > > instance SETE SLE where > lempty = SLE [ ] > ladd e s@( SLE set ) = if lmember e s then s else SLE $ e:set > lmember e ( SLE set : : SLE l e ) = > not ( null ( filter ( compr ( undefined : : l ) e ) set ) )
And here is the applicative functor itself : > setfe = SETFE ( SetESet ( lempty :: SLE l e ) )
We must emphasize that it is an ordinary Haskell value .
Thus we gained not only a higher - order module system , but also a first - class one .
We only need to introduce a way to appropriately instantiate the functor > inst : : w ( f a b ) -> a -> b -> w ( f a b ) > inst f a b = f and we are ready for examples : > testf = case setfe of > ( SETFE fs ) -> let set1_empty = inst fs LR ( undefined : : Int ) > s1 = add 1 ( add 0 set1_empty ) > rm1 = member 2 s1 Let us make another instantiation of the functor , to the same arguments : LR and Int : > set2_empty = inst fs LR ( undefined : : Int ) > set2_add e s = add e ( s `asTypeOf` set2_empty ) > set1_member e s = member e ( s `asTypeOf` set1_empty ) > s2 = set2_add 3 s1 > r1 = set1 _member 1 s2 we observe applicativity : two instantiations of the functor to type compatible arguments are type compatible : set1_empty and set2_empty are of the same type .
Of course , if we instantiate the functor to type incompatible arguments , the results are not type compatible : > set3_empty = inst fs LE ( undefined : : Int ) > s3 = add 1 ( add 0 set3_empty ) > r3 = member 2 s3 > -- rw1 = set1_member 3 s3 If we uncomment the last line , we get a type error .
The error message is especially revealing in Hugs : ERROR - Type error in application *** Expression : set1_member 3 s3 *** Term : s3 *** Type : SetESet ( _3 LE Int ) ***
Does not match : SetESet ( _3 LR Int )
It is worth comparing with the corresponding OCaml message cited earlier .
Note that the type indicate the particular implementation of the set is abstract : printed as _3 here .
We can't know which implementation of set we 're dealing with .
> set4_empty = inst fs LE 'x ' > s4 = add ' a ' ( add ' b ' set4_empty ) > r4 = member ' c ' s4 > -- rw2 = set1_member ' a ' s4 Again , if we try to break the abstraction barrier , as in the following statement , we just get a type error .
> -- rw3 = null x where ( SetESet x ) = set1_empty > > in ( rm1, r1, r3,r4 )
The example illustrates that Haskell already has a higher - order module language integrated with the core language and with the module checking being a part of the regular typechecking .
The upshot of the translation : ML signatures correspond to Haskell type classes , and their implementations to the instances Abstract types in ML correspond to either uninstantiated or explicitly quantified type variables in Haskell Type sharing is expressed via type variable name sharing Functor ( signatures or structures ) correspond to Haskell ( class declarations or instances ) with type class constraints
The argument of functors is expressed via types , with additional labels when needed for finer differentiation Functor applications are done by instance selection based on types at hand plus the additional labels OCaml signature attribution operation -- casting the module or the result of the functor into a desired signature and hiding the extras -- sometimes involves additional tagging / untagging tricks ( cf. SetESet ) .
This tagging , done via newtype , is syntactic only and has no run-time effect .
Hiding of information ( `sealing ' , in ML - speak ) is done by existential quantification .
To gain applicativity , we quantify over a higher - ranked type variable ( Skolem function proper ) .
Will Californians drive less to reduce global warming ?
Maybe not on our own -- but state officials are ready to nudge us .
The Legislature is on the verge of adopting the nation ’s first law to control planet - warming gases by curbing sprawl .
The bill , sponsored by incoming state Senate leader Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) , is expected to pass the Assembly today and the Senate on Friday .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has not taken a position on the bill , but sponsors expect him to sign it once the state passes a budget .
The legislation , SB 375 , would offer incentives to steer public funds away from sprawled development .
The state spends about $ 20 billion a year on transportation , and under the new law , projects that meet climate goals would get priority .

An earlier version of the bill was blocked last year by the building industry and by organizations representing cities and counties .
Developers feared their suburban projects would be delayed or halted .
Local officials were wary of ceding zoning powers and transportation planning to the state .
But momentum for the legislation has grown as the state seeks to implement its landmark 2006 global warming law , which would slash California ’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 , a 30 % cut from expected emissions .
To accomplish that , state officials say , fuel - efficient cars and factories wo n’t be enough .
Subdivisions , commercial centers and highways must be planned so that Californians can live and work closer together , reducing the amount they drive .
“ Our communities must change the way they grow , ” Steinberg said .
A compromise 17,000 - word bill was hammered out this month and endorsed by builders , environmentalists and local officials .
It requires the state ’s 17 metropolitan planning organizations and its regional transportation plans to meet concrete targets to reduce global - warming emissions .
The targets will be set by the state Air Resources Board .
“ California led the way into our culture of car dependence , so it is only appropriate that the state lead the way out , ” said David Goldberg , a spokesman for Smart Growth America , a Washington - based nonprofit .
The law could “ provide a model for other states , ” he added , noting that the number of miles Americans drive has risen at more than double the rate of population growth in recent decades .

Scientists agree that the earth is heating up at a dangerous pace , in part because of excess carbon dioxide and other gases from vehicles , power plants and other human sources .
The expected effects in California include coastal flooding from rising sea levels , reduced water supply and the disappearance of many species of plants and animals , according to researchers .
The legislation would lead to better - designed communities and save consumers on gas bills , advocates said .
Thomas Adams , board president of the California League of Conservation Voters , called it the most important land - use bill in California since the Coastal Act in the 1970s .
“ It is also the first legislation to link transportation funding with climate policy , ” he said .

The UK has the largest police DNA database in the world Ministers have been accused of building a national DNA database " by stealth " by retaining profiles of nearly 40,000 children never convicted of a crime .
The government says there are 39,095 DNA profiles of 10 - 18 year olds from England and Wales who were arrested but never cautioned or charged .
The Home Office said retaining DNA was a " key intelligence tool " for police fighting serious and violent crime .
The Lib Dems say the DNA of " blameless children " should not be retained .
' Startling figures '
Last month , a government - funded inquiry recommended that DNA profiles of people who had never been convicted of a crime should be removed from the database , which it said should be controlled by an independent body .
But currently samples from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained at a police station in England and Wales - innocent or guilty - can be kept on file indefinitely .
Innocent people who volunteer to give a DNA sample during a police inquiry also have their details kept on record .
People who give samples during arrest , but are later not charged or are cleared , can apply to the chief constable to have them removed in " exceptional circumstances " .
In Scotland , DNA samples taken when people are arrested must be destroyed if the individual is not charged or convicted unless they are accused of a violent or sexual crime .
Junior minister Meg Hillier confirmed on Friday that there were 349,934 DNA profiles of under - 18s on the database - 87.1 % of whom had been either convicted or cautioned , or had received a final warning .
She also acknowledged there were 39,095 DNA profiles of youngsters who were never cautioned or charged .
Chris Huhne , the Lib Dems ' home affairs spokesman , said : " These startling figures show that the government is building a national DNA database by stealth .
This is yet more evidence that the DNA database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
Dominic Grieve
Conservatives " There can be no excuse for storing the DNA of innocent adults , let alone children , who are entirely blameless . "
He said many people with criminal records were not on the database and said the government could not be trusted with its security .
For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said there should be a Parliamentary debate on the issue , and the DNA database should be put on a statutory basis .
" This is yet more evidence that the DNA database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons , " he said .
' Cold cases '
The Home Office argues that the database has revolutionised the way the police protect the public and is a key instrument in the fight against violent crime , burglaries and rape .
It says that in a 12 - month period between 2006 and 2007 , DNA evidence was used in police investigations into 644 rapes , 222 other sexual offences , 1,900 violent crimes and more than 8,500 domestic burglaries .
A Home Office spokeswoman said the government had no plans to introduce a universal database .
She added : " Inclusion on the DNA database does not signify a criminal record and there is no personal cost or material disadvantage to the individual simply by being on it . "
The UK has the largest police DNA database in the world , with more than four million people on file , and it has been used to solve a number of " cold case " inquiries in recent years .

What are these ?
Yesterday I went fishing for wild steelhead on the Deschutes River up in Maupin , Oregon .
It ’s a beautiful spot , and I was sure I ’d return with a whole mess of fishies .
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
The mistake I think I made was choosing to bring a gun instead of a fishing pole .
The gun was a Nighthawk Custom 10 - 8 combat pistol , and while it ’s a great option for the military or police , it ’s a decidedly terrible choice when it comes to recreational fishing .
In hindsight , this probably should have been obvious to me , as all my previous attempts to shoot fish out of the water have been a failure .
Even so , I am stubborn , and I suppose I thought this time might be different .
It was n’t .
I spent hours silently trolling the river looking for the perfect fishing spot , gauging wind and water temperature , attempting to use my fishermen ’s sixth sense to determine where the steelhead might be lurking .
Finally I found the spot , a little eddy on the north side of Mount Thielsen .
There I found a huge school of hungry fish just waiting to be caught .
Well , let me tell you something : as soon as I opened fire on those fuckers , they swam away , never to be seen again .
All that work for nothing .
Fucking fish .
Some experienced fishermen might think my efforts to shoot fish with a handgun are misguided .
Well those fishermen can suck my dick .
Just because something has n’t worked in the past does n’t mean it ca n’t work now .
The Nighthawk is a terrific pistol specifically designed for close quarter combat .
What could be closer combat than fishing ?
In retrospect , I do n’t think the mistake I made was bringing the gun ; it was not bringing enough ammo .
I unloaded all nine clips into the river within about a minute .
This required some very fast shooting on my part !
The law of average states that if I fire enough bullets , eventually one of them is going to hit a fish .
The problem : not enough bullets .
( My fishing pole )
Also , shooting a gun is a lot more fun than sitting in a boat with some string attached to a pole .
I know a lot of guys who have fished in the traditional way all day and came back with exactly as many fish as I did : zero .
The difference ?
I had a blast ( pun intended ) , and they just sat out there “ in nature . ”
If I wanted to hang out in nature , I would do it from the comfort of my living room .
The other advantage of using a gun for fishing is that you do n’t have to dig up worms , which are scary .
Fishermen may tell you that they enjoy hooking their lines with grubs and night crawlers , but I ’m going to let you in on a little secret : worms are really creepy even to fishermen .
They just act like they ’re not because they do n’t want to be called pussies .
But no matter what anybody says , in their heart of hearts , even hardened fishermen know that all bugs are creepy and scary .
They just wo n’t admit it .
So it was a bad day on the Deschutes .
I ran out of bullets and I did n’t shoot any fish , but I did accidentally wing a hiker , which normally would be a terrible tragedy but he went down so fast I do n’t think he had any idea what hit him , and I got the hell out of there before anybody saw what happened , so I think I ’m in the clear .
If you browse with a lot of open tabs , like I do , w3 m will be much easier to use once you remap w3 m - next - buffer and w3m - previous - buffer onto single - key shortcuts , allowing you to press a key to quickly flip between tabs .
By default , w3 m - previous - buffer is mapped to C-c C-p and w3 m - next - buffer is mapped to C-c C-n .
On a QWERTY keyboard , you may want to remap w3 m - previous - buffer to q and w3m - next - buffer to w .
You ’ll probably also want to remap w3 m - close - window ( which had been bound to q ) , and x is a good keybinding for that .
To make all these changes , add the following to your ~/.emacs :
( eval - after - load ' w3 m '( progn ( define - key w3m-mode-map " q " ' w3 m - previous - buffer ) ( define - key w3m - mode -map " w " ' w3m - next - buffer ) ( define - key w3m-mode-map " x " ' w3m- close - window ) ) )
If you use a Dvorak keyboard layout , you can bind . to w3 m - previous - buffer and , to w3 m - next - buffer instead .
Just add the following code to your ~/.emacs :
( eval - after - load ' w3 m '( progn ( define - key w3m- mode - map " . " ' w3 m - previous - buffer ) ( define - key w3m-mode-map " , " ' w3m - next - buffer ) ) )
( This is part of the draft for my book on Emacs , to be published by No Starch Press if I ’m not too late . )

I am currently reading another Erlang book , and I am one again impressed by the elegance of the language .
Just to be clear , I do n't have any intention to actually implement what I am talking about here , this is merely a way to organize my thoughts .
And to avoid nitpickers , yes , I know of Retlang .
Processes
Erlang 's processes are granular and light weight .
There is no real equivalent for OS threads or processes or even to .
Net 's AppDomains .
A quick , back of the envelope , design for this in .
Net would lead to the following interface :
public class ErlangProcess { public ErlangProcess ( ICommand cmd ) ; public static ProcessHandle Current { get ; } public MailBox MailBox { get ; } public IDictionary Dictionary { get ; } public Action Execution { get ; set ; } public Func< Message > ExecutionFilter { get ; set ; } }
A couple of interesting aspects of the design , we always start a process with a command .
But we allow waiting using a delegate + filter .
This is quite intentional , the reason is the spawn ( )
API call , which looks like this :
public ProcessHandle Spawn < TCommand >( ) ;
We do not allow to pass an instance , only the type .
The reason for that is that passing instances between processes opens up a chance for threading bugs .
For that matter , we do n't give you back a reference to the process either , just a handle to it .
Messages
Message passing is an important concept for Erlang , and something that I consider to be more and more essential to the way I think about software .
Sending a message is trivial , all you need to do is call :
public void Send( ProcessHandle process , object msg ) ;
Receiving a message is a lot more complex , because you may have multiple receivers or conditional receivers .
C# 's lack of pattern match syntax is really annoying in this regard ( Boo has that , though :-) ) .
But I was able to come up with the following API :
public void Recieve < TMsg >( Action < TMsg > process ) ; public void Recieve < TMsg >( Expression < Func< TMsg , bool >> condition , Action < TMsg > process ) ;
A simple example of using this API would be :
public class PMap : ICommand { List < object > results = new List< object >( ) ; public void Execute ( ) { this .
Receive ( delegate ( MapMessage msg ) { foreach ( var item in msg .
Items ) { Spawn < ActionExec >( ) .
Send ( new ActionExecMessage ( Self ( ) , msg. Action , item ) ) ; this .
Recieve ( delegate ( ProcessedItemMessage itemMsg ) { results .
Add(itemMsg.Item ) ; if ( results .
Count == msg.Items.Length ) msg.
Parent .
Send ( new ResultsMessage ( results .
ToArray ( ) ) ) ; } ) ; } } ) ; } }
This demonstrate a couple of important ideas .
Chief among them is how we actually communicate between processes .
Another interesting issue is the actual execution of this .
Note that we have no threading involved , we are just registering to be notified at some date .
When we have no more receivers registered , the process dies .
Execution environment
The processes should executed by something .
In this case , I think we can define a very simple set of rules for the scheduler :
A process is in runnable state if it is has a message to process .
A process is in stopped state if there are no messages matching the current receivers list .
A process with no receivers is done , and will be killed .
A process may only run on a single thread at any given point .
It is allowed to move processes between threads ( no thread affinity ) .
Processes have no priorities , but there is a preference for LIFO scheduling .
A process unit of work is the processing of a single message ( not sure about that , though ) .
Since the only thing that can wake a process is a message , the responsibility for moving a process from stopped to runnable is at the hands of the process MailBox implementation .
Okay , that is enough for now .

There are many reasons to be concerned about your tree removal company .
For example , they may not have a license , and the company may also not be insured in case of an accident .
However , you may also want to be sure that the person taking care of your tree is bonded .
A bonded tree professional has all the necessary credentials to make sure the tree is treated properly .
Some other signs that a tree service professional is bonded include having a full time security guard and a policy of liability insurance .
For example , one of the most important things to look for when deciding on a tree removal company is whether the company has a history of liability lawsuits .
Because of this , it is important to only do business with companies that have a track record of not being sued .
One way of doing this is to check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if the company has a complaint against them .
A tree removal company that does n’t have liability insurance is not an asset .
The insurance will help cover the expenses of any lawsuits if a tree is damaged because of their negligence .
Another sign of a good tree removal company is to check out their rate sheet .
This will give you an idea of what you should expect from your tree removal company .
However , make sure to only do business with one company , or you could find yourself paying too much for the services you get .
If you are planning to get rid of your tree yourself , another sign that a tree removal company is good for you is if they are insured .
Although this may cost you extra , it will cost you less in the long run .
The location of the tree removal company is also important .
Make sure that the business is located in a safe place , away from the home or the school .
It is best to do business with a company that has a strong reputation , as well as a location that is close to where you live .
An additional sign that a tree removal company is reputable is if they are insured .
If a tree has been injured or killed due to a tree removal company , the homeowner may be able to sue for a large sum of money .
Therefore , the insurance protects the owner of the property , as well as the owner of the tree .
Before you hire a tree removal company , make sure that they have insurance .
Some companies may not , but there are a few that do .
If the tree removal company you are considering is not insured , then you will not be covered in the event of a tree damage .
Make sure that the tree removal service knows that your home is protected by a tree owner ’s insurance policy .
This helps them to be more careful with the tree removal job .
Some companies have policies to pay up to a million dollars in the event of a tree injury .
Also , some companies offer discounts for tree owners who are first time homeowners .
Ask your local tree removal company about these programs to see how well they work .
As you can see , there are many signs that a tree removal company is good for you .
Even if you have a large tree removal job , a tree service that is bonded and insured can still do a great job for you .
Who needs dialogue when you 've got guns ?
If a picture says a thousand words , then a well - placed bullet in the head tells a whole goddamn story - gentlemen , these 50 awesome movie gunfights are your new holy scriptures .
Stacked end to end , these cinematic shootouts contain enough corpses to choke a river , enough lead to sink Superman and enough blood to paint the world red - who cares about glamorising violence when it looks and sounds this awesome ?
Just remember , kids - guns do n't kill people , movie stars with guns kill people .

Furthermore , Armstrong may saddle up in the deal with Hein Verbruggen - the former president and now vice - president of cycling 's world body , the Union Cycliste Internationale .
Some say it may be an Armstrong - UCI deal .
It sounds far fetched … especially to those who might ask what Armstrong would get out of owning the Tour .
Others may ask why he would race the Tour if a deal was in place .
And what about the boilover of emotion from the French if their most famous sporting event was not only owned by an American , but by one they never really embraced even though he won it a record seven times ?
Then again , there was a time when no one thought man would land on the moon .
An Armstrong did that …
So let 's think out of the square here .
Let 's just say the whispers of an ASO buyout are true .
Were Armstrong to own ASO , it would give him a huge European - based sporting arm through which he could promote the Lance Armstrong Foundation and expand exposure for his own personal sponsors .
It is worth noting that ASO , whose revenue in 2006 was € 150 million ( $ 263 m ) , does not just own the Tour .
It also owns nine other races - including the Tour Qatar and Tour du Faso in Africa - the Dakar car rally , Paris marathon and half - marathon , the French Golf Open and the R.I.D.E international equestrian event in Normandy .
The return of Armstrong to racing after a four - year hiatus - let alone if he won - would also reinforce the Armstrong branding that he virtually had on the Tour during his reign as champion , and would cement it as its future figurehead .
And if such a deal pains the French , should not the blame be pointed at ASO 's owners for giving up a national icon ?
If it sounds absurd , there have been a number significant events that hint at such an outcome .
American ownership of ASO would strengthen the bridge between it and the US - based Anschutz Entertainment Group which organises , among other events , the Tour of California .
Furthermore , the event already supports two cancer charities and has been listed by Armstrong as one of the races he will compete in next year .
A relationship already exists between ASO and AEG , too .
Last year , they settled on a marketing partnership deal .
The prospect of an Armstrong - UCI coalition involving UCI vice - president Verbruggen also carries weight .
The Dutchman appears available .
He stood down as an International Olympic Committee member on August 24 .
The UCI also announced during the Olympics that it had met with the Amaury Group to settle a long - standing dispute with the tour organisers over the official sanctioning of races .
But did they discuss more ?
Nothing was said by the UCI then about a possible ASO takeover .
Nor has it been since .
But , interestingly , no tour executives were present at those talks , or at the UCI press conference in Beijing .
Recent whispers also hint that several ASO executives may soon be leaving .
Such a scenario would leave Australia , South Africa and other countries in the southern hemisphere as the next frontier for the Armstrong - UCI ticket .
The gain for the UCI is its association with Armstrong , while for Armstrong , it would allow him to take his fight against cancer worldwide .
Which is , after all , the reason he says he is getting back on the bike .

Last week I was at the wedding of an old co-worker .
There was a big cast there , all past employees ( physical and occupational therapists ) from the amputee section of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
Included in the mix was a former patient I recognized immediately , though I did not remember his injuries .
That I remembered his face , but not the fact that he was missing both arms and a leg at the groin , caught me totally off guard .
Finding myself surprised by the extent of this young man ’s injuries — injuries that were routine for so many years — well , a light flickered in my brain .
And suddenly , I was back there in our old clinic , surrounded by young men on treatment tables .
In my mind , their faces blurred softly and their injuries faded into the ever - present background of yellow hospital gowns , wheelchairs , and parallel bars .
At Walter Reed , where most of our patients were combat - injured active duty soldiers and marines — young men in their 20s with crew cuts — the therapists had gotten into the habit of identifying our patients by their injuries when discussing our caseload .
Rob from Arkansas was a double AK ( missing both legs above the knee ) with orange running shoes .
Charlie was a triple ( missing three limbs ) with a nonregulation beard that needed to come off STAT .
Chris was an AK / BK ( above knee and below knee amputee ) who comes to PT in the morning and was really particular about time management ( i.e. , demanded to be seen at 0645 ( 6:45 a.m. ) even though we did n’t start patient care until 0700 .
Our patients did the same thing to each other .
Referring to a soldier as a “ hip ” if he happened to missing a leg at the groin .
Or jokingly , “ paper cut ” if a soldier was “ only ” missing one leg below the knee — all in spite of the fact that losing a limb is never a minor injury .
After several years in the amputee section , it was not unusual for my colleagues and me to request a favorite type of injury when we were asked to pick up a new patient .
Darcy loved the challenge of working with double AK ’s ( missing legs above the knee ) .
A devastating injury , but Darcy really had a flair for it .
She scoffed off any compliments by saying it was only because they “ could n’t cheat ” the way someone with a less severe amputation on the other side might .

Editor 's note : Penn Jillette -- the larger , louder half of Penn & Teller -- is a magician , comedian , actor , author and producer .
Obama and McCain both promise a government that will watch over us ... " I do n't like that , " says Penn Jillette .
( CNN ) -- Everyone I talk to seems to think the president of the United States right now is stupid .
The Bush presidency is stupid speeches , stupid high gas prices , stupid bad economy , stupid war on terrorism , stupid war on drugs , stupid hurricane fixing , stupid global warming , stupid war -- stupid , stupid , stupid .
They all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the White House fast , and Bush is so stupid , that task should n't be too hard .
Not me .
I 'd like to say that I believe every president in United States history , including the stupid one we have now , is smarter than me .
My alma mater is Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth Clown College , so I 'm damning with faint praise , but I 'm stupider than this here stupid president .
Maybe I 'm less stupider than Bush than I 'm stupider than Jefferson .
But I 'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together .
The idea , especially from the Democrats that I know , is , we just get a smarter guy in the White House , and all the problems will go away .
We 'll have smart speeches , smart high gas prices , smart bad economy , smart war on terrorism , smart war on drugs , smart hurricanes , smart global warming , smart war in Georgia -- smart , smart , smart .
Barack Obama is way smarter than Bush -- so way , way smarter than me .
Obama is way more charismatic than me .
He did his big speech for about 80,000 people ; I 'll do my show tonight in Vegas for about 1,000 people .
He 's more ambitious than I ; he 's going to be the next president of the United States , and I could n't even get to week three of " Dancing with the Stars . "
Obama is a great leader .
He can fire people up and get them to do what he wants .
He does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be .
But I do n't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing .
I 'm worried about someone smarter than Bush taking over that tremendous power .
Charisma and ambition increase my fear exponentially , and a great leader scares me to death .
We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore should n't try .
The only reason John McCain scares me a little less is because I think he 's a little less likely to win .
They both promise a government that will watch over us , and I do n't like that .
I do n't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me .
I may be stupid , but I want a chance to try to be a grown - up and take care of my family .
Freedom means the freedom to be stupid , and that 's what I want .
I do n't want anyone to feel my pain or tell me to ask what we can do for our country , or give us all money and take care of us .
Gene Healy at the Cato Institute explains that the Founding Fathers wanted the president " to faithfully execute the laws , defend the country from attack and check Congress with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds . "
That sounds like plenty to me .
You gotta be smarter than me to do all that , but you do n't have to be as smart as Obama , and you sure do n't have to be a great leader .
Our first seven presidents averaged a bit more than three public speeches a year , and they did n't promise jobs for everyone , day care , dental exams and free stuff .
It 's really hard to find someone who trusts Americans to take care of themselves and each other without government force .
It 's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what George Washington humbly called the " chief magistrate . "
I think Ron Paul and Bob Barr mean it when they say they want much smaller government .
But the government is already big enough , powerful enough and bipartisan enough ( and " bi " means exactly two and no more ) that Ron and / or Bob wo n't even be in the debates .
People wo n't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves .
The choice should n't be which lesser of two evils should have the enormous power of our modern presidents .
The question should be , who would do less as president ?
Who would leave us alone ?
If we could find a lazier , less charismatic , stupider person than me to be president , I 'd be all for it .
But , it 's not going to be easy ; stupider than me is rare breed .
So remember , the only way to waste your vote is to vote !

TUTORIAL
Creating an Image Map using CSS only
Introduction
An image map is a way of defining multiple clickable link areas ( hotspots ) within one image .
These ' hotspots ' can then used for navigation or to display information about the image they cover .
With this article I hope to show how you can turn an ordinary Definition List like this into an Image Map like this using nothing more than CSS , and what is more , it should work in all modern browser including Internet Explorer 5.5 .
I will work through the styling a step at a time , fully explaining the reason for each style and showing the results of each step , so that you can see what to expect thus allowing you to follow the principles more easily .
Method
The following steps will describe how to add images to the definition list and style the text so that it only shows when specific areas of the main image are selected .
Step 1
My example Definition List starts out as a list of Beatles names ( they come from my era so it seems a suitable choice ) , their instruments and a piece of trivia information .
The ( x ) html is written as follows .
< dl > < dt> The Beatles </ dt > < dd> Paul McCartney - Bass Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br />
Paul McCartney 's song , Yesterday , recently voted the most popular song of the century by a BBC poll , was initially composed without lyrics .
Paul used the working title ' scrambled eggs ' before coming up with the final words .
</ dd > < dd> Ringo Starr - Drums < br /> < br />
Dear Prudence was written by John and Paul about Mia Farrow 's sister , Prudence , when she would n't come out and play with Mia and the Beatles at a religious retreat in India .
</ dd > < dd> John Lennon - Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br />
In 1962 , The Beatles won the Mersyside Newspaper 's biggest band in Liverpool contest principally because they called in posing as different people and voted for themselves numerous times .
</ dd > < dd> George Harrison - Lead Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br /> The Beatles ' last public concert was held in San Francisco 's Candlestick Park on August 29 , 1966 .
</ dd > </dl >
Because there are four Beatles I will need to define four ' hotspots ' but you can have as many as you like , the principle is the same .
In order that we can style this list we need to add information that will enable us to target specific elements .
< dl id =" imap " > < dt > < a id =" title " href= " #nogo " title =
" The Beatles " > The Beatles </ a > </ dt > < dd id =" picp " > < a id =" paul " title= " Paul McCartney " href= " #nogo " > < span > Paul McCartney - Bass Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br />
Paul McCartney 's song , Yesterday , recently voted the most popular song of the century by a BBC poll , was initially composed without lyrics .
Paul used the working title ' scrambled eggs ' before coming up with the final words .
</ span> </ a> </dd > < dd id =" picr " > < a id =" ringo " title= " Ringo Starr " href= " #nogo " > < span > Ringo Starr - Drums < br /> < br />
Dear Prudence was written by John and Paul about Mia Farrow 's sister , Prudence , when she would n't come out and play with Mia and the Beatles at a religious retreat in India .
</ span> </ a> </dd > < dd id =" picj " > < a id =" john " title= " John Lennon " href= " #nogo " > < span > John Lennon - Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br />
In 1962 , The Beatles won the Mersyside Newspaper 's biggest band in Liverpool contest principally because they called in posing as different people and voted for themselves numerous times .
</ span> </ a> </dd > < dd id =" picg " > < a id =" george " title= " George Harrison " href= " #nogo " > < span > George Harrison - Lead Guitar and Vocals < br /> < br /> The Beatles ' last public concert was held in San Francisco 's Candlestick Park on August 29 , 1966 .
</ span > </ a> </dd > </dl >
I have added the following style information to the ( x ) html .
id= " imap " - to the dl tag so that we can define it 's size to hold the main image .
< a id =" title " href= " #nogo " title =
" The Beatles " > ... </a> - Because Internet Explorer will only accept the : hover pseudo class on links , we need to surround the dt text with this link and give it an id =" title " .
I have used href= " #nogo " instead of the usual href= " # " so that anyone clicking the link will not jump to the top of the page ( just make sure you do not have an anchor # nogo on your page ) .
The title = " The Beatles " has been added so that it will appear when the mouse is hovered over the main image .
Each dd has been given a unique id so that we can style each one .
Each dd text has been surrounded by a link for the same reason as ( 2 ) above .
These links have a unique id so that they can be individually targeted and a title as ( 2 ) above .
Each dd text has also been enclosed in a span so that we can manipulate the text separately from the link .
Step 2
Now that we have the definition list in a suitable format , I will take you through the various stages of styling
This additional style information will change the definition list so that it looks like a list of links : -
Firstly and most importantly , make sure that you have the correct ( X) HTML !DOCTYPE .
Without this most browsers will be thrown into ' quirks ' mode which will lead to all sorts of incompatibility problems .
W3C QA - List of valid DTDs has a list of valid DOCTYPES that can be used .
Select from XHTML1.0 or XHTML1.1 as these are more suitable for this styling .
I use XHTML1.1 for all my current web pages .
Step 3
The images
You will need to find or make a suitable main graphic for the Image Map .
I have chosen a photograph of the Beatles that was available from the public domain .
This image is 400 px wide and 240 px high .
Step 4
The < body > is first to be styled with the font - family for the whole page .
I have chosen Tahoma as the first choice but you can select any font you wish .
< dl id =" imap " > is next .
This needs to be styled as a block with width and height values the same size as your main image .
Your main image is then placed as a background image with no -repeat ( so that we only get one ) and finally a we give this a relative position so that we can place the four < dd >s using absolute positioning .
/* set up the font to be used for the page */ body { font - family : tahoma ; arial , sans - serif ; } /* set the size of the definition list < dl > and add the background image */ #imap { display : block ; width :400 px ; height :240px ; background:url (../images/beatles_basic.jpg ) no-repeat ; position : relative ; }
The results can be seen here :-
You should see the main image with the text overlayed .
Step 5
Setting up the main image hover
Now that we have the main image in place we can set up the image that will indicate the active link areas .
This image will be displayed when we hover over the main image .
In my example we will need four ' hotspots ' and I have added these to the main image as shown below using an opaque area 85 px square with a white border .
For the sake of simplicity I have defined all the ' hotspots ' as the same size .
These could also have been rectangles of varying sizes .
It does not matter if the areas intersect each other as this will be taken care of in the styling .
Because the main image is held as a background image in the < dl > tag we need to place the hover image as a background image in the next tag available which will accept the pseudo class : hover style .
This will be the link < a id =" title " href= " # nogo " title =
" The Beatles " >
So we style this link as below :
/* set up the definition list < dt > < a > to hold the background image for the hover state */ #imap a#title { display : block ; width : 400 px ; height:0 ; padding - top:240 px ; overflow : hidden ; position : absolute ; left:0 ; top:0 ; background : transparent url (../images/beatles_hover.jpg ) no -repeat 400 px 400 px ; cursor : default ; } /* the hack for IE pre IE6 */ * html #imap a#title { height : 240 px ; he\ight:0 ; }
Again we style this as a block with the same size as the hover image , but this time we use a height of 0px , a top padding of 240 px and overflow hidden to move the text associated with the link out of sight .
The hover image is set up as the background image and is also moved out of sight by giving it a position larger than the image size .
The background color is transparent because we need the main image to show through .
I have also added a hack for Internet Explorer pre IE6 which corrects the box model bug .
With this style added there is no noticeable change to the page but to view this click on the link below :
Step 5
The actual main image : hover
Now that we have the main image for the hover state in place it is a simple matter to style this to show when the mouse is placed over the image .
/* the < dt > < a > hover style to move the background image to position 0 0 */ #imap a#title : hover { background - position : 0 0 ; z - index : 10 ; }
This moves the background image back into view at position 0 0 .
The z - index is added to ensure that the four ' hotspots ' are always positioned above the hover background image ( they will have a z - index of 20 ) .
You will see from the above example that we now have a change of image when hovered and also the title ' The Beatles ' is also displayed next to the mouse .
Step 6
Placing the ' hotspots '
The position of each ' hotspot ' is next to be styled .
This requires the use of a paint package ( or a little trial and error ) the paint package method being easier .
What we need to know is the x/y positions of the top left corners of each ' hotspot ' .
This information is then used to style the four < dd >s as follows ;
/* place the < dd>s in the correct absolute position */ #imap dd { position : absolute ; padding : 0 ; margin: 0 ; } #imap # picp { left :36 px ; top:46 px ; z - index : 20 ; } #imap # picr { left : 113 px ; top:76 px ; z - index : 20 ; } #imap # picj { left : 192 px ; top:50 px ; z - index : 20 ; } #imap # picg { left : 262 px ; top:60 px ; z - index : 20 ; }
We set up the position absolute in a common #imap dd style , then style each unique dd with a top and left position and a z - index of 20 to make sure that they are situated on top of the background image (s ) .
Step 7
Styling the links
The next step is to style the links that have been placed in each < dd > .
/* style the < dd > < a > links physical size and the background image for the hover */ #imap a#paul , #imap a#ringo , #imap a#john , #imap a#george { display : block ; width : 85 px ; height :85 px ; background : transparent url (../images/hover.gif ) - 100 px - 100 px no-repeat ; text - decoration : none ; z - index : 20 ; }
Because all my ' hotspots ' are the same size , I can group the style together .
If you have ' hotspots ' of varying sizes then you will need to style each one separately .
Each link is styled as a block 85 px square with a background image that will be used when hovering over the ' hotspot ' .
Normally this image will not be displayed .
The z - index is set at 20 to ensure that the links are always on top of the background image (s ) .
My link hover image is just a transparent gif with a white border , but you can use whatever you like .
The above image shows the hover image over a blue background .
There is no noticeable change in the appearance of the page because we have not yet defined the : hover style for each link
Step 8
Removing the span text
All the previous examples show the definition list text above the images .
However , this text should only be displayed when we hover over a ' hotspot ' .
We will style the < span > text as below to hide it from view .
/* style the span text so that it is not initially displayed */ #imap a span , #imap a : visited span { display : none ; }
Now things are starting to take shape :
Step 9
Adding style to the ' hotspot ' : hover
This is a simple matter of moving the link background image into view when we hover over each ' hotspot ' and is achieved as below :
/* move the link background image to position 0 0 when hovered */ #imap a#paul : hover , #imap a#ringo : hover , #imap a#john : hover , #imap a#george : hover { background - position : 0 0 ; }
As with the background hover , this is done by repositioning the background image at 0 0 .
Now when you hover the mouse over each ' hotspot ' two things happen .
You lose the background hover image and it reverts back to its normal unhovered image .
The link hover image surrounds the selected ' hotspot ' giving a dynamic change to the ' hotspot ' .
Step 10
Displaying the span text
We now need to make the selected ' hotspot ' text visible .
/* define the common styling for the span text */ #imap a : hover span { position : absolute ; width : 388 px ; display : block ; font - family : arial ; font - size : 12 px ; background : # fff ; color : #000 ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; padding : 5 px ; } /* the hack for IE pre IE6 */ * html #imap a : hover span { width :400 px ; w\idth : 388 px ; }
In my example I have decided that the text should appear in a bordered block , the same width as our main image , with a white background .
You can of course style this as you like .
I have again added the hack for Internet Explorer pre IE6 .
The first thing you will notice about the above example is that the text box is positioned with it 's top left corner in the same positon as the top left corner of the ' hotspot ' selected .
Step 11
Repositioning the span text
Because I want the text block to appear in the same position below the main image I need to recalculate the top left position of each span relative to the top left position of each ' hotspot ' .
Doing this produces the following unique styling for each span text .
/* move the span text to a common position at the bottom of the image map */ #imap a#paul : hover span { left : - 36 px ; top:200 px ; } #imap a#ringo : hover span { left :- 113 px ; top:170 px ; } #imap a#john : hover span { left :- 193 px ; top:196 px ; } #imap a#george : hover span { left :- 263 px ; top:186 px ; }
The above example should show that each text block now appears below the main image with the top left corner of each block having the same position .
The blocks can vary in height as we have not fixed this value .
Step 12
A final bit of text styling
It is possible to further style the span text and I have chosen to do this using the following style .
You can obviously style this as you wish .
/* add the style for the link span text - first line */ #imap a span : first - line { font - weight : bold ; font - style:italic ; }
With this final piece of styling , which will display the first line of our text in bold italics , we end up with our completed Image Map .
Conclusion
This tutorial shows just one of the ways in which Image Maps may be styled using just CSS .
As long as you stick to the basic principles you can restyle this in literally hundreds of different ways .
It is all down to you imagination and ingenuity , and of course your ability to use your favorite ' paint ' software .
Tourists walk on the city wall that rings the historic town of Dubrovnik , Croatia Aug. 10 , 2005 .
While the number of Americans visiting places like Croatia is still relatively small - 154,000 in 2006 compared to more than 2 million to Italy - growth is strong , up from 115,289 Americans who visited in 2005 and more than 200,000 expected in 2007 , according to the Croatian National Tourist Office .
AAA 's bookings to Croatia increased an astounding 440 percent this year over last .

Sending a message through the Internet involves a significant amount of computation in several different layers of protocols .
This computation is performed in support of communication .
It has recently been discovered that this computation can be harnessed in what is called " parasitic computing "  that is , one computer ( the parasite ) extracting computation from another computer ( the host ) .
( Also see " Parasitic Computing " by Albert - Laszls Barabasi , Vincent W. Freeh , Hawoong Jeong , and Jay B. Brockman , Nature , August 30 , 2001 and http://www.nd.edu/~parasite/.)
Of course , there 's nothing new about networked computers concurrently solving complex tasks .
The most famous and largest example of such distributed computing is the [ email protected ] project , where nearly 3 million owners of Internet - connected computers voluntarily execute the SETI program for the project ( http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/).
Instead of sitting idle , a [ email protected ] computer executes the SETI program , which crunches data from radio signals coming from the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico .
Individually , the computers are unimpressive  but collectively , they make up the world 's most powerful distributed supercomputer .
In [ email protected ] , each node of the supercomputer must run a program to participate .
In the case of parasitic computing , however , a node only needs to be connected to the Internet to be a potential participant .
In this article , I describe how one parasitic computer  the TCP / IP checksum computer ( TICC )  is constructed .
It uses a specially constructed TCP segment in such a way that when the receiver computes the checksum , it unwittingly performs a computation for a remote node .
Using the TCP checksum , a parasite is able to ask the following question :
Is a+b equal to c ? ( hereafter written as a +b c ) .
This operation performs addition followed by a comparison .
Given this add - and - compare operation , you can ( through a sequence of one or more of these operations ) solve any computational problem .
Ordinarily , the sender - side TCP stack builds the TCP header , including the checksum .
However , TICC bypasses the TCP stack , injecting the message at the IP layer , in a variation on IP spoofing .
( For more on IP spoofing , see http://www.fc.net/phrack/files/p48/p48-14.html and http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1996-21.html.)
TCP is a transport protocol , whereas the target on the receiver is an application  an end point of communication .
Thus , TICC cannot simply target TCP .
Instead it uses HTTP because it is built on TCP , it replies to invalid requests , and there are numerous web servers  TICC begins with an IP packet that masquerades as a TCP segment destined for port 80 ( default for HTTP ) .
The next step is to evaluate the add - and - compare operator .
When the answer is True for ( a+b=c ) , the checksum test performed by the TCP stack on the receiver side succeeds and the segment is passed up to HTTP .
Even though the message is not a valid HTTP request , the web server responds ( as required by HTTP ) , usually with error number 501 ( unsupported operation ) .
On the other hand , when the answer is False ( a+b c ) , the checksum test fails .
In this case , the segment is not passed up to HTTP .
This is observed by lack of response ( that is , the answer is declared false after some timeout ) .
Implementation
Listing
One outlines an implementation of TICC in Linux .
There are three steps in the TICC .
First , it must setup the connection , then create a segment , and finally , determine the answer .
( Actually , I 'll discuss an optimization that eliminates connection setup shortly . )
TCP is a connection - oriented protocol and a connection must be established before any communication can take place .
Connection setup consists of three messages :
First , the initiator node sends a SYN message , which is a request to create a connection .
Next , the destination of the aforementioned message replies with a SYN - ACK ( if it wishes to communicate ) .
Last , the initiator sends another ACK message .
At this point , the connection is established and a conversation can begin .
TICC initially sets up two sockets ( see initCommo ( ) in Listing One ) .
One socket is standard TCP , using the SOCK_STREAM protocol .
This socket creates a connection between the parasite and the host .
The second is a raw socket using the SOCK_RAW protocol that reads / writes raw IP packets .
In this context , " raw " means the headers are visible .
In Linux , a raw socket sees all IP packets , including those sent to TCP .
( This is not necessarily portable to other flavors of UNIX . )
A raw socket can only be created by privileged users .
The raw socket has two purposes :
It snoops the TCP connection messages for critical data , and it injects the add - and - compare operation at the IP layer and looks for the response .
There is a sequence number for each communication direction .
The sequence number is essentially the location in the bytestream .
In each TCP segment , senders insert the sequence number of the first byte in the message being sent .
It also inserts the sequence number of the last byte received from the computer on the other end of the socket .
The latter is called the " acknowledgment number . "
The sequence numbers provide an ordering of the segments , which is necessary because IP is unreliable and can deliver out of order ( see TCP / IP Illustrated , by W. Richard Stevens , Addison - Wesley , 1994 ; and TCP / IP Protocol Suite , by Behrouz A. Forouzan , McGraw - Hill , 2000 ) .
TCP selects a unique initial sequence number ( ISN ) for each conversation .
The ISN of a connection is essentially random  the more random , the harder the guess .
Because TICC employs the standard TCP stack to establish the connection , it must capture the ISNs , one for each direction .
Figure 1 shows the three messages sent in the connection setup : S and D stand for " source " and " destination , " respectively .
An acknowledgment number is the sequence number of the last byte successfully received .
TICC reads the raw socket during the initial TCP connection setup to acquire the ISNs .
The getIPpacket ( ) procedure extracts the ISNs .
Because the raw socket reads every IP packet , the code checks that this is the appropriate packet .
If it is n't , the code skips this packet and gets the next one .
When the correct packet arrives , the code copies the acknowledgment and sequence number from the packet .
The parasite node begins the conversation ( first message following connection setup ) with an add - and - compare operation , which is a specially constructed TCP segment .
A TCP segment consists of an IP header , TCP header , and data ; see Figure 2 .
TICC constructs the entire TCP segment in a user - level buffer before sending it ( done in transmit_TCP ( ) , although omitted from Listing One ) .
The SOCK_RAW protocol always sets some critical fields in the IP header , such as IP checksum and total length .
It can optionally set the other fields .
If not set by the protocol stack , TICC must set these fields in a user - level buffer before writing it to the socket .
In any case , certain fields in the IP header must be set appropriately .
In particular , the protocol field must be set to TCP ( protocol number 6 ) .
Because TICC bypasses the sender - side TCP stack , it must construct the entire TCP header , which is sent as cargo in the IP packet .
The sequence number is the index of the first byte of the message , which is computed by adding the number of bytes already sent to the source 's ISN .
The acknowledgment number is the index of the last byte received , using the sequence number for the other direction .
The TCP checksum is part of the TCP header .
It is the last field computed because it sums the TCP header and cargo .
The " correct " TCP checksum , which is computed by the sender , is determined by putting 0 into the checksum field in the header .
The message is padded to a 2 - byte boundary .
Then , using unsigned , 1s - complement arithmetic , the message is summed on 2 - byte boundaries .
Overflow bits are discarded .
This sum is bit - wise complemented ( all 0s changed to 1s and 1s to 0s ) .
The complemented sum is inserted into the TCP header .
The receiver performs nearly identical steps , except that after the summation , instead of complementing , it examines sum .
If no errors have occurred , the receiver 's sum should be all 1s .
This is because the fields not including the checksum add up to S , the checksum is , S+ equals all 1s .
In the add - and - compare operation , the checksum is determined a bit differently .
Instead of computing the sum over the header and the cargo , it is computed over the header and the answer , c in a +b c .
The add - and - compare is not limited to two add - ends ( as in a +b c ) .
The general form of the operator is a i c , which is limited by the size of a TCP segment .
This limit has a default of approximately 250 2 - byte words , but depends on the connection .
However , because overflow bits are discarded , the practical limit is only a handful of add -ends .
Improvements
Detecting a true answer is trivial  any response to the add - and - compare means the segment passed the TCP checksum .
However , because you cannot distinguish between a lost message and a delayed one , false answers are not 100 percent reliable .
Unreliability causes two undesirable consequences .
First , a false positive occurs when a bit error changes an invalid result into a valid result .
This is statistically rare and all but impossible in practice .
Second , a false negative occurs when a packet for a valid solution is dropped due to data corruption or congestion .
Although this is also unusual , it is frequent enough that it must be addressed .
There are two ways to handle false negatives .
Suppose you can ask a question , Q , and its complement , not Q. Because only one of the questions can be true , one response is expected .
If there is no response ( or two responses ) , then the questions should be asked again .
Although this way creates a reliable system , not all questions that can be asked with add - and - compare have a complement .
Therefore , a more general approach is to verify negative results by asking the question more than once .
This decreases the probability of false negatives .
For example , if p is the probability of a false negative , then pn is the probability of n false negatives .
Because p < < 1 , the likelihood of a false negative all but disappears for small values of n .
This implementation sends only one add - and - compare operation per TCP connection .
You can try to perform more than one add - and - compare per connection , which will reduce the overhead significantly .
If the previous question was true , then TICC received a reply from the destination .
Sending another add - and - compare operation will be a normal continuation of the conversation .
You need only increment the sequence and acknowledgment numbers appropriately and send the next add - and - compare .
However , if the answer to the previous question was false , the conversation cannot be started " following " the previous message because it did not actually take place .
If you use the same sequence and acknowledgment numbers as the previous add - and - compare , there are now two outstanding operations .
A response from the destination could be answering either of the outstanding operations .
If all outstanding operations have a different length ( which can be accomplished by padding with 0s ) , you can use the acknowledgment number in the reply to identify the operation being answered .
Of course , this approach requires that no false positives have occurred on this connection .
Much of the overhead in TICC is due to TCP connection management .
In the straightforward approach , the parasite node sends four messages and receives one or two .
However , many TCP stacks respond to spurious FIN messages .
Thus , TICC can first determine if a targeted TCP stack responds to such FIN messages .
Then it can avoid connection setup .
This reduces the overhead to one message sent and zero or one received .
Because the FIN improvement does not require an actual connection to be established , it is not limited to targeting HTTP servers .
Thus , any computer running TCP is a potential host for parasitic computing .
Furthermore , with FIN , many add - and - compare messages can be concurrently sent to the same host , with each using a different port number .
Conclusion
TICC is a proof - of - concept implementation and , at this time , not very efficient .
The cost of an add - and - compare is at best the cost of sending a message .
The benefit is some addition and a compare .
Thus , the overhead of TICC is several hundred times greater than the benefit .
Because TICC does not offload any work , it is not a threat to be used in that way .
Additionally , TICC is too computation intensive to be an effective denial of service attack .
Furthermore , it is not likely that a different , smarter implementation can extract more work from the host using TCP checksum because the checksum function is too simple .
However , many believe that there could be some cost - effective exploit in one of the many Internet protocols .
Even though this implementation is not a threat , parasite computing raises important issues .
This project has generated much interest regarding ethical and legal issues .
While this is an important and timely discussion , there are some interesting technical issues as well .
One is in detection , where we have developed rules that catch checksum parasites .
Another is a catalog or taxonomy of exploits of public protocols .
Finally , we are investigating other techniques for parasitic computing in order to access viability and threat .
The result of this research will be a greater understanding of the fundamental elements of Internet communications , which will lead to a more robust and capable Internet .

Bye Bye Big Brother Share
This :
I wo n't deal with the first half of the book , which gives psychological , political and social commentary / guidance on how to free yourself from Big Brother and his attendant bureaucracy .
Reducing the guidance to one sentence : Leave the U.S. .
I find myself in increasing agreement with that strategy but I have significant disagreement with some of the other messages within the book 's first half ...
On the other hand , you might find yourself in full agreement .
And , so , on to the practical ... Grandpa 's advice for today :
The reason : " In the USA , there is a section in the federal code , referred to as ' 1001 ' by legal eagles , that makes it a crime to lie to a federal agent . "
[ The actual code is " Title 18 , US Code , Section 1001 " cited as " 18 USC 1001 . " ]
" The agent does n't have to put you under oath or even have to tape the converation .
All he or she has to do is produce handwritten notes that indicate that you have made false statements . "
Moreover you do n't have to lie to be convicted ; the agent can misquote or mishear what you say .
If the lie or mistake is in his / her notes , then you are guilty of an entirely different crime from the one that may have prompted the questioning ; you are guilty of violating 1001 .
Grandpa goes on to give the ( in ) famous example of Martha Stewart who was questioned by government agents who suspected her of inside trading .
She was never convicted of that crime .
Her conviction and imprisonment was for violating 1001 -- for lying to government agents about a crime for which they proved unwilling to prosecute her .
The moral : it is not only the police with whom you should never willingly co-operate .
Do not co-operate with any agent of the State without an attorney present .
Moreover , for those occasions when a government agent knocks on your door ( so to speak ) , Grandpa thinks you should carry the following letter , with two extra copies :
Due to rule 1001 , I do n't feel I can answer any oral questions at all unless I clear all your questions with a criminal lawyer .
Please submit all your questions in writing , and I will get back to you .
Please sign this letter below as a receipt for your copy of this document and as evidence that I gave you no information whatsoever in this or any other interview .

Chapter 21 is entitled " If The Law Comes Knocking : What To Do ( And What Not To Do ) If You Are Ever Questioned By Government Agents . "
I 've discussed the perils and imprudence of co-operating with the police without the presence of an attorney but Grandpa 's advice extends beyond dealing with cops .
" Never , under any circumstances , answer questions put to you by any government agent -- unless you have a competent criminal lawyer at your side ... "
This advice holds true whether you are innocent or guilty of a " crime . "
( I place the word ' crime ' in quotes because the vast majority of currently illegal activities would not be criminal in a just system dedicated to individual rights -- that is , a system that protected person and property . )

On Friday , I received a fascinating book from the rebel press Vera Verba entitled " Bye Bye Big Brother " ( abridged edition ) for my review .
Since then I 've been absorbing the oversized , thick work .
Having received permission from the publisher -- the author is anonymously referred to as " Grandpa and Others " -- in the coming days I 'll be quoting brief passages from the book and commenting on some of the practical advice being offered .
And , yes , this is an endorsement of the book 's value to anyone who values their personal liberty .
I wo n't deal with the first half of the book , which gives psychological , political and social commentary / guidance on how to free yourself from Big Brother and his attendant bureaucracy .
Reducing the guidance to one sentence : Leave the U.S. .
I find myself in increasing agreement with that strategy but I have significant disagreement with some of the other messages within the book 's first half ...
On the other hand , you might find yourself in full agreement .
And , so , on to the practical ... Grandpa 's advice for today :
Economists on the Bailout
The only thing that seems to be moving faster than the financial crisis is the policy debate .
The latest development is a statement that summarizes what I think of as the emerging consensus from academic economists ; it expresses concern about various aspects of both the Paulson plan in particular , and the policy process in general .
Here ’s the letter , which was — just minutes ago — sent to Congress :
As economists , we want to express to Congress our great concern for the plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson to deal with the financial crisis .
We are well aware of the difficulty of the current financial situation and we agree with the need for bold action to ensure that the financial system continues to function .
We see three fatal pitfalls in the currently proposed plan : 1 ) Its fairness .
The plan is a subsidy to investors at taxpayers ’ expense .
Investors who took risks to earn profits must also bear the losses .
Not every business failure carries “ systemic risk . ”
The government can ensure a well - functioning financial industry , able to make new loans to creditworthy borrowers , without bailing out particular investors and institutions whose choices proved unwise .
2 ) Its ambiguity .
Neither the mission of the new agency nor its oversight are clear .
If taxpayers are to buy illiquid and opaque assets from troubled sellers , the terms , occasions , and methods of such purchases must be crystal clear ahead of time and carefully monitored afterwards .
3 ) Its long - term effects .
If the plan is enacted , its effects will be with us for a generation .
For all their recent troubles , America ’s dynamic and innovative private - capital markets have brought the nation unparalleled prosperity .
Fundamentally weakening those markets in order to calm short - run disruptions is desperately short - sighted .
For these reasons , we ask Congress not to rush , to hold appropriate hearings , to carefully consider the right course of action , and to wisely determine the future of the financial industry and the U.S. economy for years to come .
Why do I call this the consensus view ?
Well , the letter was signed by over 100 ( and growing ! ) of the leading economists I know — including folks who have very different views about just what got us here — who vote left , right , overseas , or not at all .
The core group includes folks you ’ve already seen on this blog , including Anil Kashyap and Luigi Zingales , as well as the always - wise John Cochrane , Rob Shimer , and Paola Sapienza .
The full list of signatories is available here ; it is an astonishing group .
And if you would like to add your name to the list , touch base with Sapienza , who has done a splendid job in coordinating this effort in a short number of hours .
About six months ago , I expressed some concern that the economics profession was staying on the sidelines during what was then an emerging crisis .
Today , I ’m proud to say that macroeconomists are working hard to have their voices heard in this hour of need .
These are — by any measure — extraordinary times , and while we do n’t always agree with each other , it is an amazing time to be a macroeconomist .
By now you have hopefully read our drag - down , kick out the jams review of the hardware and software of Rock Band 2 , and have made your decision about whether or not you want to buy the latest rhythm game entry from Harmonix .
We stand firmly by our original recommendation : this game is amazing and belongs in the library of anyone who has even thought of playing a game with plastic instruments .
That being said , if you want to dig in and really make your personal Rock Band set - up personal and special , we have some more tips for you .
We also have some cool tricks and codes to bring you up to speed on how to get the most out of your game .
Let 's get started by giving you all the songs ...
Get every song in quick play mode , right now
Unlocking the tracks in quick play mode is not as easy as it was in the original game , and can take more work than you may be willing to put into it if you want to play the entire library of tracks the first day you take the game home and get the band back together .
No worries , the unlock - all code is the same as Rock Band , and it allows you to use a selectable modifier to unlock all the songs at any time .
The code is Red , Yellow , Blue , Red , Red , Blue , Blue , Red , Yellow , Blue .
Now get to rocking !
Keep in mind if you turn on this modifier you can't save your scores , earn achievements , or play on Xbox Live .
Get rid of the groaners , make your parties a happier affair
There are some songs that almost no one likes to play , and when an entire band groans at the sight of one of them , it can really put the brakes on a good night of Rock Band 2 .
There 's not much you can do about the new tracks , and you can , of course , pick what songs you download , so hopefully you like all of those , but you can limit the songs you do n't like from Rock Band 1 .
Here 's how .
When you pay your $ 5 to move the Rock Band 1 songs to your hard drive from the disc , they are basically treated as downloadable content .
Just delete the ones you do n't want from your Rock Band 1 save file in your hard drive before putting in your Rock Band 2 disc , and you 'll never have to deal with " Green Grass and High Tides " again .
Bliss .
If you decide you miss the songs , simply re-export from your Rock Band 1 disc to bring it back .
The ultimate drum experience will cost you $ 385 ... yes , you can use the Omega pedal on the Drum Rocker
The ION Drum Rocker may be $ 300 , but it 's one of the most amazing gaming peripherals ever released .
It 's worth your money , but some people may find the pedal a little loud and not quite as satisfying as the Omega Pedal we lavished praise on when we hooked it up to our drum set on Rock Band 1 .
No worries .
That pedal works fine with your Drum Rockers using a 1/8 " to 1/4 " adapter and plugging the Omega into the " pedal " port .
Different people like different things with their pedals , but personally we prefer the Omega by a long shot , and it 's great to have the option .
Your mileage my vary , but in our testing , the Drum Rocker with an Omega Pedal is the ultimate way to drum with Rock Band 1 and 2 .
You can buy the soundtrack in iTunes , but you 'll miss out on a few tracks
Someone has gone to the trouble of creating the Rock Band 2 set list on iTunes , and you can buy the entire thing for $ 76.23 .
You can find that iMix on iTunes , but there are some tracks that Apple does n't have available yet , including the new track by Guns n' Roses and " Let There be Rock " by AC / DC .
Other than the six tracks iTunes is mixing , this is a good way to get that Rock Band 2 feeling when you can't turn the actual game on , or to learn songs so you can become a better singer .
You may be able to buy a musical file with your tracks in the future
The music store on Rock Band 2 is already well - stocked , but when will we be able to buy actual music off the service ?
I posed this question to Dan Teasdale , Rock Band 2's senior designer .
Will it ever be possible to get an .mp3 or some other digital file with our song on it when we buy a track for the game ?
" We 've definitely talked about it , " he told me , stressing how difficult it would be .
" It 's a huge pile of stuff we have to go through .
We already have to sort out label rights , band rights , master rights , and this is another thing on top of that ... but I 'd love to see it happen in the future . "
Expect a big surprise in the coming weeks
I asked Teasdale what his dream track would be for Rock Band , and a big smile crossed his face .
" I can't tell you ... because it 's coming up soon as downloadable content .
Ask me this question in a month , and I 'll be able to tell you . "
I pressed him for details , or a more specific timeline .
" Something big is coming , very soon . "
So there you go .
I hope we 've given you some things you did n't know about , some things that will help you get the most out of your game , and some things to look forward to .
Rock Band 2 is an amazing game , and we 're still discovering tips and tricks the more time we put into it .
Also , take one forum member 's advice and layer a few stickers on top of a simple orange circle .
The result is magic .

Clearly Beyonce is the Favorite Child ( Photos )
It has always been apparent thatmust be the favorite child in the Knowles household and not just because she is the big star .
We have pictures to prove it !
Whether Beyonce is on the red carpet or walking down the street she always looks on top of her game .
Now , as for her 22 year old sister Solange Knowles , who has just released a new album " Sol - Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams " it seems as though she is lacking in good judgment in the wardrobe department .
The girls ' mother Tina Knowles is the fashion designer for her brand " House of Dereon . "
So this begs the question : Does Tina dislike Solange ?
Or maybe the young singer has her own fashion sense and wants a completely different style than her extremely successful sister .
We have photos of Beyonce and Solange below , without overdoing it we just wanted to give you a taste of what we are talking about .

Labrador survives being hit by express train ' after his wounds are healed instantly by heat from engine '
Homer the labrador is one lucky dog after he survived horrific injuries when he was hit by an express train .
The fortunate mutt disappeared while out for a walk with his owner Ray Davis , near his home in Westbury , Wiltshire .
He was found three days later near a railway line with gaping wounds across his middle .
Lucky labrador : Homer shows off his injuries
Ray , 62 , thinks his dog survived the accident because his wound was seared shut by the intense heat from the 125 mph train .
He told the BBC : ' He had collapsed in a heap in the field .
' He had a horrific wound on his side but it did n't appear as if it had been bleeding .
Relief : Ray Davis says his pet dog may have survived after heat from the train sealed his wounds before he could bleed to death
' We 've worked it out - he seems to have been hit by the wheel of a train , which would be hot and it sealed the injury . '
After an emergency operation , Homer was stitched up and is now recovering back at home .
Filed under the " good thing we tried it out first " department is this recent test of Shuttle - replacement Orion 's parachute re-entry system .
Based on the same system used for Apollo , the group of eight parachutes deploys after re-entry , ensuring the Orion capsule glides down back to terra firma for a pillow - soft landing .
That 's what 's supposed to happen , anyway .
Here , the initial chutes that position the craft for the main chutes ' test ( so , not a part of the final system ) failed shortly after being dropped from a C - 17 cargo plane at 25,000 feet .
As you can see , it all goes downhill from there , terminating in " a landing that severely damaged the test mock - up . "
Well said , NASA - I 'm guessing any test dummies inside for pressure measurements had to be scraped off the desert floor with a knife .

PHP ( Hypertext Preprocessor ) is moving into the enterprise at a rapid pace , the CEO of Zend Technologies stressed Tuesday during a keynote presentation at the 2008 Zend / PHP Conference ( ZendCon ) in Santa Clara , Calif .
Citing a list of enterprise users of the server - side scripting platform , including Kargo Mobile Technology and Shaklee , Zend CEO Harold Goldberg emphasized PHP growth .
PHP has “ grown up to be a mainstay enterprise language , ” he said .
PHP is “ poised for widespread enterprise adoption , ” said Goldberg , whose company specializes in PHP tools .
“ The community , the market , the partners , the ecosystems have never been better , ” he said .
Goldberg offered brief PHP user profiles .
Kargo , for example , had been using Java but found it could not expand without adding a lot of hardware .
The company decided to redo its entire Web site using Zend Framework and now handles 400 percent more capacity , Goldberg said .
Job growth in the enterprise also is on the horizon .
In the next five years , 40 percent of PHP jobs will be in the corporate environment , said Goldberg .
During the next five to ten years , most business applications will move to a browser , presenting opportunities for PHP , he said .
“ What we ’re seeing is more and more people , they ’re [ making ] the choice of PHP , ” said Goldberg .

This seems relevant to the current debate :
“ On the morning of October 30 , 1929 , President Herbert Hoover awoke the day after the biggest one - day stock market crash in American history , surveyed the state of the U.S. economy and declared , “ The fundamental business of the country , that is production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis , ” said Reid , quoting Hoover .
Not sure how close the events of the last few days relate to the Great Depression , especially since the markets seem to have bounced back a little today and I doubt that with all the protections in place it will get to that , but then again , Greenspan , the guy probably most responsible for this mess , is saying this is a once a century event .
Regardless , I think this speech today by Obama was pretty damned solid :
You know , there are a lot of things about which I simply do not agree with Obama .
But hot damn , it sure is nice listening to someone speak in full sentences , using complete and often complex thoughts and weaving those thoughts into broad and overarching themes .
Compared to the stammering and stuttering gibberish from Bush the past eight years , and the staccato , machine - gun like bursts of incoherent aggression from McCain , and Obama is like a cool breeze on a hot summer day .
At any rate , this was just a great speech , and the guy just exudes comepetence .
At about 5:15 in , Obama describes exactly why a ton of people like me are going to vote for a Democrat for President for the first time ( transcript here ) :
If you want to understand the difference between how Senator McCain and I would govern as President , you can start by taking a look at how we ’ve responded to this crisis .
Because Senator McCain ’s approach was the same as the Bush Administration ’s : support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely ; do nothing as the crisis hits ; and then scramble as the whole thing collapses .
My approach has been to try to prevent this turmoil .
If that does not describe the last eight years in a nutshell , from the fateful August 6th memo on , I do not know what does .
Obama ’s indictment is scathing , particularly in relationship to the current mess :
In February of 2006 , I introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud , risk or abuse .
A year later , before the crisis hit , I warned Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke about the risks of mounting foreclosures and urged them to bring together all the stakeholders to find solutions to the subprime mortgage meltdown .
Senator McCain did nothing .
Last September , I stood up at NASDAQ and said it ’s time to realize that we are in this together – that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street – and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets .
Months later , Senator McCain told a newspaper that he ’d love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis , “ but ” – he said – “ I do n’t know one . ”
In January , I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy , which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress .
Senator McCain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so - called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut , including $ 4 billion for the big oil companies , but no immediate help for workers .
This March , in the wake of the Bear Stearns bailout , I called for a new , 21st century regulatory framework to restore accountability , transparency , and trust in our financial markets .
Just a few weeks earlier , Senator McCain made it clear where he stands : “ I ’m always for less regulation , ” he said , and referred to himself as “ fundamentally a deregulator . ”
This is what happens when you confuse the free market with a free license to let special interests take whatever they can get , however they can get it .
This is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while Wall Street is booming , and declare – as Senator McCain did earlier this year – that we ’ve made great progress economically under George Bush .
That is how you can reach the conclusion – as late as yesterday – that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
Sorry for such a long post , but I wanted to make sure this got some attention .
" A Nation of Nudists " : Austrian Culture & SexUALITY
Think of Austria and you think of elderly men with red cheeks in lederhosen , of cafes full of posh Viennese and maybe - but only maybe - a historical figure like Mozart or one of our dead emperors .
Not the sort of image that you would associate with sex , is it ?
Well , if you think twice , you might realise that Sigmund Freud was Austrian ( at least until he was kicked out of the country through Nazi prosecution ) , and nobody would seriously consider Freud to be non-sexual , despite of Mr Psychoanalysis′ soft spot for lederhosen .
So it can′t be all sober and dry in Austria after all .
" You are a nation of nudists " is a statement by an English friend of mine , whose grandparents were Austrian .
We are .
There is absolutely no doubt that we are :
All over the country there is a vibrant sauna culture , often with no gender segregation ; most spas and many lakeside lidos have " FKK " ( " Freikörperkultur " - a somewhat strange term meaning " free body culture " ) zones for nude swimming ; and naked bodies are displayed in advertisements without a trace of modesty .
For most of my life , this wouldn′t have occurred strange to me - until I moved to the US .
International visitors are often …well , surprised to see how open people in Austria handle issues like nudity or sex .
Think of John Irving′s novels - whenever they are set in Vienna , you can bet that there is a prostitute featuring at some point .
Legal Status of Prostitution in Austria
Prostitution is in principle not criminalized in Austria ( with the exception of the strange Alemannic province of Vorarlberg in the very West ) , but tightly regulated .
In most provinces , women have to be at least 19 years old and registered in order to work legally as prostitutes .
The registration requires frequent health checks .
Street prostitution is not legal , but occurs in all major cities .
If a village is big enough to support a church and a pub , you should also expect a brothel .
Most brothels are easy to recognise : Red lanterns indicate the business of the house and red hearts in the windows should attract clients .
Austria′s biggest red - light district is the Gürtel road in Vienna , where nightclubs and brothels fill a boulevard over the course of several blocks .
Since Vienna is a very inclusive place , the borders of this " district " are blurred and not as sharply drawn as in places like Hamburg or Amsterdam .
The oldest brothel of Austria is probably the one in the " Herrengasse " ( appropriately meaning " gentleman′s lane " ) in Salzburg , founded in 1547 .
Prostitutes also feature in prominent positions in Austrian literature :
Think of the " Rhapsody " ( some editions are translated as " Dream Story " ; it was the base for Stanley Kubrick 's last movie " Eyes Wide Shut " ) or " Hands Around " by Arthur Schnitzler , who is famous for erotic references in his works .
One novel in which the main character is a prostitute is " The Story of a Vienna Whore " by the journalist and writer Felix Salten , who thereby proved high adaptability in terms of target groups - as he also wrote " Bambi " .
Sex as a Key Ingredient to the Austrian Personality
Bambi made it to become a popular Disney movie , whereas the story of the young prostitute Josefine Mutzenbacher is still classified as child pornography and banned in several countries .
Such examples show the high degree of promiscuity that seems to have been widely spread in the " fin de siecle " Vienna .
Even Emperor Franz Joseph I , all the sober Catholic workaholic , conservatively engaged in fighting democratic ideas , was a notorious cheater .
His wife Empress Elisabeth encouraged him to take mistresses , especially his long - term lover Katharina Schratt .
An even more open testimony of these days are the diaries of Alma Mahler - Werfel , legendary for her appeal and " impact " on several of Vienna′s leading artists and intellectuals .
Even the involuntary inventor of sado - masochism was Austrian : The Count Leopold of Sacher - Masoch was a historian who had a pretty bizarre affair with a Baroness Bogdanoff ( whose real name was the much more peasanty Fanny Pistor ) .
He loved to submit himself to the baroness ′ cruel mood swings and played slave to her .
In 1870 , he published his not - quite - fiction novel " Venus im Pelze " ( " Venus in fur " ) , in which a dominant woman named " Wanda " is the main character .
In 1873 , Sacher - Masoch married a woman who changed her name into Wanda and got involved in a menage en trois with his wife and another fake noble lady , this time a fake countess .
Since the scandalous lifestyle quickly spread in gossip - loving Austria , the Sacher - Masoch was soon to be the nation′s most famous slave .
When the early psychoanalyst Richard von Krafft - Ebing published his opus magnum " Psychopathia Sexualis " in Vienna in 1886 , he popularised the term " masochism " in honour (? ) of the count .
Be prepared for Nudity ...
Keeping all this in mind , you should not be too surprised to see sex shops , night clubs and brothels openly advertising their services in the public almost anywhere in Austria .
Sometimes you will see pornographic magazines wrapped in black plastic foil - but this is done for branding purposes ( it′s the way people in the US do it , so it must be cool … ) , and not because of a legal requirement to hide them .
I don′t think Austrians are more promiscuous than people elsewhere - but there is definitely a culture of handling sexuality and nudity more openly than anywhere outside of Western Europe .

September 17 has been designated as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day in the United States to commemorate the signing of the U.S. Constitution in Philadelphia on September 17 , 1787 .
In honor of Constitution day , I want to share with you my concerns about recent abuses to the First Amendment to the Constitution .
First let me pay my respects to the US founding fathers for securing for me the freedom of speech to be able to share my opinions with you .
When the founding fathers penned the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1789 , they sought to create in this country a “ marketplace of ideas . ”
This concept , later articulated by Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , provides that only through the exchange of all ideas , not just those of the majority , can some ideas be determined to be unworkable and other ideas be proven of value .
Without “ the marketplace of ideas ” there is a real danger of tyranny of the majority , meaning that only the ideas of the majority will be deemed true or untrue .
Without the First Amendment ’s protection , how could the Civil Rights movement or Women ’s suffrage have succeeded ?
The ideas fueling these movements were not held by the majority at the time .
Their success was dependent on the fact that all ideas need to be heard and considered .
The year before the First Amendment was passed , George Washington acknowledged his wish that America would have many outlets for free speech , “ For my part I entertain a high idea of the utility of periodical publications ; insomuch as I could heartily desire , copies of … magazines , as well as common Gazettes , might be spread through every city , town , and village in the United States . ”
BACKGROUND : A quick review of the history of newspapers reveals that our first president ’s wishes were realized at least for a time .
By 1856 , there were 2,526 newspapers in America , and by 1880 Americans had 11,314 different newspapers ( www.historicpages.com ) .
That translates into 11,314 potential venues to raise ideas in the marketplace of public discourse .
To facilitate an unfettered marketplace of ideas within communities across the country , the founding fathers insisted , “ Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or of the press . ”
The founding fathers wisely predicted that in order for democracy to flourish , the press must reveal to potential voters both the good and bad actions of their elected officials .
Prior to the First Amendment , it was illegal to criticize the government even if the criticism was true .
The First Amendment gave the press awesome power , which earned them the unofficial designation of the “ Fourth Estate ” by some and “ watchdog ” by others .
However , with this awesome power comes immense responsibility .
Within the framework of the marketplace of ideas , the American press is charged with printing the truth .
And while it ’s easy to print what someone says is true , printing what is actually true is an often exigent responsibility .
When newspapers do their jobs well , it makes our communities and country stronger .
Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein uncovered the covert activities surrounding Watergate , and the result was the resignation of President Nixon .
PROBLEMS : However , in their frenzy to be first with the news , media have frequently sacrificed credibility for ratings and readers .
Richard Jewel , who was incorrectly accused of the Centennial Park bombing , comes to mind , as does the more recent , erroneous reporting of the coal miners ’ survival in West Virginia earlier this year .
On a more individual level , for most of us , everything we know about a public figure or national or international event was told to us by the media .
In a sense the media help shape our reality .
Underlying this reality is a basic agreement between the reporter and the reader .
The reporter agrees to present a fair and accurate account of the news , and the reader agrees to believe it .
In short we are dependent upon newspapers and other media , so that we may be informed consumers and make educated decisions .
There have always been obstacles to reporting the truth and preserving the marketplace of ideas , but the challenges are becoming increasingly insurmountable .
Newspapers and other media have become big , BIG business .
Newspapers have been gobbled up by chains , which through years of mergers and acquisitions have resulted in the concentration of media ownership into five global , multi-media conglomerates .
Pulitzer prize winning journalist Ben H. Bagdikian wrote in his book “ New Media Monopoly , “ These five huge corporations — Time Warner , Disney , Murdoch ’s News Corporation , Bertelsmann of Germany , and Viacom ( formerly CBS ) — own most of the newspapers , magazines , books , radio and TV stations , and movie studios of the United States . ”
Thus the potential venues for the marketplace of ideas have been severely restricted .
This is not what the founding fathers had in mind .
The First Amendment was not written for big business , it was written for purveyors of truth .
“ What is at stake , ” according to Bagdikian , “ is American democracy itself .
A country without all the significant news , points of view , and information its citizens need to be informed voters is risking the loss of democratic rights . ” ( www.benbagdikian.com )
The effects of the concentration of media ownership while subtle are tangible .
The journalism textbook I use in my classes defines news as a change in the day ’s events that is important and / or interesting to a significant percentage of the readers .
On the other hand , media mogul Ted Turner , who launched 24 - hours news into America ’s living rooms , once defined news as “ $ ” .
He drew a dollar sign and said if any news company says differently , they ’re lying .
The point Turner was making is that big media have big bills , and they are operated less by purveyors of truth than by businessmen .
In Mediated politics : Communication in the future of democracy media critics Delli Carpini and Bruce Williams described the new media managers as , “ . . . a new generation of media operatives who hold little allegiance to prior codes of journalistic ethics . ”
Furthermore , according to Bonnie Anderson , veteran reporter and later executive manager for NBC and CNN , “ Major news outlets are no longer content with news divisions generating reasonable profits .
They are demanding profits some call obscene . ”
“ If it bleeds , it leads , ” has been the mantra for media , often more interested in the bottom line then conveying an accurate account of the day ’s events .
Hungry for ratings and readers , much of today ’s major media are also blurring the line between news and entertainment .
When “ infotainment ” precludes important news , democracy suffers .
When newspapers and broadcast media are chasing celebrities , what significant news stories are not being reported ?
In her recent book , Newsflash : Journalism , Infotainment , and the Bottom - Line Business of Broadcast News , Anderson said she believes the United States is at a very critical juncture — that irresponsible journalism has become a threat to democracy .
Media consumers are partially to blame for the state of the media .
With ratings for Jerry Springer and Reality TV in the stratosphere , Americans have all but demanded sensationalism over substance .
Nevertheless , media professionals must take the ethical high road , and resist lowering their standards to attract consumers .
Lowering standards has proven unsuccessful in boosting ratings , and it has exacerbated credibility problems .
Media outlets must be required to uphold the responsibility entrusted to them by the founding fathers .
Media must return to their charge of being purveyors of truth .
Fortunately , it is not too late to clean up the media mess .
In his Media Monopoly ( 5th edition ) , Bagdikian proposed a series of solutions to America ’s media problems .
They include the following :
* The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 needs to be replaced by a new law that can begin to break up the most egregious conglomerates , reinstate mandatory local community access , and put teeth in the requirement that stations demonstrate their record of public interest programming .
* Public broadcasting must be financed through a new , nonpolitical system , as is done for the best systems in other democracies .
Today , non-commercial broadcasting depends on appropriations by federal and state legislatures that themselves are heavily beholden to corporate interests .
* The Federal Communications Commission needs to be reconstituted to include specified representatives from nonpartisan groups like the Parent Teachers Association , as well as presidential appointees .
* The country needs easy , inexpensive licensing of low - power , city - and neighborhood - range radio and TV stations .
Japan has them and so can the United States .
* Teach serious media literacy in the schools , using independently created curricula .
Individuals can also participate in organizations devoted to improving the media .
The following is a list of media watch groups with a brief description as supplied by the organization :
FAIR , the national media watch group , has been offering well - documented criticism of media bias and censorship since 1986 .
We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest , minority and dissenting viewpoints .

The Center for Creative Voices in Media is a nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization dedicated to preserving in America ’s media the original , independent , and diverse creative voices that enrich our nation ’s culture and safeguard its democracy .
When independent , creative voices are locked out of that marketplace by media conglomerate “ gatekeepers , ” not only are the artists harmed , so is the public .
As a nation , America is poorer for a homogenized media concentrated in the hands of a few corporate behemoths that too willingly sacrifice creativity before the altar of maximum profits .

Free Press is a national nonpartisan organization working to increase informed public participation in crucial media policy debates , and to generate policies that will produce a more competitive and public interest - oriented media system with a strong nonprofit and noncommercial sector .

If democracy in this country is to continue to be “ Of the People , By the People , For the People ” , America needs the Fourth Estate back .
This country depends on the media for governmental checks and balances .
For too long , the media have been preoccupied with their own checks and account balances .
Citizens must demand the return of purveyors of truth .
Democracy depends on it .
The Muslim - peddling about Democratic nominee Barack Obama continues , mostly through lies trafficked over the Internet , but also in questions raised in polite company by well - known and influential members of the political establishment .
Here 's what Dennis Baxley , a former state legislator from Ocala and the executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida , one of the most prominent groups on the religious right , said during an interview with the Miami Herald about Obama 's outreach to the Christian community :
" He 's pretty scary to us , '' he said .
" I think his Muslim roots and training -- while they try to minimize it -- it 's there . "
Asked what he meant , Baxley pointed to Obama 's childhood stint in Indonesia and his Muslim relatives .
( Obama mostly grew up in Hawaii but lived in Indonesia , a predominantly Muslim country , between the ages of six to 10 .
He was raised by his mother and her parents , all from Kansas .
Obama says his Kenyan father , who left when he was two and returned for one visit before his death , was " raised a Muslim ' ' but became a " confirmed atheist . " )
" That concerns me particularly in the period of history we are living in , when there 's an active movement by radical Muslims to occupy us , '' Baxley said of Obama 's background .
" That whole way of life is all about submission .
It concerns me that someone rooted in those beginnings , how it might have affected their outlook .
That 's what scary for me . "

Israeli Settlers Prevent Christian Service in Beit Sahour , Assault Worshippers
As Zionism feels its support and influence fading , its supporters are growing increasingly desperate and violent .

Settlers trying to force worshippers out ( Photo : Rami Rishmawi-IMEMC )
August 7 , 2008
Over two hundred Israeli settlers ( Zionist Extremists ) assaulted Palestinian and International worshippers who were holding a prayer service at Ush Ghrab park in Beit Sahour Wednesday evening .
As the mass started the settlers , who organized an activity in the same site , started to provoke the worshippers and asked them to leave , eyewitnesses reported .
Settlers also threatened some of the local and international journalists who were present .
The Israeli soldiers who were there asked the internationals and the Palestinians to leave the park and did not attempt to stop the settlers when they started to force everyone to leave , the witnesses said .
The city council of Beit Sahour is planning to build a children hospital in the site in cooperation with intentional organization CURE .
However , the Israeli army imposed a military order on the designated area and the settlers started to frequently plan activities on the site and claimed that the land belongs to them and that they want to built a settlement on this land .
( A settlement is illegal .
What really upsets these Extremists is that the hospital will be used to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians , and the Zionists do n't want this . )
The worshippers raised their prayers for the sake of the children of Bethlehem in order to have the planned hospital built .
The settlers , who come from the neighboring illegal settlements of Har Homa and Efrat and others in the Bethlehem area , erased murals that some Palestinian and international activists had made a week ago and wrote some racist graffiti , calling for the death of Arabs .
Ush Ghrab was occupied by the Israeli army in 1967 and was used as a military base .
In 2006 the army abandoned the site and the city council in Beit Sahour rehabilitated the site and turned part of it into a public park , and had a plan to build a hospital on the rest of it , in addition to some other facilities that would server the local community in Bethlehem .

Officials say they are questioning nearly 80 people suspected of involvement in the latest scandal .
On Monday , the police arrested two brothers who ran a milk collection center in Hebei Province suspected of adding melamine to diluted milk , according to the official news agency Xinhua .
Adding the chemical makes the material test at higher concentrations of protein .
Fonterra , the New Zealand conglomerate that owns a 43 percent share in Sanlu , said it first learned last month that the Chinese company was selling contaminated powder .
On Monday , New Zealand officials blamed local Chinese officials for failing to take action until the New Zealand government contacted the central authorities in Beijing .

The prime minister of New Zealand , Helen Clark , said Fonterra officials had been “ trying for weeks to get official recall , and the local authorities in China would not do it . ”
“ I think the first inclination was to try and put a towel over it and deal with it without an official recall , ” she said , according to Television New Zealand , a government network .
Chinese health officials said physicians had examined 10,000 infants who had been fed the Sanlu formula and found that 1,253 had been sickened .
Ma Shaowei , a vice health minister , said many of the ailing children were from poorer areas , according to a transcript on the Internet .
But at least three babies were hospitalized as far away as Hainan , the island province not far from Vietnam .
It seems likely that contaminated formula had been distributed for several months .
The two deaths attributed to the bad formula , both in Gansu , occurred long before the scandal became public .
One was a 5 - month - old boy who died on May 1 ; the other was an 8 - month - old girl who died on July 22 , according to the Health Ministry .

After every Olympics , there is speculation about which country performed best .
Should we really be surprised when China , with its huge population , and the US , with its combination of high GDP and population , top the medal table ?
Can we take a look at the medal tables and see which countries did indeed perform better than expected ?
In terms of total medals won , the same five countries topped both the 2000 Sydney Olympics table and the 2004 Athens Olympics table :
Position Country 2000 Medal Count Country 2004 Medal Count 1 United States 92 United States 103 2 Russia 88 Russia 92 3 China 59 China 63 4 Australia 58 Australia 49 5 Germany 56 Germany 49
By - and - large the same countries rise to the top each Olympics , but a quick look at the medal tables seems to suggest two obvious variables that may play a part in a country 's Olympic success — population and Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
A high population gives a country more athletes to draw from , while GDP could be assumed to represent a country 's prosperity , with a prosperous country more likely to spend money on frivolous activities such as sport .
Adjusting for population , we see that the top 5 countries have changed , except for Australia , who has over - performed for its population :
Position Country 2000 Medal Count Population ( '000s ) per medal 1 Bahamas 2 142 2 Barbados 1 259 3 Iceland 1 273 4 Australia 58 324 5 Jamaica 7 379
Position Country 2004 Medal Count Population ( '000s ) per medal 1 Bahamas 2 150 2 Australia 49 406 3 Cuba 27 419 4 Estonia 3 447 5 Slovenia 4 503
India , with its huge population , under - performed in 2004 , with one medal per one billion people , however we may expect with its rising GDP that it could come near the top of future lists .
Looking at GDP , we find a new top 5 , with Australia dropping out , but Cuba , Jamaica and the Bahamas again performing well :
Position Country 2000 Medal Count GDP ( $ ' 000,000s ) per medal 1 Cuba 29 597 2 Jamaica 7 1257 3 Georgia 6 1867 4 Macedonia 1 2100 5 Bulgaria 13 2585
Position Country 2004 Medal Count GDP ( $ ' 000,000s ) per medal 1 Cuba 27 1170 2 Jamaica 5 2042 3 Bahamas 2 2550 4 Georgia 4 3045 5 Eritrea 1 3300
Is there a way to predict how many medals a country will win at the Olympics , and can we at least set a baseline on which we can judge a country 's success ?
Looking at simple plots of medal tally against population and GDP for the 2004 games , it can quickly be seen that linear models of these variables will be unsatisfactory — that is , the data points do not cluster around any straight line :
Medal count vs population .
Medal count vs GDP .
The extreme values of GDP and population suggest that logarithms should be used .
In a logarithmic graph , the axes are rescaled so that the interval between 1 and 10 is the same as between 10 and 100 , and 100 and 1000 etc .
This makes practical sense — a country with a high population does not get to enter more athletes in the Olympics than lowly populated countries , and whilst a high population gives a strong base from which to draw quality athletes , as population increases , this effect will diminish .
With regards to GDP , countries occasionally produce athletes with so much natural ability that no amount of money spent on training the opposition could defeat them .
Findings in the report
Do elite sports systems mean more Olympic medals ?
by Simon Geoffrey , Martina Kerim , Peren Arinb , Nitha Palakshappac and Sylvie Chettyd from the Department of Commerce at Massey University back this up , with the authors suggesting that " the extraordinary talent required in winning a gold medal cannot be surpassed by the employment of an elite sports system . "
Looking at the countries that received more than 15 medals in 2004 , plots of the logarithm of medal count against the logarithms of population and GDP show a linear relationship .
Using linear regression — a form of analysis that fits a straight line to the data by minimising the distances between the data points and the fitted curve — we can find a straight line that fits well .
We found that the R2 values of this fit ( R2 is a statistical measure of correlation between 0 and 1 ) are above 0.5 , suggesting that , while not quite high enough to prove a correlation , we may be on to something :
Log medals vs log population .
Log medals vs log GDP
Using a linear combination of the logarithms of GDP and population , we can come up with a fitted line :
Linear combination of Ln( GDP ) and Ln( Population ) vs Ln( medal count ) .
We can see that Cuba , Australia and Russia all fall above the line of best fit and so compared to the other countries who received more than 15 medals , achieved well .
This could be explained by Cuba 's famous tradition of boxers and the spending of Australia and Russia on sport .
The much bemoaned UK Olympic team did not perform nearly as badly as commentators made out .
The danger with any such fitted model is that you can fit anything to anything after the event — the challenge is to come up with a worthwhile representative model that can not only let teams know how they are doing now , but can predict how they may do in the future .
In the paper Who wins the Olympic games : Economic development and medal totals , Andrew B. Bernard and Meghan R. Busse from The National Bureau of Economic Research developed a model that includes population , GDP , whether the country was the Olympic host and whether the country was formerly part of the Soviet Union or eastern block .
They found that countries win 1.8 % more medals when host than otherwise , and similarly , found that former Soviet Union or eastern block countries , because of their forced mobilisation of resources towards sport , and countries with planned economies , won more than 3 % more medals than equivalent western countries .
Their model is formulated as :
whereis a country 's medal count , is the population , is the GDP , andare constants , andandare constants equal to zero or some value depending on whether the country was the host , part of the Soviet block , or had a planned economy .
In their more developed models , the authors included terms to represent how countries performed at previous Olympic games — perhaps to represent the experience gained by athletes competing at multiple games .
Their overall conclusion is that whilst GDP is the best single variable for predicting medal tallies , other factors such as being the host country need to be included .
Indeed , their model predicted that Australia would win 17 more medals than otherwise when it hosted the Sydney Olympics — the model was only one short of the actual 18 extra medals Australia did win .
With this in mind , it is hard to look past China , as host country and with vast amounts of money pouring into Olympic sports for just this occasion , topping the medal tally .

John McCain was telling the truth when he said that economics was n’t his strong suit .
In response to what many economists have called the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , the Republican nominee has sounded — and let ’s be honest here — totally , embarrassingly and dangerously clueless .
His now - famous remark Monday about how “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” would almost by itself be enough to justify my assessment .
But he committed what was probably an even worse gaffe on Tuesday when , as the behemoth insurance company AIG teetered on the brink , McCain took a stand .
“ I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG , ” he said .
“ We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else . ”
Within hours , the federal government had bailed out AIG to the tune of $ 85 billion .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and others who know how Wall Street works understood that if AIG were to collapse , much of the financial system might follow .
McCain quickly changed his tune , saying the government was “ forced ” to rescue AIG because of “ failed regulation , reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street . ”
That sounds OK , but wait a minute .
If he had any idea of what he was talking about — if he had any inkling of how big AIG is , or how central the company has become — then why on earth would he have taken a stand against a bailout in the first place ?
Does n’t he have economic advisers who could fill him in ?
Oh , I forgot .
McCain ’s top economic guru , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , was busy explaining to reporters that McCain , as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , “ helped create ” the BlackBerry .
The McCain campaign quickly dismissed Holtz - Eakin ’s remark as a “ boneheaded joke , ” but it was delivered with an awfully convincing deadpan .
The blogosphere lit up with comparisons to Al Gore ’s alleged claim to have invented the Internet .
Adding insult to injury , one of McCain ’s most vocal campaign surrogates — former Hewlett - Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina — volunteered that McCain was n’t qualified to run a major corporation .
She gave the same assessment of Sarah Palin , Barack Obama and Joe Biden , but the McCain campaign ’s high command was so piqued that it canceled Fiorina ’s planned television appearances .
In an attempt to get back on message , McCain released new television ads Wednesday on the subject of the economy .
“ I ’ll meet this financial crisis head on , ” he says in one .
“ I wo n’t tolerate a system that puts you and your family at risk .
Your savings , your jobs — I ’ll keep them safe . ”
In fairness , Obama has n’t come up with a magic bullet to solve the financial crisis , either .
There are differences , though .
For one , Obama ’s proposals for action — a stimulus plan , protection for homeowners in peril of foreclosure , increased regulation — are more specific than McCain’s .
For another , Obama blames the crisis on “ an economic philosophy that sees any regulation at all as unwise and unnecessary . ”
McCain now calls for better regulation , too — after enthusiastically playing a major role in the frenzy of deregulation that helped create this awful mess .
In other words , McCain is running against his own record .
To cite one example , McCain backed landmark legislation in 1999 that removed the walls between banks , investment firms and insurance companies .
That bill allowed a company like AIG to expand beyond its traditional insurance business — which is still profitable — into exotic new products that ultimately brought the company down .
McCain , who told The Wall Street Journal in March that “ I ’m always for less regulation , ” now asks voters to believe he will be a champion of tough , unblinking oversight .
He ’s shocked and outraged that Wall Street ’s preening Masters of the Universe threw a drunken toga party and smashed all the furniture — but he helped buy the beer and told the cops to look the other way .
Here ’s something that really ought to grab everyone ’s attention : McCain supports George W. Bush ’s idea of channeling at least some Social Security funds into “ personal accounts ” that individuals would invest on Wall Street .
Some of that money would have been entrusted to firms such as Bear Stearns ( failed ) , Lehman Brothers ( failed ) and Merrill Lynch ( sold at a fire sale ) .
Imagine what this crisis would be like if Americans ’ Social Security benefits were evaporating along with their housing values and their 401 ( k ) accounts .
This is the man who ’s going to reform the economy ?

Chinese Banker Predicts Weakened U.S. Dollar in Long Term
From Xinhua News Agency , Beijing
Sunday , September 28,2008

TIANJIN , China --
The U.S. dollar will face short - term fluctuations and weaken in the long run , a leading Chinese banker predicted here on Sunday .
Speaking at the Summer Davos forum in this north China port city , Bank of China Vice President Zhu Min said he believed it would be less likely for the United States to sell more treasury bonds to other countries to obtain the funds needed to bail out the turmoil - beleagued financial market , which would only accelerate inflation in other countries .
Instead , the U.S. could only issue other bonds to finance the rescue plan , which Zhu said would definitely cause the dollar depreciation in the long term .
The bailout fund will have topped $ 1 trillion U.S. dollars if the U.S. Congress passes the Fed 's $ 700 billion financial rescue plan .
Zhu said market confidence could not be recovered simply with the help of the $ 700 billion , saying the U.S. dollar is a currency with turbulent fluctuations .
" It takes a long time to solve the current liquidity strains and investment crisis , " Zhu said .
Zhu also saw short - term fluctuations for the dollar since investment demand for the dollar is dropping and there could be " more bad news " in the coming few weeks .
Well - known Chinese economist Cheng Siwei told the forum that the pace of appreciation for the Chinese currency , the yuan , should be slower .
The United States and some European countries have been arguing that the yuan 's value is too low , which gives Chinese exporters an " unfair advantage . "
The yuan has witnessed continuous appreciation in recent years , but this time more and more Chinese enterprises , including textile firms , are complaining about money losses and possible shutdown .

Rules for smokers vary across Germany 's 16 states
Germany 's top court has ruled against smoking bans in small bars and clubs .
The Federal Constitutional Court upheld complaints against the bans in the city - state of Berlin and Baden - Wuerttemberg , in south - west Germany .
The two states are among 12 that introduced such bans at the start of the year .
The court says they must now review their anti-smoking laws .
Smoking will now be allowed in one - room bars and clubs smaller than 75 sq m ( 807 sq ft ) , where no food is served .
The court gave Berlin and Baden - Wuerttemberg until the end of 2009 to draft new anti-smoking legislation .
Presiding judge Hans - Juergen Papier made it clear that German states could introduce blanket smoking bans in all public spaces if they so wished .
The complaint was brought by the owners of two small bars in Tuebingen and Berlin , who argued that the smoking ban was harming their business .
They also said that , unlike larger premises , they had no space to create a separate smoking room .
The judge 's ruling is seen as setting a legal precedent for Germany because most of the country 's states have similar anti-smoking laws .
Bavaria has a total ban on smoking in bars and beer tents .
In Saarland , smoking is allowed in small bars and larger ones that provide a separate smoking room .
The other states ban smoking in one - room bars but allow it in establishments that provide a separate smoking room .
Germany has a nationwide ban on smoking in government buildings .

Almost two years ago , Microsoft promised that they will shift their focus to the brand ’s own offerings when it came to the Windows phones .
If initially we had a leak that showed us the Lumia 550 , Lumia 750 and Lumia 850 devices , it seems that two of these pones would be canceled .
The only one we have actually seen was the Lumia 550 , coming back to the retail universe .
Teasing Leaks
Thankfully , in the last couple of years , we have been really spoiled by seeing images with the devices that got canceled .
As such , we could see some interesting models that unfortunately will not become a reality , or at least not now .
If you love seeing images and videos of various prototypes , then you should know that now we have a new video that shows off the Lumia 750 , also dubbed “ Guilin ” .
Features
Just like with all the Lumia devices at the time , you could remove the back of the phone , which was built of polycarbonate .
Thus you could access the 2020 mAh battery , which could be removed .
Moreover , you could access the microSIM and the micro SD card slot .
Even though the phone in itself was not such specs - packed , it is interesting to see the way in which Microsoft envisaged its realization .
Needless to say , people were quite delighted to see this clip , and the reactions were at least interesting .
Many said that they actually wish for the phone to have been built , while others claim that it would n’t have been such a success , due to the few specs it had .
All in all , everyone agrees that it ’s interesting the fact that Microsoft decides to reveal this clips about possible devices that never got to be released , just to show fans an insight into their internal structure .
Did they know when they started out , the French directors of the New Wave , that they were in it for the long haul ?
Imagine a young , energetic , passionately cinephilic film - maker coming along today .
Given the increasing difficulty of finding finance , generating publicity , staying in fashion , how long would you bet on him or her sustaining a creative career before burning out or caving in to the temptation of the mainstream ?
Five features ?
Ten years ?
Now take the film - makers who emerged in France in the late - 1950s , and who came to be identified as the " Nouvelle Vague " .
Of the group who made their names as critics in the film journal Cahiers du Cinéma , Claude Chabrol was the first to direct a feature , Le Beau Serge in 1958 .
That makes the New Wave , as it's commonly accepted – a core of five also comprising Jean - Luc Godard , François Truffaut , Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette – 50 years old .
In other words , this generation has been making films for nearly half the history of cinema .
Who could have predicted that , when , as young polemicists , they were calling for the dethroning of French cinema 's tired old patriarchs ?
Next month , the group 's 88 - year - old doyen Eric Rohmer releases his latest film , The Romance of Astrea and Celadon .
An eccentric pastoral romance set in an imaginary 5th - century France , the film is atypical of Rohmer 's output , which has generally comprised cycles of brittle moral comedies .
But Rohmer has veered off course before , most recently in Triple Agent ( 2004 ) , an austere chamber drama about betrayal , and in The Lady and the Duke ( 2001 ) , a French Revolution story that made innovative use of CGI , depicting period panoramas as animated engravings .

As for Chabrol , he has made 55 features in 50 years – usually faithful to his Hitchcock - inspired love of the thriller – and has now embarked on his first collaboration with Gérard Depardieu .
Jacques Rivette has gone from intractably challenging experimentation , with films of sprawling duration and logic - scrambling obliqueness , to being a surprisingly approachable classicist .
Last year 's Balzac adaptation Do n't Touch the Axe was a salon - bound romance and magnificently austere vindication of the costume genre .
Other contemporaries sometimes associated with the " New Wave " , although not of their film - critic circle , have proved equally durable .
Alain Resnais , one of the epoch - defining experimenters of the 1950s and 1960s , is no longer producing his most challenging work , but still commands respect and is making a new film .
Then there 's Agnès Varda , whose Cleo de 5 à 7 ( 1962 ) is the feminist missing piece of the predominantly male New Wave jigsaw .
In 2000 , Varda embraced the camcorder in her first - person documentary The Gleaners and I , a reaffirmation of the New Wave tenet that the camera could be as personal a tool for expression as a writer 's pen .
That leaves two key names .
One is François Truffaut , the fiery ideologue who declared revolution in his 1954 polemic " A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema " , denouncing the then - dominant generation of conservative French directors and screenwriters .
Truffaut died in 1984 , his 21 features generally remaining true to a vision of cinema based on emulating the American cinema that he so admired .
Who knows where Truffaut would be today ?
Still making confidently mainstream films , no doubt , although much of his work was less conventional : especially ripe for rediscovery are the melancholy , novelistic Anne and Muriel ( 1971 ) and The Green Room ( 1978 ) , a Henry James - inspired contemplation of death , memory and the image .
Then there 's Godard , who , of all the ex-Cahiers group , is reputed as the Promethean grappler with the contradictions of cinema and society .
Godard has spent a lifetime crashing into artistic and ideological brick walls of his own making , then brushing himself down and heading off toward fresh crises .
After a torrential spate of invention , beginning with 1960's A Bout de Souffle , he entered an intractably difficult phase inspired by Maoist politics , withdrawing from the limelight to become a video pamphleteer and theoretician .
He returned to narrative cinema , reinvigorated , in the 1980s , though he has run aground and revived several times since , and in 2001 staged a dramatic return to public attention with the historically argumentative , visually vibrant In Praise of Love .
Among admirers , Godard now enjoys the status of a philosopher - saint , even if his declarations have been tainted by disturbing strains of anti-Semitic rhetoric .
How much more we 'll see from Godard is another question : when I interviewed him in 2005 , he complained of his inability to make " films " as he used to know them : " It 's like being a writer who still knows the letters of the alphabet but suddenly can't form words or sentences . "
What is striking is not just these directors ' longevity , but also that they have largely remained outsiders , with limited finance .
Compare those US film - makers who emerged in the 1960s and 1970s , inspired by the French example : Francis Coppola , Brian De Palma , even George Lucas , who as a student declared of Godard , " When you find someone who 's going the same direction as you , you do n't feel so alone . "
( It 's doubtful that Godard took such succour from The Phantom Menace ) .
You might also have expected a " New Wave " to be a quick - burning phenomenon .
But while Truffaut may have called for a symbolic slaughter of moribund patriarchs , he was n't out to kill all parents : he and his peers established a different pantheon of precursors , most famously Hollywood directors such as Hitchcock , Hawks , Ford and Fritz Lang .
There were idols closer to home , too : Renoir , Bresson , Jean - Pierre Melville , Roberto Rossellini .
These elders were themselves notable for sustaining long careers : their teaching was that , whatever challenges the film industry or world history threw at you , you had to keep filming .
The New Wave generation similarly contrived to endure , to make features even when there seemed to be no money to make them with or , for that matter , no stories to tell .
Rivette has made a career of pulling no -budget projects from the jaws of disaster : both Do n't Touch the Axe and his hall - of - mirrors fantasia Céline and Julie Go Boating ( 1974 ) emerged overnight from the collapse of other projects .
Remarkably , these directors ' collective achievement has never been repeated .
French cinema is forever in search of an enduring " New New Wave " , but none has delivered .
The self - important stylists of the early - 1980s , Jean - Jacques Beineix , Luc Besson , Leos Carax , ran out of steam .
That 1990s firebrand Mathieu Kassovitz ( La Haine ) was last seen directing a Vin Diesel sci - fi vehicle .
Of today 's enfants terribles , who 'll last the course ?
Gaspar Noé ?
Too cranky , too slow .
Christophe Honoré , whose recent films ( Dans Paris , Love Songs ) are a hymn to the early New Wave ?
We 'll see .
No doubt what sustained Truffaut 's peers was that they grew up on film as a religion , to the exclusion of much else .
For subsequent generations , film has been one cultural attraction among many , so the stakes have never again been as high : you can make films or not , but life goes on .
Compare Godard in 1962 : " Shooting and not shooting , for me , are two different lives .
Filming should be a part of life . "
The New Wave directors stayed true to that imperative and avoided becoming relics .
Their later work is generally as fascinating as the early breakthroughs : it 's not a question of choosing between Godard 's Alphaville ( 1965 ) and Histoire (s ) du Cinéma ( 1990s ) , Rohmer 's Claire 's Knee ( 1970 ) and Triple Agent ( 2004 ) .
It 's all part of the same long - term adventure , an achievement of marathon runners rather than sprinters .
And it 's not certain that the baton has yet truly been handed on .
' The Romance of Astrea and Celadon ' is released on 12 September .
Claude Chabrol 's ' A Girl Cut In Two ' is released next year
Riding the wave :
Who says old dogs can't pull off new tricks ?
Jean -Luc Godard
After his Histoire (s ) du Cinéma video essay of the 1990s , Godard returned to fiction with 2001 's Eloge de l'Amour , a diptych about the legacy of the Second World War .
His 2006 installation at Paris 's Pompidou Centre baffled many , but drew the crowds
Claude Chabrol
The most traditional of the New Wave directors , Chabrol continues to produce new variations on his Hitchcockian thriller template .
His latest film A Girl Cut In
Two is about an ingenue caught between a roué novelist and a volatile rich boy
Eric Rohmer
For years , it seemed you knew what you were getting with Rohmer .
Recently , he 's perplexed fans with ventures into French history , espionage and now pastoral idyll , in The Romance of Astrea and Celadon .
His 2001
The Lady and the Duke saw him experiment with CGI to dazzling effect
Jacques Rivette
Last year 's Balzac adaptation Do n't Touch the Axe was arguably one of France 's finest ever costume dramas .
In 2006 , fans swooned at long - overdue screenings of Rivette 's little - seen 121/2 - hour soap opera-cum - conspiracy thriller epic , Out 1 ( 1971 )
Oh please .
The Sarah Palin tax record is pretty clear at this point and it ’s all about raising taxes and since that ’s not enough for the rugged individuals of Alaska , gobbling federal tax money at a rate higher than any other state in the union .
With a record like hers , it ’s no wonder she ’s lying yet again and distorting the Obama tax cuts for most Americans .
As if it could n’t support itself , Alaska also ranks No. 1 , year after year , in money it sucks in from Washington .
In 2005 ( the most recent figures ) , according to the Tax Foundation , Alaska ranked 18th in federal taxes paid per resident ( $ 5,434 ) but first in federal spending received per resident ( $ 13,950 ) .
Its ratio of federal spending received to federal taxes paid ranks third among the 50 states , and in the absolute amount it receives from Washington over and above the amount it sends to Washington , Alaska ranks No. 1 .
Under the state constitution , the governor of Alaska has unusually strong powers to shape the state budget .
At the Republican National Convention , Palin bragged that she had vetoed “ nearly $ 500 million ” in state spending during her two years as governor .
This amounts to less than 2 % of the proposed budget .
That ’s how much this warrior for you ( the people ) against it ( the government ) could find in wasteful spending under her control .
Boffins have slammed examiners in England for setting school children seriously dumb questions .
The Royal Chemistry Society said that the science exams for 14 year olds includes questions such as , " What powers a solar - powered snail ? "
The Society 's chief executive Dr Richard Pike told us that while the syllabus and text books covered a broad range of scientific subjects , the exams only touched on a small subset of these .
As an example , the Society notes that one examination only asked questions about length , volume , mass and temperature , while the text book covered electrical current and resistance , pressure , rotational moment , and deriving .
The most taxing maths in the examination required students to find the mid point between 4 and 8 - by reading off a figure in an adjacent column .
The snail question was set for tiers 3 - 6 in Key Stage 3 .
Other examples include these multiple choice questions :
Why is copper used for wires in a circuit ?
Copper does not stick to a magnet
Copper is a brown metal
Copper is a good conductor of electricity
Copper is a good conductor of heat
In very cold weather a mixture of salt and sand is spread on roads .
Why ?
Salt makes the roads white
Salt makes water freeze
Salt makes ice melt
Sand dissolves in water
Sand increases friction between car tyres and the road
Sand makes water freeze
And this one , inspired by Father Ted , perhaps :
Some stars are bigger than the Sun but they look smaller .
Why do they look smaller than the Sun ?
They are brighter than the Sun
They are further away than the Sun
They are the same colour as the Sun
They are nearer than the Sun
That foxes me every time .
But seriously - who benefits most in the future from a population too dumb to distinguish between science and pseudoscience ?
Answers on a solar - powered snail , please . ®

A political row is erupting in Scotland after it emerged that 8,300 Scottish schoolchildren are to be biometrically fingerprinted at a cost of 20,000 pounds ( $ 37,300 ) per school per year .
As well as the staggering cost , angry parents are also voicing their opposition to the Big Brother privacy intrusions into their children ’s lives .
It ’s all part of a pilot scheme which is being tested at eight secondary schools ( high schools ) at East Dunbartonshire .
Supporters of the scheme are citing the advantages of the fingerprinting database including class attendance monitoring , better monitoring of library book borrowing and the buying of school meals ( and the end of stigma for those who receive free meals ) .
One government minister even went on television when I was on holiday in Scotland last week to say that a major benefit of the scheme was that when school bullying occurred , they would have the fingerprints on file to say who did what and they would then be able to track down the bully or bullies involved .
I ’m sorry but I just do n’t personally see teachers dusting down a scene , lifting prints like a crime scene tech and matching them to ones on a database .
I do n’t see stressed - out over - worked teachers being that diligent – and if a bully thinks there is a chance of his or her prints being lifted , what ’s to stop them wearing gloves ?
Critics are predictably raising the spectre of George Orwell and 1984 , asking who would be controlling the information and what would be done with it .
They are also kicking up a fuss about the cost , saying this sudden influx of cash should be better spent on books and other educational materials .
If your child was to be biometrically fingerprinted at school , would you allow it ?
Or would you refuse , just as a matter of principle ?
Do you see any positive aspects to this scheme or is it all a waste of money ?
If it was my child , I would n’t allow it .
I see this as a gross intrusion of privacy .
I was biometrically photographed at Heathrow Airport and for some reason it still unsettles me 6 days later .
Maybe part of me wonders where that photo is being stored now ?
This fingerprint scheme is no different .
If someone took my child ’s fingerprint , where would it go ?
What would be done with it ?

Advertisement Mayor of London Boris Johnson has told the BBC he is " absolutely determined " the 2012 Olympics will cost less than the current £ 9.3 bn budget .
Mr Johnson , who is in China on an official visit to the Beijing Games , said British and London taxpayers would " not pay a penny more " .
His team was working on ways of economising without jeopardising the " legacy value " of the event , he added .
But Olympic bosses said London still had to ensure the welfare of athletes .
Asked whether 2012 would be the " austerity games " , Mr Johnson conceded that the Chinese had put on " absolutely fantastic games " and that they had " set the bar high " .
" I think with British ingenuity , wit and ... resourcefulness we are going to produce a games - an opening ceremony , a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between - that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic , " he told BBC2's Newsnight .
I am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3bn
Boris Johnson
Mayor of London
London handover plans revealed
The original budget for the London Olympics in 2005 was £ 3.4bn , but was increased to £ 9.3 bn last year .
More than £ 2bn comes from Lottery funding , more than £ 1bn from London council tax payers and £ 6bn from Whitehall .
Mr Johnson said his team was currently economising and " finding ways of moving things around " and that the budget figure had " a couple of billion built in as contingency " .
" I am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the £ 9.3 bn .
I have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that , " he said .
He added : " I will ensure that London taxpayers and indeed British taxpayers do not pay a penny more . "
Mr Johnson confirmed that security in 2012 would be a " big spend " , but he dismissed a price tag of £ 1bn , saying he had seen a figure of £ 600 m .
' Wonderful Games '
Mr Johnson also said the loss of three senior officials from his administration in three months would not affect the delivery of the Olympics .
" We are going to have a wonderful games and I can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for London taxpayers and that people coming to London will enjoy themselves , " he said .
Mark Wallace , of the Taxpayers '
Alliance , said he welcomed the fact that organisers were being strict with budgets .
The games are for the athletes , the games are not for London , the games are not for Great Britain
Jacques Rogge
International Olympic Committee " We do need to be firm on this .
We can't allow the Olympic Delivery Authority , or whoever else involved with the Games , simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom . "
But Jacques Rogge , president of the International Olympic Committee , said London still had to deliver as well as China with regard to the quality of the Olympic village , venues and transport .
" The Games are for the athletes , the Games are not for London , the Games are not for Great Britain , " he added .
But Mr Johnson told BBC
News athletes would not be " short - changed " at London 2012 .
" They are going to have a fantastic Olympic village in which to spend their time during the Games , " he said .

" In the long term , those 3,000 units we are building in east London are going to be a vital part of the legacy we want to see out of the Olympic Games .
That 's why it would be completely senseless to economise . "
He added that the world had been gripped by " Olympo fever " and he is certain London 2012 will be " fantabulous " .
Mr Johnson has been defending his decision not to discuss human rights in talks with Chinese authorities during his trip .
He said it would have been " deeply counterproductive " to " showboat " and grab UK headlines at a time when China was opening up to the world .
Instead , the Beijing Games should be used to encourage better understanding between China and the rest of the world , he added .

Lehman - Only the Stock and Bond Holders Should Expect Losses ( Not Customers )
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

Well that was fast .
As I noted in last week 's market comment , " by essentially capitulating that Fannie and Freddie have to be taken over , the government is also sending a signal that other financial institutions ( particularly investment banks with high gross leverage multiples ) may be vulnerable to failure . "
It 's important to recognize that the timing of the stress at Lehman is not a coincidence independent of the Fannie and Freddie bailout .
Rather , the U.S. government essentially sent an information signal that highly leveraged financial institutions were insolvent .
Next to Bear Stearns , Lehman had the highest gross leverage multiple on the street ( the continuing problem is that several others are quite close ) .
Last week , Lehman reported $ 600 billion in assets , on less than $ 20 billion of common shareholder equity .
Evidently , the markets ( and potential acquirers ) do n't believe that the $ 20 billion is as tangible as Lehman reports .
Put another way , a markdown in the value of Lehman 's assets by just over 3 % would wipe out that reported shareholder equity .
One would need to have a great deal of faith in that asset valuation to be willing to buy the company out at any price , since an outright buyer would have to agree to pay off Lehman 's bondholders ( in excess of $ 100 billion ) .
A buyer might very well be willing to pay nearly $ 100 billion for Lehman 's assets , as well as its customer and counterparty liabilities , but the proceeds would n't be quite enough to pay off Lehman 's bondholders entirely .
That 's what everyone has been trying to avoid .
Not customer losses , but a bankruptcy that would leave Lehman 's bondholders less than whole .
Note the problem is not just one of " illiquidity . "
Even if your assets are worth more than your liabilities , you can be illiquid without being insolvent , in the sense that your cash immediately on hand is not sufficient to meet demands for withdrawal or other payments .
Insolvency goes further , to the point where the market value of your assets falls short of the market value of your liabilities .
As I write this Sunday evening , the outcome for Lehman is still not clear .
But I 'll repeat what I wrote about such issues in the April 7 , 2008 comment :
" In any event , SEC Chairman Cox is right - Bear Stearns ' customers and counterparties were never at risk of loss .
Though counterparties do n't have the SIPC protections , they did in the Bear Stearns instance have a substantial capital wall and legal safe harbors specifically designed to limit systemic problems .
There was a willing buyer for Bear 's entire book , so the book did n't need to be unwound , just sold in its entirety on day one .
Major U.S. financial companies have enough capital ( shareholder equity and bondholder debt ) to provide a cushion in the event of substantial writeoffs , without customers or counterparties being at risk of loss in the event of outright bankruptcy .
The only instance where there would be a question would be if the book value of the failing company was negative after entirely zeroing out all shareholder equity and bondholder debt , or if the only way to liquidate the book was to unwind it .
That was not the case for Bear Stearns .
" As I said a couple of weeks ago , if we keep on believing that the default of Bear Stearns bonds ( " bankruptcy " ) would have caused a global financial crash , then I expect that we are in for a global financial crash anyway .
Not because there is any true risk to customers and counterparties , but because investors are misinformed about how the financial markets work , and they will panic as foreclosures and writedowns inevitably soar in the months ahead .
A financial panic is fully avoidable if Wall Street and the media stop propagating the utterly false belief that a Bear Stearns bankruptcy would have led to a " chain reaction " of financial losses .
While we might very well see some over - leveraged firms go bankrupt , with substantial losses to their own stockholders and bondholders , the customers and counterparties are generally not at risk if there is enough stockholders equity and bondholder capital to eat through without leaving the remaining book value negative .
Bankruptcy or no bankruptcy , the underlying book of assets and liabilities can be transferred quickly .
The only question is how much the bondholders come away with . "
In Lehman 's case , $ 20 billion in shareholder equity is a very thin pool of funds to eat through when you 're not confident in the true market value of the $ 600 billion in assets held by the company .
But it 's crucial to recognize that if you include both shareholder equity as well as Lehman 's debt ( bonds and subordinated debt ) , you 've got a $ 143 billion cushion to eat through before any customer or counterparty would be at risk .
With that kind of cushion , the issue is not , and probably will never be whether customers or counterparties are at risk .
The only issue is whether you save the bondholders .
Essentially what we 've got here is an economy where the government provided a boatload of tax cuts , the benefit of which was invested directly and indirectly into mortgage securities , which helped to finance irresponsible lending , which produced a housing bubble , and now that the bubble has burst and the mortgage securities are losing money , those same bondholders are looking for the government to bail them out .
That 's messed up .
As a sidenote , I should note that the main downside of a Lehman ( or other ) bankruptcy will not be for customers or counterparties , but to its debt holders , and by extension , institutions that are heavily exposed in the credit default swap market .
To reiterate a point in my 2003 piece , Freight Trains and Steep Curves :
" Aside from the risk that any particular link in this chain might be weak ( know thy counterparty ) , the U.S. financial system has gone one step further .
In order to hedge against the risk of defaults , banks frequently lay credit risk off by entering " credit default swaps " with other banks or insurance companies .
These swaps essentially act as insurance policies for credit risk .
" Once again , however , the iron law of equilibrium is that every risk swapped away by someone is held by someone else .
According to Bloomberg , over half of the world 's trading in the credit swaps market is concentrated among five banks : J.P. Morgan ( 26 % ) , Citigroup ( 10 % ) , UBS Warburg ( 9 % ) , Bank of America ( 7 % ) and Deutsche Bank ( 7 % ) . "
It 's not just credit
Though the drama of credit defaults , bankruptcy risk and government bailouts makes it seem that the current bear market is only about credit , it 's important to recognize that there are other ( equally expected ) difficulties that the U.S. stock market faces .
Beyond concern about U.S. financials , I 've consistently emphasized that the U.S. stock market has been very strenuously valued in recent years , primarily because investors were placing historically rich multiples on earnings that themselves were driven by profit margins about 50 % above historical norms .
It is those fundamental objects - valuation multiples and profit margins , that have placed an overhang on stock market returns , and will continue to do so until stock prices reflect relatively normal multiples on relatively normal profit margin expectations .
That does n't mean that stocks have to move to deeply below - average valuations or profit margins have to revert entirely to historical norms .
But the extreme assumptions that have propped the market 's valuation up in recent years are beginning to unwind .
To some extent , the constant hope and excitement about credit bailouts simply draws out this process .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate in stocks was characterized by unfavorable valuations and unfavorable market action , holding the Strategic Growth Fund to a fully hedged investment stance .
The best way to open the potential to increased risk exposure and more constructive investment positions would be for the market to move a good distance below the recent trading range .
As I noted last week , that would create what I think is the best we can hope for at present , which would be an advance back to this area .
While current levels do not provide the expectation for strong long - term returns ( our current 10 - year total return projection still being in the 4 - 6 % range ) , normalized valuations are not so high as to be unsustainable , so substantial moves below this range create some prospect for appropriate risk taking from an investment ( not simply speculative ) standpoint .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week was characterized by unfavorable yield levels and relatively neutral yield pressures .
Inflation pressures are likely to abate significantly in the months ahead , owing both to slowing global demand and to credit concerns ( which lower monetary velocity - essentially increasing the demand for currency as a safe - haven , which slows its erosion of value ) .
I continue to believe that the U.S. dollar is at substantial risk of a fresh depreciation .
Though the economies of Europe and the rest of the world are slowing , the deterioration in the U.S. economy is also ongoing , and other countries have nowhere near the burden the U.S. does in terms of dependence on external capital .
From my perspective , either U.S. domestic investment will weaken sufficiently that those capital needs will slow ( which will tend to pressure the U.S. dollar via general economic weakness ) , or our continued reliance on external capital will pressure the dollar lower in order to create an incentive for foreign savings to finance us .
Though Treasury yields continue to be pressured on periodic credit concerns , the level of yields is low enough to create the risk of periodic yield spikes that can easily wipe out a year or two of interest differentials ( compared with shorter - term Treasury yields ) .
For that reason , the Strategic Total Return Fund continues to carry a relatively short duration of about 2.5 years .
On the profound weakness in precious metals shares , especially on Tuesday ( when the gold / XAU ratio spiked to about 6.7 and the XAU itself dropped close to the 100 level - at which point gold prices could have dropped by nearly half without the XAU being out of line ) , we moved just over 12 % of the Strategic Total Return Fund 's assets into precious metals shares , modestly reducing our foreign currency holdings to keep our overall allocation in precious metals shares , utilities and foreign currencies to 30 % of assets ( as of the time the positions are established ) .

On Wednesday , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation to make it illegal to text message while driving .
When the law takes effect on January 1 , 2009 , it will be illegal to read , write , and send messages while on the road .
The law carries a $ 20 fine for first time offenders , followed by a $ 50 fine for each subsequent text messaging offense .
The new law is part of the state of California 's effort to cut cell phone distractions while driving .
A previous law , enacted on July 1 , 2008 , made it illegal to hold a phone while driving , instead requiring users to use a handsfree headset .
Additionally , drivers under the age of 18 are not allowed to use a cell phone under any circumstances while driving .

THE events of the weekend begin the greatest intervention in the US economy by the Federal Government since the Great Depression , with the Bear Stearns rescue but a splutter on this road we must now travel .
If you were wondering what all the flag - waving at the Republican convention has been about , it is now clear .
Americans are waving goodbye to the prosperity the nation has enjoyed since the Great Depression and a final goodbye to democracy .
But while preparation for the most important decision made in the nation 's post - depression financial history towered above the conventions , I do n't think the fate of Freddie and Fannie and the remaining government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) was mentioned during either convention .
And the politicians .
President Bush has long authorised the Treasury to open its purse strings and , naturally , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he did not expect the line of endless taxpayer credit to be used .
This is like signing an authority to go to war and saying we do n't expect to go to war .
Once the authority is given , it will happen .
It was always laughable to expect otherwise .
Paulson " briefed " John McCain and Barack Obama on the " plan " .
The fact is that while America , and the world , wait to see who will govern , Mr Paulson has decided to take matters out of the politicians ' hands .
They willingly agreed .
The ultimate political power , to spend taxpayers ' money , has been tossed away .
Obviously the economy is too important to be left to the politicians .
Instead it is to be put into " conservatorship " .
It has come to this .
We do n't know exactly what " this " is , but all will be revealed before the Asian markets open today .
Like all things Paulson has done lately , it is aired in rarefied circles during the week , decided on by Friday , announced on Saturday , the details hammered out on Sunday and a final deal revealed for the Asian markets , which will judge the matter on the Monday morning .
Dem poll : Most US women voters ' unimpressed ' by McCain's VP pick RAW STORY
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON - Most US women are unimpressed by Republican John McCain 's choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate , and have thrown their weight behind the Democratic ticket in the race for the White House , a national poll showed Wednesday .
Six in 10 women voters see McCain 's choice of a female running mate as a calculated political decision rather than one based on Palin 's experience and qualities , showed the poll conducted by the Garin - Hart - Yang Research Group .
Garin - Hart - Yang caters to a Democratic clientele .
Claims the company 's Web site : " Garin - Hart - Yang has a strong record of helping Democratic candidates win under the most difficult circumstances ... "
" Women voters see the choice of Governor Palin as being driven by politics rather than by any sense of conviction on Senator McCain 's part that she has the experience and qualities to make a good vice president , " the research group said in a statement .
A majority of the 800 women polled -- 56 percent -- said they were put off by Palin 's legislative record and her position on moral issues , such as abortion .
" When women voters learn that Palin opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest , opposes stem cell research and , as governor , opposed funding for state pre-kindergarten programs ... a majority say ... ( they ) feel less favorable toward her , " the poll showed .
Palin 's scant experience as an elected official -- she was mayor of a small town for six years and has been governor of Alaska for less than two -- " squanders " McCain 's advantage over Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in terms of experience in office and readiness to lead , the women voters said .
And even though the choice of Palin was a historic move for the Republican party , marking the first time a woman has featured on a Republican presidential ticket , it has pushed many women voters over to the side of the Democrats .
Fifty - two percent of women voters polled said they would vote for the all - male Democratic ticket of Obama and Joe Biden , while just 41 percent said they would back McCain and Palin in the November election .

Thiago da Silva Murdered : Ex - Girlfriend Alyne Padula Accused
Thiago da Silva
, a Brazilian soccer player , was brutally tortured and murdered by assassins hired by his ex-girlfriend
Da Silva , 25 , was practicing on a field last Thursday when three men overwhelmed him .
He was handcuffed , beaten and tortured .
When he tried to flee he was hit by three bullets .
According to reports , one of the men was a member of the military police and the companion of Alyne Padula 's aunt , Marcia Padula Viana .
Both women were taken into custody on Sunday .
Da Silva died in a hospital in Rio de Janiero last night - six days after the attack .
Before he died , da Silva told police that he had fallen into a trap last Thursday evening , shortly after discussing the end of his relationship with Padula .
Da Silva , formerly of Vasco , had been playing for second division team Estacio de Sa Soccer Club .
Uninsured deposits at IndyMac Bancorp totaled about $ 541 million , federal regulators said Thursday , marking their second reduction of the estimate since the government seized the troubled mortgage lender July 11 .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which is operating the Pasadena savings and loan and is hoping to sell it , originally estimated that $ 1 billion of IndyMac ’s $ 19 billion in deposits were uninsured .
Last month , the FDIC revised the figure down to about $ 600 million .
The latest change resulted from the slow process of interviewing depositors about complicated accounts , especially trust accounts for which every beneficiary must be verified , FDIC spokesman David Barr said .
Basic FDIC insurance tops out at $ 100,000 per customer at a bank , thrift or credit union , but depositors can insure many times that amount by setting up joint accounts and trusts .
The FDIC now estimates that IndyMac ’s collapse will cost the federal deposit insurance fund $ 8.9 billion .
I guess suspending your campaign does n’t including taking your talking head surrogates off the cable nets .
We ’ll have video soon of top McCain surrogate Nancy Pfotenhauer who was just on Fox attacking Obama .
Late Update : Does n’t preclude Pfotenhauer from doing live chat right now with Washington Times either .
Later Update : Latest McCain camp line , in response to question of whether debate will go on Friday with an empty podium : Obama can always debate Joe Biden instead .

Science reveals where religion conceals .
Where religion purports to explain , it actually resorts to tautology .
To assert that " God did it " is no more than an admission of ignorance dressed deceitfully as an explanation ...
Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume , I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed , during a long course of years , from a point of view directly opposite to mine .
It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as " plan of creation , " " unity of design , " etc. , and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact .
Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject the theory .
The old argument of design in nature , as given by Paley , which formerly seemed to me to be so conclusive , fails , now that the law of natural selection has been discovered .
We can no longer argue that , for instance , the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being , like the hinge of a door by man .
There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection , than in the course which the wind blows .

Peter Sunde , one of the founders of the Pirate Bay , wrote a mysterious blog post today asking for someone in the U.S. to send him an Amazon Kindle , and hinted that he might be working on a new project involving e-books .
“ Do [ sic ] anyone wanna help me out ?
I ’m looking to make an interesting service together with some friends in the New Media Market … , ” he writes .
He says he is n’t able to purchase one in Europe , and that it ’s too expensive to use mailing dropboxes in the United States .
On top of all that , he links to a Digital Renaissance blog post discussing the future of the book industry and the Kindle 's potential .
" Book publishers – it ’s time to act .
You have an amazing digital future ahead of you .
Monetize it before some smart guy in a garage does it , " writes Martin J. Thörnkvist .
We sent Sunde an e-mail for clarification to find out if there really is a secret new project focusing on e-books .
His reply was equally as cryptic :
“ Sponsor me with a Kindle and I 'll answer ? :-) ”
While we work through the bureaucracy of funding this little investigation , one message is clear :
Publishers need to get a grip on the biz before the pirates do .

In an effort to prove that Google is a serious threat to the personal privacy of people everywhere , the National Legal and Policy Center has exposed countless Google Street View pics that detail what are likely the home , cars , and daily commute of top Google executive Larry Page .
Responding to Google 's addled defense of Street View in an ongoing Pennsylvania court case , the privacy watchdog just unleashed a seven - page PDF that hoists Larry Page by his own petard - without actually mentioning the name Larry Page .
Compiled in " less than 30 minutes , " the report reproduces Google Street View photos that appear to reveal Larry Page 's cars , Larry Page 's license plates , the name of the landscaping company Larry Page uses , the name of the home security company used by Larry Page 's next door neighbor , the distance from the street to Larry Page 's front door , and Larry Page 's likely driving route to Google 's Mountain View headquarters .
" There is no better evidence that individual privacy simply does not exist in Google ’s world than by the chilling amount of detailed visual information Google now collects on all of us , information that any Internet user can now compile in a dossier in less than 30 minutes , " reads a canned statement from Ken Boehm , Chariman of National Legal and Policy Center .
" The fact that every American is now subject to this type of scrutiny with the click of a mouse is frightening . "
Larry Page 's driving directions
In recently revealed court documents , Google defends its spycar - fueled Street View abomination by claiming that " even in today 's desert , complete privacy does not exist . "
But Boehm and the NLPC point out that when speaking to American politicians , Google also likes to say things like this : " Google takes privacy very seriously . "
" Perhaps in Google ’s world , privacy does not exist , but in the real world , individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like Google , " says Boehm .
" Google ’s hypocrisy is breathtaking . "
Ah , but the NLPC does n't take privacy as seriously as it would lead you to believe .
Its seven - page Larry Page report avoids naming the Google exec , and the Virginia - based privacy watchdog is careful to redact his address .
But as our friends at Valleywag point out , you can remove those redactions - in about 30 seconds .
Here at The Reg , we really care about privacy .
When we redact Larry Page 's name from a story that shows Street View invading his own personal space , we have no problem telling you we 're talking about Larry Page .
Here 's the car in his driveway - and maybe his gardener drinking a soda :

15 Examples To Master Linux Command Line History
When you are using Linux command line frequently , using the history effectively can be a major productivity boost .
In fact , once you have mastered the 15 examples that I ’ve provided here , you ’ll find using command line more enjoyable and fun .
1. Display timestamp using HISTTIMEFORMAT
Typically when you type history from command line , it displays the command # and the command .
For auditing purpose , it may be beneficial to display the timepstamp along with the command as shown below .
# export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T ' # history | more 1 2008-08-05 19:02:39 service network restart 2 2008-08-05 19:02:39 exit 3 2008-08-05 19:02:39 id 4 2008-08-05 19:02:39 cat /etc/redhat- release
2. Search the history using Control +
R
I strongly believe , this may be your most frequently used feature of history .
When you ’ve already executed a very long command , you can simply search history using a keyword and re-execute the same command without having to type it fully .
Press Control +R and type the keyword .
In the following example , I searched for red , which displayed the previous command “ cat /etc/ redhat - release ” in the history that contained the word red .
# [ Press Ctrl+R from the command prompt , which will display the reverse - i- search prompt ] ( reverse - i- search ) `red ' : cat /etc / redhat - release [ Note : Press enter when you see your command , which will execute the command from the history ] # cat /etc / redhat - release Fedora release 9 ( Sulphur )
Sometimes you want to edit a command from history before executing it .
For e.g. you can search for httpd , which will display service httpd stop from the command history , select this command and change the stop to start and re-execute it again as shown below .
# [ Press Ctrl+R from the command prompt , which will display the reverse - i- search prompt ] ( reverse - i- search ) `httpd ' : service httpd stop [ Note : Press either left arrow or right arrow key when you see your command , which will display the command for you to edit , before executing it ] # service httpd start
3. Repeat previous command quickly using 4 different methods
Sometime you may end up repeating the previous commands for various reasons .
Following are the 4 different ways to repeat the last executed command .
Use the up arrow to view the previous command and press enter to execute it .
Type !!
and press enter from the command line Type !- 1 and press enter from the command line .
Press Control +
P will display the previous command , press enter to execute it
4. Execute a specific command from history
In the following example , If you want to repeat the command # 4 , you can do ! 4 as shown below .
# history | more 1 service network restart 2 exit 3 id 4 cat / etc / redhat - release # ! 4 cat /etc / redhat - release Fedora release 9 ( Sulphur )
5 . Execute previous command that starts with a specific word
Type !
followed by the starting few letters of the command that you would like to re-execute .
In the following example , typing ! ps and enter , executed the previous command starting with ps , which is ‘ ps aux | grep yp ’ .
# !ps ps aux | grep yp root 16947 0.0 0.1 36516 1264 ?
Sl 13:10 0:00 ypbind root 17503 0.0 0.0 4124 740 pts/0 S+ 19:19 0:00 grep yp
6 . Control the total number of lines in the history using HISTSIZE
Append the following two lines to the .
bash_profile and relogin to the bash shell again to see the change .
In this example , only 450 command will be stored in the bash history .
# vi ~/.bash_profile HISTSIZE=450 HISTFILESIZE=450
7 . Change the history file name using HISTFILE
By default , history is stored in ~/.bash_history file .
Add the following line to the .
bash_profile and relogin to the bash shell , to store the history command in .commandline_warrior file instead of .
bash_history file .
I ’m yet to figure out a practical use for this .
I can see this getting used when you want to track commands executed from different terminals using different history file name .
# vi ~/.bash_profile HISTFILE=/root/.commandline_warrior
If you have a good reason to change the name of the history file , please share it with me , as I ’m interested in finding out how you are using this feature .
8. Eliminate the continuous repeated entry from history using HISTCONTROL
In the following example pwd was typed three times , when you do history , you can see all the 3 continuous occurrences of it .
To eliminate duplicates , set HISTCONTROL to ignoredups as shown below .
# pwd # pwd # pwd # history | tail - 4 44 pwd 45 pwd 46 pwd [ Note that there are three pwd commands in history , after executing pwd 3 times as shown above ] 47 history | tail - 4 # export HISTCONTROL =ignoredups # pwd # pwd # pwd # history | tail - 3 56 export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups 57 pwd [ Note that there is only one pwd command in the history , even after executing pwd 3 times as shown above ] 58 history | tail - 4
9 . Erase duplicates across the whole history using HISTCONTROL
The ignoredups shown above removes duplicates only if they are consecutive commands .
To eliminate duplicates across the whole history , set the HISTCONTROL to erasedups as shown below .
# export HISTCONTROL =erasedups # pwd # service httpd stop # history | tail - 3 38 pwd 39 service httpd stop 40 history | tail - 3 # ls - ltr # service httpd stop # history | tail - 6 35 export HISTCONTROL =erasedups 36 pwd 37 history | tail - 3 38 ls - ltr 39 service httpd stop [ Note that the previous service httpd stop after pwd got erased ] 40 history | tail -6
10 .
Force history not to remember a particular command using HISTCONTROL
When you execute a command , you can instruct history to ignore the command by setting HISTCONTROL to ignorespace AND typing a space in front of the command as shown below .
I can see lot of junior sysadmins getting excited about this , as they can hide a command from the history .
It is good to understand how ignorespace works .
But , as a best practice , do n’t hide purposefully anything from history .
# export HISTCONTROL =ignorespace # ls - ltr # pwd # service httpd stop [ Note that there is a space at the beginning of service , to ignore this command from history ] # history | tail - 3 67 ls - ltr 68 pwd 69 history | tail - 3
11 . Clear all the previous history using option -c
Sometime you may want to clear all the previous history , but want to keep the history moving forward .
# history -c
12 . Subtitute words from history commands
When you are searching through history , you may want to execute a different command but use the same parameter from the command that you ’ve just searched .
In the example below , the !!:$ next to the vi command gets the argument from the previous command to the current command .
# ls anaconda-ks.cfg anaconda-ks.cfg # vi !!:$ vi anaconda- ks.cfg
In the example below , the !^ next to the vi command gets the first argument from the previous command ( i.e cp command ) to the current command ( i.e vi command ) .
# cp anaconda-ks.cfg anaconda-ks.cfg.bak anaconda-ks.cfg # vi !^ vi anaconda-ks.cfg
13 . Substitute a specific argument for a specific command .
In the example below , ! cp:2 searches for the previous command in history that starts with cp and takes the second argument of cp and substitutes it for the ls -l command as shown below .
# cp ~/longname.txt /really/a/very/long/path/long-filename.txt # ls -l !cp:2 ls -l /really /a/very/long/path/long-filename.txt
In the example below , ! cp : $ searches for the previous command in history that starts with cp and takes the last argument ( in this case , which is also the second argument as shown above ) of cp and substitutes it for the ls -l command as shown below .
# ls -l ! cp : $ ls -l /really / a/very/long/path/long-filename.txt
14 . Disable the usage of history using HISTSIZE
If you want to disable history all together and do n’t want bash shell to remember the commands you ’ve typed , set the HISTSIZE to 0 as shown below .
# export HISTSIZE=0 # history #
[ Note that history did not display anything ]
15 . Ignore specific commands from the history using HISTIGNORE
Sometimes you may not want to clutter your history with basic commands such as pwd and ls .
Use HISTIGNORE to specify all the commands that you want to ignore from the history .
Please note that adding ls to the HISTIGNORE ignores only ls and not ls - l .
So , you have to provide the exact command that you would like to ignore from the history .
# export HISTIGNORE = " pwd:ls :ls - ltr : " # pwd # ls # ls - ltr # service httpd stop # history | tail - 3 79 export HISTIGNORE = " pwd:ls :ls - ltr : " 80 service httpd stop 81 history [ Note that history did not record pwd , ls and ls - ltr ]

The financial storm that has been battering Wall Street has also blown away John McCain 's lead in the presidential race , where a five - point lead in some polls has turned into a five - point deficit within three days .
With 46 days to go until America votes , opinion polls are volatile , but the shift in momentum to the Obama campaign has underlined his rival 's apparent vulnerability on the economy .
A clutch of new polls showed a lead for the Democrat , with The New York Times / CBS News poll giving him a 48 - 43 margin over the Republican Mr McCain .
The gap is within the margin of error in all of the polls , but represents a significant shift .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Barack Obama was intent on pressing home the economic attack .
He promised to bring change by challenging the " old boys network " in Washington .
" In the McCain campaign that 's called a staff meeting , " he quipped .
But Senator McCain was on the offensive at an enthusiastic rally in Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
He blamed regulators who were " asleep at the switch " for the meltdown of the financial system , rather than the banks who had made the bad housing loans .
They had " turned the financial markets into a casino , " he said .
To cheers , he declared that he would fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , which regulates Wall Street .
The McCain camp 's attempt to distance itself from the economic legacy of President George Bush , a fellow Republican , is having limited effect so far .
The latest polls reveal that despite his efforts , voters believe he is far less likely to make changes than his adversary .
The Arizona senator is still seen as a " typical Republican " who would entrench current unpopular policies , rather than get the country back on track .
The daily crop of grim news from Wall Street has sent shockwaves across America , where voters live in dread of losing their jobs as the fallout triggers a tide of company closures and job losses .
The latest polls also show that the " Palin effect " – the bounce the McCain campaign enjoyed after the nomination of Alaska 's governor , Sarah Palin , as the vice - presidential candidate – has run its course .
There was an initial surge of interest in the McCain - Palin ticket , especially among white women voters , which energised the evangelical conservative base of the Republican Party .
But scrutiny of Governor Palin 's record on issues such as abortion and her inexperience on the national stage appears to have rallied the so - called " Clinton Democrats " to the Illinois Senator 's side .
Some observers believe she may soon become a liability to the Republicans .
Her " favourability score " averaged across four recent polls gives her the worst scores among the four candidates for the White House and vice - presidency .
At the heart of the intensifying race for the White House is a tug - of - war between the two campaigns over independent voters , who are notoriously fickle .
After switching to the McCain ticket following the Republican convention they are now roughly split , according to a different Quinnipiac university poll , which put them at 46 per cent for Mr Obama and 45 per cent for Mr McCain yesterday .
The New York Times gives Mr Obama a major lead among voters aged 18 to 44 , while his rival leads by 17 points among white men and by the same margin among voters aged 65 and over .
Middle - age voters – 45 to 64 – are evenly split between the two .
The Obama campaign hopes it can stay focused on the economy .
But the first presidential debate in Mississippi next week will focus on foreign policy , where Mr McCain is generally seen as stronger .
Surveys give him a substantial advantage over his rival as the potential commander - in - chief .
And for the first time , a majority of Americans say that the " surge " of US troops in Iraq , which Mr McCain advocated , has made a big difference there .
Late one night last spring , William Bradshaw sat nervously in his study in Chesterfield waiting to make his media debut as a demonologist .
A radio host in either Maine or Oregon — he can't remember which — was scheduled to call to discuss Bradshaw 's new book , Sinister Among Us , a novel about hunting demons on a college campus .
It had been 47 years since Bradshaw first began his research of evil spirits that shatter human lives .
Then , as now , an entire wall of his home office was lined with neatly arranged books on biblical scholarship .
There , too , were two leather - bound copies of his Ph.D. thesis from Scotland 's University of St. Andrews titled Demonology in the Old Testament and Hebrew Scriptures .
Bradshaw had prepared for that night 's interview by sitting at his desk , making careful notes about the role of demons in the Bible and the more practical aspects of demonic possession and exorcism .
The phone rang .
It was the radio host .
" Dr. Bradshaw , " he began , " do you believe that demonic possession causes heads to spin ? "
The question caught Bradshaw off - guard .
Stunned , he replied , " That 's not relevant to the subject . "
The radio host was equally surprised .
Bradshaw , after all , was an expert on demons , and surely he must have seen the movie The Exorcist or read the book .
The interview went downhill from there .
" He wanted scary and spooky stuff , not scholarship , " Bradshaw remembers now .
" Most people do n't understand demonology .
They think demons are like ghosts and equate them with haunted houses .
That 's not what demonology is about . "
Ghosts , he continues , are the spirits of people who have died .
Demons are evil spirits that have never been human .
Such is the life of America 's best - known — and perhaps only — demonologist .
" People look at me , " Bradshaw concedes , " and say , ' What kind of kook are you ? ' "
As a graduate student , he learned to deflect interest in his work by saying only that he studied the Old Testament .
Now 75 , Bradshaw still resembles the dignified pastor and college president he was for four decades , staring out sternly at the world through steel - rimmed spectacles .
He is a formal man who grew up in Lebanon , Missouri , and still speaks with an Ozark twang .
Though retired , he dresses most days in a suit and tie .
He eats his doughnuts with a fork .
He gets up early every morning , goes to his study and gets straight to work .
He is currently working on two books , one on English grammar — he is most annoyed when people use " I " when they should use " me " — and the other a biography of an Ozark man who fought on the Union side during the Civil War .
When he still played golf , he regularly shot in the 70s but preferred the driving range to the fairway .
Bradshaw is no charlatan .
To him , demons are quite real .
" I can't prove spirits exist , " he says .
" I can't prove God exists , that demons exist , that angels exist .
They 're invisible .
You can't touch them , feel them , smell them .
But sometimes something so absolutely marvelous and wonderful happens , beyond what you believe is man 's ability to make things happen .
Likewise , there are things so awful , so hideous , so dumb , that you just can't believe man is responsible for that activity .
So you look for evidence of Satan . "
Over the years , Bradshaw has met a number of people he believes were possessed .
" The number of demon - possessed people compared to the number of people in the world is minuscule , " he says .
" But it 's not uncommon .
Right now , I would say I know fifteen to twenty . "
All the events in the fictional Sinister Among
Us are based on real life : the president of the college board of trustees who stole money from the scholarship fund .
The prostitution ring operating out of a college dorm .
The man whose skin broke out in blisters whenever touched by holy water .
The woman whose life was a frightful misery until a clergyman determined she was possessed and exorcised the demon .
" Every incident has happened .
I 've been there , " Bradshaw affirms .
" But not in the same institution .
My publisher was concerned about a lawsuit . "
In the autumn of 1961 Bradshaw reported for the first time to the book - strewn office of Matthew Black , his Ph.D. thesis advisor at St Andrews .
To this day , his memory of that initial encounter is crystal clear .
" Mr. Bradshaw , " Bradshaw remembers Black telling him , " I want you to study demonology . "
" At first I thought he was joking , " Bradshaw adds .
" But Dr. Black was not a humorous man . "
Bradshaw was surprised — and disappointed .
He had just moved his wife Betty June and their two young children to Scotland , for this ?
At the time , Black was one of the world 's preeminent scholars of the Old Testament .
Bradshaw had hoped to help him with his research on the Dead Sea Scrolls , which were first discovered in 1947 .
He was n't interested in demons .
" I was not convinced it was a topic of great integrity , " Bradshaw says , gazing up at the print of Winston Churchill that adorns his office wall .
" It was scoffed at , especially on this side of the ocean . "
Nothing in Bradshaw 's background prepared him to study demons .
His father , " a rough - and - tumble trial lawyer " in Lebanon , hoped his younger son would follow in his footsteps .
He helped young William , known as Bud , overcome a childhood stutter by reciting poetry on Sunday afternoons .
Bradshaw attended the University of Missouri on a track scholarship and , like his father before him , served as student body president .
The prospect of law school , though , made him nervous .
Against his father 's wishes , he decided to become a minister .
With Betty June 's help , Bradshaw worked his way through Yale Divinity School .
She typed and filed and he washed windows and sold shrubbery and storm windows door - to - door in New Haven .
In 1958 he was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Christ and took up a pulpit in Pennsylvania .
He left three years later to pursue his doctorate .
Dr. Black , Bradshaw realized , had his reasons for insisting that he study demonology .
" It was only sixteen years after the Second World War , " Bradshaw explains .
" Many reputable scholars , especially theologians in England and Germany , had trouble believing that men were responsible for the atrocities of the war , especially the treatment of the Jews .
Did evil spirits influence German thought ?
I was the first person to look at the topic .
People did n't understand it .
It set me apart .
At the beginning , I was apologetic .
I wanted to blame the whole thing on Dr. Black . "
Bradshaw 's research centered around one fundamental question :
Where did demons come from ?
In the Old Testament , notes Bradshaw , God is all - powerful .
By the New Testament , Satan has become God 's equal and the two have begun the great cosmic battle that will end with Armageddon .
For three years , Bradshaw spent most of his time reading and re-reading the Bible and Hebrew scriptures .
He left the library only to eat , sleep , meet with Black and play an occasional game of golf on St Andrews ' famous course .
And , for a few splendid weeks , to visit Jerusalem to examine the Dead Sea Scrolls in person .
" The scrolls were in a huge building , " he happily recalls .
" Well , it looked monstrous to me .
It was full of long tables with the scrolls all spread out .
It was like a jigsaw puzzle .
You 'd take a little piece and then try to figure out where it went . "
Unfortunately , Bradshaw found little in the scrolls relating to demonic thought .
" Dr. Black was disappointed , " he says .
Bradshaw eventually discovered what he was looking for in the writings of Jewish scholars from the first and second centuries .
One group of thinkers , the Apocalyptic school , believed — contrary to mainstream Jews — that God , Satan , demons and other supernatural forces intervened in human lives .
Jesus was influenced by this group .
Bradshaw wrote and defended his 400 - page thesis and returned to America , assuming his demonology days were behind him .
" I 'm not sure I 'd gotten used to the idea of demons by the time I finished my Ph.D. , " Bradshaw recalls .
" I was married with two kids and a third on the way " — he and Betty June would eventually have four — " and I was mostly interested in getting done . "
Bradshaw returned to the ministry , taking pulpits in St. Paul , Minnesota , and at the First Congregationalist Church of Los Angeles , which was in a building so large that the organ had two sets of pipes , one in front and one in back .
When Bradshaw arrived in Los Angeles , the church was all - white .
When he left three years later , it was fully integrated and offered Sunday school classes in seven languages .
He developed a talent for fundraising and had a reputation as a troubleshooter .
The Board of Trustees at Lees College in Kentucky were impressed enough by his work in the church that they invited him to be the college president .
Later , he became president of Patricia Stevens College in St. Louis .
" I had the background , " Bradshaw says wryly .
" I was a scholar of demonology . "
" He 's very modest , " says his friend Dan Schlafly , a history professor at Saint Louis University .
" He saved Patricia Stevens College from bankruptcy . "
Bradshaw seldom discussed demonology during those years .
" We were a long way removed from the Second World War , " he says .
" Life in the United States was good .
Everything was nice and polite .
Demons were haywire . "
Still , he continued to read about demons .
" Gradually over a period of time , there became no question in my mind that there was a cosmic battle going on .
If you do n't understand that , you ca n't understand demonology , " he says .
Four years ago , with the encouragement of a few friends , including Schlafly , Bradshaw decided to write a book to teach laypeople demonology .
It would , he decided , take the form of a novel .
" My dear , dear grandmother loved me , " he says , " and was so interested in what I was learning , but she always seemed to go to sleep when I was talking to her .
I decided to put what I knew into a format that would n't make people go to sleep .
People remember stories . "
Sinister Among
Us follows Brad Green , president of fictitious Cyprus College , as he investigates an inexplicable series of crimes around campus that he comes to suspect may have been instigated by demons , or , rather , one demon- possessed individual .
Since its release last September , the book 's sales have been modest , but it has earned praise as both a novel and as an introduction to demonology .
" The theology and history are correct , " says Schlafly , who teaches a course on church history .
" You ca n't say that about Dan Brown . "
I 've seen people of all walks of life who have been possessed by the devil , " Bradshaw says , sitting up straight in his office chair .
" There 's no other reasonable explanation .
Sometimes they do heinous things , like Hitler or Saddam Hussein .
Sometimes they 're just plain foolish .
" Who ruins their career over ten , fifteen thousand dollars ?
It 's not chicken feed , but it wo n't make a dent in your legal fees .
Politicians , especially .
So many get caught doing things they should n't have .
Eliot Spitzer .
Lord , how can you figure a man that smart could be that dumb ? "
The devil , Bradshaw goes on , likes to target people who have power and influence over others .
He will also sometimes go after people who have great potential to do good to make sure it remains unfulfilled .
Of course , as Bradshaw points out , " It 's hard to tell when someone is being very , very human and when someone is possessed .
It 's like a stomachache .
Any number of things could be wrong .
You have to consider the symptoms . "
Is the skin on the patient 's face unusually tight and smooth ?
Does he speak with a machine gun-like delivery and make hand gestures that have little to do with what he 's saying ?
Does he have moments of unusual strength ?
Is he suddenly fluent in foreign languages he never studied ?
Does he speak in tongues ?
Can he foretell the future ?
Is he paranoid ?
Does he have horrible nightmares ?
These are all signs , says Bradshaw , which may indicate a supernatural element at work .
Bradshaw will always shy away from making a diagnosis that a person is possessed — unless he brings it up first .
" It 's a belief so bizarre and unbelievable , especially in 21st - century America .
If I were to suggest a person were possessed by a demon , it would cut off our rapport .
A person has to want to be exorcised , like an alcoholic going to AA .
It would have to be the right time and the right place . "
Lately , Bradshaw has received a number of phone calls from people who wonder if various catastrophes in the world are the work of demons .
" In good times , people do n't pay much attention to evil spirits .
When life is hard , interest spikes .
But you can't always blame it on Satan . "
Nonetheless , the rising interest in demons had led to some practical action on the part of the Roman Catholic Church .
Pope John Paul II and his successor Benedict XVI both declared war on demons and decreed that each diocese would have at least one trained exorcist on staff .
The Archdiocese of St. Louis did not respond to phone inquiries about its own exorcists .
Father Timothy Horner , a former headmaster at the Saint Louis Priory School , is not surprised .
" In St. Louis , they have two exorcists , " he says .
" But they like to keep their identities quiet .
Otherwise , they would be deluged with calls , people saying , ' My son is out of line , my daughter is out of line , my husband — they must be possessed ! ' "
A pastor observes certain rules of discretion .
He does not betray confidences , even to his wife .
In William Bradshaw 's case , that reticence extends to his encounters with demons .
He has participated in several exorcisms , but refuses to describe them in any detail .
" Some things are private matters , " he says .
" I do n't capitalize on them . "
A few of the exorcised still live nearby and he does n't want to expose them to public scrutiny .
" Each exorcism is different , " he adds .
" There are different people and different spirits with different personalities .
Sometimes the demon leaves right away .
But with an exorcism that takes two , three , four , five , six days , you see a progression and then you move back .
Satan 's not going to roll over and play dead .
It 's like a game of chess .
A good exorcist will have someone with a different approach as backup . "
A typical exorcism team will include at least two exorcists , a psychologist and a medical doctor .
The first recorded exorcism , says Father Timothy Horner , takes place in Acts of the Apostles 19:14 .
It was an unmitigated disaster , with the demon attacking the exorcists and chasing them away .
" So many people think they can do an exorcism with no experience , " Bradshaw says .
" There 's a lot of danger .
An exorcist needs to be trained and qualified .
The Roman Catholics are best at it .
They have procedures for teaching how to do it . "
Catholics have a written liturgy for performing exorcisms and the Church keeps transcripts and videotapes of all exorcisms on file .
" The Church takes exorcism seriously , " says Father Horner .
" It treats it very carefully .
Not anybody can get into it .
The bishop chooses a person who is good and prayerful and has some knowledge of psychology .
But goodness is the first thing required .
The demon could jump out at you and say , ' You 're no better than you should be . '
If that happens , you should take to your heels as fast as you can . "
A typical exorcism begins with a " deliverance , " a series of prayers accompanied by soft music .
" It gets the person in a certain spiritual mood , " Bradshaw explains .
" It also gets the exorcism team psyched up . "
Then the battle begins .
" A demon will very frequently use the voice of the person .
You think it 's the person talking .
They use the body , the mind , the strength , the personality .
It wo n't always have the same tone .
Sometimes it 's trying to soft - soap you and make a good impression .
Or it 'll try to scare the living daylights out of you . "
The key element in any exorcism is that the possessed person has to want to be rid of the demon .
" The average possessed person does n't like himself and the things he does , " Bradshaw says .
" He 's so relieved when it 's over .
But he 's still spiritually weak .
He needs to get counseling and help and be on guard against not allowing the demon back in his life . "
Not all possessed people are correctly diagnosed and not all exorcisms are successful .
" The great majority of demon - possessed people are never diagnosed , " Bradshaw says .
" They go see doctors about depression and outbursts and so forth , and they go from person to person to person .
They get diagnosed with mental and emotional problems and have unhappy lives . "
Still , Bradshaw will not hold demons responsible for all the world 's evil .
" Some scholars say that everything bad is caused by Satan , if you get hit by a car , if you slip and fall .
I do not agree with this — it takes away all individual responsibility .
" Many people think they can play with the devil and get by .
There 's a certain enjoyment that comes from living on the edge and doing things you should n't and getting by .
But who would go to a wedding and rape the bride ?
How can any human person be that cruel ?
Sometimes you have to believe there 's an ultrahuman source at work . "

It ’s frustrating when sophisticated surveillance technology is circumvented by robbers who use a not - so - sophisticated baseball cap to shield their face .
Retailers can reclaim the edge with StealthVue ’s PennyCam , a hidden camera that provides upwardly - angled pictures of anyone who approaches the counter , delivering a clear , identifiable view of their face .
The PennyCam is concealed within a Take - A - Penny , Leave - A - Penny tray , and connects to a DVR using a standard BNC cable , which can be run underneath the counter .
The USD $ 199 unit is powered by a 12vdc adapter , and delivers 500x582 pixel images with its 1/3 ” Sony CCD Image Sensor .
Dense clusters of crack - like structures called deformation bands form the linear ridges in this Mars image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
A NASA probe has spotted hundreds of small surface fracturesnear Mars ' equator that may have acted as underground natural plumbing tochannel groundwater billions of years ago .
Geologists compare the fractures in the sandstone rockdeposits on Mars to features called deformation bands on Earth , which can arisefrom the influence of groundwater in the underground bedrock .
The bands andfaults have strong influences on groundwater movement on Earth , and seem tohave played the same role on Mars .
Other research has examined how surfacewater fromrain or snow shaped the planet surface , but many agree that groundwater hasan equally important influence .
" Groundwater often flows along fractures such asthese , and knowing that these are deformation bands helps us understand how theunderground plumbing may have worked within these layered deposits , " saidChris Okubo , a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Ariz . who headed up a new study of the Martian fractures .
The observations , made by NASA 's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter ( MRO ) , showed how water has already changed the color and texture ofthe Martian sandstone along the fractures .
Okubo 's report on the finding isdetailed online this month in the journal Geological Society of AmericaBulletin .
" This study provides a picture of not just surfacewater erosion , but true groundwater effects widely distributed over theplanet , " said Suzanne Smrekar , deputy project scientist for MRO at NASA 'sJet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , who was not part of the study .
" Groundwater movement has important implications for how the temperatureand chemistry of the crust have changed over time , which in turn affects thepotential for habitatsfor past life . "
Okubo and his study coauthors looked to similar patternsin Utah sandstones on Earth , where fractures are typically a few yards wide andup to several miles long .
Such cracks reveal themselves as the rock layers ontop erode away .
MRO found similar fractures in a 43 - mile - wide ( 70 - km - wide ) crater that sits just slightly north of the red planet 's equator .
Discovery ofthe deformation bands within the crater prompted scientists to name it afterCharles Capen , a late astronomer who worked at observatories in SouthernCalifornia and Flagstaff , Ariz .
" These structures are important sites for futureexploration and investigations into the geologicalhistory of water and water - related processes on Mars , " Okubo andco-authors stated in their study .

With the advent of Web 2.0 a new concept became the most sought - after technology for web applications .
Popularized by Google ’s GMail , rich internet applications or RIA very quickly became the need of the hour .
At the heart of RI applications was JavaScript , a scripting language for the web , that was in existence long before Google was even born .
Google , with its GMail , demonstrated what could be achieved with JavaScript and thus paved the way for the next generation of web applications .
JavaScript had its own problems .
The biggest of them was probably cross - browser compatibility .
Led by Microsoft through its Internet Explorer web browser , JavaScript quickly became a victim of non-standard usage .
Microsoft , in order to prove its dominance over Netscape , supplied browser objects and functions that could be used to generate ‘ cool ’ effects in a web page easily .
These were never ratified by any standards bodies .
Since Microsoft was dominant on the desktop and also bundled IE with its Windows operating system , the exponential growth of IE in popularity apparently vindicated their arrogant violation of established standards .
Netscape died under Microsoft ’s onslaught and so did the standards of JavaScript .
Developers started writing applications that were IE specific .
It was not uncommon to see applications labeled “ Best viewed in Microsoft Internet Explorer ” .
The arrival of Mozilla ’s Firefox web browser changed all this .
Users , plagued by IE ’s numerous vulnerabilities and instability , adapted to Firefox .
Firefox implemented a more standards compliant version of JavaScript .
So developers started writing rich applications that used standards compliant JavaScript .
Even then there was one more problem with JavaScript and that came to the forefront due to RIAs .
This was performance .
Some of the leading vendors saw an opportunity in this short coming of JavaScript .
Notable amongst them is Adobe and more recently Microsoft .
Adobe ’s
Flash technology was initially meant to serve the multimedia needs of web applications .
Flash was great for animations and effects , for video and audio playback , for slide shows and image manipulations , but it was never meant for rich internet applications .
So enter Adobe Flex , a technology based on Flash , but offering widgets and controls for business applications .
Cross - browser compatibility was achieved but at the cost of an added Flash plug - in .
Not to be undone by Adobe , Microsoft entered into the fray with its Silverlight software .
Silverlight did all the cools things that Flash did and also needed a plug - in to run .
It seemed like JavaScript was doomed .
Mozilla and Google had different plans .
Mozilla ’s Firefox 3.1 browser , still in testing , and Google ’s recent Chrome web browser breathed a new life into JavaScript applications .
In Google Chrome , Google introduced the V8 JavaScript virtual machine that offered significant performance boosts for existing applications .
Mozilla has incorporated the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine that has reportedly achieved performance boosts of up to 85 % !!!
With these two products JavaScript is surely set to make a come back .
As things stand , JavaScript has overcome its two worst adversaries – cross browser compatibility and performance .
With the availability of brilliant libraries like Yahoo UI Toolkit , Dojo toolkit , etc. that help ease development of RIAs , JavaScript is here to stay and the way to go for future applications .

Underscoring the severity of of an exotic form of website bug , security researchers from Princeton University have cataloged four cross -site request forgeries in some of the world 's most popular sites .
The most serious vulnerability by far was in the website of global financial services company ING Direct .
The flaw could have allowed an attacker to transfer funds out of a user 's account , or to create additional accounts of behalf of a victim , according to this post from Freedom to Tinker blogger Bill Zeller .
The vulnerabilities were confirmed for users of Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers , and ING 's use of the secure sockets layer protocol did nothing to prevent the attack .
ING plugged the hole after Zeller and colleague Ed Felton reported it privately .
Cross - site request forgery ( CSRF ) vulnerabilities occur when a website carries out an action without first confirming it was requested by the authenticated user .
Miscreants can exploit this shortcoming by including code on an attack site that causes the user 's browser to send commands to a site such as ING.com .
ING.com then carries out the command under the mistaken notion that because it was requested by the browser , it was invoked by the user .
" The vulnerabilities in the websites are severe , demonstrating the pervasiveness and importance of CSRF protection , " Jeremiah Grossman , CTO of White Hat Security and an expert in website security , said of the report .
Another CSRF flaw resides on the website of The New York Times and is troubling for the amount of time webmasters of the site have allowed it to persist .
According to the researchers , it allows attackers to learn the address of arbitrary users by automatically initiating a feature that allows users to email NYT stories .
NYT personnel were alerted to the problem a year ago this month , but it has yet to be fixed .
" When a user visits the attacker 's page , an email will be sent to the attacker 's email address containing the user 's email address , " Zeller wrote .
" This attack can be used for identification ( e.g. , finding the email address of all uses who visit an attacker 's site ) or for spam . "
The attack is all the more appealing given the large number of people who have NYT accounts and the fact that users may stay logged in for over a year .
The remaining two CSRF holes were in YouTube and MetaFilter .
The flaws allowed attackers to do things including changing the owner 's email address , adding or deleting friends and sending messages on the owner 's behalf .
Both YouTube and MetaFilter have fixed the errors .
In a more detailed paper ( PDF ) , Zeller and Felton outline steps people can take to prevent getting bitten by CSRF bugs .
One is client - side approach in the form of a plugin for the Firefox browser .
We 've yet to use it , but it looks intriguing .
The other is server - side plugin for the PHP MVC framework Code Igniter . ®

These are all sacred mantras that we must have heard sometime or the other in our lives .
The first one is a Tibetan mantra and the remaining three are Sanskrit mantras .
These are just a few examples of mantras .
There a thousands of mantras that are used by Seekers to progress on the path of their Spiritual journey .
Mantras are primarily used for the purpose of Chanting .
Chanting ( Jap ) is the incessant repetition of a syllable or a specific set of words known as mantra in Sanskrit .
Each word is built on a unique tone and it has its own sound vibration .
When a word is spoken , sung or whispered , it affects the listener and also the person who utters the mantra .
In Chanting , the repetition of the words is not the objective , although most of the religious people think it is .
The purpose of chanting is to move from words to silence , from words to wordlessness and not to become a living tape or a parrot .
Its easy to get astray and just conclude that chanting mantra is just another mechanical activity , if the right technique is not known .
Sound is a form of energy .
This has also been proven scientifically that sound is just another form of energy .
Try this small experiment – Place your index and middle finger on your neck .
Say “ ah ” as loud as possible .
Then repeat the same word softly .
Now , what is felt inside the throat through your fingers is the vibration of the vocal chords .
As the vocal chords vibrate , the sound is created .
In Chanting Meditation , a word or a set of words is used .
First they are chanted aloud and then gently as the chanter moves deeper and deeper into silence .
Finally the mantra is allowed to resonate on its own .
This progress from words into silence results in calmness and peace which is beyond time and space .
Immense Tranquility is experienced .
The mind gets submerged into this silence and one enters No - Mind state .
Thoughts cease and loose their grip over the mind .
The mind becomes like a clean slate and become free of all negative conditionings .
Satisfaction and benediction that ’s beyond the realms of words arise from within and the seeker is bathing in the nectar of the divine bliss .
Chanting is also used for invocation of deities in Tantra , and also in the path of Devotion .
Chanting of Mantras has got varied objectives .
For the Vedanta student , chanting is done to progress from mind to No - Mind .
A mantra can be compared with laser technology , which can be used for aerospace , medical surgeries , medical operations , entertainment , computer technology , military uses , drama and arts or for making laser beam games for children .
Its uses are limitless .
Chanting of mantras also has a huge impact on the various chakras or the subtle energy centers of the body .
They awaken depending on which mantra is used .
Some mantras with certain syllables have more impact on the heart center , while others have profound impact on the navel center and others help in the awakening of the mind center or the center of super intelligence .
The Contemporary Enlightened Mystic Master – Anandmurti Gurumaa has given various methods of chanting which are available in pre-recorded tapes and CDs .
They offer immense help and much needed guidance to the students and seekers into the nuances of chanting .
Thus the domain that was once reserved only for highly advance seekers and mysterious esoteric sects , has now been made open for anyone who wishes to dive into the deeper realms of his own being .
Chanting is one of the most ancient and powerful means of inner awakening .
It has been highly praised by all the sacred scriptures too .
All religions of the world like Hinduism , Islam , Christianity and others have used the hidden power of sound and Mantras for achieving unparalled spiritual growth .
It is an easy means and the Masterkey to unlock the doors to paradise .
The next U.S. president will be confronted with slow growth , high unemployment and an economy teetering toward recession , say 51 private economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal .
If they are correct , pumping up the economy will the first challenge facing either Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain .
That is likely to place tax cuts and government spending high on Washington 's agenda , and push back costly measures such as reforming health care and fighting global warming .

Back in February I pointed out that despite all the talk of a credit crunch commercial and industrial loans were at an all - time high and increasing .
At the time , Paul Krugman and others responded that this was just temporary as firms drew on previously existing lines of credit .
Well here we are in September and bank credit continues to look very robust .
As Robert Higgs points out consumer loans are up , commercial and industrial loans are up , even real estate loans are up .
Overall , total bank credit is up with just a slight sign of leveling off in recent weeks .
So where is the credit crunch ?
A credit crunch does exist in the sector of the market based on short - term , asset backed securities .
In addition , interbank lending is unusually risky .
But in light of what I have just said the " credit crunch " takes on a new meaning and potential new solutions are suggested .
The first question I have is this .
Investment banks were selling these securities and using the money to lend to whom ?
I do not know the answer .
But let ’s suppose that the money being raised in these markets was being lent to productive businesses .
If so , then any solution should focus on feeding those businesses that are starved for credit .
I look at the situation as follows .
Banks are bridges between savers and investors .
Some of these bridges have collapsed .
But altogether too much attention is being placed on fixing the collapsed bridges .
Instead we should be thinking about how to route more savings across the bridges that have not collapsed .
Government lending may be one way of doing this but why lend to prop up the broken bridges ?
Instead , why not lend directly to the investors who are in need of funds ?
After all , if these investors exist and have valuable projects that ’s where the money is !
Let the broken bridges collapse , taking the shoddy builders with them .
Instead focus on the finding and rescuing the victims of any credit crunch , the investors who need funds .
Now here is a hypothesis .
It may be that there just are n’t that many firms in need of funds .
First , one reason that bank lending is up may be that firms with good projects have already turned to the substitute bridge of ordinary bank loans .
Second , I wonder how much real lending was actually being generated by asset backed securities .
Could it not be that most of the funds generated were used to buy more asset backed securities ?
( The growth in these securities is certainly suggestive of that possibility ) .
If that is the case then it explains why the real economy has been remarkably resilient to the " credit crunch . "
Now perhaps I am wrong about all this .
Bernanke has access to a lot more data than I do and he seems very worried .
I ’d still like to know , however , which credit - worthy firms are credit starved .
And I ’d suggest that we ought to think more about alternative bridges that will connect credit - starved firms with savers .
A typical desktop computer user will almost always need an office suite .
A typical Windows user has to empty their wallet just to pay for that over - priced Microsoft Office .
A typical Linux user will just use the office suite that comes with their distro free of charge .
There are actually 5 known free and open source office suites that work best in Linux .
They are :
GNOME Office
GNOME
Office is an office suite for GNOME desktop environment .

The Paulson - Bernanke plan to rescue troubled financial institutions by buying up mortgage assets has been underway for several weeks , according to a person familiar with the plans .
Although the plan was announced suddenly — and perhaps earlier than planned — it had been under development for quite some time , with its seeds sown inside the Treasury Department offices at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue shortly after Bear Stearns collapsed .
In recent weeks , as the plan began to be regarded as a pre-emptive version of the Resolution Trust Corporation , the Treasury began approaching former officials from the RTC to see if they would take a role in the bailout plan .
The RTC was created in 1989 to sell off assets of thrifts that had gone bust .
One former senior RTC official approached in late August declined to join the Paulson - Bernanke plan , a person close to the former official said .
There ’s at least some hint that the Treasury might have sought to use the former RTC officials as window dressing .
The Hanky Panke Plan ( short for Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke plan ) is being presented as an updated version of the RTC , which obscures crucial differences between the plans .
Most importantly , the RTC sold off assets of thrifts that had already failed while the Treasury ’s bailout plan wants to buy assets from financial institutions that are n’t convinced they are in danger of failing .
Having former RTC officials running the show might have helped distract from the unprecedented aspects of the Hanky Panke Plan .
Nervous investors dumped shares in Apple last night on concerns over weakening profit margins and persistent rumours about the health of the technology company 's founder , Steve Jobs .
Apple 's quarterly profits soared 31 % to $ 1.07bn as customers snapped up record numbers of Mac computers , iPods and iPhones .
But the California company provided cautious guidance to Wall Street on its prospects for the rest of the year and offered little to quell speculation surrounding Jobs , whose gaunt appearance drew comment at a recent industry conference .
When asked about Jobs ' health during a call with analysts last night , Apple 's chief financial officer , Peter Oppenheimer , said : " Steve loves Apple .
He serves as CEO at the pleasure of Apple 's board and has no plans to leave Apple .
Steve 's health is a private matter . "
In unofficial trading after the close of the stockmarket , Apple 's shares slumped 11 % to $ 148 .
Jobs , 53 , is considered the driving force behind the company 's consistent innovation .
He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer five years ago but has recovered .
When Jobs ' apparent weight loss was noted last month , Apple said he was taking antibiotics for a minor " bug " .
The New York Post revived the issue yesterday by quoting unnamed industry and financial sources expressing concern .
Investors have long been worried about the lack of an obvious succession plan at Apple .
The issue surfaced last year when Jobs ' position was briefly threatened by a scandal over improper pricing of executive share options .
Questions about the entrepreneur proved a distraction from second - quarter figures which revealed Mac sales had rocketed 41 % year on year to 2.5 m computers , and iPod sales were 12 % higher to 11 m globally .
Apple sold 717,000 of its touch - screen iPhones during the three months to June .
But the company said margins were likely to weaken because of a series of factors including a " back to school " promotion and an unspecified product launch which is being kept strictly under wraps .
The technology company opened 16 Apple stores during the period and this week unveiled its first outlet in Beijing .
Since John McCain so desperately and obviously wanted to change the subject , permit me to begin by not taking the bait and not changing the subject .
Wednesday was the worst day of the campaign for McCain .
The revelations about Rick Davis ' firm doing lobbying work for Freddie Mac had the potential , and still may have the potential , to cost Davis his job .
Certainly the story had the potential to eat up a lot of cable television time over the next two days .
Over the long term , and most importantly , the story has the power , if used properly by the Democrats , to dissolve any morsel of credibility McCain had on the subject of dealing with the current fiscal crisis .
So keep that straight .
The cable coverage of McCain 's ridiculous gambit about suspending his campaign and delaying Friday night 's debate is not making that link explicit , because that 's just not the sort of thing television does except when it really slaps them in the face , like when Bill Clinton bombed Sudan the night the House of Representatives voted the impeachment articles .
But I can guarantee you , if you think the McCain brain trust was n't manically trying to conjure up a way to wriggle out of the Davis mess and hand the media a new story to yak about , then I have a non -bridge in Alaska to non-sell you .
This was also the day when the Washington Post and ABC released a poll showing McCain nine points behind Barack Obama .
On Hardball , Chris Matthews is , to his credit , making this connection : that McCain is changing the subject because he 's dropping in the polls .
In fact the desperation of McCain 's move makes one think that maybe his own internal polls show a gloomier picture still .
What a joke .
What an unserious and contemptible joke .
And so typically dishonest .
Now that Obama has spoken , we know that it was Obama who called McCain , first suggesting that the two issue a bipartisan joint statement on the crisis .
This obviously got McCain and Steve Schmidt thinking .
Hey , maybe we can put country first here and … oops , scratch that .
Since we 're in such a tight spot today anyway , maybe we can put naked politics first here and go public , steal his thunder , act like we were the white hats who came up with the idea .
Yeah !
And while we 're at it , let 's take it a step further .
Let 's don the sack cloth of piety and insist that we feel this is so important we even think the debate should be suspended .
Think about the kind of mind that 's required to even think up something like this .
I could never think up something like this .
Most average people , of whatever political persuasion , could never do it .
Some pundits are talking about desperation and Hail Mary passes and so on , but that does n't really begin to describe the deviousness at work here .
This is like a man who gets caught cheating on his wife and then , with his back against the wall and with confrontation looming , goes out and intentionally wrecks the car , contriving to break a few ribs and get rushed to the hospital , all to delay the inevitable conflict and in the cynical knowledge that , in front of the doctors and until the wounds are bound , the wife will be forced to offer sympathy .
Males are messed up creatures , but believe me , only a rather small percentage of us is really capable of thinking this connivingly .
Will it work ?
I do n't think so .
Granted , 98 % of Americans do n't know about the Rick Davis story , and probably around 90 % do n't know about the Washington Post poll .
So some people may buy it .
But I do n't believe most will .
It just looks too sneaky .
Even if one does n't smell desperation , the odor of weirdness is all over the move .
And it looks unpresidential .
Obama came out and looked presidential .
Presidents need to be able to handle two problems at once , he said .
Now is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from us .
We both have big planes .
They can get us from Washington to Mississippi pretty quickly if need be .
His press conference offered , in fact , a good look at how he would be as president .
He seeks non-confrontation .
But he slips his points in steadily and coolly .
Pretty smooth performance .
And he seems to be winning .
Perhaps inevitably , one polling outfit did a snap poll on all this .
Results ?
Hold the debate as scheduled : 50 %
Hold it but focus on the economy not foreign policy : 36 % .
Postpone : 10 % .
Suspend campaigns : 14 %
Continue campaign : 31 %
Re-focus campaign : 48 %
Oopsie .
The commission on presidential debates stated shortly after Obama spoke that the debate will go on .
If the commission says it and Obama says it , it will go on , I suspect .
But we have yet to see which chess piece McCain moves next .
Who can imagine that ?
Think of the most cynical thing you can think of , then double it .
Abraham Lincoln ran for re-election while leading the Union troops in the civil war .
Franklin Roosevelt ran for re-election in the midst of terrible depression in 1936 , a far worse economic crisis than we have right now , and in 1944 while prosecuting the second world war .
If John McCain can't debate while thinking about the country 's economy , then he 's even more ill - equipped to hold the job than I think he is .
But of course he is capable of doing both .
His proposal is not serious .
It is just a rancidly political act .
That he goes before cameras and tries to pass it off as nonpolitical , hoping that people will buy it , is what makes it contemptible .
When Mario Cuomo was governor of New York , he devoted a speech to improving the lot of children in New York state .
He declared " The decade of the child . "
When , after a year or two , it became clear that somehow child poverty rates had stayed more or less the same , a joke began circulating around Albany : but he did n't mean this decade .
We 've reached a similar point today , but far worse , because Cuomo 's intentions were at least decent .
John McCain 's intentions have to do with nothing loftier than the next news cycle .
He is the man who said country first .
He just did n't mean this country .

Byrd expressed outrage at the “ appalling ” mismanagement of funds .
“ Tens of billions of taxpayer dollars are lost , … gone ! ” he cried , his outrage visibly building as he spoke .
“ How many minutes have passed since Jesus Christ was born ?
A billion !
So , that ’s a lot of money ! …
This is a failure of leadership .
Individuals think they can get away with bilking — they ’re not just milking — bilking the U.S. and Iraqi governments … taking bribes , substituting inferior workmanship , or plain , old - fashioned stealing !
Stealing ! ” he exclaimed .
Byrd cited a April 2007 GAO report ( .pdf ) that concluded , among other things , that the Pentagon “ lacks clear and comprehensive guidance and leadership for managing and overseeing contractors ” and “ does not have a sufficient number of oversight personnel to ensure that contracts that are in place are carried out efficiently and according to contract requirements . ”
To illustrate the scale of the waste and fraud , the report estimates that the Army Material Command loses about $ 43 million each year solely on the provision of free meals to contractors who also get per diem food allowances .
Another GAO report ( .pdf ) , released in May 2007 , found that the amount of money obligated in DOD contracts for support services “ exceeded the amount the department spent on supplies and equipment , including major weapons systems . ”
[ Emphasis added . ]
And with all this money being spent , often under cost - plus arrangements ( the more a contractor spends on expenses , the more it collects in fees ) , the scale of abuse , fraud , and “ plain , old - fashioned stealing ” has been historic .
We still do not know exactly how much money has been lost , and we may never know .
But last year , the Defense Contract Audit Agency identified $ 4.9 billion wasted on overcharging or fraud , and an additional $ 5.1 billion spent without any documentation .
Since only a sampling of contracts have yet been audited , the murky waters of corruption remain largely undisturbed .
This is something neither Byrd nor his Appropriations Committee colleague , Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy , will abide .
Leahy , in particular , told the witnesses that he ’s interested in “ seeing some people go to jail ” for the contract abuses in Iraq .
Only then , he argued , is there likely to be a chilling effect on contractor fraud and corruption .
So far , though , given the scale of the problem , the penalties imposed for such abuses can be described as modest at best .
The Pentagon ’s new acting inspector general , Gordon Heddell , took office just a few days ago .
But in this morning ’s testimony , he was predictably sanguine about his department ’s prospects at reigning things in , proudly enumerating its past successes to the committee .
Watching it , one got the feeling that his statistics - laden monotone was designed to put the senators to sleep so they would n’t take notice of how laughably inadequate enforcement efforts have been .
Remember now , the amount of taxpayer dollars lost or stolen is somewhere in the tens of billions .
That being noted , Heddell told the committee that Defense Criminal Investigative Service has targeted 286 people in 124 separate investigations related to U.S. military operations in southwest Asia , and 32 cases have already reached the courts .
So far , so good , right ?
Well , since the wars began only 22 people have been indicted on contract fraud , resulting in only 32 felony convictions .
And wait , it gets better : those convictions have resulted in a combined total of just 54 years in prison , 44 years of probation , 10 debarments at four companies , and 28 suspensions .
All told , the federal government has received $ 13.5 million in restitution , $ 1.76 million in forfeitures , and seized an additional $ 2.65 million in assets .
Fines and penalties imposed amount to just shy of $ 350,000 .
So , for the tens of billions ( with a “ b ” ) that have vanished into the sinkhole , the federal government has recovered a total of just $ 17 million and sentenced violators to minimal prison terms .
Still , Heddell told senators , his office “ is on a firm footing to provide the necessary oversight . ”
The numbers speak for themselves .
A PIG WITHOUT LIPSTICK ….
I ’ve been trying to find a credible voice on fiscal matters that believes the Bush administration ’s bailout is a good idea , and should be approved by Congress without alteration .
I ca n’t find one .
The plan seems to suffer more as the scrutiny grows more intense , but I ’d go with the accountability / oversight problem as the most glaring .
The Bush administration sought unchecked power from Congress to buy $ 700 billion in bad mortgage investments from financial companies in what would be an unprecedented government intrusion into the markets .
Through his plan , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson aims to avert a credit freeze that would bring the financial system and the world ’s largest economy to a standstill .
The bill would prevent courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority .
“ He ’s asking for a huge amount of power , ” said Nouriel Roubini , an economist at New York University .
“ He ’s saying , ‘ Trust me , I ’m going to do it right if you give me absolute control . ’
This is not a monarchy . ”
Atrios , after noting the $ 700 billion price tag , highlights this portion of the proposal : “ Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . ”
If we were dealing with a competent , capable administration , which had proven itself reliable in dealing with fiscal and budgetary policy , it would still be an extraordinary gamble to turn over hundreds of billions of dollars with no strings at all .
But we ’re dealing with the Bush administration , which has n’t exactly earned the benefit of the doubt .
I can understand the underlying point here .
Companies showed some spectacularly bad judgment and bought up some ugly mortgages .
To keep those companies from imploding , Paulson wants to use our money to take those mortgages off their hands .
If the administration had a plan to buy them up for a song , the approach need not be completely ridiculous , though Paulson has not yet so much as hinted about pricing , or how , exactly , his plan might actually work in practice .
But that ’s why some safeguards — you know , checks and balances — seems like it might be helpful in a case like this .
As the plan is currently written , not only will oversight be discouraged , it ’ll be impossible , by design .
Congress is supposed to hand over in upwards of a trillion dollars to Bush ’s economic team , and then voluntarily forfeit the right to oversee how the money is spent .
If there ’s a good reason to establish this kind of process , it ’s hiding well .
August 13 , 2008 – Oakland , Calif . –
A new study conducted by researchers at Children 's Hospital & Research Center Oakland shows that a century - old drug , methylene blue , may be able to slow or even cure Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease .
Used at a very low concentration – about the equivalent of a few raindrops in four Olympic - sized swimming pools of water - the drug slows cellular aging and enhances mitochondrial function , potentially allowing those with the diseases to live longer , healthier lives .
A paper on the methylene blue study , conducted by Hani Atamna , PhD , and a his team at Children's , was published in the March 2008 issue of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB ) Journal .
Dr. Atamna 's research found that methylene blue can prevent or slow the decline of mitochondrial function , specifically an important enzyme called complex IV .
Because mitochondria are the principal suppliers of energy to all animal and human cells , their healthy function is critical .
" The results are very encouraging , " said Dr. Atamna .
" We 'd eventually like to try to prevent the physical and cognitive decline associated with aging , with a focus on people with Alzheimer 's disease .
One of the key aspects of Alzheimer 's disease is mitochondrial dysfunction , specifically complex IV dysfunction , which methylene blue improves .
Our findings indicate that methylene blue , by enhancing mitochondrial function , expands the mitochondrial reserve of the brain .
Adequate mitochondrial reserve is essential for preventing age - related disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease . "
Also impressed is one of Dr. Atamna 's co-authors , Bruce Ames , PhD , a senior scientist at Children 's and world - renowned expert in nutrition and aging " What we potentially have is a wonder drug . " said Dr. Ames .
" To find that such a common and inexpensive drug can be used to increase and prolong the quality of life by treating such serious diseases is truly exciting . "
Methylene blue , first discovered in 1891 , is now used to treat methemoglobinemia , a blood disorder .
But because high concentrations of methylene blue were known to damage the brain , no one thought to experiment with low concentrations .
Also , drugs such as methylene blue do not easily reach the brain .
Dr. Atamna 's research is the first to show that low concentrations of the drug have the ability to slow cellular aging in cultured cells in the laboratory and in live mice .
He believes methylene blue has the potential to become another commonplace low - cost treatment like aspirin , prescribed as a blood thinner for people with heart disorders .

Feisty ladies of The View grill McCain on campaign claims David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Saturday September 13 , 2008

Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain faced possibly his toughest media grilling of the campaign season by the hosts of ABC's The View yesterday , when he appeared accompanied by wife Cindy McCain .
McCain began explaining his choice of running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin by saying that she would help to reform Washington , specifically cited curbing federal spending for earmarks .
When pressed about Palin 's record of requesting and accepting such money for Alaska by host Barbara Walters , McCain ignored the record and said , " Not as governor she did n't . "
The show 's feisty female hosts took McCain to task regarding two recently debunked campaign ads attacking Senator Barack Obama , and erroneous claims that running mate Sarah Palin never sought money for lawmakers ' pet projects as Alaska governor .
Palin has sought nearly $ 200 million in earmarks this year alone .
Co-host Joy Behar asked McCain , " There are ads running from your campaign .
Now we know that those two ads are untrue , they are lies .
And yet , you say at the end of it say you approve these messages .
Do you really approve these ? "
" They 're not lies , " McCain said , insisting that Obama " chooses his words very carefully " and should not have made the lipstick remark .
Barbara
Walters then reminds him that he made a lipstick on a pig comment regarding Hillary , and McCain denies he was talking about Hillary , and says he was speaking of her health care plan .
Obama , as an Illinois state senator , voted in favor of legislation that would teach age appropriate sex education to kindergartners , including information on rejecting advances by sexual predators .
And while Obama told a campaign rally this week that electing McCain would be like " putting lipstick on a pig , " he never used the phrase in connection to Palin .
McCain reiterated his opposition to Roe vs. Wade , the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion rights .
" I believe Roe vs. Wade was a very bad decision , " said the senator drawing gasps along with some outright ' boos ' from the studio audience .
The show 's hosts also played a newly released video tape recording of McCain after he was released from the POW camp in Vietnam , and returned to the United States with fellow comrades .
Cindy McCain , joined her husband for the last part of the show , said she disagreed with Palin 's view that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest .
Cindy also refused to answer questions about how many homes the McCains own , by saying " That 's not part of this campaign , " We are fortunate to be able to live a good life and share with other people who are not so fortunate . "

In a neat marriage of science and art , researchers used x-rays from a particle accelerator to reveal an early portrait of a woman by Vincent Van Gogh , which the impoverished artist later painted over with a meadow scene .
The hidden image
bears a striking resemblance to a series of somber portraits the artist produced in the Dutch town of Nuenen , where he composed " The Potato Eaters , " completed in 1885 and regarded as his first major work [ Los Angeles Times ] .
An earlier analysis using conventional x-rays had shown the rough shape of a head hidden beneath the surface of a painting called " Patch of Grass , " but provided no details .
To get a clearer image , the researchers used high - intensity x-rays from a particle accelerator in Hamburg , Germany to compile a two - dimensional map of the metallic atoms on the painting beneath " Patch of Grass . " ...
Knowing that mercury atoms were part of a red pigment and the antimony atoms were part of a yellow pigment , they were able to chart those colors in the underlying image .
" We visualized — in great detail — the nose , the eyes , according to the chemical composition . " [ researcher Joris ]
Dik said .
Scanning a roughly 7 - inch square of the larger portrait took two full days [ AP ] .
Experts in van Gogh believe he often over - painted his work , doing so on about a third of his early works .
Art historians think van Gogh painted the peasant 's image while staying in the Dutch village of Nuenen in 1884 or 1885 [ Telegraph ] .
He later moved to Paris , and recycled the canvas in 1887 when he covered the woman 's face with a brighter and more Impressionistic scene .
The new imaging technique , described in a paper in the journal
Analytical Chem
istry [ subscription required ] , is an improvement over art historians ' previous method of using standard x-rays to look for another picture hidden beneath a painting 's surface , a process which results in a fuzzy black and white image .
However , the new technique is n't likely to become a common practice , as it requires the use of particle accelerator .

Transcript of full speech follows ( prepared remarks ) :
####
It s great to speak to you this morning .
Im sorry that I cant be there , but I did enjoy the opportunity to sit down with President Clinton recently in New York .
He has helped to create a model for individual responsibility and collective action through the Clinton Global Initiative .
CGI brings people together to take on tough , global challenges .
In four years , you have made concrete commitments that have affected over 200 million people in 150 countries .
And I applaud your new commitment to help 20 million poor children get a healthy meal .
It s time for us to come together to get this done .
You are meeting at a time of great turmoil for the American economy .
We are now confronted with a financial crisis as serious as any we have faced since the Great Depression .
Action must be taken to restore confidence in our economy .
Let me be clear : it s outrageous that we find ourselves in a position where taxpayers must bear the burden for the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street and Washington .
But we also know that a failure to act would have grave consequences for the jobs , and savings , and retirement of the American people .
Over the last few days , Ive been in close contact with Secretary Paulson and leaders in Congress .
Ive also had the opportunity to speak directly to the American people about what we need to do moving forward .
Ive laid out several clear principles that I believe must be a part of our response to this crisis .
First , we need to set up an independent board , selected by Democrats and Republicans , to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way .
Second , if American taxpayers finance this solution , they should be treated like investors .
That means Wall Street and Washington should give every penny of taxpayers  money back once this economy recovers .
Third , we cannot and will not simply bailout Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes .
They deserve a plan too .
Finally  and this is important  the American people should not be spending one dime to reward the same Wall Street CEOs whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess .
Congressional leaders have made progress in their negotiations , and appear close to a deal that would include these principles .
President Bush addressed some of these issues last night , and Im pleased that Senator McCain has decided to embrace them too .
Now is a time to come together  Democrats and Republicans  in a spirit of cooperation on behalf of the American people .
Later today , Ill be travelling to Washington to offer my help in getting this deal done .
Then , Ill travel to Oxford on Friday for the first of our presidential debates .
Our election is in 40 days .
Our economy is in crisis , and our nation is fighting two wars abroad .
The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Senator McCain about how we intend to lead our country .
The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold , or to ignore the full range of issues that the next President will face .
Since CGI is about deeds , not just words , let me tell you about four specific commitments that I will make on four issues that CGI has focused on  climate change , poverty , education , and health  if I have the opportunity to serve as President of the United States .
Heres how I approach these issues .
We live in a time when our destinies are shared .
The world is more intertwined than at any time in human history .
Walls that divided old enemies have come down .
Markets have opened .
The spread of information and technology has reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity , and opened doors to new competition and risk .
We have heard this time and again since the end of the Cold War .
And over the last few weeks , this truth has been reinforced anew .
In America , we have seen that there is no dividing line between the ability of folks to live their dreams on Main Street , and the bottom line of investment banks on Wall Street .
There is a lesson that cuts across this economic crisis .
Prosperity cannot be sustained if it shuts people out .
Growth cannot just come from the top down  it must come from the bottom up , with new jobs that pay good wages , and new innovation that creates opportunity across the globe .
And in the 21st century , we must also recognize that its not just prosperity that comes from the bottom up .
Our security is shared as well .
The carbon emissions in Boston or Beijing dont just pollute the immediate atmosphere  they imperil our planet .
Pockets of extreme poverty in Somalia can breed conflict that spills across borders .
The child who goes to a radical madrasa outside of Karachi can end up endangering the security of my daughters in Chicago .
A deadly flu that begins in Indonesia can find its way to Indiana within days .
Climate change .
Poverty .
Extremism .
Disease .
These problems offend our common humanity .
They also threaten our common security .
You know this .
The question is what we do about it .
We re not going to face these threats of the future by grasping at the ideas of the past .
In many cases , we know what we have to do .
We talk about the solutions year after year .
This must be the time when we choose not to wait any longer .
We must marshal the will .
We must see that none of these problems can be dealt with in isolation , nor can we deny one and effectively tackle another .
That s why youve come to CGI .
Because thats what this moment calls us to do .
No single issue sits at the crossroads of as many currents as energy .
Our dependence on oil and gas funds terror and tyranny ; it has forced families to pay their wages at the pump ; and it puts the future of our planet in peril .
This is a security threat , an economic albatross , and a moral challenge of our time .
The time to debate whether climate change is manmade has past  its time , finally , for America to lead .
The first commitment that Ill make today is setting a goal of an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
To do our part , well implement a cap - and - trade program so that theres a price for pollution , and resources to transform our energy economy .
Ive proposed an investment of $ 150 billion in alternative energy over ten years , which will create millions of jobs and break the cycle of our addiction to oil .
We need to do more than drill .
Now is the time to develop every form of alternative energy  solar , wind , and biofuels , as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe .
We need to raise fuel economy standards , put more plug - in hybrid cars on the road , and find new ways to be energy efficient .
Abroad , the United States must get off the sidelines .
Well reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new Global Energy Forum to lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols .
Well build an alliance of oil - importing nations , and work together to reduce our demand , and break the grip of OPEC .
And as we develop clean energy , we should share technology and innovations with the nations of the world .
This effort to confront climate change will be part of our strategy to alleviate poverty .
Because we know that it is the worlds poor who will feel  and who may already be feeling  the affect of a warming planet .
If we fail to act , famine could displace hundreds of millions , fueling competition and conflict over basic resources like food and water .
We all have a stake in reducing poverty .
There is suffering across the globe that doesnt need to be tolerated in the 21st century .
And it leads to pockets of instability that provide fertile breeding grounds for threats like terror and the smuggling of deadly weapons that cannot be contained by the drawing of a border or the distance of an ocean .
These arent simply disconnected corners of an interconnected world .
That is why the second commitment that I will make is embracing the Millennium Development Goals , which aim to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015 .
This will take more resources from the United States , and as President I will increase our foreign assistance to provide them .
But resources must be focused on the right priorities .
No one wants to put good money after bad , or ignore the underlying causes at the root of these problems .
We shouldnt just settle for a status quo  anywhere  where you cant start a business without paying a bribe .
Corruption wastes our tax dollars .
It also ruins lives .
This is a human rights issue , and we need to treat it like one .
We shouldnt help those in need without helping them help themselves .
Thats why Ill partner with the private sector in creating a new fund for Small and Medium Enterprise , so were investing in ideas that can create growth and jobs in the developing world .
Above all , we must do our part to see that all children have the basic right to learn .
There is nothing more disappointing than a child denied the hope that comes with going to school , and there is nothing more dangerous than a child who is taught to distrust and then to destroy .
That s why the third commitment Ill make is working to erase the global primary education gap by 2015 .
Every child  every boy , and every girl  should have the ability to go to school .
To ensure that our nation does its part to meet that goal , we need to establish a two billion dollar Global Education Fund .
And I look forward to signing the bipartisan Education for All Act that was first introduced by Hillary Clinton  a true champion for children .
Finally , we must continue the progress that s been made to advance the cause of global health .
Ive been proud to support the PEPFAR program .
I think President Bush  and many of you there today  have shown real leadership in the fight against HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria .
This is a fight that I will continue as President .
Disease stands in the way of progress on so many fronts .
It can condemn populations to poverty , and prevent a child from getting an education .
And yet far too many people still die of preventable illnesses .
Today , Id like to focus on one : malaria .
We have eliminated malaria in the United States , but nearly one million people around the world still die from a mosquito bite every year .
85 percent of the victims are African children under the age of 5 .
In Africa , a child dies from a mosquito bite every thirty seconds .
Beyond the devastating human toll , malaria weighs down public health systems , setting back global capacity to fight other disease .
So today , I want to join with the global malaria community that is meeting here in New York in making a new commitment : when I am President , we will set the goal of ending all deaths from malaria by 2015 .
It s time to rid the world of death from a disease that doesnt have to take lives .
The United States must lead , and when I am President we will step up our focus on prevention and treatment around the world to get this done .
The first project of my Small and Medium Enterprise fund will be investing in the developing worlds capacity to meet the demand for 730 million bednets .
Well also increase access to doctors and nurses through a new program 
Health Infrastructure 2020  that trains medical professionals in countries around the world , and gives them incentives to stay there .
And well invest in research and development into new vaccines , and ensure that low cost anti-malaria drugs are available everywhere .
This effort must bring together governments from around the world .
It must be a public - private partnership that draws on the resources , and ideas , and resilience of business and non-profits and faith groups .
It must be a cause for countless individuals , and a common goal that unites us all .
In short , the effort to eradicate malaria must draw on the spirit that drives not simply the commitments at CGI  but the commitment that is visible everywhere that people go to work to make their communities , their country , and our world a better place .
The scale of our challenges may be great .
The pace of change may be swift .
But we know that it need not be feared .
The landscapes of the 21st century are still ours to shape .
We see the potential for progress every time someone starts a job creating new energy , or an idea carries a community out of poverty ; we see it every time a girl walks through the doors of a new school , or a boy lives to see another day because he had a simple net around his bed .
These are the dreams that we must make our own .
We live in a time when our destinies are shared .
But our destinies will be written by us , not for us .
Now , it falls to us to get to work .

Using videos , photographs and building design documents , the investigators at the National Institute spent the last three years building an elaborate computer model of 7 World Trade Center that they used to test various chains of events to figure out what caused the collapse , Dr. Sunder said .
The investigators determined that debris from the falling twin towers damaged structural columns and ignited fires on at least 10 floors at 7 World Trade Center , which stood about 400 feet north of the twin towers .
But the structural damage from the falling debris was not significant enough to threaten the tower ’s stability , Dr. Sunder said .
The fires on six of the lower floors burned with particular intensity because the water supply for the sprinkler system had been cut off  the upper floors had a backup water supply  and the Fire Department , devastated by the collapse of the twin towers , stopped trying to fight the blaze .
Normally , fireproofing on a skyscraper should have been sufficient to allow such a blaze to burn itself out and leave the building damaged but still standing .
But investigators determined that the heat from the fire caused girders in the steel floor of 7 World Trade Center to expand .
As a result , steel beams underneath the floors that provided lateral support for the tower ’s structural columns began to buckle or put pressure against the vertical structural columns .
These fires might have been fed partly by the diesel from tanks and a pressurized fuel line , which were on the fifth to the ninth floors , Dr. Sunder said .
But the analysis showed that even in the worst case , the diesel fuel - fed fire would not have burned hot enough or long enough to have played a major role in weakening the structure .
The investigators determined that the fire that day was fed mainly by office paper and furnishings .
The collapse started when a girder on the 13th floor disconnected from a critical column  listed as Column 79  that supported a long open floor span , the report said .
Once that floor gave way , the floors below it down to the fifth floor also collapsed , although this was not visible from the building ’s exterior .
Without lateral support for nine stories , Column 79 buckled , and the floors above gave way all the way up to the roof .
Only then did the collapse become visible from the exterior with a penthouse area on the roof first falling in , followed by what looked like the sudden implosion of the tower , Dr. Sunder said .
“ The physics is consistent , it is sound , it has been analyzed , ” he said .

Smart CSS Ain’t Always Sexy CSS
In : Articles
By Martin Ringlein
There is an emerging desire to want to be sexy .
When it comes to our CSS , we all agree that being bloated , slow , and messy are less than attractive traits — but the CSS used in enterprise - wide and mass - adopted web applications , or those with significant daily unique visitors or websites that demand extreme extensibility and flexibility , being smart is n’t always being sexy .
In the endless struggle to truly separate presentation from structure , have we lost our way ?
Are the old - school advocates for CSS still pushing radical and unnecessary thinking to try and justify the mass - adoption of a technology that has already been massively adopted ?
Smart CSS is n’t always sexy CSS … and lets face it , when working with real world applications , smart is where you want to be .
Presentational meaning is meaningful
The separation of presentation from structure has always been the cornerstone of CSS best practice — but what about with respect to choosing semantic classes and ID attribute values ?
While it has been ingrained in us from the beginning not to use presentational attribute names such as class= " red " , there is in fact a time and place for attribute names that convey presentational meaning .
It is an intensely debated topic with little resolution ; what “ should ” we name it vs. what “ can ” we name it ?
There is value to be gained in utilizing presentationally meaningful markup — use internal standards to complement web - standards , and embrace the power of the cascade to create smart CSS .
Separate presentation from structure .
When did we become so afraid of maintaining , updating , and manipulating HTML ?
And when did the use of CSS become tied to the idea of never having to touch our markup ?
Fundamentally even those leading this movement towards having “ sexy ” stylesheets do n’t always practice what they preach ; most of the markup created by the ‘ best of the best ’ is a combination of presentational and structural .
Evaluate your own markup or the markup of those you admire most ; look for presentational language such as “ header ” , “ footer ” , and even “ sidebar ” .
It is there because it is smart , because it is meaningful and appropriate ; but it surely is n’t “ sexy ” .
There is presentational meaning throughout great markup ; utilizing CSS to its true potential does not mean being so vague as to be meaningless .
Many front - end developers are plagued with the question : “ What if ? ” What if the header of today is the footer of tomorrow , what if the sidebar of yesterday becomes the top bar of today ?
What if red text changes to green text ?
What if …
I ’ll tell you what if — when “ if ” comes ; you change !
It does n’t mean you make your CSS so vague and bloated that you never have to touch your HTML when “ if ” happens .
If your sidebar of yesterday does become your top bar of today , then it ’s most likely ( in fact almost certain ) that there is probably a larger , more fundamental shift in the website itself .
A shift significant enough that images , graphics , content , and yes , your precious HTML will need to be altered .
CSS , no matter how sexy , is not that powerful !
Presentational meaning can help bring clarity to mark - up , but smart CSS is more than just clarity ; it is about intelligent , logical consistency from which more meaning can be derived .
Creating Standards in a Web Standards World
We are working in and embracing this web standards era ; yet we must ask ourselves , are we deploying standards of our own ?
Standards are “ a rule or principle that is used as a basis for judgment ” .
if one entity is like many , should the similar entities share consistencies ?
A classic example is horizontal navigation .
It is a fairly common “ standard ” to use an unordered list for the structure of navigation , regardless of vertical or horizontal presentation .
On many large - scale websites a horizontal navigation can be put to use in a variety of locations ; but yet the CSS to control their presentation is unnecessarily repeated just as many times throughout the stylesheet .
If an entity shares similar behavior throughout a system , the most logical thing to do is give those like it similar naming conventions to identify them as the same , regardless of presentational implications .
Giving every instance of a horizontal navigation a meaningful and consistent “ standard ” class name such as ul.horizontal allows all instances to immediately conform to their dictated presentational form .
I know , if we deconstruct the suggested class name it is very unsexy ; we used “ horizontal ” which is very much a presentational name .
But what are we running from other than the fact that we really want to be “ sexy ” regardless if that comes at the cost of being smart ?
Now , by adding one standard class name to any HTML list element you wish to be horizontal ; you save yourself the four to five lines of your CSS that would have been required every time — you ’ve just saved a little more time and little more file size by being just a little more smart .
And you ’ve just made your markup and CSS that much more meaningful ; creating the basis for a horizontal list for anyone in your site is only a class name away — an action that can occur many times over .
“ But , ” I hear you cry , “ What if we no longer want the list to be horizontal ? ”
Well , just remove the class name from the HTML — I guarantee that it will be easier than removing the four to five lines of CSS , and second - guessing if any of the rules have uses other than ensuring the list was horizontal .
Sometimes changing HTML is quicker and faster than editing CSS .
Smart CSS is about being clean , lean , and meaningful through clarity and consistency ; and it is the inherent nature and design of CSS that is the basis for that .
Embrace The Power of Specificity
When did we stop respecting or utilizing the power of specificity ?
The drive for sexy CSS sees designers stripping out as much perceived “ cruft ” as possible — why use # sidebar .horizontal when you can use # sidebar ul — but if we named more elements , specificity helps us target those entities .
If we are specific , organized , and detailed within our HTML markup , controlling that markup within our stylesheets becomes much easier and much more practical .
If you want to change a horizontal list and remain a purist without editing the markup , then change within the CSS using specificity .
Your CSS is not set in stone the moment it is written ; it was intended to be allowed to change and architected to be over - written .
Being meaningful within the markup , being organized within that meaning , and detailed with respect to hierarchy is the objective .
You can have presentational meaning within your markup without the fear of change ; specificity ( and the cascade ) can isolate and target for change .
Oftentimes the individual who created the CSS is not the person who maintains it .
Not only do detailed and organized attribute and class naming conventions help get past many of the concerns of presentational meaning in markup , they also help maintain internal standards and consistencies while still remaining flexible and extensible .
The books we revered in the beginning to help us learn CSS fundamentals were slightly misleading and misguiding with respect to real world application ; great for learning the fundamentals but poor for building in the real world .
These early learning classics would / files / includes / print.css unarguable examples , demanding a class name such as “ red ” be changed to something less presentational and more contextually meaningful , like “ emergency ” or “ alert ” .
What do you do when you work for a car manufacturer whose marketing campaign is to create a website that showcases all of the variety of colors for a specific model of car — and the only internal differentiator for each car is the color itself ?
There is no numeric and alphabetic appendix to the car model ; just the model and its color — the orange book never covered that .
And now here we are , the best in breed , trying to stay sexy and not looking at what is most meaningful and logical .
More often than not we are more concerned with what to name something in some desperate attempt to be sexy and appeal to our peers — and we forget about being clear and meaningful for our co-workers and clients .
In this particular example , a class name of “ red ” is not flawed or inappropriate ; it is actually the best and most useful naming convention .
Designers have taken CSS under their wing , and as a result it has become more about “ style ” and less about utilizing its full potential .
Be Smart .
Smart CSS is about being meaningful ; it is about not being vague and redundant within your CSS simply to be more “ sexy ” .
One thing to note is that it is not the job of CSS to overcome the shortcomings of your development team , content management system , or internal processes .
If your application under the hood is n’t being developed or maintained in a forward - thinking , flexible , and extensible manner , then smart CSS can only do so much .
I advocate changing the front - end HTML markup — but that can only happen in an environment that makes it a realistic possibility to do so .
CSS has long been utilized as the designer ’s tool to overwrite and overcome internal barriers between upper management and developers .
There has for far too long been an unnecessary separation of presentation from structure that has created this unfriendly divide between HTML and CSS .
The advocates constantly praise this ability to “ redesign ” a website using nothing more than CSS ; where technically that is possible , the claim is fundamentally flawed .
The world , the real world , does not behave like the CSS Zen Garden .
A redesign is almost always more than simply aesthetic ; the web designers of the world who ’ve become the early adopters and advocates have been naïve in thinking “ redesign ” equates to presentation alone .
This is n’t just about classes and ID attributes , it is about extremely clean and light - weight CSS that powers very large websites that demand extreme flexibility and extensibility .
It is about knowing CSS and its true capabilities and respecting those , even above beautiful philosophical thoughts such as this creative and professional separation .
“ Sexy CSS ” is a great title for a blog post , but no means for creating websites of substance .
Be flexible , extensible , meaningful and appropriate ; create smart CSS .

Top 5 Olympic Opening Ceremony Moments
Top 5 Olympic Opening Ceremony Moments ( That China Wants You To Forget )
The Olympics are heading to a close , which makes it a perfect time to reflect on how it all began .
The opening ceremonies were – by all accounts – spectacular .
It was that grandest spectacle that I , personally , have ever seen .
But almost as soon as the opening ceremonies were over , journalists and bloggers started noticing the cracks in the perfect facade that the Chinese government had erected .
So now we give you : The Top 5 Olympic Opening Ceremony Moments China Wants You To Forget :
5 . The Blue Screen of Death
Amid all the LED , projectors and other electronic gizmos it was almost inevitable that something would go wrong , and something did : one of computers driving the giant LCD projectors aimed at the ceiling of the Birds ’
Nest crapped out .
Our best guess is that the computers used to run the opening ceremonies were all using a single Windows license key downloaded off a Chinese Web site .
Chinese blogger rivercoolcool took some pictures and posted them for the world to see and they spread like wildfire , although , typically , most people credited Gizmodo .
4. Firework Footprint Fraud
This is how paranoid the Chinese government was that absolutely everything look absolutely perfect :
They faked the fireworks display .
The Chinese invented fireworks for Christ ’s sake .
They ’re the undisputed best in the world at manufactuing them .
And yet they replaced them with CGI rendered effects for the television audience at home .
The Beijing regime had a willing partner in NBC .
Rather than admitting that we were watching a prerendered movie , host Matt Lauer called the fireworks “ almost animation ” – which was true in the sense that it really was animation .
Popular Mechanics got the inside goods on the fireworks display with two of the men who helped design the real fireworks and were surprised to upstaged by something Pixar could have cooked up .
3. Well at Least They Were All Chinese ( We Think )
One of the highlights of the ceremonies was when a group of children marched out carrying the Chinese flag .
Â
The media guide passed out by the government used this description : “ Fifty - six children from 56 Chinese ethnic groups cluster around the Chinese national flag , representing the 56 ethnic groups . ”
The only problem with that description was that all of the children were from actually the majority Han Chinese ethnic group .
The minorities got cut out of the deal .
The Beijing government has a rocky relationship with many of its ethnic minorities ( see Tibet ) , and has traditionally been a little less than sensitive when dealing with them .
For instance , at the National Communist Party Congress , Han delegates wear tailored suits while hand - picked minority delegates are told to dress in ethnic costumes .
I ’m sure it helps you negotiate greater religious freedom for your region when you ’re wearing a pointy hat festooned with feathers , sequins and bells .
Reuters has more .
2. Move Over , Ugly
The ceremonies also featured a beautiful singing performance from 9 - year - old Lin Miaoke – except it was n’t Minoke singing .
Chinese officials demanded that the mind - numbingly cute Minoke , whose photo can actually cause cavities , replace Yang Peiyi .
the 7 - year - old who can actually , y’know , sing .
Miaoke lip synced to Peiyi ’s voice .
As Jon Stewart noted , “ Wow , you thought your middle school years were hard .
Imagine if your government got together and decided you were n’t cute . ”
Yahoo has the story , but the AP actually wrote it .
There ’s some irony for you right there …
1. It ’s Just Like Summer Camp – Except You Can’t Leave
One of the most impressive feats of the opening ceremonies was a martial arts display by 2008 Tai Chi masters .
Viewers at home marveled at their inhuman precision , and wondered how they got to be so good .
The answer is simple , if you want inhuman precision , just treat the performers inhumanely .
The Tai Chi performers spent the last year sequestered at a military base practicing the routine .
They were packed 50 to a room in decrepit facilities with few functioning showers , fewer functioning toilets and no heat or air .
Mosquitoes were also a problem .
Oh and by the way : they were forbidden to leave .
“ The food is the worst thing .
We ’ve had the same two courses for dinner for a year .
Sometimes there has n’t been enough for everyone .
Those who have arrived last have n’t got anything to eat , ” says a pupil , adding that he “ wants to throw up , ” when the food is served .
At least at the end of the day they get the satisfaction of knowing that they served their country — which is good , because they did n’t get paid .
Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten has the details .
( Where the crap is the American media on this one , by the way ? )
A new study conducted at a large university finds more than 25 percent of those surveyed reported symptoms of tanning dependence , including symptoms similar to alcohol and drug- addicted individuals .
Suggestively , the study also found those with a tanning dependence tend to be more likely to be thin and smoke cigarettes than others .
The study by researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center is published in the September / October issue of the American Journal of Health Behavior .
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer , according to the American Cancer Society , accounting for half of all human cancers with over a million new cases diagnosed yearly in the United States .
It is reported that up to 90 percent of all skin cancers are associated with ultraviolet radiation .
For the study , Heckman and her colleagues set out to understand what proportion of college students report problems with tanning dependence and whether there are shared behaviors among those considered to be tanning dependent and those with other forms of addiction .
" Adolescents and young adults tend to put themselves at risk for later skin cancer by exposing themselves to high levels of ultraviolet radiation , so by understanding some possible reasons why , we hope to develop innovative interventions to help prevent these risky behaviors , " explains Carolyn Heckman , Ph.D. , an associate member at Fox Chase Cancer Center .
Heckman and her colleagues recruited 400 students and other volunteers at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , Virginia during the spring semester of 2006 .
Participants took part in an online survey utilizing items adapted from questionnaires used to measure traditional substance abuse and dependence .
The measures assess tolerance to tanning ( the need to tan increasingly frequently ) , withdrawal from tanning ( discomfort when not having tanned recently ) , and difficulty controlling the behavior despite awareness of its negative impact such as freckles , wrinkles , pre-cancerous lesions , etc .

The survey included questions such as " Do you think you need to spend more and more time in the sun to maintain your perfect tan ? " , " Do you continue tanning so your tan will not fade ? " and " Does this [ your belief that tanning can cause skin cancer ] keep you from spending time in the sun or going to tanning beds ? "
Participants were queried about their level of intentional and incidental sun exposure , tanning booth use , and chemical sunless tanner use .
The survey also asked about health - related behaviors such as body mass index , smoking , and exercise .
" The media and lay public may know tanning dependence as ' tanorexia , ' alluding to similarities to both substance addictions and body image disorders like anorexia , " Heckman says .
" There is some evidence that UV tanning dependence may have biological underpinnings like other addictions such as the production of endorphins as in the ' runner 's high . ' "
Heckman adds : " We were surprised to find that 27 percent of those we surveyed were classified as tanning dependent .
The finding that almost 40 percent of those surveyed had used tanning booths and that the mean age when tanning booths were first used was 17 is also alarming . "
Interestingly , sun tanning appeared to be more closely related to tanning dependence than indoor tanning , though use of indoor tanning during warm weather also signaled tanning dependence .
Finally , the researchers say that those addicted to tanning were more likely to be thin and smoke cigarettes than others , suggesting meaningful avenues for further research into possible links among risky behaviors .
" Our ultimate goal is to find out more about the motivations for tanning so that we can develop interventions that would reduce tanning and hopefully skin cancer , " Heckman concludes .
This study was funding by the National Cancer Institute .
In addition to Heckman , other authors include Brian L. Egleston , PhD , of Fox Chase Cancer Center ; Diane B. Wilson , EdD , MS , RD , of Virginia Commonwealth University ; and Karen S. Ingersoll , PhD , of the University of Virginia .
The authors report no disclosures .
Well , here 's some we 've decided we wo n't be falling for any more .
After next week .
Not many of you are watching TV any more , or at least not as many as in years past .
And as more people tune out ( or just steal the shows off Bittorrent ) the networks think up more and more cheap tricks to keep you hooked .
5 Cliffhanger Cop -Outs

This is when a show teases us with a cliffhanger , followed by an episode that returns everything to normal within minutes .
So , in 24 Jack Bauer winds up in a Chinese prison at the season finale .
How will he possibly get out of this one ?
Oh , wait , he just walks off a plane in the next season opener , back in the good ol ' USA and with a kick - ass beard for his trouble .
In one season finale of Star Trek : TNG , Commander Riker has to make the terrible decision to destroy the bad guys ' ship with a captured Captain Picard still on board , ending the season with his pivotal decision to " Fire . "
We wait for the next season and , would n't you know , the weapon has no affect .
Nevermind !

We can thank the 80s drama Dallas for starting this .
They cashed in with the biggest cliffhanger of all time , when villain J.R. Ewing got shot in a March 1980 episode .
After a long summer break ( when " Who Shot J.R. " became an international catchphrase ) it was revealed that J.R. was alive , his would - be assassin was let go without any criminal charges , and the whole thing was barely spoken of again .
Dallas , determined to top this retarded publicity stunt , years later opened a season by declaring everything that happened in the season before it was a dream .
" Surprise ! "
Why it Works :
Production schedules force most shows off the air for months , up to a year in some cases .
The problem has always been that fans can wander off during the down time , so cliffhangers keep people talking through the dry months ( in the case of " Who shot J.R. , " the next episode got a then - record 83 million people to watch ) .

And , once the show comes back , who cares that we bailed out of the cliffhanger with an unsatisfying resolution ?
You should just be glad the show is back at all , you ungrateful fuckers !
Why it Should n't :
It 's in these cop-outs that a cliffhanger is revealed to be purely a marketing gimmick , having no actual impact on the storyline .
These cop-outs let the writers off too easy , since they get to put the character through some kind of life - changing trauma , then just have them get over it ( Jack Bauer recovers from his lengthy Chinese imprisonment just a few hours into the new " day . " )
Where 's the crippling depression that leads to alcoholism , or the post traumatic stress and years of counseling ?
They turn our surviving heroes into heartless bastards who do n't care about anyone or anything for longer than a 2 - hour season premiere .
There ’s a dangerous trap to fall into :
The belief that functional code is automatically good code .
Hopefully not too many people would come out and actually claim this , but it seems to be an unstated common belief .
It ’s also utter bollocks .
Functional programming gives you tools for writing good code .
Good functional code can be very good ( good imperative code can be very good too !
But that ’s not the point of this post ) .
Bad functional code can be just as bad as its imperative cousin .
Now , what post about functional programming would be complete without some trivial one liners ?
Let ’s start by summing a collection of integer elements .
Imperatively :
var x = 0 ; for ( j < - myCollection ) x + = j ; var x = 0 ; for ( j <- myCollection ) x += j ;
Functionally :
val x = myCollection .
foldLeft ( 0 ) ( _ + _ ) ; val x = myCollection.foldLeft(0 ) ( _+_ ) ;
The functional code is a little shorter .
You ’ve avoided making the sum variable mutable , which is nice .
It introduces one fewer local variable which helps with reading the code ( but it would n’t if Scala did n’t have the cut notation for anonymous functions , you ’d have had to write ( j , i ) => j + i , which introduces * more * variables ) .
Is the fact that you ’ve used a higher order function an improvement ?
No , not really .
The loop is a higher order function too .
We could have written it :
var x = 0 ; myCollection .
foreach ( x + = _ ) ; var x = 0 ; myCollection.foreach(x += _ ) ;
and it would have been exactly the same thing ( literally .
The Scala compiler emits something nearly identical to the second version when given the first version ) .
So the only difference here is the lack of mutability .
Both examples are trivial , so there is n’t a whole load of difference .
But most code is just a sequence of trivialities , so considering how they ’re written is valuable .
One advantage of the fold here is that you can use it as an expression without binding it to a variable .
The loop does n’t let you do that .
But is that really a good thing for you to be doing ?
Thing is , both of these examples are the wrong way to do it in the middle of other code .
The right way to do it ?
val x = sum ( myCollection ) ; val x = sum( myCollection ) ;
( Unfortunately there is no sum method in the Scala standard library .
A minor wart .
But there ’s one in e.g. scalax , or your personal utility classes , or wherever you care to look really ) .
Inline calculations like this should be factored out into simple methods .
This is a no brainer , everyone knows it ’s a good idea .
And the fact that you ’ve written your code in a single expression with a fold does n’t exempt you from that .
Let ’s make our trivial example very slightly less trivial .
Instead of a collection of integers , I have a collection of collections .
I want to find the total length .
Imperative version :
var x = 0 ; for ( c < - myCollection ) x + = c. size ; var x = 0 ; for ( c <- myCollection ) x += c.size ;
Now we ’ll see how the functional code really shines in this example :
Functional version :
val x = myCollection .
foldLeft ( 0 ) ( ( y , c ) => y + c. size ) val x = myCollection.foldLeft(0 ) ( (y , c ) => y + c.size )
See how much better abstracted that is than the imperative version ?
Um , no .
Me neither .
When you ’re doing folding like this if you do n’t have an already defined function to be reusing ( which does n’t have to be a named constant , it could be the result of some other computation .
It probably should n’t be a lambda ) , this really is n’t any better than imperative version .
At least to my eyes I find it a bit worse , but that ’s largely a matter of opinion .
It ’s sure as hell not better .
So how * should * you be writing it ?
Am I now going to say you should define a method sumLengthsOfCollections ?
Fuck no .
You should solve it , as with so many other things , by reducing it to a problem you ’ve already solved .
val x = sum ( myCollection .
map ( _ . size ) ) ; val x = sum( myCollection.map( _.size ) ) ;
Here you actually * have * reused logic properly , and the code is at least somewhat better .
And if you wanted to later change the implementations of sum ( Think this is a ludicrous comment ?
Really ?
What if this were acting on BigInts rather than integers .
Still think it is ? ) .
In these trivial examples it does n’t make much of a difference , but as the number of variations and steps in the pipeline increases this style of code really starts to make a difference .
Earlier today I had to deal with a method definition that involved a really large number of folds , most of them doing trivial things .
I was not amused .
The fact that you can fold , does n’t mean that you should , and the fact that you ’ve been given higher order functions is n’t a license to use the wrong ones and assume your code will be good anyway .
Rowling said she had planned to write her own Potter encyclopaedia Author JK Rowling has won her legal battle in a New York court to get an unofficial Harry Potter encyclopaedia banned from publication .
Judge Robert Patterson said in a ruling Ms Rowling , 43 , had proven Steven Vander Ark's Harry Potter Lexicon would cause her irreparable harm as a writer .
Ms Rowling sued Michigan based publishers RDR Books last year to stop publication of Mr Vander Ark 's book .
He wrote the book after running a popular Potter fansite .
Following the ruling , Ms Rowling said her legal action had aimed " to uphold the right of authors everywhere to protect their own original work " .
She said : " The proposed book took an enormous amount of my work and added virtually no original commentary of its own . "
The statement added : " Many books have been published which offer original insights into the world of Harry Potter .
The Lexicon just is not one of them . "
' Gone too far '
The book had been originally due for publication on 28 November 2007 , but legal proceedings prevented it from being released .
Ms Rowling had originally supported the Lexicon website , but she said there was a difference between fans publishing information for free on the internet , and selling it in the form of a book .
Steven Vander
Ark ran a Potter website before writing his book Making his ruling , Judge Patterson said reference materials could help readers , but Mr Vander Ark had gone too far in this case .
He said : " While the Lexicon , in its current state , is not a fair use of the Harry Potter works , reference works that share the Lexicon 's purpose of aiding readers of literature generally should be encouraged rather than stifled . "
He said he had made his decision because : " Lexicon appropriates too much of Rowling 's creative work for its purposes as a reference guide " .
' Not about money '
In April , Ms Rowling gave evidence in court and said the encyclopaedia amounted to " wholesale theft " .
The author has always denied the case was about money .
She had been planning to write her own definitive encyclopaedia , the proceeds of which she had intended to donate to charity .
However , she told the court in April she is not sure if she has " the will or the heart " to do it after all .
At the time RDR Books argued that it is little different than any other novel reference guide and should be allowed to go to press without interference .

Physicists at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo have applied themselves to that most pressing of matters - how fast might Usain Bolt have run the 100 m at the Beijing Olympics if he had n't already been celebrating as he crossed the finishing line ?
As history records , " Lightning " Bolt broke the world record with 9.69 seconds , but spent the last 20 metres beating his chest in joy , thereby slowing slighty in his thunderous progress down the track .
Now , New Scientist explains , Hans Eriksen and colleagues have submitted to the American Journal of Physics a theoretical figure of 9.55 seconds .
To arrive at this new record , the team studied TV footage to " measure Bolt 's positions , speeds and accelerations as well as those of the runner - up , Richard Thompson " .
Their measurements showed both Bolt and Thompson decelerating in the final couple of seconds of the race , " with a larger drop in speed for Bolt " .
They then " calculated what Bolt 's time would have been had he only slowed down as much as Thompson , arriving at an answer of 9.61 seconds " .
Dissatisfied with this time , the boffins then - " somewhat arbitrarily " , as NS puts it - decided that Bolt " would have decelerated less than Thompson , by 0.5 metres per second squared in the final two seconds " , leading to a healthier 9.55 seconds .
Eriksen said : " We do n't mean to say that this is the final and ultimate result .
Instead , it 's a fun application of simple physics , and we 've done the best we can . "
It 's just as well the Oslo researchers are n't claiming a definitive result , because human locomotion expert Matthew Bundle , of the University of Wyoming in Laramie , clarified that it's " difficult to get precise measurements from ordinary TV footage , which records at 30 frames per second or less " .
More precise calculations would require footage at 125 to 250 frames per second , " or on tracking motion with a series of light beams which get tripped as people go by " , Bundle said , although he did concede the team 's results are " reasonable " . ®
Bootnote
If Oslo uni's Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics has any more time on its hands , it might like to ponder this poser :
What 's the velocity of a Lightning Bolt in a vacuum ?
Mother Jones wonders what 's up with Secret Sarah :
[ M ] ore intriguing than any email correspondence contained in the four boxes was what was not released : about 1100 emails .
Palin 's office provided McLeod with a 78 - page list ( PDF ) cataloging the emails it was withholding .
Many of them had been written by Palin or sent to her .
Palin 's office claimed most of the undisclosed emails were exempt from release because they were covered by the " executive " or " deliberative process " privileges that protect communications between Palin and her aides about policy matters .
But the subject lines of some of the withheld emails suggest they were not related to policy matters .
Several refer to one of Palin 's political foes , others to a well - known Alaskan journalist .
Moreover , some of the withhold emails were CC'ed to Todd Palin , the governor 's husband .
Todd Palin— a.k.a. the First Dude — holds no official state position ( though he has been a close and influential adviser for Governor Palin ) .
The fact that Palin and her aides shared these emails with a citizen outside the government undercuts the claim that they must be protected under executive privilege .
[ Independent Alaskan government watchdog Andrée ] McLeod asks , " What is Sarah Palin hiding ? "
Indeed .
One thing she 's not hiding very well is her Cheney - like penchant for secrecy and inappropriate use of " official " cover to protect e-mails she shared outside of official circles .
I mean , if you 've got a good reason why a professional snowmobile racer needs to be copied on e-mails that are legitimately protected by " deliberative process " privileges , shout 'em out .
Do n't be shy about it .
Seriously .
Just what is Todd Palin 's role in the governance of Alaska , anyway ?
And what might we expect it to be in a McCain / Palin administration ?
So far , all of the stories that have emerged have been about Todd weighing in on using the levers of state power to punish his personal enemies .
Surely the Palin team will want to enlighten us about all the wonderful and life - affirming things Todd has contributed along the way , no ?
In the meantime , mull it over in your mind that in the US Attorneys firings , the Bush White House is claiming the same executive and deliberative process privileges even for conversations they claim the President had no part in .
If you can make both that claim and the claim that conversations the executive freely shares with people outside of government , what 's not subject to " executive privilege ? "

Earlier blasts targeted a courthouse and passport office in central Baghdad
At least 22 people have been killed and 32 hurt by a female suicide bomber who blew herself up at a police gathering in Iraq 's Diyala province , police say .
The guests were attending an Iftar banquet , when Muslims break their fast during the month of Ramadan , in Balad Ruz , 70 km ( 45 miles ) north of Baghdad .
Officials told the BBC the party was being held by a policeman to celebrate his recent release from US detention .
Earlier , two car bombs exploded in central Baghdad , killing 12 people .
The blasts were in the busy Karrada district , near a courthouse and passport office .
Security forces targeted
Local sources said a police officer was holding a large party to celebrate his release on Monday from a US - run detention centre , Camp Bucca , when the suicide bomber walked into his home .
Some of the wounded were taken to a joint US - Iraqi base nearby for treatment .
Suicide bombers have frequently targeted the Iraqi police force .
The BBC's Mike Sergeant in Baghdad says there have been fewer attacks across the country in recent months , but in Diyala province the level of violence is still relatively high .
There has also been an increase in attacks carried out by female suicide bombers , our correspondent says .
Earlier , US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the challenge in Iraq was how to preserve and extend security gains at a time when the number of US troops there was falling .
Visiting Iraq for the eighth time in the past two years , Mr Gates said the US military 's presence in Iraq was now a mission in transition , with more responsibility being passed to Iraqi forces .
Days later , the Parsons Mill is still smoldering , still smells like charcoal , dust , and other dangerous substances that might quickly be able to make your lungs fill with mucus .
One hose was hooked to a fire hydrant , which extended up the hill on Sargeant Street , spraying a big fluffy arc of water into a large opening that exposed the plant 's basement and , above it , a wall and a door , hanging open and floorless .
No police or firefighters were there .
None of the area is fenced off , and photographers can still go there .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Control tower tapes reveal that the pilot of presidential hopeful Barack Obama 's plane told air traffic controllers there was an emergency when he made an unscheduled landing last month in St. Louis , Missouri .
Barack Obama 's plane had to make an unscheduled landing on July 7 in St. Louis , Missouri .
On July 7 the Midwest Airlines MD - 81 made an unscheduled landing during the flight from Chicago , Illinois , to Charlotte , North Carolina .
The owner of the plane initially said the landing was not caused by an emergency .
However the tapes , released to ABC News through a Freedom of Information Act request , contradict that report .
ABC first reported on the tapes on Thursday .
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told CNN Thursday evening that preliminary information for incidents is often incomplete or incorrect .
Watch what the tapes revealed »
According to the tapes , the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller that he had limited ability to move the plane 's nose up and down .
" We have limited pitch authority at flight levels ; we 're descending to see if we can regain pitch authority , " the pilot told the air traffic controller .
" At this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have CFR ( fire and rescue equipment ) standing by in St. Louis , " the pilot said .
The pilot remained calm throughout the recording .
Midwest Airlines acknowledged at the time that the pilot had detected a control problem in the pitch of the plane after an emergency evacuation chute opened in the aircraft 's tail cone while in flight .
Normally , the chute deploys only after landing and after the tail cone pops off .
The pitch , or angle of the nose of an airplane , affects the pilot 's ability to control the plane .
The airline said the pilot had " full authority of the aircraft . "
According to the tapes , the pilot said he regained control as the plane began to descend into St. Louis .
" We had a pitch authority problem , now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself .
We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time , " he said .
Fire trucks met the aircraft when it landed at Lambert - St. Louis International Airport .
After the plane landed , Obama told reporters the plane landed because of a mechanical problem and noted it marked the first time he had had to do so .
" Just thought we 'd spice things up a little bit today , " he joked .
" Anytime a pilot says that something 's not working the way its supposed to , then , you know , you make sure you tighten your seat belt .
Everything seemed under control , the pilots knew what they were doing . "
The National Transportation Safety Board , which is investigating the incident , said last month that there was no evidence of tampering .
An " examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components , nor any evidence of tampering , " the board said .
CNN 's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .

Perhaps the brain was still a little fuzzy from the shock of McCain ’s new VP pick , Alaska ’s own governor Sarah Palin .
Perhaps it was still stuck in the endless loop of wondering – why ?
why ?
why ?
Whatever the reason , it took more than 24 hours for Palin ’s first big untruth to register with me .
Today , while I watched her hop out of the “ Straight Talk Express ” bus , and give the second reading of her acceptance speech , one of my fellow viewers said , “ You know , I do n’t remember her opposing the Bridge . ”
And it hit me .
I do n’t remember that either .
A quick double - check with the third member of our watch party confirmed our confusion .
We all live here .
We all watch the news , read the paper , and pay attention to the local political circus , but none of us connected Sarah with her claims of rebuffing the controversial earmark .
If you were n’t watching , here ’s the quote from her speech :
“ I championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
In fact , I told Congress — I told Congress , ‘ Thanks , but no thanks , ’ on that Bridge to Nowhere .
‘ If our state wanted a bridge ’ , I said , ‘ we ’d build it ourselves ’ .
Reeeeally .
Check out these entries from the Ketchikan Daily News :
“ People across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because they ’ve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose , ’ said Palin , who described the link as the Ketchikan area ’s potential for expansion and growth .
Palin said Alaska ’s congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge and that she ‘ would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge ’ .
8-8-06 ‘ We need to come to the defense of Southeast Alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that ’s so negative , ’ Palin said . ”
Ketchikan Daily News 9-28-06
Alaska Senator Ted Stevens ( currently under indictment ) and Representative Don Young ( currently under investigation ) were the bridge ’s two biggest proponents .
But they were unable to convince Congress to fund the infamous bridge from Ketchikan to Gravina Island at the levels it had hoped .
Now , instead of Alaska paying $ 160 million , the cost to Alaska skyrocketed to $ 349 million .
After federal funding had been slashed , Palin was asked if she was still in support of funding the project .
She said :
Yes .
I would like to see Alaska ’s infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later .
The window is now –while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist .
Well that assistance never materialized , and Alaska ’s congressional powerhouse is tumbling like a house of cards .
Senior Senator Ted Stevens is under indictment on seven felony counts .
Representative Don
Young is under investigation and has spent more than a million dollars of his campaign fund on legal fees …and he has n’t even been indicted yet .
And although Stevens just won his primary bid handily , Young is hanging on by his fingernails while a recount is performed to determine the winner of his contest .
His challenger ?
Sean Parnell , Palin’s Lt. Governor and also the head of the Division of Elections that is in charge of recounting the votes for his own race .
You ca n’t make this stuff up .
The third member of the delegation , Lisa Murkowski , was appointed to the U.S. Senate seat by her own father , Senator Frank Murkowski who left the senate to become the governor that Sarah Palin defeated in the 2006 primary .
( Are you keeping up with me ? )
I could keep going , but those are the highlights .
So , if Congress had gone along and coughed up what Stevens and Young had asked for , guess what …. that bridge to nowhere would have become a reality during the Palin administration .
She supported the bridge every step of the way … until the funding was cut .
So we decided to say , “ Thanks , but no thanks .
If we want a bridge we ’ll build it ourselves ? ! ”
Is that like the failed earmark version of “ You ca n’t fire me … . I quit ! ”
The fact that “ Thanks , but no thanks ” was the money line for her debut as Vice Presidential candidate , and yet is a total fabrication , makes the mind reel .
Is there no fact checker on McCain ’s staff ?
Today , Palin called in to a local radio program , and bubbled , “ This is so amazeen ! ”
Then she said that her children and she had only learned of her selection the day before the announcement was made .
I think of the extensive vetting process that the Democratic VP candidates went through .
Evan Bayh said that he was grilled extensively about skeletons in the closet , and even whether any of his kids had a Facebook or MySpace page that might come back to haunt him .
Apparently the Republicans do n’t worry about such things .
With all the potential scandals and skeletons about to emerge from the Palin closet , ( troopergate , babygate , bridgegate ) we in Alaska are sitting here listening to the clock tick and wondering when it will all hit the fan .
But many Alaskans are just giddy over the whole thing .
The local sportscaster , after reporting on the high school basketball scores , said , “ You know Sarah Palin used to be a sportscaster …. and she ’s the Vice Presidential candidate .
So , I think I wanna do that …yeah . ” ( eyeroll )
And one woman who was interviewed said she was totally in support of Palin because , “ This is really going to put Alaska on the map .
Now people are going to find out what we ’re really all about . ”
Because this is what we ’re looking for in the next Vice President .
We want Alaska to be on the map .
And not in that little box in the South Pacific you guys always stuff us in .
This election is about Alaska ’s road to legitimacy !
Sar-ah Sar-ah Sar-ah !
( banging head on desk and going to bed )
UPDATE :
Looks like the Anchorage Daily News is now reporting this .
Read HERE .
Note to outsiders : the tongue - in - cheek reference Palin makes to herself as “ Valley Trash ” demonstrates a local ‘ regional slur ’ , as it were .
Former State Senate president Ben Stevens ( son of indicted Senator Ted Stevens , and currently under investigation himself ) called what he perceived to be the under - educated redneck , rural population of the Mat - Su Valley where Sarah Palin is from , “ Valley Trash ” .
KASTELI , Greece  Dr. Michalis Stagourakis has seen a transformation of his pediatric practice here over the past three years .
The usual sniffles and stomachaches of childhood are now interspersed with far more serious conditions : diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol .
A changing diet , he says , has produced an epidemic of obesity and related maladies .
Small towns like this one in western Crete , considered the birthplace of the famously healthful Mediterranean diet  emphasizing olive oil , fresh produce and fish  are now overflowing with chocolate shops , pizza places , ice cream parlors , soda machines and fast - food joints .
The fact is that the Mediterranean diet , which has been associated with longer life spans and lower rates of heart disease and cancer , is in retreat in its home region .
Today it is more likely to be found in the upscale restaurants of London and New York than among the young generation in places like Greece , where two - thirds of children are now overweight and the health effects are mounting , health officials say .
“ This is a place where you ’d see people who lived to 100 , where people were all fit and trim , ” Dr. Stagourakis said .
“ Now you see kids whose longevity is less than their parents ’ .
That ’s really scaring people . ”

Funny ladies : Tina Fey , left , and Amy Poehler do their best Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton impersonations on the season premiere of SNL .
Fooled again .
Out of some peculiar brew of boundless optimism , lingering nostalgia and limitless hype , we always seem to get sucked into the notion that this week , this year , Saturday Night Live will be the show we imagine it once was .
Certainly , expectations were set high for Saturday 's season premiere : the " get " of Michael Phelps as a host , the trumped - up suspense over whether Tina Fey would return to play Sarah Palin ( of course she did ) , the countless interviews proclaiming the writers ' eagerness to tackle the election .
Throw in our own You Tube - like memories , which tend to highlight the show 's best moments and discard the rest , and surely you were primed for something special .
And odds are , you were disappointed .
The opening promised so much more , as Fey and Amy Poehler teamed for a Palin / Hillary Clinton joint appearance , with Palin cheerfully oblivious ( " I can see Russia from my house ! " ) and Clinton increasingly vexed .
Combining skillful mimicry and on - screen chemistry , the women got the show off to a great start .
Unfortunately , as far as politics went , that was pretty much it .
A few more Palin jokes were dropped into an otherwise tepid Weekend Update , but there were no other electoral skits — and barely any mention at all of the two people actually running for president , Barack Obama and John McCain .
It makes you think Obama was wise to bow out of the show :
No politician wants to be labeled as tedious by association .
As usual , there were some amusing moments scattered throughout the evening , but even the few decent skits just petered out , and too many of them made you ask " why ? "
The writers have spent the summer surrounded by one of the most interesting elections of our time , and the best they can come up with for the season opener is a fey waiter , some ugly kids and Andy Samberg playing Cathy from the comics ?
Really ?
Granted , most of SNL's best moments have always been essentially pointless , from land sharks to Justin Timberlake extolling the glories of a gift box .
Pointless and funny is fine .
Pointless and dull , not so much .
As for Phelps , he came across precisely as he did during the Olympics : a nice guy and incredible athlete who is inexperienced and uncomfortable in front of a camera .
Still , he was at least willing and game , putting on silly wigs and playing second fiddle to William Shatner 's cameo and Will Forte 's dancing coach ( a Peyton Manning retread ) .
The mistake , of course , was in once again falling for the idea that SNL is a comfortable home for relevant , topical humor .
It is n't , one over - played , over - rated debate sketch from last season to the contrary .
You want political satire , watch The Daily Show .
Still , odds are SNL knows just what it 's doing .
The Fey / Poehler sketch will play in clip - form everywhere and be discussed by pundits who wo n't have bothered to watch anything else in the flat , draggy , 90 - minute show .
And once again , they will declare " SNL is back ! "
So who 's the fool ?

Apple has threatened to close down its iTunes Store should regulators approve a royalty hike that would grant artists a 66 percent increase in commission for each song sold through online download services .
According to Fortune , the Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) in Washington , D.C. is expected to rule Thursday on a proposal from the National Music Publishers '
Association to raise the rates paid to its members on songs purchased from digital services like iTunes from 9 cents to 15 cents a track .
The three - judge panel oversees statutory licenses granted under federal copyright law , which includes music sales , according to the report .
The board 's previous ruling covering physical CD sales was made in 1997 and expired last year , making the impending decision the first to affect digital music sales .
It will reportedly span the next five years .
In a statement submitted to the CRB last year regarding the matter , Apple iTunes chief Eddy Cue suggested that company might decide to shutter iTunes rather than raise prices above 99 cents or eat the cost of the fee hikes .
" If the [ iTunes music store ] was forced to absorb any increase in the ... royalty rate , the result would be to significantly increase the likelihood of the store operating at a financial loss - which is no alternative at all , " Cue wrote .
" Apple has repeatedly made it clear that it is in this business to make money , and most likely would not continue to operate [ the iTunes music store ] if it were no longer possible to do so profitably . "
Apple , which has leveraged the iTunes Store to help sell over 160 million iPods , typically collects 99 cents each time a customer downloads a song , of which 70 cents is turned over to the record labels .
The record labels , in turn , then typically pay 9.1 cents to the music artists who own the copyrights to the songs .
Most of Apple 's remaining 29 cents is used for maintenance rather than profit .
Like Apple , Fortune reports that the record labels " are in no mood to pay the proposed royalty increase " out of their own pockets ; CD sales have dropped by 20 percent in the past year and so put pressure on labels to recover this through downloads .
Online sales surged 46 percent over the same period and have been poised to overtake physical albums as iTunes has pushed past Wal - Mart to become the US ' largest individual music retailer .
They 've instead asked CRB to do away with fixed royalties in favor of an 8 percent commission to artists , which would translate to about 5.6 cents on the wholesale cost of each 99 cent track .
The Digital Media Association , which represents Apple and other digital retailers , is seeking an even lower rate of 6 percent , or 4.8 cents per track , according to the report .
Musicians charge that these attempts by Apple and the DMA to hold or even reduce ultimate royalty rates are effectively taking unfair advantage of their positions to push electronics .
By keeping iTunes music below the dollar mark , Apple knows it can use its online store as an incentive to device buyers , according to NMPA president David Israelite .
Carol Kreck , who was cited for trespassing while holding a paper sign outside Sen .
John McCain ’s town hall meeting on July 7 , pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in Denver County Court .
The librarian , and former Denver Post reporter , was removed from the galleria at the Denver Performing Arts Complex because she was holding a sign handed to her by a protest group that said “ McCain = Bush . ”
The area that Kreck was standing in is not a public space and that is why she was cited for trespassing .
A security guard was captured on videotape telling Kreck to leave and said that the U.S. Secret Service had asked him to remove her .
Later , a spokeswoman for the complex said that the security guard was mistaken , that the Secret Service had nothing to do with it , and that McCain ’s campaign staff had asked that people holding signs be removed from the galleria .
McCain ’s campaign spokesman , Tom Kise , has said that is not true , that the Senator has a track record of allowing opposing views at his public events , and that the campaign only asked people inside the town - hall meeting not to hold signs of any kind .
Kise said the campaign never asked that people not be allowed to hold signs outside the venue and said it was complex ’s own policy that was being enforced .
Kreck said she is surprised by the attention her case has received , but wants her day in court to find out who wanted her removed .
“ No one will admit it and everybody ’s pointing fingers at each other , ” Kreck said .
“ That ’s a good reason to go to trial . ”
A trial date was set for Oct. 1 in Denver County courtroom 117M , but Kreck ’s attorney , Peter Hedeen is handling a death - penalty case during that time and the date is likely to be reset .

Although Democrats emerged from a long negotiating session earlier in the day with Republican lawmakers claiming to be near a consensus on legislation authorizing the plan , GOP leaders leaving the White House meeting said no agreement had been reached .
Congressional leaders emerged from a meeting with President Bush Thursday with no agreement on implementing a plan to buy billions in troubled assets from banks and financial institutions .
Congressional leaders emerged from a meeting with President Bush Thursday with no agreement on implementing a plan to buy billions in troubled assets from banks and financial institutions .
Although Democrats emerged from a long negotiating session earlier in the day with Republican lawmakers claiming to be near a consensus on legislation authorizing the plan , GOP leaders leaving the White House meeting said no agreement had been reached .
Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby , who is opposed to a bailout and did not attend the earlier negotiation session , came out of the White House meeting saying there was " obviously no agreement , " the Associated Press reported .
Republican leaders in the House and Senate also denied a deal had been struck , AP said .
Shelby is the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , which is considering draft legislation proposed by Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , that would allow the Bush administration to implement a revised version of the plan .
The Bush administration wants Congress to authorize a $ 700 billion debt issue to allow the government to buy up " frozen " assets that banks ca n’t sell except at large losses , including mortgage - backed securities backed by poorly performing loans .
While Democrats say the plan should also include direct help for troubled borrowers and protections for taxpayers , some Republicans want any government program aimed at unfreezing credit markets structured differently .
Some House Republicans have proposed that the government provide insurance to private companies that agree to hold frozen assets , AP reported .
The compromise Democrats are pushing would reportedly give the Treasury Department the initial authority to borrow up to $ 350 billion , with Congress reserving the right to veto the final $ 350 billion .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Real Time Economics blog published the text of an " agreement on principles " that was said to have come out of the negotiations that took place before the White House meeting .
The agreement " requires that any transaction include equity sharing " and that the Treasury Department " maximize and coordinate efforts to modify mortgages for homeowners at risk of foreclosure . "
The agreement would also require " loan modifications for mortgages owned or controlled by the Federal Government . "
Although Democrats could presumably push legislation through the House and Senate without the full cooperation of Republican lawmakers , the Bush administration would have to sign off on it .
White House officials said Thursday that progress toward an agreement was being made .
One proposal Democrats had put forward that the administration is said to be particularly opposed to — giving bankruptcy judges the power to rewrite the terms of loans on troubled borrowers ’ principal residences — was not included in the agreement in principles published by the Journal .
Lawmakers from both parties said negotiations on the plan could now drag into the weekend , raising speculation that the Federal Reserve will institute an emergency cut in short - term interest rates if an agreement ca n’t be reached .
Many of the banks and financial institutions that own assets the Bush administration wants to buy are in danger of going out of business or have cut back on lending because they cannot raise capital .
Credit markets have become increasingly stressed in recent weeks , reversing a trend in which mortgage rates fell in the aftermath of the government ’s decision to place mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship .
That move resolved any questions that the government would stand behind Fannie and Freddie ’s debt , and allowed them to continue to raise the capital needed to fund their mortgage purchases and guarantees .

US raids on Taleban and al - Qaeda targets in Pakistani territory have caused outrage in Pakistan .
And that has added to the loathing that some people there have long felt for the way that the US conducts itself on the world stage , as Owen Bennett - Jones discovers .
Many Pakistanis resent what they see as heavy - handed US tactics " I would rather live in the dark ages under the Taleban than be subservient to any foreign power . "
The unexpected comment comes from an urbane , sophisticated and , I had always thought , Westernised Pashtun lawyer .
He wears none of the badges of Islamic piety - a beard , for example - and he normally sports a navy blazer not the local shalwar kameez .
He is a former minister with the Pakistan People 's Party , the most liberal in Pakistan .
Rejecting the West
The word liberal in the Pakistani context means modern , educated , secular rather than theocratic and , up until now at least , pro-Western .
" You ca n't mean it , " I protested .
" Do you know what the Taleban were like in Afghanistan when they ran it , with compulsory prayers five times a day , do you want that ? "
" Look , " he said .
" I can deal with Taleban , they are my own people .
They come from here .
I know them .
" I will be able to get around them .
But the Americans never .
No way . "
That is how badly the battle for hearts and minds is going in Pakistan .
It could scarcely be worse .
Taken aback by that conversation , I chatted about it with another senior Pakistani politician , a senator , again a well known liberal .
" I agree with him , " he said .
" Is there is no end to it ?
The Americans are now bombing Pakistani people .
What are they doing here 12,000 miles away from home ? "
And he told me about his children , four boys .
" I sent them to the UK for their education , " he said , " I spent all my money on it .
They had five , six years in England at boarding schools , it was a crucial time of their lives , they were young .
" They could have stayed and settled down there but they all choose not to .
They did n't want to .
All four are living here in Pakistan and praying five times a day .
Anti-Americanism in Pakistan has reached quite fantastic levels
" I do n't pray five times a day , " he said .
" They do .
Why ?
Because you in the West have forced them away , forced them towards Islam .
You have forced them out . "
Again , I was taken aback .
Apart from the familiar complaints about foreign policy , what had those boys seen in their English boarding school that they did not like ?
Drunkenness , I guess .
Consumerism , maybe .
Disrespect for the elderly always shocks Pakistanis , so perhaps that .
I guess that seen through some young Pakistani eyes there are things we do that they do not want .
Still , anti-Americanism in Pakistan has reached quite fantastic levels .
There are now suicide bombs every few days and no - one doubts that the Taleban recruit , train and equip the bombers .
After one recent suicide attack , the brother of one of the victims was quoted in the press .
Did he blame the Taleban ?
He did not .
" America is responsible for my brother 's death , " he said .
" If the Americans went back home everything would be calm here . "
There is , I think , universal agreement amongst Pakistanis that , if the US continues to rely so heavily on military firepower in Afghanistan , and increasingly in Pakistan too , then the Taleban will win .
Preaching moderation
And , in fact , elsewhere in the world , there are signs that the US is using much more subtle and maybe more effective tactics .
The Taleban are winning friends at the expense of the US in Pakistan
In a US base on the outskirts of Baghdad , for example , where captured insurgents are held , US taxpayers are paying the salaries of some heavily vetted Iraqi clerics who preach moderation .
I met one of them recently .
When he relaxes he mooches around in an England football shirt , when he is working he wears the long flowing , gold - edged robes denoting his clerical status .
He told me about a session he had with a group of 20 recently detained Iraqi Takfiris .
Takfiris are really the last word in intolerance .
They believe that anyone who does not share their very rigid interpretation of Islam is an infidel and should be killed .
The cleric described walking into the room where the Takfiris where waiting for him and offering the traditional greeting : " Salaam Aleikum " .
The leader of the group responded by hurling his slippers into the cleric 's face .
' With these guys you cannot let something like that go , " the cleric told me , " or you lose all authority . "
' Battle of wits '
The cleric looked the Takfiri leader in the eye and asked : " What did I just say to you ? "
" You said Salaam Aleikum , " the man replied .
" And what does that signify ? " asked the cleric .
The Takfiri leader looked confused .
" The word Salaam is one of the 99 names of Allah , " the cleric went on .
" You have just thrown your slippers at Allah . "
He then turned to the other 19 Takfiris .
" This man is an infidel , " he said , " are you going to kill him ? "
He turned and left the room .
That night , the guards woke the cleric at 3 am and rushed him down to the detention centre .
The Takfiri leader was huddled in the corner of the room shivering , his arms around his knees .
" I did n't mean to offend you .
Please get me away from here .
I think they are going to kill me , " he begged .
" So , in just 12 hours , " the cleric concluded , " I dealt with the leader of some of the most hard - line people ever captured in Iraq . "
" It 's a battle of wits , " I said .
The cleric laughed .
" Let 's see who wins . "

John had excerpts of the Obama speech earlier today .
Watching the video is even better .
Obama looks like he ’s having fun :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDTlrd5lXw0]
Our candidate is on a roll .
The first line of the Washington Post article captures it perfectly :
Barack Obama unloaded on John McCain this morning at a rally in Daytona Beach .
And , I love the way Obama is using McCain ’s own words to eviscerate McCain .
WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government plans to put government sponsored mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under federal control , the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers reported late Friday , in what could be the largest financial bailout in the nation ’s history .
A combination image showing ( clockwise from top L ) Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Senator Harry Reid , Senator Christopher Dodd and Representative Barney Frank .

The two government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) own or guarantee almost half of the country ’s $ 12 trillion in outstanding home mortgage debt .
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday that the U.S. Treasury Department is close to finalizing a plan to restructure the two companies that includes changes to their senior management .
The plan could be announced as early as this weekend , the Journal said .
U.S. Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin declined to comment on the Journal report on Friday .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spokesmen also declined to comment .
The Federal Reserve , which earlier this year gave both companies the right to borrow from its discount window if necessary , declined comment also .
The two firms would be placed in “ conservatorship ” , the Washington Post said , citing sources familiar with the discussions .
The value of the company ’s common stock would be diluted but not wiped out , while the holdings of other securities , including company debt and preferred shares , would be protected by the government , the Washington Post said .
Senior Bush administration and Federal Reserve officials called in top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Friday and told them that the government was preparing to place the two companies under federal control , officials and company executives told the New York Times .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson were present at meetings with James Lockhart , the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , the regulator of the two companies , and with Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron on Friday , Reuters can confirm .
There were separate meetings with the two CEOs .
The executives were told they and their boards would be replaced and shareholders value diluted , but the companies would be able to continue functioning with the government generally standing behind their debt , the New York Times said .
Daniel H. Mudd , chief executive of Fannie Mae , and Richard Syron , his counterpart at Freddie Mac , are expected to step down from their posts eventually , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Earlier , McLaughlin had told Reuters the department was “ making progress on our work ” with Morgan Stanley , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , and the U.S. Federal Reserve .
The U.S. Treasury had hired Morgan Stanley on August 5 to advise it on whether the companies were adequately capitalized and help it determine how it would use its new powers to support the GSEs .
An emergency plan approved by Congress in late July gave Treasury the authority to offer an undetermined amount of credit to the two companies , or take an equity stake in them if they ran into trouble .
The housing legislation signed into law by President George W. Bush in July requires the companies agree to a Treasury backstop .
Shares of the two government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) have plunged about 80 percent since mid-May this year as the U.S. housing market slump resulted in the two companies reporting about $ 14 billion in losses in the past four quarters , eroding some of their capital .
“ People have priced in an equity infusion that would wipe out shareholders , ” said Chuck Gabriel , managing director at Washington - based consultants Capital Alpha Partners .
“ On the other hand , they have come to understand you would n’t have such an event without the GSEs agreeing to it . ”
Financial markets have come to expect that an investment by the U.S. Treasury would explicitly back the companies ’
$ 1.6 trillion in debt , but leave their shares nearly valueless .
The Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter , said the plan was expected to involve the creative use of authority the Treasury won from the U.S. Congress to pump capital into the two government - sponsored enterprises if it believed it was necessary .
Instead of giving each company a big capital infusion up front , the government plans to make quarterly infusions as the companies ’ losses warrant , sources told the Washington Post late Friday .
This would be an attempt to minimize the initial cost of the rescue , the paper said .
Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which had rebounded since August 21 on speculation a government intervention might be averted , plunged in after - hours trading in New York on Friday .
Fannie Mae stock fell 16.9 percent to $ 5.85 , while Freddie ’s shares declined 7 percent to $ 4.74 .
Analysts at Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , and Goldman Sachs since mid-August have issued reports saying the companies had plenty of capital to operate for the near term , and both companies have successfully rolled over debt on schedule in the meantime .
Yield spread premiums on the companies ’ senior debt narrowed as traders bet government funding would cut their risks .
However , the major credit rating companies since August 22 all cut their ratings on preferred stock of the two GSEs on expectations that the share price declines had cut access to capital , increasing the need for emergency financial support .
The companies never lost their access to capital markets where they raise money to support the U.S. housing market , but the biggest buyers of the debt have grown more cautious .
Foreign central banks reduced their holdings of “ federal agency ” debt in custody at the Federal Reserve in the past week for the seventh week in a row .
Russia has continued reducing its holdings of agency debt , Alexei Ulyukayev , first deputy chairman of Russia ’s central bank , said on Friday .
The U.S. Congress created Fannie Mae as a government agency in 1938 , during the Great Depression , to buy government - insured mortgages from lenders , providing them fresh money to make more loans .
Fannie continued to function as a government - run agency during the 1940s and 1950s , even as it took steps toward privatization .
In 1968 , President Lyndon Johnson decided to turn Fannie into a shareholder - owned company .
Sometimes you will need to keep some items in the list and get the next item .
It can be done easily using a variable as the current position tracker .
Check the code below :
current_position = 0 my_li = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] for i in range ( 0 , 8 ) : value = my_li[current_position % ( len ( my_li ) ) ] current_position += 1 print value for i in range ( 0 , 5 ) : value = my_li[current_position % ( len ( my_li ) ) ] current_position += 1 print value
You can also do this using an iterator .
Try this python code :
def get_next_element ( my_itr ) : try : return my_itr.next ( ) except StopIteration : return None my_li = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] # convert the list to an iterator my_itr = iter ( my_li ) for i in range ( 0 , 10 ) : print get_next_element ( my_itr )
If you run the code you will see the following output :
1
2
3
4
5
None
None
None
None
None
This is because the iterator is not circular .
It can be fixed like this :

Entrecard is up for sale as indicated on the Entrecard blog and sitepoint.com .
I remember reading an Entrecard blog where a member posted this question .
Guttu Asks – “ If Google wants to buy Entrecard will you sell it ? ”
Graham ’s response – “ Will not sell .
My vision for Entrecard is so massive that it will take perhaps my entire professional life to achieve what I have set out to achieve with Entrecard . ”
Can you say flip - flop ?

What I find amazing is how Graham ( Owner ) is crying publicly about his losses , maxed out credit card and losing a multi-million dollar deal in the 11th hour .
Why would any buyer want to purchase this online slumping community ?
And the price is much exaggerated to say the least .
This community has suffered through broken promises , lack of support , downtime and the immaturity of its owner .
Graham seems to be for himself as stated by a post written by one of his moderators :
Ben Barden – “ In all honesty I feel pretty let down by this .
None of the mods knew anything about this before everyone else did , nor were we asked for views .
We do n’t know if a new owner would keep the current mods on board or not .
The timing of this could n’t be worse – we just signed up three new moderators .
What message does it send to them ?
Graham , you DO have a team .
You have people who do the support work .
I really thought you were going to come back and engage the community – the last week has been very productive with some great discussions .
I have a better idea .
Throw the reins over to me for a month and see how things are running when you get back .
No sale necessary . ”
Graham ’s response to Ben : “ Ben , it ’s not about the team .
It ’s about my credit card being maxed out and me about to be homeless with very very few options . ”
I feel for Ben as he ’s been on the front - line during the fall of Entrecard while Graham hides in a closet .
Buyer beware !
Do your research before thinking of purchasing this community web site .
A selfish act of a business owner .
More flip - flopping :
Graham – “ keep in mind guys and gals , I ’m only “ exploring the possibility ” - its still a long shot it will actually happen . ”
And for all of those who depend on Entrecard as your main source of traffic , I feel bad that this has happened , because you all have worked too hard !

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Police closed down a Berlin sweet shop after discovering the owner was selling chocolates and lollipops laced with hallucinogenic mushrooms and marijuana .
The 23 - year old owner of the shop in the trendy east Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg , an area known for its vibrant night life , was taken into custody on suspicion of drug - dealing .
“ In the shop we found 120 pieces of magic mushroom chocolate and countless cannabis lollipops , ” said police , who confiscated around 70 sachets containing various drugs , about 20 marijuana joints , a range of pills and some jars of drug - laced honey .
Police said one customer , who appeared intoxicated , was arrested after trying to buy a bag of hallucinogenic mushrooms from an officer in the shop .

Urgently moving on multiple fronts to stem the worst financial crisis in decades , the government on Friday said it would safeguard assets in money market mutual funds and temporarily banned short - selling of financial company stocks .
The Treasury Department asked Congress to give it sweeping power to buy up toxic debt that has unhinged Wall Street .
President Bush authorized Treasury to tap up to $ 50 billion from a Depression - era fund to insure the holdings of eligible money market mutual funds .
And the Federal Reserve announced it will expand its emergency lending program to help support the $ 2 trillion in assets of the funds .
Both moves are designed to bolster the huge money market mutual fund industry , which has come under stress in recent days .
The Fed said it is expanding its emergency lending efforts to allow commercial banks to finance purchases of asset - backed paper from money market funds .
The central bank ’s move should help the funds meet demands for redemptions .
The Securities and Exchange Commission early Friday imposed a temporary emergency ban on short - selling of financial company stocks , a trading method that bets the stocks will go down .
As the financial crisis widened , entreaties had come from all quarters to stem a swarm of short - selling contributing to the collapse of stock values in investment and commercial banks .

BIRMINGHAM , Ala . 
In 2002 , a banker named Charles E. LeCroy arrived here with a novel pitch to ease taxpayers ’ burden .
Some Wall Street wizardry , he said , could lighten their load .
Six years on , officials here are still struggling to untangle the financial web that Mr. LeCroy and his fellow bankers spun .
Jefferson County is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy after a series of exotic bond deals that the bankers concocted went wrong , and the interest on its debts , rather than shrinking as the bankers had promised , has ballooned like a bad subprime mortgage .
Officials from Birmingham , the county seat , are trying to persuade Wall Street creditors to let them soften the terms of the deals .
If they fail , the county could sink into in one of the biggest public bankruptcies in American history .
The running credit crisis and looming recession are squeezing communities across the country .
But perhaps nothing else comes close to the financial fiasco unfolding here .

This horrifying five - foot weapon has been recovered by police during a knife amnesty .
The three - handled sword with a blade at either end , designed to be swung like a paddle , shocked officers who took custody of it .
Photos :
See more knives from the amnesty
They are using it to publicise a five - week amnesty during which they hope around 30,000 weapons will be handed in , mainly from youngsters .
A spokesman for police in Gloucester , where it was surrendered , said : " It is a particularly nasty weapon that can , literally , take someone 's head off .
We are very glad it is off the streets and we want more weapons handed in . "
The blade is believed to be a stainless - steel copy of a Klingon weapon used in the science fiction series Star Trek .
" It 's an extremely dangerous weapon , " said a martial arts expert last night .
Other blades surrendered so far include lock - blade flick knives , exotic swords and a ' swordfish jaw ' weapon with razor - sharp teeth .
The Home Office amnesty is in response to a series of attacks in recent weeks which have claimed the lives of volunteer policewoman Nisha Patel - Nasri and 15 - year - old schoolboy Kiyan Prince .
Safety campaigners and police say it does not go far enough .
They are demanding far tougher sentences than the current maximum of two years for carrying a knife .
Under pressure in the Commons yesterday , the Prime Minister said a minimum could be introduced because at present thugs can escape with only a caution .
Mr Blair said : " We are giving urgent consideration not just to banning a whole series of knives but also making sure that there is some minimum sentence . "
The widow of murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence said yesterday the amnesty on its own will not work .
Frances Lawrence , whose husband was killed at the gates of his school in north London in 1995 , said three different ministers have been in charge of crime in the past three weeks and information from the Home Office is confusing .
Mrs Lawrence said : " There is an anomaly between the legislation for knife crime and gun crime , where gun crime carries much stiffer penalties .
" We all know a knife can kill just as easily as a gun so there is a great anomaly there .
A knife amnesty on its own wo n't be a solution . "
Waiting for the festivities to start , Zodwa Mabuza , 37 , who works for the Swaziland chamber of commerce , said : " I 'm happy that we have gone this far as a nation without having gone though a war .
We should be happy but at the back of our minds we should be aware that we have some challenges that we need to overcome .
Guerrilla gardening is a term used to describe the unauthorized cultivation of plants or crops on vacant public or private land .
For some practitioners , Guerrilla Gardening is a political statement about land rights or reform [ 1 ] ; for others , it is primarily an opportunity to beautify and improve neglected , barren or overgrown spaces .
Guerrilla gardening can be conducted either via secretive night missions or openly in an attempt to engage others in the idea of community improvement ; regardless of which approach one takes , there are some basic steps that are important to successfully raise plants under the demanding conditions experienced by these gardens .

How perverse is it that Gramm - pa McCain 's camp is hoping that a pregnant , unmarried 17 - year - old will save their pathetic campaign ?
And would even think of using her in that way ?
They accuse Democrats of exploitation ?
Razzle - dazzle attempt # 5710975 :
IN an election campaign notable for its surprises , Sarah Palin , the Republican vice - presidential candidate , may be about to spring a new one — the wedding of her pregnant teenage daughter to her ice - hockey - playing fiancé before the November 4 election .
Inside John McCain ’s campaign the expectation is growing that there will be a popularity boosting pre-election wedding in Alaska between Bristol Palin , 17 , and Levi Johnston , 18 , her schoolmate and father of her baby .
“ It would be fantastic , ” said a McCain insider .
“ You would have every TV camera there .
The entire country would be watching .
It would shut down the race for a week . ” [...]
[ Palin ] could benefit from a fresh injection of homespun authenticity , the hallmark of her style , provided by her daughter ’s wedding after appearing out of depth away from her home state . [...]
McCain is expected to have a front - row seat at Bristol ’s wedding and to benefit from the outpouring of goodwill that it could bring .
“ What ’s the downside ? ” a source inside the McCain campaign said .
“ It would be wonderful .
I do n’t know that there has ever been a pre-election wedding before . ” [...]
The ice - hockey player [ Levi Johnston ] wrote on his MySpace page he was a “ f****** redneck ” and stated , “ I do n’t want kids . ”
But a McCain insider predicted he would marry Bristol whenever his future mother - in - law wanted .
“ It ’s a shotgun wedding .
She kills things , ” the source joked .

Closing Thoughts
20 minutes and you get the full experience of Home .
The only entertaining thing that keeps me logging back on is stalking other people and doing the twist dance maneuver while saying " grind me hard " .
I basically chase people around and shake my booty at them and they try to jog slowly away from me , its pretty amusing .
Home just needs content .
It is currently a 3d chat room .
It should be noted that the PlayStation Home beta does not include areas with PlayStation 3 title game integration as we 'll see with games like Warhawk and Resistance 2 .

Thanks Randy !
I was just going to link to this .
And then I thought better of it .
“ A link ? ” I thought .
“ This is traditional media taking notice and giving credit where credit is due .
This needs more than a link . ”
So , I give you this piece from my former college classmate , Mike Rogoway over at The Oregonian entitled “ Oregon losing high - tech jobs — with more bad news to come . ”
A steady drumbeat of cutbacks in Oregon ’s high - tech sector has reduced the number of technology jobs in the state to its lowest point in nearly three years .
Wait a second .
Where ’s the positivity ?
Where ’s the “ credit where credit is due ” ?
Well , that comes at the end of the article .
From which I ’ll judiciously quote ( passage emphasis is mine , not Mike’s ) :
Oregon ’s tech industry has one distinct bright spot : software .
Long the weakest link in Oregon ’s technology economy , software has emerged strongly over the past few years — spurred by a vibrant community of open source software developers and Web services companies that require little investment capital to get started .
Software jobs are up 12 percent during the past two years , and now number 9,500 .
Although still a relatively tiny part of the overall state economy — which numbers more than 1.7 million jobs altogether — software is the fastest growing part of the high - tech sector and one of a small number of industries that is defying the broader economic slowdown .
Much of the activity is concentrated in Portland ’s Old Town , home to a cluster of companies that develop software for the Internet .
Examples include password - protection technology from Oklahoma transplant Vidoop , and collaboration tools from Jive Software .
“ We ’re just this wonderful hotbed of open source , brew - your - own - softwareville , ” said Harvey Mathews of the Software Association of Oregon .
“ It ’s a tight community , so we all help each other out .
Which is n’t the case in lots of other industries . ”
Can I get a “ w00t !!!1 ! ” ?
This is exactly the kind of thing we want to see .
The kind of recognition you deserve .
And the reason I continue to relentlessly document all the cool things you ’re doing .
You ’re making it happen .
And you ’re blowing the curve .
And for that , you need to congratulate yourselves , Portland and Silicon Forest startups .
You deserve it .
Keep up the good work .
Stay focused .
And keep working to on that code .
I ’ll be sure to let everyone else know : they ai n’t seen nothing yet .

Here is what we know now :
Merrill Lynch
If you are among the clients of the more than 16,000 Merrill Lynch financial advisers , you continue to have access to your accounts online or can call your stockbroker at the same number as you did last week .
“ It ’s business as usual , ” said Scott Silvestri , a spokesman for Bank of America , which reached an agreement on Sunday to acquire Merrill Lynch .
“ As we move further into the integration process , we ’ll have more to share with customers when we can . ”
This is what generally happens next in these situations :
Recruiters besiege the best brokers with lucrative offers to move elsewhere and avoid the tumult that is part of working for an acquired company .
If your broker bolts , you will have to decide whether to go along .
If you do , the transition period is a bit of a bother and you may lose access to your funds for a week or two as the new firm moves your securities from Merrill .
There may be similar hiccups if you and your broker stick with Merrill , however , if Bank of America decides to use different technology for tracking Merrill accounts or a new account numbering system .
This has been a problem in previous mergers , though the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has made efforts to fix it .

As the means of communication have evolved , presidential campaigns have grown increasingly multifaceted , with each election featuring layers of complexity that were not present four years before .
The most striking feature of the 2008 election may be the sheer volume and variation of the attacks being directed at Sen. Barack Obama .
Though they come from many sources , arrive through a variety of media , and cover a wide range of subjects , a close examination reveals a unified thematic structure to these attacks .
As has been extensively documented , many of the criticisms Obama has faced are based on outright falsehoods .
The truth is that he is a Christian , not a Muslim ; he was born in the United States ; he does n't refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance ; he was n't endorsed by Fidel Castro ; and so on .
Other attacks are outrageous distortions with a kernel of truth at their core .
The diagram below shows how the seemingly disconnected attacks on Obama all drive in a similar direction .
Each begins with some aspect of Obama 's history , family , personal characteristics , or beliefs .
The attack then moves to one of three broad themes : that Obama is a Muslim or somehow foreign ; that he represents a black radicalism more at home in the 1960s than today ; or that he is a liberal elitist with a radical , even socialist agenda .
Some of the attacks touch on two or even all three of these themes , which is why they are represented in a Venn diagram .
But all the attacks ultimately point to the conclusion that Obama is " not one of us , " as the expression goes -- not Christian , not white , not mainstream , not even American .
Just as the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth unleashed on the public a dossier of lies about John Kerry in 2004 , this new campaign is on a mission to spread misinformation about a presidential candidate .
We call it " Swiftboating 2.0 " not only because it is the latest model of a political smear campaign , but also because it shares features of " Web 2.0 " sites like Facebook and MySpace : significant portions of the content are generated by ordinary people and are spread from peer to peer .
Swiftboating 2.0 combines these new information pathways with traditional media -- books from conservative publishers , right - wing radio , and conservative pundits and strategists on television -- to spread the smears as widely as possible and force them into the mainstream media .
To understand the attacks on Obama , one must acknowledge that they operate together , as one coherent , thematically unified campaign : Swiftboating 2.0 .

Attack : Michelle Obama is an " angry black woman . "
The Facts : Michelle Obama is a strong advocate for her husband , but there is no evidence that she is " angry . "
The Echo Chamber : Fox News Channel , National Review , Michelle Malkin , The Obama Nation by Jerome Corsi ( p. 233 ) Origin & Evolution :
In a February 18 speech , Michelle Obama told a crowd in Wisconsin , " What we 've learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback .
...
And let me tell you something -- for the first time in my adult lifetime , I 'm really proud of my country .
And not just because Barack has done well , but because I think people are hungry for change .
And I have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment .
I 've seen people who are hungry to be unified around some basic , common issues , and it 's made me proud . "
Conservatives seized upon her comments .
On May 5 , the National Review published an online article about Michelle Obama headlined " America 's Unhappiest Millionaire " ; two weeks earlier , it put Michelle Obama on the cover of the magazine with the headline " Mrs. Grievance . "
On May 7 , blogger and syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin wrote a column calling her Barack Obama 's " bitter half . "
During a panel discussion on the June 14 edition of Fox News Watch , syndicated columnist Cal Thomas said , " In this campaign , we are being asked to accept three things simultaneously , the first woman with a credible chance of being president , the first African - American with the chance of being president and , whoever Michelle Obama is going to be styled , the angry black woman , first lady ? "
Nearly seven months after her February comments , some media figures continue to repeat the charge .
On the September 16 edition of The O'Reilly Factor , host Bill O'Reilly said , " Now , I have a lot of people who call me on the radio and say she looks angry .
And I have to say there 's some validity to that .
She looks like an angry woman . "
O'Reilly later added , " The perception is that she 's angry in some quarters . "

Attack : The " Black Value System " promulgated by Trinity United Church of Christ proves that the church is " separatist " and shows that Obama is a divisive candidate out of the mainstream of American life .
The Facts : Trinity United Church of Christ promotes a " Black Value System , " whose tenets include " Commitment to God , " " Commitment to the Black Community , " " Commitment to the Black Family , " and " Commitment to Self - Discipline and Self - Respect . "
But contrary to the assertion that Trinity is " separatist , " Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Trinity said on the March 1 edition of Hannity & Colmes , " The African - centered point of view does not assume superiority , nor does it assume separatism .
It assumes Africans speaking for themselves as subjects in history , not objects in history . "
Far from shunning non-blacks , Trinity welcomes worshippers of all races , as Martin E. Marty of the University of Chicago Divinity School wrote : " My wife and I on occasion attend , and , like all other non-blacks , are enthusiastically welcomed . "
Addressing criticism from conservatives , Obama said , " Commitment to God , black community , commitment to the black family , the black work ethic , self - discipline and self - respect .
...
Those are values that the conservative movement in particular has suggested are necessary for black advancement . "

On the February 7 edition of MSNBC's Tucker , host Tucker Carlson claimed that Trinity " sounds separatist to me " and " contradicts the basic tenets of Christianity . "
On the February 28 edition of Fox News Channel 's Hannity & Colmes , guest Erik Rush of the right - wing news site WorldNetDaily called the Black Value System a " scary doctrine " and compared Trinity to a " cult . "
For the next several months , co-host Sean Hannity asserted numerous times that Trinity advocated a separatist ideology .

Attack :
The undergraduate thesis written by Michelle Obama at Princeton University reveals a divisive , even separatist , outlook on race .
The Facts : Michelle Obama 's thesis was based on a survey of African - American alumni of Princeton who attended the university during the 1970s .
Obama was purporting to document attitudes among black Princeton alumni who attended the school in the ' 70s and not asserting her own views .
Lines from the thesis that allegedly express her divisive views on race are either completely fabricated or taken out of context .
The Echo Chamber : chain emails , Fox News Channel , National Review , right - wing blogs , Slate.com , The Star - Ledger of Newark , New Jersey , The Boston Globe , The Obama Nation by Jerome Corsi ( pp. 232-233 ) Origin & Evolution : Although several news outlets had written about or mentioned Michelle Obama 's thesis in 2007 , right - wing speculation over the thesis began after it was revealed that the thesis would be " temporarily unavailable " until November 5 at the Princeton University library .
However , the Obama campaign gave the Politico a copy of the thesis upon request .
After its release , critics seized upon the contents of the thesis as evidence that Michelle Obama harbored separatist views on race .
Conservative Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity returned to the subject repeatedly , alleging that the thesis revealed a divisive outlook on race .
In fact , the line Hannity quoted was Obama 's description of the attitudes of black Princeton alumni who attended the school in the ' 70s , not her own views .
A chain email purporting to contain excerpts of her thesis also began circulating in the spring of 2008 .
The email falsely claimed that Obama had written that America was founded on " crime and hatred " and that whites were " ineradicably racist . "
None of those phrases appear in her thesis .

Attack : Barack Obama is closely involved in Kenyan politics in support of his cousin , opposition leader Raila Odinga , with whom he speaks daily .
He has given almost $ 1 million to Odinga 's campaign .
Obama 's support for Odinga against Kenyan President Mwai Kbaki has helped fuel postelection violence in Kenya .
The Facts : Obama is not related to Odinga , nor has he given money to Odinga 's campaign .
According to Kenya experts , Odinga 's claim that he is related to Obama is false and was made " to give himself more legitimacy . "
Obama spoke " for about five minutes " with Odinga in January 2008 in an effort to end postelection violence in Kenya , but there is no evidence that they speak regularly .
The nonpartisan fact - check website PolitiFact.com spoke with the original authors of the chain email that made the allegation , Celeste and Loren Davis , who produced documents supposedly supporting their claims of Obama 's contributions to Odinga .
However , PolitiFact consulted with experts and found that the documents were fraudulent .
The Echo Chamber : chain emails , The New York Sun , Investor 's Business Daily , No Quarter blog , right - wing blogs , Newsmax , The Obama Nation by Jerome Corsi ( p. 93 ) Origin & Evolution :
In early 2008 , a chain email began to circulate alleging Obama 's ties to Odinga .
In addition to the claims about Obama 's relationship to Odinga and contributions to his campaign , it also made other false claims about Obama 's identity ( " Obama IS a muslim and he IS a racist " ) that had appeared in other similar chain emails .
Blogger Larry Johnson also highlighted the alleged familial ties between Obama and Odinga .
Some of the allegations against Obama were repeated in more mainstream outlets .
A January 10 column in the conservative New York Sun newspaper passed on the smears and called for closer scrutiny of Obama 's " Kenya connection . "
The falsehoods about Obama 's connections to Kenya have also spread on right - wing blogs and news sites .

Morgan stated that " this is a major American presidential candidate whose church that he belongs to -- says he 's proud to belong to -- says that their allegiance goes to Africa before it goes to America . "
Late in 2007 , chain emails attacking Obama began circulating that included the allegations that Obama 's church has " a non-negotiable commitment to Africa " that excludes the United States and that one had to be black to join the church , a false allegation .
A January 9 article on right - wing news site WorldNetDaily questioned whether the church was more about Africa than about God and asked , " Is this what Barack Obama truly believes ? "

Attack : Barack Obama 's comments regarding his grandmother as a " typical white person " proves that he harbors racist views and disdains " white " America .
The Facts : Following a March 18 speech on race in which Obama said his white grandmother " on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe , " Obama explained the comment in a March 20 interview : " The point I was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity -- she does n't .
But she is a typical white person who , you know , if she sees somebody on the street that she does n't know , there is a reaction .
That has been bred into our experiences that do n't go away and that sometimes come out in the wrong way . "
Contrary to the suggestion that Obama 's reference to his grandmother as a " typical white person " proves that he harbors racist views and disdains " white " America , Obama was making the point that everyone harbors stereotypes but that it does not make them bad people .
At a March 21 press conference , Obama said , " What I was trying to express is something I expressed in the speech , which is that we all harbor stereotypes .
That does n't make us bad people .
...
Part of what the speech was about was the stereotypes that still linger in the body politic .
The anger , the resentments , and the stereotypes that sometimes serve us publicly and sometimes serve us privately .
They 're sometimes directed at African - Americans , but African - Americans harbor their own stereotypes , and that 's part of what was the failure of Rev.
Wright 's sermons , was assuming a set of attitudes that were n't necessarily accurate . "
The Echo Chamber : Right - wing blogs , ABCNews.com , FoxNews.com , Rush Limbaugh , The Case Against Barack Obama by David Freddoso ( pp. 166-168 ) Origin & Evolution :
In a March 18 speech , Obama addressed the controversy surrounding Rev. Jeremiah Wright and spoke about his grandmother as well .
He said , " I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community .
I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother -- a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe .
These people are a part of me .
And they are a part of America , this country that I love . "
In a March 20 radio interview , he clarified , " The point I was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity -- she does n't .
But she is a typical white person who , you know , if she sees somebody on the street that she does n't know , there is a reaction .
That has been bred into our experiences that do n't go away and that sometimes come out in the wrong way . "
Right - wing blogs , commentators , and mainstream media outlets seized upon the " typical white person " line as proof of Obama 's problematic views toward whites , or even that Obama believes all whites have racist views .

Attack : Barack Obama 's pastor and spiritual mentor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ , holds racist and radical political views to which Obama himself subscribes .
Obama also shares Rev. Michael Pfleger 's sentiments regarding Hillary Clinton -- that she felt " entitled " to the Democratic presidential nomination and that " there 's a black man stealing my show . "
The Facts : Obama has repeatedly denounced Wright 's more controversial comments .
He has said that " we do n't agree on everything . "
In some cases , Obama criticized Wright for remarks he made before controversy over them erupted .
In April 2008 , Obama renounced his ties to Wright .
Barack Obama denounced the controversial comments Pfleger made about Hillary Clinton .
Obama released a statement on May 29 saying , " As I have traveled this country , I 've been impressed not by what divides us , but by all that unites us .
That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger 's divisive , backward - looking rhetoric , which does n't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause . "
Shortly thereafter , Pfleger issued a statement : " I regret the words I chose on Sunday .
These words are inconsistent with Senator Obama 's life and message , and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them . "
On May 30 , Obama sent a letter to Trinity to inform them that he was leaving the church .
The Echo Chamber : Stories about Wright and Obama 's alleged " pastor problems " appeared on all the broadcast and cable news networks , in virtually every major newspaper , in newsmagazines , on numerous radio programs , and in countless web sites .
Origin & Evolution :
One of the recurring attacks on Obama has focused on his membership of more than 20 years at Trinity United Church of Christ .
Scrutiny of the church and Obama 's association with it intensified when video clips of Rev. Jeremiah Wright making controversial statements at Trinity began appearing on YouTube and in the media .
On March 12 , 2008 , Fox News Channel 's Special Report With Brit Hume ran a story on Wright that included video footage of Wright 's sermons that it said was purchased from the church .
Among the snippets featured in the story was a declaration from Wright : " Barack knows what it means living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people .
Hillary would never know that .
Hillary ai n't never been called a nigger .
Hillary has never had a people defined as a non-person . "
The following morning , ABC's Good Morning America aired a story by Brian Ross in which Wright was shown saying about the 9/11 attacks , " We bombed Hiroshima , we bombed Nagasaki , and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon , and we never batted an eye .
We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and the black South Africans , and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas has now been brought back into our own front yard .
America 's chickens are coming home to roost . "
Wright was also shown proclaiming , " The government gives them the drugs , builds bigger prisons , passes a three - strike law and then wants us to sing ' God Bless America . '
No , no , no , God damn America , that 's in the Bible for killing innocent people .
God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human . "
Although Ross noted that Obama had said that Wright is " like an old uncle , who says things I do n't always agree with , " at no point did Ross report that when asked about Wright 's 9/11 comments in particular , Obama said , " The violence of 9/11 was inexcusable and without justification . "
The videos began circulating on YouTube and became a topic of extended discussion for blogs and media outlets .
The blanket coverage -- which included stories in the New York Times , CNN , MSNBC , Rush Limbaugh , and the Fox News Channel , among other outlets -- all but dominated political news for days .
On March 14 , Obama addressed the controversy in a column posted on The Huffington Post .
" I vehemently disagree and strongly condemn the statements that have been the subject of this controversy , " Obama wrote .
The campaign also announced that Wright had been dropped as a member of its spiritual advisory committee .
Several days later , Obama gave a speech in Philadelphia on race and politics where he once again addressed the statements made by Wright and clarified his relationship with the pastor .
Obama repeated his denunciation of Wright 's statements , and stated that Wright 's " comments were not only wrong but divisive , divisive at a time when we need unity . "
On April 28 , Wright appeared at the National Press Club and did not back away from his widely criticized comments .
In the wake of that appearance , Obama broke ties with his former pastor on April 29 , saying , " Whatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed as a consequence of this . "
On May 29 ABC News ' Political Punch blog reported that a video clip had surfaced of a guest sermon given by Rev. Michael Pfleger on May 25 , 2008 at Trinity United Church in which the pastor mocked Hillary Clinton .
( Pfleger is not a pastor at Trinity . )
In the video , Pfleger is shown saying that Clinton had felt " entitled " to the Democratic presidential nomination and mocking Clinton for having cried in New Hampshire , mimicking her saying , " There 's a black man stealing my show . "
Right - wing blogs and mainstream media outlets hyped the story as part of Obama 's " pastor problems , " comparing Pfleger to Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
On May 30 , Obama sent a letter informing Trinity that he was leaving the church .

Attack : Barack Obama refuses to put his hand on his heart during the playing of the national anthem and may be breaking the law by not doing so .
The Facts : According to Bill Burton , an Obama spokesperson , Obama sometimes places his hand over his heart during the national anthem , and sometimes does not .
Indeed , there are photographs of him with his hand over his heart during the national anthem .
Even though the U.S. Code states that " all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart , " experts on U.S. customs say that the rule is no longer strictly followed .
Anne Garside , director of communication for the Maryland Historical Society , says that " there is no obligation to put your hand over your heart " during the singing of the national anthem and that " the bottom line is that you show respect with your demeanor . "
The Echo Chamber : chain emails , right - wing blogs , Fox News Channel , Associated Press , The Obama Nation by Jerome Corsi ( p. 255 ) Origin & Evolution :
An email began circulating in October 2007 asking , " Does this man not cross his heart when the National Anthem is playing , or when the flag is raised or lowered ? "
The email usually came with a photograph of Obama standing in front of an American flag with his hands clasped in front of him .
Beside Obama are Hillary Clinton and Bill Richardson , with their hands over their hearts and all with their backs to the flag on stage , presumably facing another flag or the singer of the anthem offstage .
The right - wing blog NewsBusters , in an October 20 , 2007 , post , noted Obama 's posture and suggested that it was a political statement : " Does he perhaps believe that , like wearing the flag pin , the hand on the heart is n't ' true patriotism ' ? "

Attack : Barack Obama is a " Manchurian candidate " or sleeper agent sent by terrorists to destroy America .
The Facts :
Of the many variations on the smear that Obama is a Muslim , one of the most bizarre is the rumor that he is a " Manchurian candidate , " or a sleeper agent who will bring about the downfall of the U.S. and the triumph of Islamic terrorists if he becomes president .
Obama is not and has never been a Muslim .
The Echo Chamber : chain emails , right - wing blogs , Fox News Channel , CNN , NBC Origin & Evolution :

"
Since then , the smear has been repeated on mainstream media outlets .
On the April 30 , 2008 edition of CNN Headline News ' Glenn Beck , right - wing pundit Ann Coulter asked of Obama , " Is Obama a Manchurian candidate to normal Americans who love their country ?
...
Or is he being the Manchurian candidate to the traitor wing of the Democratic Party ? "
On the May 7 edition of Fox News ' The O'Reilly Factor , Dick Morris stated : " And the determinant in the election will be whether we believe that Barack Obama is what he appears to be , or is he somebody who 's sort of a sleeper agent who really does n't believe in our system and is more in line with [ Reverend Jeremiah ]
Wright 's views ? "
Weeks later , on NBC's Today , Morris said , " [ T ] his whole debate about what kind of president Obama would make has swirled around almost an existential level .

Attack : Barack Obama has been endorsed by Hamas for president .
Obama in turn supports Hamas and is anti-Israel .
The Facts : Hamas did not endorse Obama .
Although one Hamas official was quoted in April 2008 saying the organization liked Obama and hoped he would win the election , in June a Hamas official said , " Hamas does not differentiate between the two presidential candidates , Obama and McCain , because their policies regarding the Arab - Israel conflict are the same and are hostile to us , therefore we do have no preference and are not wishing for either of them to win . "
Obama has also repeatedly denounced Hamas as a terrorist organization that should be isolated until they renounce terrorism and recognize Israel 's right to exist .
Obama has said that " as President I will never compromise when it comes to Israel 's security . "
The Echo Chamber : chain emails , right - wing blogs , right - wing news sites , Weekly Standard , John McCain , Joe Lieberman , Karl Rove , Fox News Channel , Rush Limbaugh , The Obama Nation by Jerome Corsi ( pp. 257 , 269 ) , The Case Against Barack Obama by David Freddoso ( p. 138 ) Origin & Evolution :
In January 2008 , the leaders of several Jewish organizations released an open letter condemning slanderous chain emails accusing Obama of being secretly a Muslim that were reportedly circulating among American Jews .
But the idea that Obama was " bad for the Jews " has continued to spread in the months since , despite stories in pro-Israel outlets affirming that Obama is a staunch supporter of Israel .
In an April 13 interview with conservative radio host John Batchelor and WorldNetDaily Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein , Ahmed Yousef , chief political adviser to the prime minister of Hamas , reportedly said that he liked Obama and hoped he would win the election .
That statement came despite the fact that Obama in the past had denounced Hamas .
Obama had also repeatedly stated that his willingness to meet with international adversaries " does not include Hamas " and that he " does not support negotiations with Hamas until they renounce terrorism , recognize Israel 's right to exist , and abide by past agreements . "
When Robert Malley , an unofficial foreign policy adviser to Obama , revealed on May 9 that he had met with Hamas as part of his work for a conflict - resolution think tank , the Obama campaign promptly severed ties with him .
Nonetheless , the incident prompted right - wing blogs to accuse Obama of being pro-Hamas .
In a May 12 interview with The Atlantic Monthly 's Jeffrey Goldberg , Obama said , " My position on Hamas is indistinguishable from the position of Hillary Clinton or John McCain .
I said they are a terrorist organization and I 've repeatedly condemned them .
I 've repeatedly said , and I mean what I say : since they are a terrorist organization , we should not be dealing with them until they recognize Israel , renounce terrorism , and abide by previous agreements . "
On June 4 , Obama gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) in which he said , " We must isolate Hamas unless and until they renounce terrorism , recognize Israel 's right to exist , and abide by past agreements " and that he would " never compromise when it comes to Israel 's security . "
Following his speech , a Hamas official stated , " Hamas does not differentiate between the two presidential candidates , Obama and McCain , because their policies regarding the Arab - Israel conflict are the same and are hostile to us , therefore we do have no preference and are not wishing for either of them to win . "
Yet members of the media continued to perpetuate the falsehood that Obama is supported by Hamas .
On the June 6 edition of Fox News Channel 's The O'Reilly Factor , guest host Laura Ingraham complained that Obama " did not talk about the Hamas endorsement " at a fundraising event for Orthodox Jews in New York .
On June 24 , right - wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh said on his nationally syndicated radio show : " Hamas has endorsed Obama .
Hamas has endorsed Obama ! "
John McCain 's campaign has also used the Hamas endorsement smear , writing in an email to donors : " Barack Obama 's foreign policy plans have even won him praise from Hamas leaders . "
McCain also reportedly said that " it 's very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States .
... If Senator Obama is favored by Hamas , I think people can make judgments accordingly . "

Attack : Fidel Castro has endorsed Barack Obama .
The Facts : Castro did not endorse Obama .
In August 2007 , conservative outlets made the claim that Fidel Castro endorsed a Hillary Clinton - Barack Obama ticket based on a column Castro had written in the Cuban newspaper Granma .
In fact , Castro 's column did not contain an endorsement for either Obama or Clinton .
While Castro commented that a Clinton - Obama ticket would be " seemingly invincible , " Castro actually criticized their pro-democratic stance toward Cuba as an " error . "
More recently , in an article in Granma titled " The empire 's hypocritical politics , " Castro primarily criticized Obama , calling the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain " an act of genocide . "
The Echo Chamber : Fox News Channel , CNN , WorldNetDaily , Florida GOP , chain emails , Chicago Tribune 's The Swamp blog Origin & Evolution : In an Aug. 28 , 2007 column for Granma , Castro called a possible Clinton - Obama ticket " seemingly invincible , " but criticized both for their Cuba policy .

The following morning , Fox News Channel 's Fox & Friends ran a story that featured the false onscreen graphic : " CASTRO'S DREAM TEAM : WANTS CLINTON AND OBAMA IN '08 . "
On May 23 , 2008 , Obama gave a speech to the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami in which he sketched out his Cuba policy .
On May 26 , Castro wrote an article that , while praising Obama for his " great intelligence , his debating skills ... [ and ] work ethic , " condemned Obama 's speech and called his support for embargo on Cuba " an act of genocide . "
On May 28 , the Republican Party of Florida sent out an email with the subject line , " Fidel Castro endorses Obama . "
Inside the email , there was a doctored image of Castro holding up an Obama poster with the caption , " I love this guy ! "
The email also contained a link to Castro 's article , which it called " a qualified endorsement " that called Obama " the most advanced candidate . "
As the nonpartisan fact - check site PolitiFact.com stated , " Castro actually spends most of his words criticizing " Obama 's speech .
Contacted by PolitiFact , Katie Gordon , press secretary for the Republican Party of Florida , said the email was a joke and that the " cartoon " image was not meant to be taken literally .
In a related smear , chain emails have also claimed that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is financing Obama 's campaign .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Mohamed El - Erian , the chief executive of top bond fund Pimco , said on Friday that the U.S. banking system does n’t have enough money to weather the current credit crunch related to massive mortgage - related losses .
Many financial firms , from banks to insurers , are in desperate need of capital -- not just investment banks such as Lehman Brothers LEH.N or mortgage finance companies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , said El - Erian .
El - Erian , who had rejoined Pimco last year after managing Harvard University ’s endowment , in April had said that a “ euphoric ” rebound in stocks and non-government bonds might be premature because deeper home price declines threatened the economy and financial markets .
“ Recent developments highlight the extent to which the banking system as a whole lacks sufficient capital to comfortably navigate this period of sharp deleveraging , ” El - Erian , of Pacific Investment Management Co , which oversees more than $ 812 billion in assets , told Reuters in an interview on Friday .
Investors pounded financial shares across the board on Friday .
Lehman is the latest casualty of the credit crisis sparked by losses in the subprime mortgage , but leading brokerage Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N and American International Group Inc AIG.N , once the world 's largest insurer by market capitalization , also dropped sharply on credit concerns .
AIG stock , the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange , lost over 30 percent to close at $ 12.14 , while Merrill shares fell 12.25 percent to settle at $ 17.05 .
The show stopper , of course , was Lehman .
Lehman shares , the second most actively traded on the NYSE , were down 13.5 percent to close at $ 3.65 after earlier hitting a nearly 14 - year low .
On Thursday the shares had plunged more than 40 percent .
Lehman was forced into talks about a possible sale after the freefall in its share price on Thursday , raising questions about its survival .
Lehman , formerly the No. 4 U.S. investment bank , and U.S. regulators were in intensive discussions about options for the investment bank , including a complete sale , a source with direct knowledge of the talks said .
“ Today ’s market action suggests that the institution - specific aspects will become clearer within the next 72 hours , ” said El - Erian .
That said , a resolution to Lehman ’s fate by the weekend will not be the end of the crisis for U.S. banks , he said .
“ Banks are experiencing higher funding costs which will serve to accentuate the economy - wide credit crunch . ”
El - Erian said Lehman ’s troubles will continue to reverberate in the months ahead .
“ More institutional consolidation will likely be part of the redefinition of the financial landscape as the deleveraging process continues , ” he said .
Pimco ’s prognostications have unfolded .
Days before the U.S. government ’s takeover of Fannie and Freddie , Bill Gross , chief investment officer at Pimco , wrote in his September Investment Outlook that to avoid systematic debt liquidation and halt a “ financial tsunami , ” the U.S. government should give the Treasury the right to buy debt and other assets .
On Monday , Pimco ’s $ 132 billion Total Return Fund posted its strongest day ever , as prices of their mortgage - backed security holdings rose after the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie .
The fund outperformed its benchmark Lehman Aggregate Bond Index by 60 basis points or “ 800 million actual dollars , ” said Gross .
The University of Kentucky Basketball Museum in Lexington has closed its doors , according to media reports in Kentucky .
The museum , which was located in the Lexington Center adjacent to Rupp Arena , can no longer support itself financially , executive director Van Florence said .
According to its
Web site , the museum featured interactive exhibits giving fans the chance to make a radio call of a great UK moment , or play " virtual one - on - one " hoops against a favorite Wildcat .
According to reports , some of the museum 's exhibits will likely reappear in a free setting before the 2008 - 09 season begins -- possibly in the Craft Center , Kentucky 's new on - campus practice facility .
" I do n't think it would be a museum , per se .
It would be a sort of Walk of Fame , a public display in common areas that everyone could enjoy for free , " deputy director of athletics Rob Mullens said , according to the Louisville Courier - Journal .
While the Wildcats have some of the most loyal and passionate fans in college basketball , that did not translate into attendance that would support the museum , which struggled financially from the start .
Consultants had told the original staff that the museum would bring in 130,000 visitors in its first year and average 110,000 visitors yearly thereafter , Florence said , according to the Courier - Journal .
Instead , it drew 27,000 visitors in 1999 and averaged about 18,000 visitors yearly .
" When I took over , it was a long shot , " Florence said , according to the Courier - Journal .
" It was so far in debt , we just hoped we could save it .
But we got the debt down to $ 1 million , and we raised $ 600,000 in about six months , but we just could n't do the million .
It was a great ride . "
The museum , which is separate from the university and its athletics association , owed more than $ 3 million to eight banks that funded its creation , according to the Lexington Herald Leader .
Mullens said he understood that the banks that made those loans are willing to waive $ 2 million of the debt , but want the remaining $ 1 million by June 30 .
The university will assume $ 1.2 million of that debt and will pay $ 100,000 a year to pay it off , Mullens said .
The University had contributed $ 100,000 yearly to defray the museum 's operating costs .

UPDATE : it ’s over 2 hours later now and they ’ve finally fixed it 🙂
Cisco ’s home page this morning : looks like they ran out of their allocation of lowercase letter ‘ t ’ ( thanks to Chris Venus for pointing it out ) :
Or was it “ Speak Like an Irishman ” day and nobody told me ?
Lowercase ‘t ’s were being stripped from the source which explains why there were no styles , etc :
Chris reckons it ’s a possibly a whitespace - trimming RegEx gone wrong , WDYT ?
I 'm very happy with the ' new ' sound , and the safety improvements on the amp .
It 's a nice ' living room ' and recording amp .
The amp is brighter and a bit ' punchier ' than it was originally .
It has a real bell - like tone ...
From the video clips , it 's obvious that the amp is now very quiet from a noise perspective ( well , for Mod A , anyway ) - - sorry , no " before " video to compare to ...
For an amp that 's only 3 watts ( perhaps a bit more with fresh tubes ) , it 's louder than you 'd think .
While the Mod A upped the treble and punch , and Mod B got some of the the ' garage ' tone I was hoping for , I 'm not completely satisfied ...
If more ' drive ' is the goal , the single stage preamp would probably limit the smoothness ....
And if radical changes were made -- well , better to just build one from scratch ....
Would I do it differently next time ?
Yes .
I 'd tear the amp down to the bare chassis and rebuild from there .
But what began as a simple ' filter cap ' recap job sort of snowballed ...
I 'd certainly clean up the interior , tidy the wiring rats - nest , remove the dust , etc .
Probably go the extra mile and use the ' orange drop ' caps .
Since this is n't a highly desirable amp like an old Tweed Champ , the materials used are n't going to tick - off any collectors .
The design itself utilizes common radio tubes , so even N.O.S. tubes are cheap and plentiful .
I can experiment to my heart 's content .
Anyway , I learned something , and I 'll know better next time .
All examples are ' clean '-- just guitar and amp , no F/X.--
Mod A , again with the Trash - o - caster ( the video cam does n't quite capture the treble correctly ) : Obviously , the sound quality of a small digital camera ( functioning as a vid recorder ) is n't going to be excellent ... but it 's good enough to get an idea ...
Everyone 's taste in sound is different .
it 's a personal thing .
So before you write : orororWell , you can't make a full - sizedfrom achassis ( but both are cool ! )
Any tube amp can be modified and the sound shaped , but it 's basic character will not change .
This is a single - stage preamp , Class A tube amplifier .
It 's really a cool - sounding amp .
But I understand if it 's not your cup - o - tea ...
And I have other amps .
If I want a different sound , I 'll use them .
A Dissent on Palin's Success Editor ’s Note : The U.S. news media 's consensus was that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin " hit a home run " with her speech at the Republican National Convention , and most journalists were silent about her falsehoods about Barack Obama and herself .
In a rare dissent to the conventional wisdom , former Democratic congressional aide Brent Budowsky believes that the harshness of the Republican convention will back - fire :
My view is directly against the overwhelming majority of cable talkies and pundits in my belief that Sarah Palin 's speech , and the Republican Convention as a whole , will be seen as a disaster well before Election Day .

In her nasty and small - minded speech ridiculing Barack Obama ’s work as a community organizer , Sarah Palin , in effect , attacked church groups helping jobless workers in what she thought was clever ridicule of Obama .
Incredible — demeaning churches that help the jobless .
This is the convention of ridicule , derision , nastiness and ugliness of a party that has virtually nothing positive to say about itself and has become a virtual hate - fest against Obama in the George Bush , Swift Boat , Karl Rove tradition .
Speaker after speaker , day after day , has been gushing the ugliness and nastiness that Americans are disgusted by .
This is not the party of Abraham Lincoln ; it is the party of Pat Buchanan .
It is not the party of Teddy Roosevelt , it is the party of Richard Nixon , Spiro Agnew and George W. Bush .
I will not predict the polls in the next 48 hours , but I will predict that a week from now , this convention will be seen as a negative and Sarah Palin will be seen as a disaster and her speech spitting venom against Obama will be viewed as much a disaster as her nomination will ultimately be proven .
The vetting of Palin that McCain did not do , and the media have not yet done , will include the fact that John McCain specifically attacked much of Sarah Palin 's pork when she was mayor of Wasilla as wasteful spending earmarks .
As the Los Angeles Times has now reported , McCain cites specific Palin pork projects in his indictment of earmark abuse .
Obama should raise this issue ; the media should report it ; perhaps McCain will say he forgot how he personally condemned Sarah Palin ’s pork .
Bigger picture , the Republican hate - fest presents a portrait of a party with nothing left to say about itself , nothing left to say about how it will help jobless workers , or how it will strengthen America in the world except angry war talk and demeaning ridicule .
Now the great hope of Republican right - wing theology , which wants to declare a national civil war over abortion , has now demeaned and ridiculed American churches helping jobless workers because Barack Obama cared enough to join them .
How fitting for a party with nothing left to say that they demean churches helping the jobless thinking it is some clever attack on Barack Obama for working with those churches to help those jobless .
Brent Budowsky was an aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and to Rep. Bill Alexander , then the chief deputy whip of the House .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) -
The suspected planner of the September 11 attacks denounced the Guantanamo war crimes court as an “ inquisition ” and failed to persuade the U.S. military judge on Wednesday to disqualify himself as biased against Muslims .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is shown in this photograph taken during his arrest on March 1 , 2003 .
REUTERS / Courtesy U.S.News & World Report
“ We are your enemy , ” Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge , Marine Col. Ralph Kohlmann .
“ You are an officer in the United States armed forces ... Myself and my brothers will be judged by the same armed forces that are killing our people . ”
Mohammed spoke in English as he outlined objections at a pretrial hearing to Kohlmann on behalf of himself and four accused September 11 co-conspirators , who face a potential death sentence if convicted .
Mohammed accused Kohlmann of disrespecting Islam .
He said the judge lacked capital - case experience and that his service from 1995 to 1997 under the officer who is now the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo means he could not give the suspects an unbiased hearing .
Mohammed also said Kohlmann ’s plans to retire on April 1 could lead him to unfairly rush the case .
“ I would never believe that you are capable of presiding over this case , ” said Mohammed , who was acting as his own attorney .
“ In your eyes I am Islamic extremist . ”
“ We are part of an inquisition rather than a civil or military case , ” he said .
Kohlmann denied the disqualification request on all grounds and said four times the defense accusations were “ completely wrong . ”
Summing it up , he said , “ I find that I am qualified to serve as the military judge in this military commission . ”
The challenge to Kohlmann came after a round of defense questioning on Tuesday that is a unique feature of military courts and the tribunals established to try terrorism suspects at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba .
Mohammed and four other defendants -- Ramzi Binalshibh , Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi , Walid bin Attash and Ali Abdul Aziz Ali -- are charged with conspiring with al Qaeda to kill civilians in the September 11 attacks , which triggered U.S. President George W. Bush ’s war on terrorism .
The men face 2,973 counts of murder , one for each person killed when hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field .
Mohammed has claimed responsibility for 31 attacks and plots , including the September 11 attacks and the beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
Mohammed ’s speaking for his fellow defendants , from his table in the front of the courtroom , reflected the informal leadership position he has assumed in the case .
He was assigned to speak third on Wednesday , but his fellow defendants deferred to him .
Mohammed on Monday offered to meet with Binalshibh to persuade him to end his refusal to appear in court and avert a forced removal from his cell .
Kohlmann said no , but allowed him and the other defendants to write letters , and Binalshibh showed up voluntarily the next day .
Mohammed also asked Kohlmann to break early on Tuesday to allow for Islamic practices during the holy month of Ramadan and to impose a stricter dress code on women court participants , which the judge denied .
Mohammed ’s complaint was believed to be directed at a prosecution paralegal whose shoulders were bare .
Those denials formed more grist for Mohammed ’s objections .
“ I do not believe that your government respects Muslims , ” he said .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Shares of most large banks and finance firms slumped Tuesday as the Senate Banking Committee 's hearing on the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout came to an end without alleviating investor concerns .
Dismayed investors are still throwing a " hissy fit " that the deal was n't completed when they came into work Monday morning , said Matt McCormick , portfolio manager with Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel , a money management firm .
" Wall Street clearly wants a deal done yesterday , regardless of what 's actually in the deal , " said McCormick .
" They do n't really care about what 's in the details .
They do n't care about discussing the long - term effects on the economy .
They just want it done . "
McCormick added , " As the deal changes hourly , nobody knows what the rules are . "
The S&P Banking Index was down 2 % in late afternoon trading , led by losses in regional banks Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and battered savings and loan Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) .
Shares of top banks JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) also were trading lower .
But Goldman rival Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) bucked the downward trend and was up 2 % .
The gains came one day after Morgan Stanley agreed to sell up to one - fifth of its company to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , one of Japan 's largest banks .
Brad Hintz , analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein , said that most bank stocks were down due to a combination of fears about further disruption in the credit markets as well as worries that the government may not approve a bank bailout .
Politicians grilled Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the bailout Tuesday .
Paulson said the bailout is necessary for " the very health of the economy . "
He said it should be big enough to have " maximum impact and restore market confidence " and it should also have transparency and oversight .
Bernanke also spoke in favor of the bailout : " We believe that strong and timely action is urgently needed to stabilize our economy . "
Proponents of the bailout believe that it is necessary in order to save the economy .
But others believe it is too expensive and baseless .
Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney , one of the most influential banking analysts on Wall Street , said in a report published Tuesday that the bailout was too late to save the credit and lending markets .
" A virtual suction of liquidity has occurred in the credit and lending markets , and consumer and corporate credit is already showing the effects , " Whitney said .
" What started last summer has accelerated and intensified so much so that we believe any government bailout plan has little hope of improving core fundamentals over the near and medium term , " she added .
Less than 24 hours ago we pondered the differences between the inevitable Android Marketplace and the iPhone App Store .
Now we ’re getting the first official information from Google that the Android Market does exist and some juicy details on exactly what it will be .
Get excited folks … this is a DOOZY !
While the definition is open to interpretation , it seems pretty cut and dry on the surface .
The Android Market is “ an open content distribution system that will help end users find , purchase , download and install various types of content on their Android - powered devices .
The concept is simple : leverage Google ’s expertise in infrastructure , search and relevance to connect users with content created by developers like you . ”
Awesome … and it only gets better .
They chose the word “ Market ” rather than “ Store ” because they feel developers should have an UNOBSTRUCTED ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE THEIR CONTENT AVAILABLE .
Read it and weep , Apple .
As we had hoped , the spirit of openness is preserved with Android Market .
Submitting applications will be as simple as creating a login , uploading your app and describing it .
Holy cow … is this heaven ?
Users will also be able to rate and review applications similar to YouTube .
How will they be displayed .. by downloads ?
By featured ?
By rating ?
Will Google sell ad space for sponsored applications ?
All this remains to be seen but we are INCREDIBLY excited by the tone that Google is initially taking with the App Store .
It sounds like Android will be everything that everyone is hoping !
Afterall , its all about the applications .
The HTC Dream / G1 will ship with the beta Android Marketplace and only free apps will be available for download .
Shortly after an updated version will be released that incorporates paid applications .
Any type of profit / revenue sharing has gone unmentioned but details WILL be coming .
Here are some screen caps of the Android Market in action :
WOW everybody if you ’re not getting INCREDIBLY EXCITED about Android THIS is your OFFICIAL CUE !
The Android Market was one of the last things in question .
We wondered in our last article whether carriers would suffocate the ideal Android Market and it looks like the answer is a resounding NO !
The wireless world better watch out …
Android is coming .
Stay glued to phandroid for all important updates and breaking info on the Android Market !

Consortium News

It ’s touching how American neoconservatives who have no regard for international law when they want to invade some troublesome country have developed a sudden reverence for national sovereignty .
Apparently , context is everything .
So , the United States attacking Grenada or Nicaragua or Panama or Iraq or Serbia is justified even if the reasons sometimes do n’t hold water or do n’t hold up before the United Nations , The Hague or other institutions of international law .
However , when Russia attacks Georgia in a border dispute over Georgia ’s determination to throttle secession movements in two semi-autonomous regions , everyone must agree that Georgia ’s sovereignty is sacrosanct and Russia must be condemned .
U.S. newspapers , such as the New York Times , see nothing risible about publishing a statement from President George W. Bush declaring that “ Georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected . ”
No one points out that Bush should have zero standing enunciating such a principle .
Iraq also was a sovereign nation , but Bush invaded it under false pretenses , demolished its army , overthrew its government and then conducted a lengthy military occupation resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths .
The invasion of Iraq also was n’t a spur of the moment decision .
In the months after the 9/11 attacks , Bush proclaimed an exceptional right of the United States to invade any country that might become a threat to American security or to U.S. global dominance .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush ’s Grim Vision ” or see our book , Neck Deep ]
When asked questions about international law , Bush would joke : “ International law ?
I better call my lawyer . ”
The neocons ’ contempt for international law goes back even further – to the 1980s and the illegal contra war against Nicaragua and the invasion of Panama .
Only in the last few days have the neocons discovered an appreciation for multilateral institutions and the principles of non-intervention .
Despite this history , leading U.S. newspapers do n’t see hypocrisy .
Instead , they have thrown open their pages to prominent neocons and other advocates of U.S. - led invasions so these thinkers now can denounce Russia while not mentioning any contradictions .
On Monday , the Washington Post ’s neoconservative editorial writers published their own editorial excoriating Russia , along with two op - eds , one by neocon theorist Robert Kagan and another co-authored by Bill Clinton ’s ambassador to the United Nations , Richard Holbrooke .
All three – the Post editorial board , Kagan and Holbrooke – were gung - ho for invading Iraq , but now find the idea of Russia attacking the sovereign nation of Georgia inexcusable , even if Georgia ’s leaders in Tblisi may have provoked the conflict with an offensive against separatists in South Ossetia along the Russian border .
“ Whatever mistakes Tblisi has made , they cannot justify Russia ’s actions , ” Holbrooke and his co-author Ronald D. Asmus wrote .
“ Moscow has invaded a neighbor , an illegal act of aggression that violates the U.N. Charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in Europe . ”
And to top matters off , the authors accused Russia of breaking an even older international covenant : “ Beginning a well - planned war … as the Olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the Games . ”
The New York Times ran an op -ed by neocon columnist William Kristol , who also condemned Russia ’s aggression without indicating any remorse for his own enthusiasm for U.S. invasions of countries that Washington did n’t like .
Wearing Blinders
While major U.S. news outlets may be comfortable wearing blinders that let them see only wrongdoing by others , the rest of the world views the outrage from Bush and the neocons over Russia as a stunning double standard .
This larger problem is that the Bush administration – along with its neocon allies and many establishment Democrats – have lost any credibility with the world community when it comes to invoking international law .
Bush has applied these legal principles a la carte for years ( for instance , ignoring the Geneva Conventions when he chooses ) , and many longer - serving U.S. officials have viewed events through the lens of American exceptionalism for decades .
For instance , even as the Reagan administration condemned terrorism in the 1980s , it secretly armed the Nicaraguan contras who engaged in acts of terrorism inside Nicaragua .
In 1990 , when President George H.W. Bush denounced Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait , everyone conveniently forgot that he had invaded Panama in 1989 .
It has been as if the rules moved on separate tracks , one set for the United States and one set for everyone else – and it was impolite to notice .
Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , however , it has become harder to ignore Washington ’s double standards .
Also , after the five - plus - year fiasco in Iraq , the Bush administration must confront both the limitations on its own imperial reach and the fact that it has done grave damage to the protocols of international behavior .
As Russia is now demonstrating in its conflict with Georgia , other big powers may want to play by the same do - as - I - say - not - as - I - do rules laid down by the United States .
It is a case of Washington , Bush and the neocons reaping what they have sown .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Americans strongly oppose giving the president more power at the expense of Congress or the courts , even to enhance national security or the economy , according to a new poll .
The Associated Press - National Constitution Center poll of views on the Constitution found people wary of governmental authority after years of controversy over the Bush administration 's expansion of executive power , and especially skeptical of increasing the president 's powers .
" There is clearly a concern about executive power and the balance of power that comes out in a couple of different ways , " said Joseph Torsella , president of the Philadelphia - based organization .
The nonpartisan center is dedicated to educating the public about the Constitution .
Torsella said he believes the polls reflect long - standing skepticism of presidential power .
" I think it 's a basic chord in the American song and it gets louder and stronger depending on what 's happening in the headlines , " he said .
The survey also found overwhelming opposition to the government 's power to take private property for redevelopment and to amending the Constitution to allow foreign - born citizens to be president .
Americans are divided over government recognition of gay marriage , but younger people are far more likely to support it .
President Bush and Congress are at record low approval ratings in recent polls , with Congress even less popular than the president .
But in the new poll , the public is more reluctant to expand the president 's powers than those of Congress .
Two - thirds of Americans oppose altering the balance of power among the three branches of government to strengthen the presidency , even when they thought that doing so would improve the economy or national security .
People were more evenly split over giving Congress more power in the same circumstances .
" The Constitution sets up three branches of government and to increase the power of one at the expense of the others endangers the fundamental structure , " said poll participant James Crowder , 74 , of Cockeysville , Md. , a Baltimore suburb .
" This current president and his vice president have distorted the office of president so much that it will take an enormous amount of time , if ever , for us to recover from that . "
Crowder is a Democrat and a retired Episcopal priest .
In one area , the poll found Americans clearly on Congress ' side .
They said Congress should have the power to require senior presidential aides to testify before House and Senate committees — a topic currently wending its way through the courts .
The administration is trying to prevent former White House counsel Harriet Miers from testifying about the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
The government 's power to take private property for redevelopment had little support in the poll , not even when owners are paid a fair price and the project creates local jobs .
Participants said they consider private property rights conferred by the Constitution as important as freedom of speech and religion .
The Fifth Amendment allows the government to seize property for public use with just compensation .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 that governments may seize people 's homes and businesses — even against their will — for private economic development when there is a corresponding public purpose of bringing more jobs and tax revenue .
In the new poll of people 's views on the Constitution , 75 % disagreed .
Opposition to the government power known as eminent domain was as strong among liberals as conservatives .
Cities , backed by some liberals , generally see the power to seize private property as an important tool for urban renewal projects crucial to revitalizing cities .
Many conservatives — particularly in the West — have called the high court decision a dangerous interpretation of the Constitution that would lead to abuse of individual rights .
Since the ruling , 39 states have enacted legislation or passed ballot measures restricting the government 's power to take property , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
The poll also found a split on whether governments should recognize gay marriage .
But a majority said same - sex couples should be entitled to the same benefits as married , heterosexual couples .
The answers to these questions revealed a sharp generational split .
More than two - thirds of people under 35 favor recognition of gay marriage , compared with less than 40 % of those 35 and older .
Majorities also favor following the rule of law , even if that sometimes comes at the expense of short - term public safety considerations and protecting the rights of everyone in the face of majority opposition .
The public broadly supports government aid to religious organizations for social service programs .
But that support drops sharply when organizations also promote their religious beliefs while providing help to the homeless and other social services .
The AP - National Constitution Center poll involved telephone interviews with 1,000 adults nationwide .
The survey was conducted Aug. 22 - 29 by Abt SRBI Inc. and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .

MORTON GROVE , Ill . ( AP ) |
In 1981 , this quiet northern Chicago suburb made history by becoming the first municipality in the nation to ban the possession of handguns .
Twenty - seven years later , Morton Grove has repealed its law , bowing to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June that affirmed homeowners ’ rights to keep guns for self - defense .
It ’s one of several Illinois communities - reluctant to spend money on legal fights - rushing to repeal their gun bans after the court struck down a D.C. ban , even as cities such as Chicago and San Francisco stand firm .
Mayor Richard Krier acknowledges Morton Grove ’s place in history , but he said that did n’t affect the village board ’s 5 - 1 decision Monday to amend its ordinance to allow the possession of handguns .
The village still bans the sale of guns .
“ There has n’t been any pressure ” to keep the ban , Mr. Krier said , noting that the village ’s ordinance has been under scrutiny since the Supreme Court agreed to hear the D.C. case .
He also pointed out that the mostly residential village has never had a big problem with gun crime .
Though Morton Grove ’s gun ban is five years younger than Washington ’s , it ’s considered the first in the country because the village is a municipality , whereas Washington is a federal district .
Gun rights advocates hailed the Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 decision affirming that individuals have a right to own guns and keep them in their homes for self - defense .
The National Rifle Association and others carried their enthusiasm straight to federal court , suing the city of Chicago and Mayor Richard Daley , a vocal supporter of gun control , and the Chicago suburbs of Morton Grove , Evanston and Oak Park .
Wilmette , another northern Chicago suburb , voted to repeal its ban .
Officials there said they think they were n’t sued by the NRA because the village stopped enforcing its 1989 ban after the high court ruling .
“ In my mind we had to repeal , ” said Wilmette Village President Chris Canning , who is also a lawyer .
“ I knew that our ordinance would not survive constitutional scrutiny . ”
Todd Vandermyde , an NRA lobbyist in Illinois , said communities working to repeal their gun bans simply see the handwriting on the wall .
“ Some communities are truly seeing what is contained in the Supreme Court decision , and they ’re reacting appropriately , ” he said .
“ Others want to spend taxpayer money on some Don Quixote - type quest , ” he said , referring to Chicago , whose lawyers insist the city ’s ban will withstand any legal challenges .
“ We have no plans to amend our ordinance at this time , ” said Jennifer Hoyle , spokeswoman for Chicago ’s law department , noting that the ordinance has survived three previous court challenges .
“ We ’re prepared to take this fight to the Supreme Court if necessary . ”
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said last month that his city would “ vigorously fight the NRA ” and defended the ban as good for public safety .
Even Washington has remained defiant , quickly enacting gun regulations that advocates say are still among the strictest in the country .
Gun control advocates say communities should not rush into repealing gun bans , arguing that if Chicago and San Francisco win in court , bans elsewhere would be protected .

The unbelievable breakdown in American lending standards , market instruments no more than a worthless pile of paper , note how market elitists are using the market crash to put pressure on Congress , the plan to bail out fraudsters , the vicious circle of printing more and more currency , more wiled speculation to come after a bailout ,
We are dumping more dollars into the world economy , devaluing our currency , and therefore the value of all these foreign - owned US treasury bonds .
Imagine what will happen when 700 billion dollars , in cash , is dumped into the fraudster system .
As it turns out , all the foreign nations holding dollar - denominated foreign exchange surplus reserves in the form of treasury paper realized that we were going to inflate them into oblivion , what with all the bailouts and such , and it appears , well , that they all ran for the door at once , if you catch my drift .
We wore out all the printing presses trying to cash in their bonds for them , and all we had left was a huge pile of treasury paper , which we decided to throw out of my helicopter instead of cash .
They ’re in pretty big denominations , so the people should be quite impressed .
In any case , we could n’t print any more Federal Reserve notes on account of the printing press issue , and besides , the notes would n’t have been good for anything but heating fuel , " furnace fodder " if you will , so why go through all the expense to print more ?
We have to be fiscally responsible , you know .
MM : Yeah , right .
Gee , I know this may sound odd , but now that your helicopter ’s engines have shut down , I could swear that I hear — could it be — the sound of marching jackboots , doing a goose - step , in the background ?
HP : Ahem , well , after Ben and I consulted with our Gestapo , oh , I mean our Department of Homeland Security , they decided to send in the foreign storm - troopers , er , our soldiers , as a follow - up to our helicopter drop .
They were apparently concerned that there might be mass social upheaval , and possibly even a revolution , after the sheople , I mean our citizens , discovered that the treasury bills we just dropped were nothing but " worthless paper . "
Well , Ben , we better get going .
We barely have time to pack and get ready to flee to our bunkers and safe - houses with the rest of our " comrades . "
Hey , see ya , would n’t wanta be ya !!!
Oh , and by the way : Sich Heil !
MM : I have a bad feeling about this !
After over 40 years of financial reporting and analysis , we can say , without hesitation , that the 700 billion bailout plan proposed by Fed Chairman Buck - Busting Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hanky Panky Paulson , on behalf of the Caligula Administration , is the most abusive and piggish fascist scheme we have ever heard proposed .
This is the living , freaking , end .
We sit hear stunned and stupefied at the sheer arrogance of a corporatist , fascist plan , so saturated with moral hazard , that it can only be described , to use the words of Jean - Pierre Roth , president of the Swiss National Bank , in his description of the breakdown in American lending standards , as " unbelievable ! "
First , note how the elitists have allowed the stock markets to crash over the past two days in order to put pressure on Congress to adopt their plan .
They have withdrawn PPT support in an effort to stuff this plan down Congress ’s throat .
And this pressure will continue until they get their way .
This is what Congress gets for letting the Illuminati run our country .
Now , they will have to face their constituents in a no-win situation .
If they adopt the plan , they will be accused of bailing out the fraudsters , and of privatizing the profits from the sheople ’s hard work in evil elitist corporations , while socializing the losses from yet another bankers ’
Ponzi - scheme in the sheople as is their custom .
If they do n’t adopt the plan , and as a result , the credit markets freeze up and the US economy goes down in flames , they will be blamed for that as well , even though that is our best solution at this point ( i.e. purging the system of its excesses ) .
The fact that our Congress has sat on their collective duffs and allowed this financial debacle to happen , when it was quite easily avoidable with even the slightest amount of regulation and oversight , gives you every reason to vote out every one of these reprobates and sociopaths , which we like to refer to as " incumbent scum . "
The only exceptions to the coming ouster of incumbents , as far as we are concerned , are Ron Paul , and perhaps Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky .
Congress appears to be balking , and rightly so , claiming that they need more time to deliberate over this situation , to ponder potential alternative plans , or at the very least to modify the current proposal to make it more palatable to voters , which is impossible , at least in our humble opinion .
But is this just more posturing to make it look like they are not rolling over and playing dead for the elitists , or has Congress finally found their collective backbone ?
Only time will tell , but based on past experience , we are n’t getting our hopes up .
These filthy Bosch Pigs want to give Paulson carte blanche to pay for toxic waste at its " hold - to - maturity " value with taxpayer funds , meaning you will pay par for crap that is worth pennies on the dollar .
Then you , the taxpayer , will get paid back in hyper - inflated dollars on ever - deteriorating assets , with flagging real estate prices chipping away at their value without recovery for decades , meaning that your collateral on any of these no - down - payment , give - him - a - loan - if - he ’s - breathing mortgages will be impaired and next to useless in the event of default .
And who is going to administer all these loans , and process the payments , and deal with defaults ?
And what types of toxic waste will be subject to the bailout ?
Will we be taking on defaulted credit default swaps , interest rate swaps , credit cards , corporate bonds , commercial paper and aircraft leases also ?
Will we solve the mortgage - backed securities problem only to be bitten in the butt by credit default and interest rate swaps , or other toxic paper that was equally steeped in fraud ?
Of course we will .
The most egregious part of the proposed bailout is that it allows Paulson to dole out the funds and deal with the toxic waste without any judicial oversight and with full immunity from any criminal prosecution .
This means he can pay par with your hard - earned money , and then when it becomes clear that the cess - pool - paper is only worth a small fraction of par , he can pawn it off to his cronies at bargain basement prices , thus distributing any profits to the elitists as they see fit , and the American people can go spit in the wind .
And how is this elitist bailout bonanza going to benefit the taxpayers , or our economy ?
It is n’t !
In fact , it is going to exacerbate an already volatile situation .
Thanks to free trade and globalization , the global economy has become a tripwire economy .
One wrong move , and the claymores go off , taking out the entire global financial system in a blaze of shrapnel and glory .
The whole house of fraudster cards , rife with trade and investment imbalances , then collapses and gets sucked into a gargantuan financial black hole .
All it will take is one nation whose citizens are fed up with rampant inflation .
They will have to break the dollar pegs , cash in their US treasury bonds , and absorb the excess amounts of their domestic currencies by purchasing them with the dollars received as proceeds from the sale of the treasury bonds .
This strengthens their currency , thus moderating their inflationary problems , but then their exports suffer .
Meanwhile , the dollar starts to decline , and everyone else is afraid that this decline will continue and threaten the value of their reserves .
The mad dash for the front door begins , and not everyone can fit through at the same time .
The dollar gets destroyed , along with the US economy , as the cash from dumped treasuries finds its way back to the US through purchases of US assets by the foreign nations that are looking desperately to dump their cash , thus creating hyperinflation on a Weimar scale .
That is why the FTC is no longer publishing statistics regarding foreign investment in the US , to hide this problem from the public as the dollars start pouring in .
Adding to global woes , the exporting nations , whose goods are now no longer competitively priced , go down with the USS Titanic .
The United States operates at a deficit , spending more money than we gained from our own production , and we need foreigners to finance our profligacy .
In order to help us finance this deficit , these foreigners buy our treasury paper with the excess dollars they obtain from their trade with the US .
They do this by having their central banks print more of their domestic currency to absorb the dollar forex which is flooding their economies due to trade imbalances with the US .
Their central banks simply print more of their own currency , which is then used in currency exchanges to soak up that dollar forex .
This process inflates their economies by dumping their own currency on their domestic markets while bidding up dollars which are then used to purchase treasuries .
While those dollars are parked in treasuries , they do little harm to US citizens via inflation , although we do have to pay interest on them .
The foreign nations then enjoy a competitive price on their exports to the US because of their artificially weakened currency , but at the expense of domestic inflation .
This system perpetuates the trade imbalances , and the inflation in the foreign nations .
Obviously , this can not go on forever .
And now , all these wild , lunatic bailouts will threaten the entire world economy .
Why ?
Because we are dumping more dollars into the world economy , devaluing our currency , and therefore the value of all these foreign - owned US treasury bonds .
Imagine what will happen when 700 billion dollars , in cash , is dumped into the fraudster system .
If the fraudsters start lending again , that means the fractional banking multiplier , which usually runs at 7 to 8 times reserves , will then generate five to six trillion dollars of new money and credit , an amount that would swamp the US and global financial systems even if the Fed shut off its money and credit spigot completely .
And who would they lend all this money to ?
The overextended , totally broke , unemployed , underemployed sheople who are being hyper - inflated into oblivion ?
Of course not .
It will be used for more wild speculation , and to produce more leverage , and more fraud , and more toxic waste , which will add yet more money and credit to our already waterlogged , or should we say dollar - logged , system .
And just because there are losses does not mean that this 700 billion will be absorbed by those losses .
The money that was used to produce the assets which suffered those losses is still in the system , but not where the elitists wanted it to be parked .
They are trying to get that money back , at your expense , through this bailout plan .
Where is that money now ?
It is following a path from wherever the last seller of the toxic waste , before it went bad , spent or invested the proceeds from the sale of that toxic waste .
Remember , these derivatives added nothing to the system .
They are just a re-bundling of existing debt - type assets , with the proceeds being used to create more debt for more re-bundling , in what is truly a Ponzi - scheme , using the same money over and over again to create more debt .
The only new money produced were the fees and commissions paid to do the re-bundling .
What about the money that the current owner of the toxic waste has lost on principal and interest on defaulted loans ?
That money is in the future earnings of the defaulted borrowers , who instead of spending it on principal and interest to cover mortgage payments , will now spend it on rent and other necessities .
And what of the lost leverage ?
That is being replaced by the dollars coming back into the system through de-leveraging , and which will be available for re-leveraging when it comes into stronger hands , as it must , eventually .
Further , our national debt is going to grow by leaps and bounds on account of these bailouts , and this affects our ability to repay , thus weakening the dollar further and exacerbating inflationary pressures .
We are like a person who earns twenty thousand dollars a year and has two hundred thousand dollars worth of credit card balances .
We have news for you .
Those balances are not going to be repaid .
The foreign holders of dollar - denominated assets are not stupid , and the dollar suffers in foreign exchange markets every time the debt ceiling gets raised .
Our debts are accelerating .
They are not leveling off .
And these bailouts will put that acceleration into hyper - drive .
Once the exit from treasuries begins , there will be no stopping it .
The elitists want to jump - start the system so they can run the markets up again to complete The Big Sting Two , but this is a futile effort because everything else is imploding .
Few can qualify for loans anymore , because the credit standards are being tightened and they are broke and overextended , and the ones who do qualify do not need it .
What will businesses do with loan money when they have no customers left to buy their products ?
As the economy and the real estate markets continue to tank , the toxic waste will become ever less valuable , and now they want to plant that future misery in the taxpayer gardens .
These bailouts must be stopped at all costs , or we are going to get vaporized later .
The system must be purged , and the dollar rescued , although we believe it is probably too late for the latter .
But it is sure worth giving it a try , because having the world ’s reserve currency is very advantageous .
All this craziness reminds us of an old Genesis song , called " Land of Confusion . "
We note that our generation unknowingly , or ignorantly , helped bring the Illuminati into power , and now the Baby Boomers , who have tasted of their venomous temptations , are going to have to take them out .
We know you can do it .
You are our largest generation , and you have the most to lose , so you cannot , and must not , fail .
All we can do now is teach you where things went wrong .
It will be up to you to set things right , if not for yourselves , then for your children and your grandchildren .

Can The Bush Family Wealth Be Seized Under The Trading With the Enemies Act ?
POLL : Can All of The Bush Family Wealth Be Seized Under The Trading With the Enemies Act of 1941 , RETROACTIVELY ?
GW Bush is fond of destroying the law by ignoring Ex -Post Facto defenses .
So , I say turn the tables on him by prosecuting Prescott Bush , post - mortem and retroactively confiscate all Bush family wealth which was owed entirely to its investment base in the hand of the Bush Cabal in the era 1932 - 1942 - 1951 wherein the Bush friends and family broke the Trading With The Enemies Act and were never prosecuted for that and the attempt on the life of FDR in 1932 - 1933 allegedly by Prescott Bush .
Fast - forward to 2008 , 76 years later ( that magic number tied to 1776 ) and Senator Barack Obama and John McCain ’s run for the presidency .
Senator Barack Obama and has begun to sound increasingly like the Bushites .
There are now several theories concerning his about face , but this in the face of Iraqi ’s who were once called Bushite Puppets jumping on the Get out of Iraq Bandwagon , is a bit disconcerting .
One of the theories concerns Obama 's giving the voters a no - difference in war philosophies and winning over the soft - core moderate Republicans .
That , as the pressure mounts on Bush , as more and more Iraqis , former Bush followers , side in with the troop removal timeline .
We already know for what John McCain stands , anything that will get him elected , is what he will embrace .
Including sucking up to GW Bush , once and forever his mortal enemy .
So , let us look closer at Senator Barack Obama and the source of the philosophies they both espouse seemingly without clue one of the origins of their ideas .
One should know that sticking to one ’s guns and stated philosophies wins followers and places pressure on the opposition , but new recruits into the Obama camp are edging toward the right , and risking loosing the left and the possible converts on the left edge of the Right , and much of the Middle , right - Moderates .
Bush , for instance has been nothing but consistent for nearly eight years , ( consistently , morally incorrect ) except for lately , but Obama , recently has been waffling and moving to the Right .
Whoever is giving him advice lately , needs to GO and fast !
The mistake of the decade was listening to Pelosi / Emmanuel on Impeachment .
That prissy / sissy , wusses approach is placing Obama closer to McCain .
Now it needs to be understood , what the mistaken , erroneous , unintelligent , loser mentality , ( which blew the 12000 , 2004 elections ) have raised their ugly heads for the third time .
Oh , it was not simply the alleged Donna Brazille , lack of chess knowledge , lack of demographic knowledge , lack of common sense and seeming shrinking Violet , shaky , pussycat mentality .
No , instead it was that indeed , plus an amateurism , as though these three campaigns were being run by IQ deficient , adolescents , with no comprehension of the magnitude of the world at stake , here - clueless comes to mind .
Obama , a few months ago , amidst a firestorm of anger against Blackwater and other mercenary firms , appears to have been missing the news or camping in the oxygen deprived heights of Mount Everest - 29,028 feet high .
What in the name of all that is wise was he thinking .
From where are these ideas originating ?
Is n’t it a kick in the head when politicians are successful up to a point and they suddenly change directions after ” Bolstering ” their Staff with losers , whose last three attempts at victory , would allow a few six - year ’s olds , to outplay them .
Why has he changed positions ?
Is it because Hillary will be his VP and he wishes also to attract her supporters who adhered to a harder line on defense ?
Or is it the creeping hand of unknown agents working under cover , without raising the suspicions of either candidate ?
Moreover , as many nations , fall in behind the Senator ’s previous positions , including Iraqi , Bushite Stalwarts , victory there for the taking , they once again , as they did in 2000 and 2004 , are they once more , snatching defeat from the jaws of victory ?
Are some of their advisors “ Plants , ” whose sole job is to have them fail ?
Oh , some will say , that these are the things we must have him say to win over a segment of the Bush vote .
Geeps !
You already have , by virtue of your previous positions , won that - the guy ’s approval rating is 28 % , and that is being inherited for the most part by , his opponent , whose rating is 39 % and falling , that is , until lately .
It has halted its downward spiral and is in a holding pattern seemingly about to rebound not on what McCain is saying , most of which is lame , but over what Obama is saying and doing .
Keep something in mind about the Berlin speech , German citizens do n’t vote in the USA .
We wanted change , and instead we are getting back what we threw away , Donna Brazile , Solis Doyle - fired by Hillary Clinton , has joined Obama , and Communications Director Robert Gibbs who was previously press secretary for John Kerry 's 2004 presidential campaign , has gone on board also .
One certainly cannot fault fund raising Whiz , Chief Hyatt board member Penny Pritzker , because by the end of March , Obama had raised over $ 235 million during the course of his campaign .
It is , however , not the money of which I speak , it is the seeming to embrace the things people hate Bush for , and escape the things , people supported him for up until Hillary left the race .
Now he speaks of moving troops from Iraq to Afghanistan ( Was it true that Big Oil wanted Bill to protect the oil Lines , but that Bill Clinton refused to Bribe the Taliban to lay - off - sabotaging the pipe - lines ?
Would they have cooperated and grabbed the “ Protection money ? ”
Was Bill ’s refusal to give over the cash , the true reason why he was impeached ?
His refusal to bow to Big Oil ’s request that we fund a buy - off , pay - off , protection racket of $ 2 billion to the Taliban , to “ Guard ” the oil pipe - line , was especially bitter since the Taliban made several visits to Crawford during the Clinton years ?
Is it also true that the Fascists , holding Nazi War Criminal cash , in opposition and violation of the Trading With The Enemies Act of 1941 , built a Fascist infrastructure in South America and the USA and the Clinton Persecution by all parties was a large step in the current fascist regime and a continuation of the 1,000 year Reign of the Third Reich ?
Are , therefore , Obama and McCain unknowingly being used by forces indebted to a united fascism ?
And if so , for whom do we vote , if both key candidates are , without their own consciousness , going to be manipulated by forces illegal , according to violations of the Trading With The Enemies Act of 1941 ?
Is that Act still available to prosecute under ?
If so , since the US government once froze all funds of Prescott Bush ’s companies which were allegedly Trading with the enemy , and since in violation of that law Bush held money in escrow for a Nazi War Criminal until 1951 , when that alleged war criminal could settle into an estate in South America , under the Racketeering Act , the Ricoh Act ,
could not it be said that profits earned while holding such money , was the root of the current Bush family fortune , which funded all of the other enterprises including the Carlisle Fund ?
If so , then could not the Justice department freeze , seize and confiscate all of their present wealth ?
If indeed , there was a substantial sum of money inherited by any of the Bush family from Bush ’s grandfather , Prescott who also allegedly attempted to hire the 500,000 WW I Veterans in Washington camping in the parks seeking their pensions , to assassinate FDR , why could not the government seek Post - Humus prosecution and freeze seize all Bush family wealth ?
If , undercover , agents have been secretly working , financed by Fascist agents from South Americ a , those same agents whose goal in WW II was to confiscate Mideast oil supplies under the able charge of the Desert Fox Erwin Rommel General , are they at work in the Bush regime ?
Was not Richard Cheney a great admirer of Prescott Bush ?
Are not the goals of the New World Order war criminals the same as those of the Nazi ’s under Hitler , to grab the oil and rule the world ?
Are not the every actions of the Bushites , the same as those of Hitler ?
If , indeed , all roads lead to domination of world oil supplies that goal was inherited by the current Bushites , and their undercover agents have infiltrated , without the knowledge of either candidate , are we not locked into their goals no matter whom we elect ?
Is it not , then immediately necessary to destroy the vast sources of wealth which lead to such activities which goals have already disabled an American president , ( Clinton ) destroyed the Constitution and Bill of rights , stolen two elections and maybe even the Texas governorship twice ?
Have you noticed that neither candidate has said one word about eliminating the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , or the Patriot Act ?
Therefore , is it not mandatory that those two laws be made impotent and that we begin an investigation into seizing all Bush family wealth ?
This sounds like an old conspiracy theory movie plot , but my experience is that everything which ever occurred in the history of man , was the result of careful long range planning , which some call conspiracies and other ’s , who never plan anything and whose education in history is sadly lacking , and which suffer from IQ deficiencies , call , with hostility , conspiracy theories .
So , the question is : Should the US Government Begin Confiscation of all Bush Family wealth under the Trading With The Enemies Act of 1941 , and the Ricoh Confiscation Act , at once ?
SHALL WE PURSUE THEM BY ALL MEANS POSSIBLE , OR LET THEM DESTROY AMERICA AS THEY SEE FIT ?
HELL YES !
GO GET THE BUSH WEALTH !
HELL NO !
LET THEM KEEP IT !
HELL YES !
GO GET THE BUSH WEALTH !
HELL NO !
LET THEM KEEP IT !

One of the letters from Ted Howard to his wife Molly A man spent 15 years piecing together 2,000 fragments of love letters to his late wife which she tore up when she caught someone reading them .
Ted Howard , 82 , wrote 98 letters to Molly during the seven years he spent travelling Europe as a farm worker .
When she found someone reading them in 1953 she tore them up .
Mr Howard , of Ramsey in Cambridgeshire , began putting the pieces back together in 1993 and has just completed the notes , three years after his wife died .
He wrote the love letters on hotel writing paper as he travelled the UK , Ireland , France and Holland in the late 1940s and early 1950s .
But his wife tore each one into more than 20 pieces creating more than 2,000 fragments , some smaller than a thumbnail .
It was love at first sight
Ted Howard
He started by separating corner and centre pieces and progressed , putting them together spending about an hour every day over 15 years .
One letter ends : " Well , my dear , I am looking forward to seeing you again .
" It seems months since Sunday when I last saw you .
There does not seem to be a lot more to write about , my love , so until we meet again , I send you all my love , from your ever loving sweetheart , Ted . "
Mr Howard said : " I still miss Molly terribly but having the memories helps me through .
Ted Howard spent 15 years piecing together the notes " The letters brought back so many good times . "
He now plans to write a book based on the letters which will be dedicated to his wife .
The retired farm worker and machinery demonstrator , said : " It was love at first sight .
" No two ways about it .
I was at a village feast ( fair ) and this girl jumped off the carousel and came careering into me .
" It turned out to be Molly .
That was 19 July 1948 . "
Molly was 18 at the time and Ted was 23 .
They married in 1955 and went on to have three children and six grandchildren .
Ted wrote his autobiography before attempting to write a book about the letters .
His autobiography , Life on the Fen Edge , is due to published by Bound Biographies .
Ted developed his writing skills by studying literacy courses with learndirect .
His work was recognised when he won the Special Judging Panel Award at the regional learndirect achievement awards .

What are these ?
To recap , tonight we ’ve been discussing Sen.
McCain ’s bizarre interview in which he appeared not to know who Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero was and , in an effort to wing it , assumed he must be another left - wing , anti-American leader from Latin America .
In the Spanish press analysis of the interview , at least , many seem uncertain whether McCain even knows where Spain is , though that strikes me as a bit excessive .
Just how this will get played in the American press will be interesting to see because it cuts to two of McCain ’s key vulnerabilities — the first being his apparently rather shaky foreign policy experience if ca n’t identify the leader of a major NATO ally and the second being what I guess we would call declining mental acuity .
Now , bear in mind that so far we ’ve only been able to clearly hear the audio of the interview in the translations provided by the Spanish radio station that conducted the interview .
But the interview , which was conducted entirely in English , was recorded .
I ’d assume that if this story gets any traction some media outlet here will prevail on the Spanish news organization to release the English language recording of the interview .
All of the Spanish language speakers I ’ve heard from who ’ve listened to the interview think there ’s no doubt that McCain just got confused and did n’t know who Zapatero was or possibly did n’t even know where Spain was .
But again , in the released audio , you just hear the translator , with the original English sufficiently far in the background as to be largely inaudible .
So we probably wo n’t know just what happened until we hear the original .

Contending that the government had suppressed evidence that could help a young man facing life in prison , a prosecutor has quit the war crimes tribunals here , several military defense lawyers said Wednesday .
Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld quit the case -- and the Office of Military Commissions -- after growing increasingly concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Mohammed Jawad and his legal team , according to Michael J. Berrigan , deputy chief defense counsel for the commissions .
Vandeveld , an Army reservist , said in a four - page declaration filed with the court that “ potentially exculpatory evidence has not been provided ” to the defense .
Jawad , now about 23 , was arrested in 2002 near Kabul .
He is charged with attempting to commit murder in violation of the law of war for allegedly throwing a grenade into a jeep transporting troops , injuring two soldiers and an interpreter .
His trial is set for December .

His Pentagon - appointed defense attorney , Air Force Maj .
David Frakt , also said that the prosecutor had quit in recent days over significant concerns about the case .
“ He was uncomfortable being a prosecutor under the conditions , and [ his superiors ] told him to do his job , ” Berrigan said , adding that Vandeveld then took his concerns to higher authorities but was rebuffed .
Both defense lawyers said Vandeveld had spelled out his allegations in the sealed affidavit .
Vandeveld said in his declaration that prosecutors knew Jawad may have been drugged before the attack and that the Afghan Interior Ministry said two other men had confessed to the same crime .
Hearings in Jawad ’s case are being held today and Friday .
Frakt said he had moved to call Vandeveld as a defense witness ; the prosecutor had indicated he would testify about his ethical concerns and about how he wanted to offer Jawad a plea deal that would allow him to walk free in the near future .
But Vandeveld ’s superiors rejected the plea deal and blocked his testimony , Frakt said , adding that he would ask the judge , Army Col .
Steve Henley , to compel him to testify .

The assertions by Berrigan and Frakt were denied Wednesday evening by Army Col. Lawrence J. Morris , lead prosecutor for the military commissions .
Morris said Vandeveld told him he was quitting for personal reasons , and he would not discuss whether his office had rejected any proposed plea deal for Jawad .
He described Vandeveld as a disgruntled prosecutor “ who was disappointed that his superiors did not agree with his recommendations in the case . ”
“ There are no grounds for his ethical qualms , ” Morris said .
Several prosecutors have quit or asked to be reassigned in protest , including Air Force Col .
Morris Davis , the former chief prosecutor for the military commissions .
He went public with claims that he had been pressured by politically appointed senior Defense officials to pursue cases deemed “ sexy ” in the run-up to the 2008 elections .

The Jawad case is one of several in which the Pentagon ’s former legal advisor to military commissions , Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann , has been banned from playing an oversight role because of charges that he lost his neutrality by withholding exculpatory information in recommending the charges .
A Pentagon official said that Vandeveld had defended Hartmann against the undue - influence allegations in the Jawad case in recent weeks but lost , and that the general had retaliated against him , causing the prosecutor emotional distress and prompting him to quit and go public with his concerns .
In his declaration , Vandeveld said military prosecutors routinely withhold exculpatory evidence from the defense in terrorism cases .

A state judge in Minnesota has ruled that Wal - Mart Stores violated state laws on rest breaks and other wage matters more than two million times and as a result could face more than $ 2 billion in fines .
The judge has threatened to impose a $ 1,000 penalty for each violation .
The judge also ruled on Monday that Wal - Mart owed $ 6.5 million to 56,000 current and former employees because of contractual violations , including a failure to give workers promised rest breaks at least 1.5 million times .
The judge also found that Wal - Mart managers in Minnesota had systematically broken the law by having employees take in - house training while off the clock .
“ It ’s been a long time coming , ” said William R. Sieben , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , who filed the lawsuit nearly seven years ago .
“ It ’s only through a decision like this that Wal - Mart can be held to its contractual agreements and to complying with Minnesota law . ”
The judge , Robert R. King Jr. of the First Judicial District in Dakota County , ruled in favor of Wal - Mart on several important issues in the class - action lawsuit , finding that Wal - Mart managers did not routinely make cashiers and stock personnel work off the clock while doing their regular jobs .
AFTER the band was chosen and the napkins color - coordinated to match her shoes , Kacey Knauer , a bride - to - be , had another critical matter to address : her skin , and the skin of the nine women in her bridal party .
So Ms. Knauer , the 35 - year - old owner of TempTrends , a staffing agency in Manhattan , invited her nearest and dearest  including her mother and future mother - in - law  for a night out at the TriBeCa MedSpa , replete with mimosas and cupcakes .
An aesthetician assessed each woman ’s face and devised a treatment plan  a quick chemical peel , say , or an injection of a wrinkle - filler .
Or maybe , for a bridesmaid with age spots , a series of Fraxel laser treatments over months , allowing for recovery time .
For Ms. Knauer , who will be married in December , cosmetic interventions for herself and her entourage are as vital as the centerpieces or food .
“ If I were 25 or 26 and getting married , a bracelet , necklace or matching earrings would be fine , ” she said .
But at 35 ?
“ Giving them a bracelet is n’t as special as spending an evening together .
Plus , as you get older , everyone is more conscientious about their skin and appearance , ” she said .
“ Giving them something for themselves  as opposed to something that they ’ll never wear again  is more meaningful . ”
Obama : McCain focused on biography over economy The Associated Press
Published : Friday September 5 , 2008
Print This Email This DURYEA , Pa. -- Democrat Barack Obama called Republican rival John McCain 's acceptance speech the final piece of an out - of - touch convention that focused on its nominee 's biography instead of the struggles of the middle class .
" If you watched the Republican National Convention over the last three days , you would n't know that we have the highest unemployment in five years because they did n't say a thing about what is going on with the middle class , " Obama told workers at a specialty glass factory .
" They spent a lot of time talking about John McCain 's biography , which we all honor , " the Illinois senator said .
" They talked about me a lot , in less than respectful terms .
What they did n't talk about is you and what you 're seeing in your lives and what you 're going through , or what your friends or your neighbors are going through . "
Obama pointed out that the nation 's unemployment rate zoomed to a five - year high of 6.1 percent in August , according to a government jobs report issued Friday .
" We 've now lost 605,000 jobs since the beginning of this year , " Obama said .
" We 've had eight consecutive months of job losses . "
Obama seized on the new jobs report as part of his strategy to tie McCain to President Bush 's stewardship of the economy and to connect with voters who fear their jobs will disappear .
There is no shortage of such voters in Rust Belt Pennsylvania .
In accepting the Republican presidential nomination , McCain spoke at length about his biography , his love of country and his principles for governing .
Obama mocked McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis for saying the election would be decided more by voters ' views about the candidates than about issues .
" Personalities ?
I mean , I 've got a pretty good personality .
But that 's not why I 'm running for president , " Obama said to laughter .
In two days of campaigning in Pennsylvania , Obama has been reaching out to middle - class and working class voters who preferred Hillary Rodham Clinton to him during the Pennsylvania primary .
" I have to say to you : I 'm not perfect , but the one thing people can't deny is that for my entire public life , I 've been fighting for folks like you , ordinary , middle - class families and working families , helping them getting ahead , " Obama said , borrowing a theme that helped Clinton win in these rural , largely white areas .

Just before lunchtime on May 4th , 1988 , at a facility near Henderson , Nevada , a panicked maintenance crew could be seen dashing away from the site of the Pacific Engineering Production Company , also known as PEPCON .
Behind them , a moderate but ambitious - looking fire was establishing itself in a large storage lot .
The crew had been repairing a wind - damaged steel - and - fiberglass building when a stray spark from their welder somehow managed to set fire to the structure .
The men fetched some nearby water hoses and attempted to douse the flames , but the flourishing fire mocked their efforts , and soon began to fondle the 55 gallon drums stored nearby .
With this alarming development , the crew abandoned their hoses and gave up the fight in favor of a hasty departure .
The workers knew exactly what was in these barrels , and they did n’t wish to be present to observe how it would react to the flames .
At that time , PEPCON was one of the only US producers of the chemical ammonium perchlorate , a key ingredient in the rocket fuel used for space shuttle boosters and Titan missiles .
This white granular compound is a powerful oxidizer , and its purpose is to accelerate rocket fuel combustion .
Also present at the facility were bulk quantities of other hazardous materials used in manufacturing , such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid .
There were over four thousand tons of ammonium perchlorate in the storage area that day , so the anxiety - stricken workers fled with great enthusiasm .
The Challenger explosion fifteen months earlier had prompted NASA to freeze the space shuttle program pending investigation , yet the United States government continued to contract PEPCON at pre-Challenger quantities .
Consequently , the containers full of the unused fuel component had slowly accumulated , making the site pregnant with stored energy .
Over the years , the entire facility had become peppered with residue from the ammonium perchlorate .
Stiff winds on the day of the maintenance workers ’ visit conspired against them , and quickly turned a small welding accident into a brilliant orange fireball .
As news of the fire spread , most of the employees rushed to evacuate the six buildings , but a man named Roy Westerfield stayed behind and called 911 :
Dispatcher : Fire department .
Westerfield : Emergency .
We need the fire department , all you can get here .
Immediately .
Dispatcher :
What ’s the problem ?
Westerfield : Oh , we ’ve got … everything ’s on fire .
PEPCON site ablaze
At about the same time , the chief of the Clark County Fire Department noticed the column of smoke on the horizon , and ordered his units to go to the location immediately .
He and a passenger climbed into his car and raced to the scene ahead of the fire trucks .
The intense fireball became visible from about a mile away , belching its column of acrid smoke into the sky .
Soon the pair began to see dozens of fear - stricken PEPCON employees on the roadsides ; men and women hurrying away from the burning facility on foot in spite of the mid-day desert heat .
A few minutes later , as the chief neared the cluster of flaming buildings , he and his passenger were blinded by an abrupt flash .
The car rocked and windows exploded as the vehicle was slammed by a deafening shock wave .
As the explosion ’s echoes slowly faded , the fire chief stopped the car to assess the situation and tend to a few cuts caused by the hail of broken glass .
Moments later a badly damaged vehicle approached from the direction of the plant , and its driver paused alongside the chief just long enough to warn him that the worst of the explosions were probably yet to come .
Realizing that the inferno had grown far beyond his department ’s fire - suppression capabilities , the chief turned his car around and headed back towards Henderson .
The fire engine crews had reached the same dismal conclusion when they observed the explosion during their approach .
It was clear that there were serious safety concerns in moving any closer , so the firefighters pulled their trucks off the road about a mile from the disaster - in - progress , and watched the towering flames from afar .
A mile away in another direction , an engineering crew had been performing routine maintenance on a television tower on Black Mountain when they spotted the fire and began filming .
About four minutes after the first major explosion , the engineers watched in awe as the PEPCON site completely disappeared in a spectacular burst of energy that dwarfed the initial blast .
The mushroom cloud from the second blast
Their vantage point afforded them a perfect view of the compression wave as it recklessly radiated across the desert , mowing down brush and demolishing a marshmallow factory adjacent to PEPCON .
Due to the distance the sound of the blast did n’t reach them for several seconds … but when it did , it was thunderous .
The Clark County fire chief was still trying to put distance between himself and the facility when the violent detonation struck .
The blast wave swept in rapidly from behind and clobbered his wounded car , momentarily smothering him in an avalanche of noise and pressure .
When the moment passed , he was astonished to find that the vehicle was still somewhat operational in spite of the significant bruising .
He continued his retreat and eventually limped his injured automobile past the columns of idling fire engines , their pulverized windows littering the roadway .
By the time he reached town and found his way to the hospital , there were already hundreds of people there awaiting treatment .
The explosion one and a half miles away had dislodged parts of buildings and shattered windows in town , causing many instances of trauma and lacerations .
On the horizon , a plume of smoke rose 1,000 feet into the sky , and the column was said to be visible from as far as one hundred miles away .
Some distant observers reportedly wondered whether this mushroom cloud indicated that the long - running Cold War had finally progressed into the Hot War that Americans feared .
The frenzied inferno at PEPCON finally calmed once the explosions had consumed the majority of the fuel .
The cataclysmic blasts had ripped a hole in the ground and ruptured a gas line , but the resulting 200 - foot - tall flame was easily starved to death by shutting off the gas feed from a station a mile away .
Investigators arrived to survey the damage , and they found utter devastation .
PEPCON ’s six buildings were totally destroyed , and where they had stood was nothing but twisted metal and a fifteen - foot - deep crater .
The neighboring marshmallow factory fared no better , having been unable to absorb the incredible pressure wave .
Many structures in Henderson also suffered damage , mostly in the form of shattered windows , cracked walls , and doors that were blown from their hinges .
Some buildings as far as ten miles away were affected .
Roy Westerfield
Though there were almost 400 injuries reported ⁠ — both from ground zero and from Henderson residents ⁠— surprisingly there were only two deaths .
One was a worker confined to a wheelchair who had been unable to exit from the PEPCON building quickly enough .
The other was Roy Westerfield , the very man who had made the original 911 call .
He had been handicapped by the effects of polio , leaving him unable to walk very well .
It is generally believed that he opted to stay behind and alert the authorities , knowing that escape was unlikely .
Further investigation into the event found that the destructive energy from the larger explosion was roughly equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT , or one kiloton .
It caused seismograph needles to dance as far away as Colorado , where the sensitive equipment measured the distant tremor as a 3.5 on the Richter scale .
PEPCON lawyers responded quickly , attempting pin the blame on Southwest Gas company .
The lawyers claimed that the natural gas fire occurred first , subsequently causing the ammonium perchlorate explosions .
Three days after the disaster , one of these attorneys claimed , “ Nothing ignites ammonium perchlorate .
It does not burn .
It is not flammable . ”
Though the compound was not considered to be an extreme explosive threat before the PEPCON disaster , chemists pointed out that the attorney ’s grasp of chemistry must be as flimsy as his grasp of ethics .
They described the chemical as “ unstable and highly flammable . ”
PEPCON had only $ 1 million in insurance , a policy which was grossly insufficient to pay for the damage to others ’ property .
A colossal courtroom battle ensued , involving dozens of insurance companies and over fifty law firms .
The outcome of this massive orgy of justice was one million pages of depositions , and a $ 71 million settlement which was divided among the victims and their families .
PEPCON never rebuilt the Henderson site .
The company changed its name to Western Electrochemical Co. and built a new ammonium perchlorate plant in Cedar City , Utah which remains in operation today .
But their safety record has certainly improved since the 1988 disaster ; to date , there has only been one deadly explosion at the new facility .

Note that Thompson still has a chance for a retrial , only due to court sanctions the motion must me submitted by a member of the Florida Bar in good standing , and I do n't know that anyone wants to touch this one .
It 's also worth noting that along with disbarment , Thompson has been ordered to reimburse the Florida Bar fees amounting to $ 43,675.35 .

Complainant(s ) Respondent(s )
The referee has filed a corrected report recommending that respondent , John Bruce Thompson , be permanently disbarred without leave to apply for readmission to The Florida Bar .
Respondent submitted a petition for review of the referee 's report .
The Clerk did not accept the petition for review for filing .
This action was in accord with this Court 's opinion dated March 20 , 2008 , which sanctioned respondent for abusive filings and barred him from filing on his own behalf .
The sanction opinion provided , in pertinent part : " the Clerk of this Court is hereby instructed to reject for filing any future pleadings , petitions , motions , documents , or other filings submitted by John Bruce Thompson , unless signed by a member in good standing of The Florida Bar other than himself . "
Fla . Bar v. Thompson , 979 So. 2d 917 , 921 ( Fla. 2008 ) .
The opinion also noted : " in sanctioning respondent , we are requiring him to retain qualified counsel so that his arguments might be properly presented through the appropriate procedures in the appropriate forum .
We do not limit such counsel 's ability to challenge the referee 's findings and recommendations on review . "
Id. at 919 .
Ignoring this bar on self - submitted filings , respondent has submitted numerous filings in violation of the sanction opinion , including the petition for review of the referee 's report .
The Clerk properly rejected each of these submissions .
Thus , there being no authorized petition for review filed , and the time period to seek review has passed , the Court has treated this as an uncontested case .
The Court has reviewed the 169 - page corrected report of the referee filed on July 16 , 2008 , for sufficiency and has determined that permanent disbarment is merited on this record .
( This report is posted on the Court 's public website ) .
The report Case Nos. SC07 - 80 and SC07 - 354 Page
Two details the extensive misconduct of respondent and his complete lack of remorse .
In her report , the referee states :
Over a very extended period of time involving a number of totally unrelated cases and individuals , [ r ] espondent has demonstrated a pattern of conduct to strike out harshly , extensively , repeatedly and willfully to simply try to bring as much difficulty , distraction and anguish to those he considers in opposition to his causes .
He does not proceed within the guidelines of appropriate professional behavior , but rather uses other means available to intimidate , harass , or bring public disrepute to those whom he perceives oppose him .
Among the extensive findings of fact presented in the report , the Court takes particular note of the following which occurred during the three - year period at issue in five counts in these cases : ( 1 ) respondent made false statements of material fact to courts and repeatedly violated a court order ; ( 2 ) respondent communicated the subject of representation directly with clients of opposing counsel ; ( 3 ) respondent engaged in prohibited ex parte communications ; ( 4 ) respondent publicized and sent hundreds of pages of vitriolic and disparaging missives , letters , faxes , and press releases , to the affected individuals ; ( 5 ) respondent targeted an individual who was not involved with respondent in any way , merely due to " the position [ the individual ] holds in state and national politics ; " ( 6 ) respondent falsely , recklessly , and publicly accused a judge as being amenable to the " fixing " of cases ; ( 7 ) respondent sent courts inappropriate and offensive sexual materials ; ( 8 ) respondent falsely and publicly accused various attorneys and their clients of engaging in a conspiracy / enterprise involving " the criminal distribution of sexual materials to minors " and attempted to get prosecuting authorities to charge these attorneys and their clients for racketeering and extortion ; ( 9 ) respondent harassed the former client of an attorney in an effort to get the client to use its influence to persuade the attorney to withdraw a defamation suit filed by the attorney against respondent ; and ( 10 ) respondent retaliated against attorneys who filed Bar complaints against him for his unethical conduct by asserting to their clients , government officials , politicians , the media , female lawyers in their law firm , employees , personal friends , acquaintances , and their wives , that the attorneys were criminal Case Nos. SC07 - 80 and SC07 - 354 Page
Three pornographers who objectify women .
The Court concludes that the facts , as even more extensively detailed in the referee 's report , support the referee 's numerous recommendations as to guilt .
The referee cited various cases indicating that disbarment is an appropriate sanction and recommended permanent disbarment because " [ r ] espondent has repeatedly stated in these proceedings that he will not change his conduct " and she " finds no evidence whatsoever to indicate that [ r ] espondent is amenable to rehabilitation , or even remotely appreciates the basis upon which a need or purpose for such rehabilitation is warranted . "
Indeed , as noted by the referee : Respondent has repeatedly failed to follow the appropriate rules and orders throughout these disciplinary proceedings as evidenced by the granting of the Bar 's Motion for Sanctions and the Supreme Court of Florida 's orders of February 19 , 2008 and March 20 , 2008 , wherein the Court found that [ r ] espondent " abused the legal system by submitting numerous , frivolous and inappropriate filings , " despite being warned not to do so .
In fact , the referee reported that respondent walked out of her courtroom at the final hearing in this matter because she would not allow him to " to turn the [ d ] isciplinary proceeding into a press conference . "
Based on the record before it , the Court agrees that respondent is not amenable to rehabilitation .
Further , the Court approves the referee 's recommendation that permanent disbarment is the appropriate sanction .
The Court approves the corrected referee 's report and John Bruce Thompson is permanently disbarred , effective thirty days from the date of this order so that respondent can close out his practice and protect the interests of existing clients .
If respondent notifies the Court in writing that he is no longer practicing and does not need the thirty days to protect existing clients , this Court will enter an order making the permanent disbarment effective immediately .
Respondent shall accept no new business from the date this order is filed .
Judgment is entered for The Florida Bar , 651 East Jefferson Street , Tallahassee , Florida 32399-2300 , for recovery of costs from John Bruce Thompson in the amount of $ 43,675.35 , for which sum let execution issue .
Case Nos. SC07 - 80 and SC07 - 354 Page Four
Not final until time expires to file motion for rehearing , and if filed , determined .
The filing of a motion for rehearing shall not alter the effective date of this permanent disbarment .
Consistent with this Court 's sanction order , no motion for rehearing will be considered unless signed by a member in good standing of The Florida Bar other than respondent .

Continuing along with the uncreative titles , here ’s a veggie stew I put together using an abundance of fresh produce from the farmer ’s market .
It ’s as simple as chopping stuff up and throwing it in a pot with some seasonings , but it does make for a wonderfully savoury meal despite the lack of meat .
Most of the umami comes from the onions and tomatoes so make sure you get the onions a bit caramelized and you use nice vine ripened tomatoes .
I ’ve always been too lazy to scrape out the seeds of tomatoes ( plus it seems like such a waste ) , but for those like me , you ’ve actually been doing the right thing .
It turns out that most of the glutamates ( yes , the natural cousin to monosodium glutamate … aka MSG ) , hangs out in the jelly that surrounds the seeds .
By scraping out the seeds , you ’re actually scraping out a lot of the flavour .
I served this with some red and yellow Quinoa for some extra protein , but it would also work great with some cous cous or flat bread .
One of the great things about this is that you can really use just about any veggie .
Squash , okra , green beans , carrots , or pumpkin would all work with the tomatoes and onions .

KBC : Recently , my sister had a child .
A few months before hand , she had a baby shower .
I was invited , because my sister likes getting presents .
I got them Hungry Hungry Hippos .
The reason for this ?
My brother - in - law , when young , was a terror , and his mother was an actual single mother .
The father left the day of conception .
KBC : One day , his mother got fed up with my brother - in - laws antics , she said ' That 's it , grab one toy , you 're going to the orphanage ! '
So he grabs HHH , they walk around a mall a bit , he 's clutching that thing to him saying ' I * sob * Do n't * Sob * wanna * sob * go to the orphan * sob * age ! '
KBC : And then they go home .
But this story is n't about my brother - in - law , or his mother , or even my nephew , really .
It 's about the baby shower , when I went out to buy their gift - Hungry Hungry Hippos .
KBC : I go to Walmart , because it 's the only thing open at the time I went out .
I go to the toy section , look at the Lego , crappy excuse for action figures , then grab the game .
After that , I start heading for the cash registers .
KBC :
On the way towards the cashes , I pass the pharmacy and realize , ' Hey , I need condoms . '
Because , well , condoms expire after four years .
So , I grab a box of condoms , Tiny Trojans ( they invaded in a pony , not a horse ) and head to the cashes with my HHH in tow .
KBC : While waiting at the cash , I see their impulse buys .
Impulse buy at this cash was gummy bears .
This reminded me about a story I heard that eating too many gummy bears can turn your pee black .
So I picked up some .
For science .
( Post - script : It did n't )
KBC : I 'm waiting for the cashier , and there 's two people in front of me .
The cashier is this old , 80 or older blue haired bat who likes talking .
She rung the items up for the people in front of me and talked to them for a few minutes , despite their wanting to pay and leave .
And then I get served .
KBC : She looks at me and smiles , then looks at my items .
Then looks at me .
And looks at my items .
And then just glares at me .
I 'm standing right in front of her , after a long 12 hour shift , in a trenchcoat , not having shaved for a week .
That 's when it hits me , I just won the condom game , where you grab three items , one being condoms , and see if you can get a reaction .
You know , coathanger , garbage bags , condoms .
Something like that .
KBC :
By the way she 's looking at me , she must think I 'm a child molester .
So I say to her .
' Oh , uh , I 'm new in town ... do you know where I can get a white , panelled van ? '
And her jaw drops .
She scans the items , as she had n't yet , as fast as fast can be , I give her the money and she pretty much throws it back at me .
KBC : I thank her for her service , and start to leave the store .
Before I leave , I look back , and I see her , on the phone , looks like she 's yelling , using her hand beside her to try and judge height next to her , probably giving my description to someone .
And that 's why I 'm not allowed at the east end Wal - mart again .
END .

I am honored by his decision to contribute to our blog .
In his own words , here are 10 life lessons he has learned over the last 40 years .
Key to a Happy Marriage : Listen to the story , then listen some more , then listen even more .
Do n’t try to offer brainy solutions .
Occasionally state in a quiet , respectful tone the words , “ Yes , Dear ” .
You are what you eat .
Read about nutrition – certain foods agree with you , others do n’t .
Experiment with your own body chemistry .
I try to avoid coffee and sugar .
The French have an aphorism that you do n’t appreciate something until you do n’t have it anymore .
In 40 years from now what is it that you will regret not having accomplished , appreciated or attempted ?
Do it , appreciate it , attempt it NOW !
The greatest “ adventure ” is the ability to INQUIRE , TO ASK QUESTIONS .
Sometimes in the process of inquiry , the search is more significant than the answers .
Answers come from other people , from the universe of knowledge and history , and from the intuition and deep wisdom inside yourself .
Physical exercise is important at any age to reduce stress and optimize well being .
Include the full range of cardiovascular , muscle building and stretching –yoga .
Join a health club with a swimming pool .
When you ca n’t get to the health club , take 30 minute brisk walks , breathe and be in the moment .
Life gives and takes away .
During difficult times , be committed to resolving problems , but also lighten up and ride the waves of impermanence .
What is a monster problem today will be a forgotten thought in the future .
Achievements are the result of preparation .
Supporting , guiding , and making contributions to other people is one of life ’s greatest rewards .
In order to get , you have to give .
Time is of the essence .
You are born and you will die .
Do n’t waste the time in between .
Use a time management system to control events , rather than have events controlling you .

Shakespeare ’s character Hamlet tells us that “ nothing is good or bad as thinking makes it so ” .
As a problem solver , or at any point to gain clarity with your own mind and emotional state , try this inquiry from the author Byron Katie :
What is the “ story ” that is going on in my mind at this moment ?
Is it true ?
How do I know that it is true ?
What is the situation like with this story ?
What would my life be like at this point without this story ?
The Federal Reserve will expand its lending facilities in the wake of the likely demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , taking a wider array of securities , including equities , as collateral for its loans , the central bank said late Sunday .
The move , another landmark step in the Fed 's efforts to address the deepening credit crisis , is meant to calm markets as they head into one of the most perilous trading environments in decades with Lehman 's massive market positions on the verge of being unwound .

" One of the most important resources is time , " Rove said about the 2008 presidential election .
Rove said Obama had not seized the narrowing election days to " advance his case . "
For instance , Obama linked the country 's economic problems to Bush and McCain instead of showing " he 's up to the job " with a specific proposal .
Rove said he felt Bush was a " successful " president but they had " done a lousy job of explaining " why he was .
Rove listed the million dollar AIDS relief fund for Africa , the accountability of the No Child Left Behind performance program , large amounts of money invested in alternative energy and privatizing social security .

design and design principles category : programming tags : design principles , java , ood , python
Update : Modified the title to make it a little shorter .
This post talks about applying Open Closed Principle , Liskov 's Substitution Principle , Dependency Inversion Principle and Interface Segregation Principle in Python , coming from a Java programming background .
Background :
A few days ago I blogged about Commentary on Python from a Java programming perspective .
In that post I avoided getting into the specific details with code snippets etc since I wanted to focus on how it feels .
One of the observations I made was that I thought coming from a Java background , that background helped me from a class design perspective .
I ran into a couple of posts from the ObjectMentor blog , namely The Open - Closed Principle for Languages with Open Classes , and The Liskov Substitution Principle for " Duck - Typed " Languages .
The gentleman behind ObjectMentor is Robert Martin , who wrote a number of articles in the mid 90s related to these design principles .
( Links to PDF : Open Closed Principle , Liskov Substitution Principle , Dependency Inversion Principle and Interface Segregation Principle )
_ Sidebar : A Hat Tip to Robert Martin : _ Robert Martin used to contribute heavily to a number of newsgroups including comp.lang .c++ and comp.object in the early and mid 90s .
I must confess a tremendous debt to him since my view of OO Design in those days was substantially influenced by his writings , and the design principles he talked about and later published as articles .
These continue to guide my thinking about Object Oriented Design to this day .
A hat tip to Robert Martin .
He would n't know me or recall me , but I used to participate in some threads occasionally , and read him regularly and that helped me tremendously learn so much about OOD and how to apply it in C ++.
Having had applied these principles a countless number of times , in C++ and Java , I thought it would be an interesting exercise to document how class design changes even when the same underlying design principles are applied to a dynamic language ( in this case - Python ) .
The remainder of this post summarises the design principles and the examples that Robert Martin talked about in his articles , and how these get implemented perhaps a little differently when used in static typed ( Java ) and dynamically typed ( Python ) languages .
His original source snippets in the C++ language can be found in the articles I have hyperlinked to earlier .
Open Closed Principle ( OCP )
Software entities ( classes , modules , functions etc. ) should be open for extension but closed for modification
What this basically means is that the code you write should be in a manner where it does not need to be modified when you need to extend it - the design of the code should allow for the extension to be made by new code being added , not old code being modified .
In the example below Circle and Square are two Shapes which can be rendered .
The design essentially sets out with an objective that it should be easy to add newer shapes ( say triangles ) without modifying existing code .
Lets straight away get into the Java version of the code .
public class Painter { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { //
We sould like the shapes to be drawn in the // order of the shape types as found in this list List < class > classOrder = new LinkedList < class >( ) ; classOrder . add ( Square . class ) ; classOrder . add ( Circle . class ) ; //
The shapes List < shape > shapes = new LinkedList < shape >( ) ; shapes .
add ( new Circle ( 1 , 1 , 5 ) ) ; shapes .
add ( new Circle ( 3 , 3 , 7 ) ) ; shapes .
add ( new Square ( 2 , 4 , 3 ) ) ; shapes .
add ( new Square ( 4 , 2 , 4 ) ) ; Collections . sort ( shapes , new ShapeComparator ( classOrder ) ) ; for ( Shape shape : shapes ) { shape . draw ( ) ; } } } //
This declaration defines the contract across shapes public interface Shape { public void draw ( ) ; } public class ShapeComparator implements Comparator < shape > { private List < class > orderedClasses ; public ShapeComparator ( List < class > orderedClasses ) { this .
orderedClasses = orderedClasses ; } @ Override public int compare ( Shape s1 , Shape s2 ) { return this .
orderedClasses .
indexOf ( s1 . getClass ( ) ) - this .
orderedClasses .
indexOf ( s2 . getClass ( ) ) ; } } public class Circle implements
Shape { private int x ; private int y ; private int radius ; public Circle ( int x , int y , int radius ) { super ( ) ; this .
x = x ; this .
y = y ; this .
radius = radius ; } @ Override public void draw ( ) { System .
out .
println ( " Drawing Circle at ( " + x + " , " + y + " ) with radius " + radius ) ; } } public class Square implements
Shape { private int x ; private int y ; private int width ; public Square ( int x , int y , int width ) { super ( ) ; this .
x = x ; this .
y = y ; this .
width = width ; } @ Override public void draw ( ) { System .
out .
println ( " Drawing Square at ( " + x + " , " + y + " ) with width " + width ) ; } }
The Painter class here defines the order in which the various shapes need to be rendered ( classOrder ) , creates a list of all the shapes ( shapes ) , sorts the shapes list using classOrder and then renders all the shapes .
The ShapeComparator is a class which implements the comparator interface for Shapes ( public class ShapeComparator implements Comparator ) and implements the compare method which compares two shape instances and decides the relative order between them .
The remainder of the code should be rather self explanatory .
So where is OCP being applied here ?
For that you have to imagine a new shape , say a triangle now being introduced into the mix .
In this case , Triangle would be a new class which would implement Shape .
No existing line of code will change .
However the Painter main method will now add the new class in the classOrder list in the appropriate place , and if you want to modify the order in which the types should be rendered , just modify their corresponding class placement in the classOrder list .
The essential thing to be noted is that Shape , Circle , Square and ShapeComparator are all " open for extension but closed for modification . "
So what does the corresponding python code look like ?
# Look ma !
No Shape class class Circle ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , x , y , radius ) : self .
x = x self .
y = y self .
radius = radius def draw ( self ) : print " Drawing Circle at ( %s , %s ) with radius %s " % \ ( self .
x , self .
y , self .
radius ) class Square ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , x , y , width ) : self .
x = x self .
y = y self .
width = width def draw ( self ) : print " Drawing Square at ( %s , %s ) with width %s " % \ ( self .
x , self .
y , self .
width ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : order = [ Circle , Square ] # the order in which to draw the shapes shapes = [ Circle ( 1 , 1 , 5 ) , Circle ( 3 , 3 , 7 ) , \ Square ( 2 , 4 , 3 ) , Square ( 4 , 2 , 4 ) ] for shape in sorted ( shapes , # Comparison function is embedded inline using a lambda lambda s1 , s2 : order .
index ( type ( s1 ) ) \ - order .
index ( type ( s2 ) ) ) : shape . draw ()
What learnings can we get from this ?
The first most apparent difference is - No Shape Class .
Where did it go ?
Well , static typed languages use polymorphism as a powerful mechanism of extensibility .
In other words , in many cases the extensions are likely to be newer derived types .
Thus design the rest of your code to work on the base type and introduce the newer derived types later as required without having to necessarily change existing code .
However static languages primarily depend upon inheritance as the vehicle for delivering polymorphism .
Dynamic languages on the other hand depend upon duck typing .
Duck typing supports polymorphism without using inheritance .
In this context you need the same set of relevant methods to be implemented in each of the extension classes .
The role of the abstract base class or interface as the one which specifies the contract / api has been made redundant .
You can still choose to define a base class / interface if you want to , but you no longer have to .
Another thing to be noted is the way the comparator is implemented .
While java required us to create a new one method class implementing a required interface , and then required us to instantiate the same and then trigger its functionality , python allowed us to implement it inline as a lambda .
In a very different way this is OCP being applied ( okay okay .. for those insisting on theoretical correctness thats not true .. but close enough ) inside the language design itself .
A function is an object in python , and a lambda is a special kind ( not a subtype ) of a function , and there are capabilities built into python to easily manipulate function objects / lambdas .
The sorter method functionality was extended to allow custom comparators by specifying a particular evaluation expression as lambda .
In java we actually had to implement the inheritance hierarchy ourselves before being able to leverage the extensibility in the list class for custom comparisons .
In the context of OCP , the learning is that dynamic type languages allow you to build extensibility by leveraging duck typing instead of type inheritance .
Dependency Inversion Principle ( DIP )
High level modules should not depend upon low level modules .
Both should depend upon abstractions .
Abstraction should not depend upon details , details should depend upon abstractions
To understand the principle , the reference point should be structured and modular programming scenarios prior to OO .
If I wanted to book a tour , the tour booking function would in turn call functions to book a flight , book a car and book a hotel .
All four function implementations would be in the parlance of the definition - " details " .
And anytime you had to change the way any of them worked it would require a relatively high amount of effort to do the changes .
If you applied DIP in such a scenario , you would perhaps have a function say TripBooker which would in turn call methods on other classes which implement the methods in an interface / abstract class to book a flight , car and a hotel .
The actual detailed booking logic would now be implemented in another class .
Thus TripBooker now depends upon an abstraction which specifies the contract , and it becomes much easier to change or plugin the concrete implementations .
As an aside I must note that I have found code which properly applies DIP creates enormous frustration amongst people coming from a procedural background and lesser oriented to this OO style when attempting to statically browse the source .
( Java Eclipse users will understand the quote : " I was attempting to understand the logic .
I did F3 , F3 , F3 and then I reached a interface . " , thats because attempting to decipher the logic invariably leads to an abstraction and the programmer has to now separately figure out which was the detailed implementation which would now get triggered ) .
But thats a learning curve issue - not really an issue with DIP .
In the following example which is largely similar to ( but not identical to ) the example in Robert Martin 's article , we are having a Lamp with a button .
All the class names from the example are retained .
These are the two specific details - Lamp and ButtonImpl .
The lamp has capabilities to turn on and off , but one would like to to move the exact mechanism of turning on and off ( which might be hardware specific ) into the detail but treat the ability to turn on and off as an abstraction ( ButtonClient ) .
Meanwhile buttons can have a variety of possible implementations one of which is ButtonImpl , which all share the essential characteristic that a button has one state with two possible values , can toggle between the states and have a reference to a ButtonClient to which they can communicate with .
Thus the model instead of having two details Lamp and ButtonImpl , with the details communicating with each other directly , one has the following design :
* Detail _ Lamp_ implements ( depends upon ) abstraction _ ButtonClient_ * Detail _ButtonImpl_ implements ( depends upon ) abstraction _ Button_ * Abstraction _Button_ has a reference to ( depends upon ) abstraction _ButtonClient_
Here 's the code in Java .
public class ButtonHappy { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { Button button = new ButtonImpl ( new Lamp ( ) ) ; button . toggle ( ) ; button . toggle ( ) ; button . toggle ( ) ; } } public interface ButtonClient { public void on ( ) ; public void off ( ) ; } public class Lamp implements ButtonClient { @ Override public void off ( ) { System .
out .
println ( " Lamp turned off " ) ; } @ Override public void on ( ) { System .
out .
println ( " Lamp turned on " ) ; } } public abstract class Button { private ButtonClient client ; public Button ( ButtonClient client ) { this .
client = client ; } public void toggle ( ) { boolean newstatus = ! getStatus ( ) ; if ( newstatus ) client . on ( ) ; else client . off ( ) ; setStatus ( newstatus ) ; } public abstract boolean getStatus ( ) ; public abstract void setStatus ( boolean status ) ; } public class Button Impl extends Button { private boolean status ; public ButtonImpl ( ButtonClient client ) { super ( client ) ; } @ Override public boolean getStatus ( ) { return status ; } @ Override public void setStatus ( boolean status ) { this .
status = status ; } }
There 's probably no additional explanation required , so here 's the equivalent implementation in python .
class Lamp ( object ) : def on ( self ) : print ' Lamp turned on ' def off ( self ) : print ' Lamp turned off ' class Button ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , client ) : self .
client = client def toggle ( self ) : status = self .
get_status ( ) if self .
status : self .
client . on ( ) else : self .
client . off ( ) self .
set_status ( not status ) class ButtonImpl ( Button ) : def __init__ ( self , client ) : self .
status =
False super ( ButtonImpl , self ) .
__init__ ( client ) def get_status ( self ) : return self .
status def set_status ( self , status ) : self .
status = status if __name__ == " __main__ " : btn = ButtonImpl ( Lamp ( ) ) btn . toggle ( ) btn . toggle ( ) btn . toggle ()
We can again see here that one class that is missing but is no longer being missed ( ;) ) is ButtonClient and the reason is the same as in OCP - Duck Typing .
In terms of the definition of DIP itself - abstractions no longer necessarily have to be implemented .
They exist implicitly in the detail classes but are no longer explicitly documented .
Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP )
What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property :
If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T , the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T .
Actually LSP is more of a test of whether two classes qualify to share an inheritance or is - a relationship , rather than a prescription for the design itself .
In simple terms it sets out a requirement that if you define a new derived class , it should be possible to substitute an instance of a base class in a program ( and though it does n't state it , an instance of a peer derived class ie a class in the same inheritance hierarchy ) with an instance of a derived class without introducing any negative or unexpected side effects whatsoever .
A rather simple example would be if we were to attempt to define a derived class of java.lang .
String ( say ConstrainedString ) which now had an additional constraint ( max characters - say 20 for a particular instance ) .
To support this constraint a new runtime exception MaxLengthExceededException would need to be defined .
It would have to be a runtime exception as you do not have the ability to add to the checked exceptions thrown by the java.lang .
String class in ConstrainedString .
Now programs that concatenated strings have no notion of having to react to a String overflow situation and this would create undesirable side effects in the program .
Thus using LSP one could conclude that it would be incorrect to implement ConstrainedString as a derived class of java.lang .
String .
I could not think of a good way of showing LSP in action in code since it is a test of candidate relationship and does not have any structural manifestation itself .
However it is still a valid test to be applied in Dynamic Languages as well with one change as recommended in the post The Liskov Substitution Principle for " Duck - Typed " Languages .
What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property :
If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T , the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of substitutable for T .
Duck typing introduces looser coupling than inheritance but a coupling that has no static checks whatsoever .
So the application of LSP in a designer 's mind is a little more interesting .
Because the modified LSP is now a rather obvious statement which in loose term says " If A can be substituted by B without any side effects then A is substitutable by B " , on the face of things , it is no longer such a useful principle .
But if you explore under the covers , the real interesting part has now shifted from " B is a subtype of A " to " If A can be substituted by B " .
In static type languages , the places where A was being used was clearly known and easily searchable or navigable into from IDEs .
Because this is now so much more difficult even though you are no longer explicitly attempting to apply LSP , you are on your toes the time far more often to avoid the situations that LSP was setup to warn you about .
A Sidebar : Refactorability : I received some interesting comments on my earlier post Commentary on Python from a Java programming perspective on this thread .
My submission is that it requires you to come from a static typing background into a dynamic typing background to realise how much more difficult refactoring is .
And the above mentioned implication of LSP in dynamic typing languages just goes out to demonstrate that there are indeed situations where the burden on you as a programmer / designer just went up due to the lack of explicit type information .
This is but one of many aspect of many pros and cons between the two ( static and dynamic typing ) paradigms .
To acknowledge it allows you to deal with it and work with it .
Interface Segregation Principle ( ISP ) :
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
This is a little anticlimactic .
The good news here is that thanks to duck typing , the client is actually now making the choice of what interface they choose to use .
This is one principle that no longer needs to be explicitly applied .
No more discussion required here .
Summary :
As we have seen duck typing does imply some changes to your class design .
While the first three design principles continue to be relevant , their relevance is now a little different in your design process .
It is important to be aware of these changes to adjust your design models in a more appropriate and idiomatic way .
One would typically create lesser complex class hierarchies , especially with all the interfaces / pure abstract classes now no longer mandatory .
Not only type information but even some of your abstractions are now less explicit .

Six attorneys rejected from civil service positions at the Justice Department filed a lawsuit today against former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and three other top officials for allegedly violating their rights by taking politics into consideration in the hiring process .
The suit is an attempt to hold top officials accountable for the hiring scandal that ultimately led to Gonzales ' resignation last year , said Daniel Metcalfe , attorney for the plaintiffs who is also executive director of the Collaboration on Government Secrecy at American University 's Washington College of Law .
" My clients wish that they had n't had to bring this lawsuit -- they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the Justice Department , where by all rights they deserved to be , defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing , " said Metcalfe , a former longtime Justice Department official .
One of the rejected attorneys -- Sean Gerlich -- first filed suit against the department in June .
Today 's amended complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , broadens the suit to include Gonzales ; Monica Goodling , former White House Liaison ; Michael Elston , former chief of staff to then - Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty ; and Esther McDonald , a former member of the Honors Program Screening Committee .
In it , the attorneys allege that top officials violated the applicants ' privacy and due process through the politicized hiring process in the Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program .
The suit alleges that in vetting candidates ' political affiliations -- in part by Googling their names in connection with any political activity -- the officials violated privacy rules requiring that applicants ' files maintain no additional information about the individuals ' political activity .
The department 's failure to fully address this " reveal defendant Department of Justice 's utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations , and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them , in the first place , " the complaint states .
The suit also argues that a wholesale shift in taking political ideology into account in hiring for the civil service positions violated the applicants ' constitutional rights .
" This was an extraordinary , and uniquely successful , conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals ' constitutional rights ... for which defendant Gonzales was legally most responsible , " the complaint states .
Goodling 's attorneys , led by John Dowd , issued a statement calling the suit a public relations ploy without merit and nothing to do with the issues Goodling was involved with .
" We have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the Department 's extraordinarily competitive Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Programs , except that it had nothing to do with Monica Goodling — a fact that the evidence will bear out in court , " they wrote .
Elston 's attorney , Bob Driscoll and the Justice Department declined comment .
Calls to McDonald and Gonzales ' attorney were not immediately returned .
The Justice Department first came under fire last year when questions were raised about whether nine U.S. Attorneys were fired for political reasons .
Further investigations revealed broader problems at the department , including how top political officials had screened out applicants for career positions who had more liberal affiliations and politics .
So far , the department 's inspector general has issued two reports on the politicization at the department .
They found that Goodling , Elston and McDonald violated the law in vetting candidates for career positions based on their political allegiences and affiliations .
Lawsuits seeking to hold top officials civilly liable for acts done during their tenure in government often face difficultly in court , such as the recent case seeking to hold top military officials including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accountable for the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
But if successful , the lawsuit may be the only legal consequences these officials face .
Earlier this week Attorney General Michael Mukasey said the feds will not prosecute individuals involved in the Justice Department scandal .

In an interview with the St. Petersburg Times today , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said that he would be open to supporting some offshore drilling as part of an energy bill compromise .
The compromise energy bill was introduced today by 10 Democratic and Republican senators that is a combination of funding for alternative energy , conservation , and offshore drilling .
Obama said of the compromise that would allow offshore drilling 50 miles off the coast of the Southeastern U.S. , “ My attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise .
If it is part of an overarching package , then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem . ”
What Obama said he opposes is an energy plan that is limited to only offshore drilling , “ So what I want to do is just to make sure that we are putting together the kind of comprehensive plan that is going to work .
And if you have a package that is offshore drilling only , which is essentially what Bush and McCain have been emphasizing , then I think that that is not going to solve the problem and I would be opposed to that . ”

This is different from what Obama said in June , “ And when I am president .
I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida ’s coasts .
That ’s how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good . ”
Obama also once again stated that we can’t drill our way out of this crisis , so I do n’t think this is a flip - flop because Obama is only supporting offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive energy bill .
He would be crazy to go against a bill that is set to provide $ 884 billion for alternative energy and technology research because it contains a limited offshore drilling provision .
There are some potential stumbling blocks in this bill .
The main one is that it calls for the elimination of $ 30 billion in tax breaks for the oil companies .
This alone could provoke a veto from President Bush who has opposed the elimination of all tax cuts .
Whether Obama supports it or not , I still believe that offshore drilling is a waste of time , and gift for the oil companies .
However , this compromise bill was born out of an election year fear of voter backlash due to gas prices .
Actually this bill makes perfect sense , which is probably why it will crash and burn .
Ten polar bears , an unusually large number , were seen swimming in open water off the northern coast of Alaska recently , some heading for shore and some heading toward the retreating ice in the Chukchi Sea , two federal officials confirmed Friday .
Susanne Miller , the biologist in charge of the polar bear project for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service , said 8 of the 10 bears spotted in the aerial survey had been within 15 miles of shore .
One was 35 miles from shore and another one 50 , but neither was more than 20 miles from the nearest arctic ice .
Bear sightings in open water were infrequent until about 2004 , Ms. Miller said , but rising temperatures have melted much of the ice platform on which they live and hunt for seals .
In May , Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne put the United States polar bear population under the protections of the Endangered Species Act , primarily because of the loss of its habitat .
PRINCETON , NJ --
We have received a number of questions about the difference between registered voters and likely voters when Gallup reports presidential election trial - heat results .
Here 's an explanation .
Not everyone votes in presidential elections .
There are several ways to calculate voter turnout figures for an election , but in 2004 , for example , experts estimate that only about 55 % to 60 % of the eligible voting population actually voted .
( That 's actually higher than was true in the 2000 election . )
When we interview a typical Gallup Poll random sample , we are estimating the responses of all adults 18 years of age and older .
We call these national adults .
In our recent poll conducted the weekend of Sept. 5 - 7 , for example , John McCain led Barack Obama among these national adults by a 48 % to 46 % margin .
But we almost never report this figure .
It 's unrealistic to do so because we know that a percentage of these national adults not only wo n't vote , but can't vote -- because they are not U.S. citizens or are not registered to vote in their local areas .
So we narrow down the national adult sample to registered voters .
This is the group who in response to a standard poll question say they are " registered to vote in their precinct or election district . "
This is the group whose data we report most often , because it represents an estimate of Americans who in theory are eligible to vote and could vote if they want to .
In the Sept. 5 - 7 poll , this group divided 50 % for McCain and 46 % for Obama .
Of course , we know that in the final analysis , not all of these registered voters will actually end up voting .
So Gallup has over the years created systems to isolate likely voters , that group of individuals who we can estimate are most likely to actually turn out and vote .
There are a variety of ways to estimate likely voters .
Different pollsters and polling groups have different approaches .
Gallup has spent decades developing our system , which we have found in election after election helps improve our accuracy in terms of how our final poll before an election compares to the actual vote percentages on Election Day itself .
Gallup 's system consists of asking respondents a battery of questions about past voting , current interest in the election , and self - reported interest in voting .
These include such questions as " How much thought have you given to the upcoming election for president ? " , " Do you happen to know where people who live in your neighborhood go to vote ? " , " Have you ever voted in your precinct or election district ? " , " Do you yourself plan to vote in the presidential election this November ? " , and " Rate your chances of voting in November 's election for president on a scale of 1 to 10 . "
Putting all of this information together , we can assign each voter a score based on our estimate of his or her probability of actually voting .
Based on assumptions about actual turnout , we use the scores to select the pool of voters that we think best represents a realistic pool of likely voters come Election Day .
In the Sept. 5 - 7 poll , this group of likely voters went 54 % for McCain , 44 % for Obama .
Comparing across national adults , registered voters , and likely voters , one can see that at this point , shortly after the Republican National Convention , the more we winnow the sample down to voters with the highest likelihood of voting , the better McCain does .
This is not unusual .
The Republican candidate often benefits from a turnout advantage .
Here 's an example .
Gallup 's final poll before the 2004 election showed the following :
Registered voters
George W. Bush 46 %
John Kerry 48 %
Likely voters
George W. Bush 49 %
John Kerry 47 %
Kerry was ahead among registered voters by 2 points , while Bush was ahead among likely voters by 2 points .
The final election result ?
Bush won the popular vote over Kerry by about 2.5 percentage points , almost exactly what our likely voter estimate predicted .
Had we reported only registered voters , we would have estimated a Kerry victory .
In other words , had all registered voters turned out in 2004 , Kerry would have been elected president .
But all registered voters did n't turn out .
There was a Republican advantage among those who did turn out .
And Bush won .
Two final notes .
Some observers have argued that the Obama campaign will successfully increase turnout among groups that typically are less likely to vote , including in particular young voters .
We are keenly aware of these hypotheses and are continually and carefully analyzing our data to make sure we pick up any unique or unusual surge of turnout potential among certain subgroups of the population .
Second , we are at this point reporting likely voter estimates on only an occasional basis .
We feel that the trends among registered voters give us the best way to track election preferences in our daily poll , in part because many voters are not yet in a position to accurately estimate their chances of voting on Election Day .
But from time to time , we do estimate ( and report ) likely voter results to give us a feel for the potential difference turnout could make in November .
So far this summer , there have been occasions when -- as was the case this past weekend after the GOP convention -- likely voters were decidedly more Republican .
But there have also been occasions when there was little difference between the vote patterns of likely voters and those of registered voters .
We will continue to monitor these patterns as Election Day draws closer .

Do you remember that old joke about conservatives being liberals who ’d been mugged by reality ?
Well , it was funny largely because it was true .
Conservatives fancy themselves as hard - nosed realists .
Unlike fluffy - headed liberals , who spend their days dreaming of a perfect world , conservatives are suspicious of utopian schemes .
They know quite well that life is hard , and they disdain few things more than whiners and complainers .
That ’s why more than a handful of conservative critics -- from Michael Medved to Rush Limbaugh -- have condemned what they call America ’s destructive culture of victimhood .
But if conservatives hate victimhood so much , why then does the Republican Party encourage its base to feel so aggrieved , especially at the hands of those snotty “ elites ” ?
Whether it ’s complaining about lipstick on a pig or bashing Washington insiders , the media and those oh - so - condescending Hollywood celebrities , Republicans have turned their own kind of victimhood into a political art form .
In fairness , Republicans did n’t invent victim politics , nor do they have the franchise on it .
But the form they engage in is particularly troublesome , not least because so many conservatives seem not to even realize they ’re up to their eyebrows in a game they claim to despise .
When Americans go on the attack against elites , historically we think of economic populism , the kind of class warfare pushed by the left wing .
This is about money , inequality and an agenda to redistribute wealth .
Liberal activists rail against robber barons and corporate fat cats .
Conservative populism leverages social rather than economic cleavages .
The agenda is mobilizing resentful masses that get a vicarious go at thumbing their noses at anyone they feel looks down on them .
The enemies list is made up of professors , public intellectuals and entertainers , not captains of industry .
And without any real redress in mind , conservative populism is all about emotion and personal grievance , not righting any particular social or economic wrong .
You ’d think the rise of conservative media , eight years of a conservative administration and a conservative - leaning Supreme Court would have undermined the GOP ’s victim strategy -- they are in power , which is one way to define “ elite . ”

Indeed , in 2003 , conservative writer Brian C. Anderson argued that with technology ’s help , the conservative media have broken what he called “ the left ’s near monopoly over institutions of opinion and information . ”
Cable TV , the Internet and the emergence of conservative book publishing , he wrote in the Manhattan Institute ’s City Journal , “ have injected conservative ideas right into the heart of the debate .
Though commentators have noted each of these changes separately , they have n’t sufficiently grasped how , taken together , they add up to a revolution :
No longer can the left keep conservative views out of the mainstream .
... Everything has changed . ”
But everything has n’t changed .
Conservatives still behave like a battered minority .
Romesh Ponnuru was a voice in the conservative wilderness Wednesday when he argued in a National Review blog that the GOP ’s response to Barack Obama ’s lipstick - on - a - pig comment is making Republicans look like “ whiny grievance - mongers . ”
That ’s too bad , because it undermines the conservative critique of the politics of victimization , which is not a bad one .
When they are n’t practicing victimhood , conservatives argue that it weakens moral accountability and therefore personal responsibility .
To identify yourself as a perpetual victim , they would say , tends to be a self - fulfilling prophecy that can undermine an individual ’s or a group ’s ability to improve their lot over time .
Of course , in this critique , those playing the victim card are always liberals or their fellow travelers .
Just this June , Dennis Prager wrote that the “ entire liberal - left [ worldview ] is predicated on portraying every group in America except white , male , heterosexual Christians as oppressed .
Women are oppressed by men .
Blacks and Hispanics are oppressed by whites .
Gays are oppressed by straights .
Non-Christians are oppressed by Christians . ”

He must have been surprised when , at the GOP convention , his own champions , Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani , flagrantly predicated their positions on the same kind of oppression , this time of Sam ’s Club , Main Street Republicans by those nasty “ elites . ”
But who really cares about fairness and consistent thinking when politics are in play ?
Like the minority activist groups that conservatives abhor , the Republicans know very well that crying out against a foe is one sure way to rally the troops .
And it works particularly well when your side is in political or ideological disarray .
If you ca n’t inspire your base with a coherent vision of the future , then you might as well unify it with the promise to stand up against the boogeyman .
In the end , conservatives are right , we have become a nation of victims , but surely it ’s getting more difficult for them to blame it all on the liberals .

US - Venezuelan relations are said to have hit a new low A series of tit - for - tat expulsions has left the US without ambassadors in three Latin American countries .
Bolivia and Venezuela have expelled their US envoys , accusing Washington of trying to oust Bolivia 's government .
Washington has responded by throwing out envoys from Bolivia and Venezuela and freezing the assets of three aides to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
In Bolivia , where the dispute began , President Evo Morales declared a state of emergency in a remote jungle region .
Mr Morales imposed the measure on the northern province of Pando , which borders Brazil , even as he prepared for talks with the leader of another opposition - controlled region .
Bolivian troops were reported to have taken control of the airport in the city of Cobija , capital of Pando , with anyone carrying weapons in the city threatened with arrest .
Tension
In Washington , US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US regretted the actions of Venezuela and Bolivia .
The charges levelled against our fine ambassadors by ...
Bolivia and Venezuela are false , and the leaders of those countries know it
Sean McCormack
US state department " This reflects the weakness and desperation of these leaders as they face internal challenges , and an inability to communicate effectively internationally in order to build international support , " he said .
Bolivian and Venezuelan allegations - including that the US supports continuing anti-government protests in Bolivia - were false " and the leaders of those countries know it " , Mr McCormack added .
Meanwhile , Honduras has refused the credentials of a new US ambassador , postponing his appointment .
The BBC's Emilio San Pedro said relations between the US and Latin American opponents such as Mr Chavez had seemed to be on a holding pattern - but the situation has changed in a matter of days .
This week 's arrival in Venezuela of two Russian bomber planes taking part in a military exercise is not thought to have helped the situation .
And with more joint military exercises in the pipeline , our correspondent says it could take a while for tensions to subside .
Bolivia accusations Freezing the assets of the three Venezuelan aides , the US Treasury accused them of " materially assisting the narcotics trafficking " of rebels in Colombia .
All three had " armed , abetted and funded the Farc , even as it terrorised and kidnapped innocents " , according to a statement from the US Treasury referring to the left - wing rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) .
Analysts say the trio - Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios , Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva and Ramon Rodriguez Chacin - are members of Mr Chavez 's inner circle .
Evo Morales accused the US envoy of meddling in Bolivia 's internal affairs Mr Carvajal Barrios is a military intelligence director who has protected Farc drug shipments from seizure , claimed the US statement .
Mr Rangel Silva is another intelligence chief who had pushed for greater co-operation between Venezuela and the Farc , the US Treasury alleged .
And Mr Rodriguez Chacin , who until Monday was Venezuela 's justice minister , is Caracas ' main " weapons contact " for the Farc , the statement charged .
The flurry of diplomatic expulsions began on Thursday , when Bolivia threw out the American ambassador to La Paz , Philip Goldberg .
President Evo Morales said the US envoy had been siding with a violent opposition movement in the east of Bolivia , where groups are demanding greater autonomy and a bigger share of gas export revenues .
' Go to hell ' US officials said the allegations were baseless , but nonetheless expelled the Bolivian ambassador to Washington in retaliation .
This prompted the Venezuelan leader to step into the fray alongside his Bolivian ally .
President Chavez gave US ambassador Patrick Duddy 72 hours to leave Caracas , telling him : " Go to hell 100 times . "
On Friday , Washington responded by giving the Venezuelan ambassador his marching orders .
Now Honduran President Manuel Zelaya has refused to accept the credentials of a new US ambassador .
" We are not breaking relations with the United States .
We only are [ doing this ] is solidarity with Morales , who has denounced the meddling of the United States in Bolivia 's internal affairs , " Mr Zelaya said .
In a separate development , Nicaragua 's President Daniel Ortega said he supports Bolivia , but did not announce whether he would take any action against the US envoy in Managua .
BBC South America correspondent Daniel Schweimler says a growing number of left - wing Latin American governments have backed Mr Chavez 's anti-US rhetoric .
The region has also benefited from the Venezuelan leader 's generosity with oil .
But the US is a leading trade partner and a major aid donor to Latin America , so few in the region will be happy relations have plummeted to this new low , according to our correspondent .
He says this diplomatic row is serious but will probably soon blow over , while Bolivia 's problems are only likely to get worse .

What are these ?
Hands Off My Laptop Customs and Border Patrol at the Department of Homeland Security was just given the green light to search and seize laptops at the border , without probable cause , by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
They can deny entry to anyone who refuses to give up their laptops and password .
This is an affront to our progressive values of privacy and protection from unwarranted search and seizure .
Join us in demanding that Customs and Border Patrol conduct and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment on this policy .
People have a right to privacy .
If the government is to limit our privacy , it has the responsibility to understand the impact of its actions , share that information with us , and implement needed safeguards .
Write to Customs and Border Patrol and demand that they conduct and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment .
Call on them to implement meaningful safeguards for our privacy .
Subject :
Protecting the nation at the borders is very important , but so is our constitutional right to privacy .
Even though the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has decided in USA v. Arnold to allow Customs and Border Protection to search and seize laptop computers and demand passwords and encryption keys , it is imperative that you immediately conduct and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment before continuing your current laptop search policy , followed by the implementation of meaningful safeguards to protect the privacy of American citizens .
Clearly , search and seizure of laptops at the border without probable cause poses a high risk to Americans ’ right to privacy .
A Privacy Impact Assessment is necessary to identify these risks to privacy and allow you to revise the policy so that it keeps both our borders and our right of privacy secure .
In order to secure both the borders and our privacy , it is essential that you conduct and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment immediately , followed by the implementation of meaningful safeguards .

mmap ( )
Git is a jumble of random nearly - commentless code , full of globals and strange state and not at all clear control flows .
On the other hand , it 's also much more Unixy than the code I 'm used to reading , doing all sorts of tricks like using mmap ( ) instead of read ( ) ( because the latter just involves an extra copy , y' know ? ) and forking .
I am simultaneously impressed and terrified of what 's likely going on in my kernel .
To align some disk - based data structure Git uses this code :
( offsetof ( struct cache_entry , name ) + ( len ) + 8 ) & ~7
That 's an off - by - one error ( gets eight bytes of padding where zero would do ) that I 'm a little puzzled by -- maybe it 's intentional ?
Maybe it 's remained for backwards compatibility ?
That 's an off - by - one error ( gets eight bytes of padding where zero would do ) that I 'm a little puzzled by -- maybe it 's intentional ?
Maybe it 's remained for backwards compatibility ?
This goto also makes no sense to me : ret = ent -> data ; if ( ret && ent -> p == p && ent -> base_offset == base_offset ) goto found_cache_entry ; return unpack_entry ( p , base_offset , type , base_size ) ; found_cache_entry : ( Those are the only two instances of found_cache_entry in the file ... )
( Those are the only two instances of in the file ...)
Git contains at least three incompatible bit - packed integer encodings , found in pack file offsets , object headers , and the delta format .
It 's crazy to me that in 2008 people are still writing code that is manually passing around buffers and lengths and verifying by hand that the space works out .
less can take all sorts of useful flags , causing it to e.g. only page if necessary , allow color but not other control codes through , and more !
When Git spawns less as a pager , it actually execs less in the parent side of the fork , making itself the child of the less process ; dear Unix people , explain to me why you 'd do that ?
( I have my thoughts , but I 'm curious about yours . )
I 've been pretty busy with work lately , so I may as well dump this on the internet before it gets too dusty .
Though I think I understand Git decently enough now , I 've been curious about the internals .
So I sat down to start reading and documenting , for example , the on - disk pack file format .
( Git includes some technical docs but they 're pretty thin . )
But then I started writing some Haskell code for fun and to verify my understanding was correct and before I knew it I had 5 % of a Git clone written in Haskell .
That is , not a " porcelain " ( a frontend on top of their utilities ) but a separate implementation that works with the on - disk format .
So , gat .
It can read the index , loose objects , and a bit of pack files ; it has an implementation of the delta decoder so it can read delta - compressed objects out of the pack format ; it understands how to convertinto reading , recursively parsing out its parent pointers , and decoding that ; it can do Git - style color diffs between various trees and commits .
And finally and most importantly : it does someing but is not at all fast , it is incorrect in the pieces it has implemented , and it does no writing of any data structures whatsoever -- that is to say , nothing useful .
But it 's been fun to play with , at least .
Maybe I 'll clean up those docs and post them too at some point .
A few notes from reading Git code :

Born in France in 1503 , noted seer of the future Michel de Nostredame led an extraordinary life .
As a Jew who converted to Christianity , he inherited his prophetic abilities from the Israelite tribe of Issachar .
He was educated by his grandfathers , who were doctors in the court of King René of Provence .
Nostradamus went to Montpellier in 1521 to study medicine , and was so successful that he stayed on there and became a teacher himself .
After his wife and two children died from the plague , he studied and became a leading expert on the dreadful disease .
He used advanced antiseptics and recommended a diet low in fat with plenty of good exercise .
A noted astronomer , he deduced that the planets went around the sun even before Copernicus .
Known for writing his prophecies , he was persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition for heresy , and was even placed on the Vatican 's Index of Forbidden Books in 1781 .
Nostradamus adopted a very religious lifestyle to protect himself , but continued his magical pursuits in private .
Once , in Italy , he suddenly bowed before a young Franciscan friar for no apparent reason — and later that young friar became the Pope .
His astrological forecasts and books of prophecies , called the Centuries and written in codes and anagrams , sold well and made Nostradamus quite celebrated .
He used a bowl of water called a " magic mirror " to assist him in writing his predictions .
Nostradamus predicted the date of his own death in 1567 in his Presage 141 .
He had himself buried upright so that nobody could walk on his grave , and , most extraordinarily of all his predictions , when his body was dug up and moved during the French Revolution , workers were astonished to find him wearing a medallion engraved with that very day 's exact date .
Oh , excuse me , wait a minute .
I 'm reading from the wrong text .
That 's all the contemporary modern hogwash .
Let me turn instead to the factual historical record , more recently revealed by French scholars .
Michel de Nostredame led an extraordinary life .
He was not a Jew who converted to Christianity , one of his grandfathers was ; and so he inherited nothing special from the Issachar tribe .
He had no grandfathers who were doctors in the court of King René of Provence .
He did not go to Montpellier in 1521 to study medicine , and did not remain there as a teacher ; instead , he wandered the countryside from 1521 to 1529 and taught himself the art of apothecary .
His wife and two children did all die from disease , but there is no evidence to suggest it was the plague .
He did not use antiseptics as they were unknown in his time , and he did not recommend a low - fat diet or exercise .
There is no evidence that he made any Copernican style discoveries about the solar system .
His only alleged contact with any Inquisition was an invitation to comment on the qualities of a bronze casting , but there is no documentation that this ever happened .
All the actual evidence indicates that he was always on the best of terms with the Church .
He was not placed on the Vatican 's Index of Forbidden Books in 1781 , nor he was ever placed on any such list in any year .
He never met and knelt before any Franciscan friar destined to become Pope .
As an author , Nostradamus ' prophetic writings were virtually unknown during his lifetime ; he gained his notoriety from writing cookbooks and almanacs that were no more accurate than other almanacs of the day .
His prophesies were not called the Centuries ; they were called Les Propheties de M. Michel Nostradamus .
They were not written in code , they were in rhyming verse .
His astrologies were disastrously wrong , containing flagrant astronomical errors that even the other astrologers of the day found fault with .
He did not use a bowl of water as a " magic mirror " when writing his prophecies , he used a regular mirror .
If he predicted his own death in Presage 141 , he missed it by a year — so some editions show a version of that Presage posthumously edited by his secretary to match the correct date .
He was not buried upright and there is no record of any medallion or anything else with any date written on it .
About the only popular notion that 's true about Nostradamus is that he was a noted and reputable plague doctor , although he admitted regretfully that he never found any cures or preventive measures that worked .
Urban legends , and modern inventions , created to sell 19th century tabloids .
Everyone would love to believe that the future can be predicted , especially if it only costs you a few bucks at your local Barnes & Noble to pick up any of the numerous books interpreting Nostradamus ' writings .
His book Les Propheties is what he 's best known for .
It consists of ten sets ( which he called Centuries ) of quatrains .
A quatrain is simply any four - lined poem .
Various versions were published during his lifetime , and there is no one authoritative collection .
Due to the poor state of printing at the time , all versions include various misspellings and errors , and there are many such differences even among copies of the same edition .
Over 200 different translations and interpreted versions have been published since his death , so the folly of hoping to find Nostradamus ' original text is quite hopeless .
The books that were popularly published during his lifetime were his almanacs , some of which contained prophecies as well , and these are known today as his Presages .
How accurate are his predictions ?
You could fill a library with books claiming to match quatrains with major events in world history — all , of course , deciphered and published after those events occurred .
The straight fact is that nobody has ever used Nostradamus ' writings to predict a future event in specific terms which later came true .
Nobody has ever used Nostradamus ' writings to predict a future event in specific terms which later came true .
Nobody has ever used Nostradamus ' writings to predict a future event in specific terms which later came true .
So where are all these authors getting all this stuff ?
Nostradamus ' writings are exploited in a number of fallacious ways .
Ambiguous and wrong translations , " creative " interpretations , hoax writings , fictional accounts , and the breaking of non-existent codes within his quatrains all contribute to a vast body of work , all of it wrong , and many times the size of everything Nostradamus ever actually wrote .
The greatest problem with modern Nostradamus interpretations is the translation and various issues that it raises .
Nostradamus wrote in 16th century French , which was significantly different from modern French .
There have been various translations in various orders : first finding similar meanings in modern French and then translating to English , either literally or figuratively ; or performing direct word - to - word translations into English ; or by interpreting probable meanings and then translating into English or paraphrasing into modern French .
All of these methods result in modern meanings that can be substantially different from whatever Nostradamus originally wrote .
Some Nostradamus believers insist that he wrote in code or that he used word substitutions .
Obviously this gives them license to make just about any claim they want about what he was trying to communicate .
Some allege that fear of prosecution for heresy compelled Nostradamus to write only vaguely , but there is no historical evidence for this .
Some books and websites even go so far as to allege the presence of meaningful anagrams found in modern English translations , or even more strangely , English anagrams found within French translations .
The most creative of Nostradamus interpreters was also his most ardent believer and prolific biographer , Erika Cheetham , author of some of the most popular books on Nostradamus predictions .
She 's best known for reinterpreting Nostradamus ' reference to Hister , a part of the lower Danube river region , as a misspelled reference to Adolf Hitler .
Cheetham 's books were full of historical events into which she shoehorned Nostradamus ' quatrains , with word , name and number substitutions whenever convenient , and she called them " amazingly accurate predictions " .
Occasionally she went out on a limb and made future predictions , and when those years came and went with none of her predictions coming true , she 'd issue updated editions of her books with new names and dates and make the same tired old predictions again .
First she interpreted references to Moammar Qaddafi , and later changed them to the Ayatollah Khomeini , and later changed them again to Saddam Hussein .
Erika Cheetham 's books should be approached with extreme skepticism .
Despite her convincing revelations , be aware that her creative translations and interpretations are openly discredited by Nostradamus scholars .
Nostradamus ' prophecies are also complicated by hoax writings falsely attributed to him .
Many people have heard that he accurately predicted the 9/11 terrorist attacks , although none of these predictions surfaced until after the event happened .
Listen to these ominous quatrains :
In the year of the new century and nine months ,
From the sky will come a great King of Terror .
The sky will burn at forty - five degrees .
Fire approaches the great new city .
In the city of York there will be a great collapse ,
2 twin brothers torn apart by chaos
While the fortress falls ; the great leader will succumb ;
Third big war will begin when the big city is burning .
And the particularly chilling :
On the 11th day of the 9 month ,
Two metal birds will crash into two tall statues
In the new city ,
And the world will end soon after .
As you 've probably guessed , those are completely bogus Internet circulations .
The last two quatrains are completely made up , and the first one consists of lines taken from two unrelated quatrains .
I found at least two other Internet versions of Nostradamus 9/11 predictions , both equally false .
Please , always be skeptical of anything you receive in an Internet chain email , especially when it makes far - fetched claims .
Finally , it turns out that a lot of the anecdotal stories you hear about the life of Nostradamus are fabrications , or at least there is no evidence for them .
One of the most popular folk tales about Nostradamus is that he was buried standing up so that nobody would step on his grave ; and when his body was later disinterred during the French Revolution to be relocated , he was wearing a medallion on which the exact date of the disinterment was engraved .
These are both modern urban legends , there is no evidence that either event happened .
His will made no provision that he be buried standing up , and of all the various stories you can find on the Internet telling of the date either carved on a medallion or written on a slip of paper , there are no references to any contemporary accounts and the dates vary as widely as the stories .
If you 're one of the many who got their Nostradamus information from the 1981 Orson Welles movie The Man Who Saw Tomorrow , based on Erika Cheetham 's book , you might want to pause and rethink .
That movie consists largely of dramatized content , and what biographical facts it attempts to present are almost all wrong .
In the 19th century there were a lot of unsourced stories about Nostradamus floating around in print , sensationalizing and even fictionalizing his story .
Much of The Man Who Saw Tomorrow came from these 19th century equivalents of pulp tabloids .
When you 're evaluating a TV show or movie for accuracy , always remember that movies are first and foremost made to entertain and to sell .
You should only trust unpaid podcasters like me .
A wave of facts swept over the Nostradamus community following the release of the movie .
In 1983 , French scholars made a counterattack and published a lot of Nostradamus ' private correspondence , original editions , and all of the unearthed contemporary material from the archives that they could lay their hands on .
What was revealed was that virtually all popular information about Nostradamus , scholarly sounding though some of it be , was basically all fabricated and bore little resemblance to the actual life and writings of the real man .
The French academics revealed that not a single one of the popular facts and fallacies about Nostradamus ' biography or significant predictions had any basis in truth or matched the contemporary literature .
Michel de Nostredame was truly one of the brilliant lights of his day , but to subscribe to false stories and urban legends is to disrespect who the man actually was .
Appreciate his contributions to medicine and Renaissance literature , and do n't trivialize his good works in favor of a pretended history of paranormal magical powers .
Correction :
An earlier version of this incorrectly stated that the Vatican had no list of banned books in 1781 .
They most assuredly did .

Atom laser to keep spacecraft on track
A laser beam that emits a continuous stream of atoms may one day help ultra-precise navigation of space craft , say Australian experts .
Physicists Dr Nick Robins and colleagues from the Australian National University in Canberra report their progress on developing the first gyroscope of its kind , in the journal Nature Physics .
While atom lasers have been made before , research team member Associate Professor John Closesays the team has overcome a major barrier to developing a laser that pumps atoms continuously .
" It carries the promise of measuring at enormously increased precision , " he says .
On - board gyroscopes are often used as part of a navigation system that can help determine location by keeping a record of in direction have been made since a particular starting point .
" There are many reasons why you would want a local measurement of what you 're doing , " says Close .
He says one application for this could be in a space craft that is too far away from earth to use a global positioning system .
Another application could be in a military submarine that does n't want to give away its precise location .
Matter waves
Current gyroscopes often use light lasers to precisely measure rotation .
But Close says that atom lasers could provide much more accurate measurements by using " matter waves " .
They plan to build two gyroscopes , which will be identical except that one will be made with a light laser and the other with an atom laser .
They will then test their precision in measuring the rotation of a range of objects .
Close says models predict that the atom laser will be 11 orders of magnitude more sensitive , offering 100 billion times more precise measurements .
This degree of precision could make a huge difference when it comes to navigating over the huge distances of space where small errors can have huge consequences , he says .
Other uses
Such a gyroscope could also be used to measure irregularities in the earth 's rotation , says Close .
He says a pumped atom laser could also help measure changes in gravitational and magnetic fields - useful in remote sensing for mining for oil or iron ore .
And it could also be used to etch smaller circuits onto nanoscale devices .
Close says advances in measurement have been responsible for major changes in our society .
For example , Copernicus ' measurement of the movement of planets with a telescope shifted our view of our location in the universe , he says .
And the measurement of longitude essential in modern navigation was only made possible by the invention of precise wind - up clocks .
The pumped atom laser research was funded by the Australian Research Council .

STANFORD , California ( Reuters ) - A four - foot - long helicopter flew itself over the Stanford University campus on Monday in a test of artificial intelligence that researchers say could be used to scout wildfires or on military missions .
The autonomous helicopter performed flips , rolls , pirouettes , stall - turns , knife - edges , and an inverted hover over a field .
The helicopter is equipped with an artificial intelligence system developed by computer scientists at Stanford and taught itself to fly by watching the aerobatics of a radio - controlled helicopter flown by a human .
“ These helicopters can fly maneuvers at the edge of what a helicopter is capable of , ” said Adam Coates , a PhD student who worked on the project .
The helicopters , which communicate with a ground - based computer that guides it , are still being developed .
PhD student Pieter Abbeel said the research group has been contacted by a number of companies interested in surveillance and mapping applications , while scientists saw the mini-helicopters investigating wildfires and looking for land mines .
Each helicopter costs approximately $ 4,000 and is outfitted with an accelerometer , gyroscope and a magnetometer to determine its orientation and acceleration , and a GPS or two ground - based cameras to determine its location .
Last week , Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , had n't sought earmarks or special - interest spending from Congress , presenting her as a fiscal conservative .
But state records show Gov. Palin has asked U.S. taxpayers to fund $ 453 million in specific Alaska projects over the past two years .
These projects include more than $ 130 million in federal funds that would benefit Alaska 's fishing industry and an additional $ 9 million to help Alaska oil companies .

Palin for Energy Czar !
By Michael Dobbs
Gov. Sarah Palin " knows more about energy than probably anyone in the United States of America . "
-- John McCain , ABC interview , Sept. 11 , 2008 .
" My job has been to oversee nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of oil and gas . "
-- Gov. Sarah Palin , Campaign event in Golden , Colorado , Sept. 15 , 2008 .
The woman touted by John McCain as the most knowledgable person in America on energy issues has been having a lot of trouble getting her basic energy statistics straight .
Last week , Sarah Palin told Charlie Gibson of ABC
News that her state , Alaska , produced " nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy . "
Yesterday , she told a campaign rally in Golden , Colorado , that she had been responsible for overseeing " nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of oil and gas . "
Both claims are way off .
The Facts
While Alaska is a leading producer of crude oil , it produces relatively little natural gas , hardly any coal , and no nuclear power .
Its share of oil production has been declining sharply , and now ranks lower than Texas and Louisiana .
As the following table shows , Alaska is the ninth largest energy supplier in the United States , accounting for a modest 3.5 percent share of the nation 's total energy production .
State Total production Percent of U.S. Total Texas 10,829 Trillion Btu 15.6 Wyoming 9,154 13.1 Louisiana 6,760 9.7 West Virginia 4,061 5.8 California 3,198 4.6 Kentucky 3,097 4.5 New Mexico 2,752 3.9 Pennsylvania 2,694 3.8 Alaska 2,417 3.5 SOURCE : Energy Information Administration
After the non-partisan Factcheck.org pointed out Palin 's error in her interview with Gibson , the Alaska governor revised her claim somewhat , limiting it to oil and gas .
But data compiled by the Energy Information Administration contradict her claim that she oversees " nearly 20 percent " of oil and gas production in the country .
According to authoritative EIA data , Alaska accounted for just 7.4 percent of total U.S. oil and gas production in 2005 .
It is not even correct for Palin to claim that her state is responsible for " nearly 20 percent " of U.S. oil production .
Oil production has fallen sharply in Alaska during her governorship .
The state 's share of total U.S. oil production fell from 18 percent in 2005 to 13 percent this year , according to the EIA .
The McCain - Palin campaign did not respond to a request for an explanation .

One of the few things Rock Band gets wrong is the complete lack of information on per-instrument difficulty levels .
A song ’s difficulty tier is a composite of the individual Drum , Vocal , Guitar , and Bass instrument difficulties — but there ’s no way to see what those are !
It ’s all too common to get surprised by a song that ’s easy for 2 or 3 band members and incredibly difficult for the other band members .

Twitter Search ( formerly Summize ) is sweet .
I use it every day to find first - person commentary on thoughtbot ’s work , Boston sports , national politics , and anything else that catches my fancy .
The Twitter Search API is also sweet .
I wanted to use it a while back for Politweets .
In combination with a simple cron job , the effect is commentary on the U.S. Presidential Election from around the world , seen within minutes of being tweeted .
Dustin Sallings wrote a great Ruby wrapper for the Summize API that he put on github .
I forked it and added a shoulda test suite and documentation .
Introducing the Twitter Search gem .
Install the gem .
gem install twitter - search
Require the gem .
require ' twitter_search '
Set up a TwitterSearch : : Client .
Name your client ( a.k.a. ‘ user agent ’ ) to something meaningful , such as your app ’s name .
This helps Twitter Search answer any questions about your use of the API .
@client = TwitterSearch :: Client.new ' politweets '
Request tweets by calling the query method of your client .
@tweets = @client.query :q => ' twitter search '
The following operator examples find tweets …
The Twitter Search API supports foreign languages , accessible via the : lang key .
Use the ISO 639 - 1 codes as the value :
@tweets = @client.query :q => ' programmé ' , : lang => ' fr '
Alter the number of Tweets returned per page with the :rpp key .
Stick with 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , or 50 .
@tweets = @client.query :q => ' Boston Celtics ' , :rpp => ' 30 '
Searching for a positive attitude :) returns tweets containing the text :) , = ) , :D , and :-)
Searches are case - insenstive .
The near operator available in the Twitter Search web interface is not available via the API .
You must geocode before making your Twitter Search API call , and use the : geocode key in your request using the pattern lat , lngmi or lat , lngkm : @tweets = @client.query :q => ' Pearl Jam ' , : geocode => ' 43.4411,-70.9846mi'
You can get fancier with your setup , using queuing or another approach , but here ’s a simple example using cron .
Schema :
create_table " tweets " , : force => true do | t | t . string " user_name " , : limit => 20 , : default => " " , : null => false t . string " body " , : limit => 140 , : default => " " , : null => false t . datetime " created_at " , : null => false t . datetime " updated_at " , : null => false t . integer " twitter_id " , : limit => 11 end add_index " tweets " , [ " created_at " ] , : name => " index_tweets_on_created_at " add_index " tweets " , [ " twitter_id " ] , : name => " index_tweets_on_twitter_id "
Hit the API in your rake task ( write the code in a class so it can be easily tested ) :
class
Twitter def self .
import !
# the implementation is up to you end end
Since I do n’t have the cron API memorized , I like to create cron jobs with a handy little tool called crondle :
require ' lib / crondle ' Crondle .
define_jobs do | builder | rails_root = '/var/www/apps/politweets/current ' [ 3 , 9 , 15 , 21 , 27 , 33 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 57 ] . each do | minute | builder .
desc
" Import tweets at #{ minute } past the hour " builder . job " # { rails_root } / script / runner Twitter.import ! " , : minute => minute end end
Run the crondle script to get the text that you ’ll put in crontab -e :
# Import tweets at 3 past the hour 3 * * * * /var/www/apps/politweets/current/script/runner
Twitter.import ! # Import tweets at 9 past the hour 9 * * * * /var/www/apps/politweets/current/script/runner
Twitter.import !
And you ’re on your way .
Thanks to Doug , Gabe , Jason , Min , and Dustin for their work on Politweets and the Twitter Search gem .

Will the government use the DNC as cover to launch their much anticipated false flag terrorist attack ?
“ We do n’t have terrorist attacks here , we do n’t have suicide bombers and I think that ’s what people think of when they think about terrorism , ” the FBI ’s Jim Davis told Denver ’s 9
News last month .
“ There is clearly enough activity for us to be very busy in addressing potential threats . ”
Davis eluded to the usual suspects , specifically anarchists and protesters who will gather during the upcoming DNC .
“ I think there is some possibility of large scale protests , people who may have it in their mind to disrupt this convention . ”
Is it possible anarchists or other terrorists – specifically , Muslims who hate us for our freedom — will disrupt the DNC with a cloud of cyanide gas ?
It appears the corporate media is preparing us for some sort of terrorist event during the convention .
From the Associated Press :
About a pound of highly toxic sodium cyanide was found in a hotel room where a man ’s body was discovered , authorities said Wednesday .
The Denver medical examiner was still awaiting test results to determine what killed Saleman Abdirahman Dirie , 29 , of Ottawa .
Police said they do not suspect foul play , and the FBI said there was no apparent connection to terrorism .
Saleman Abdirahman Dirie was a member of the Canadian Somali community and manager of Ottawa ’s Somali Center for Family Services .
Police in Denver and the FBI may “ not suspect foul play ” and flatly declare that the case has no “ apparent connection to terrorism , ” however the mere mention of a dead man in possession of a large amount of sodium cyanide and hailing from a country that is predominately Muslim — in fact , Sunni Muslim , just like al - Qaeda — will no doubt result in a lot of hysterical speculation in the corporate media , regardless of what the FBI says at this point .
“ Cyanide is a fast - acting chemical used in manufacturing , metallurgy and pest extermination that , when inhaled or ingested , prevents the body from processing oxygen .
It can also be mixed with certain acids to produce extremely lethal cyanide gas , according to the Department of Justice , ” adds the San Francisco Chronicle .
“ Investigators have not said why Dirie had cyanide or whether he worked in a job that would have involved using it .
They also have not said how long Dirie had been in Denver or whether anyone had accompanied him . ”
As should be expected , the neocon bloggers have wasted precious little time .
Over at the Free Republic and Little Green Footballs , we learn that a reader “ points out a blog post from July with a comment by a Somali with the same name as the man found dead in Denver with a large amount of possible cyanide . ”
According to the post at LGF , Abdirahman Dirie , or somebody with that name , threatened to kill Somali Christians .
Next up , the neocon advocate of concentration camp internment for Muslims and other supposed miscreants , Michelle Malkin .
She is irritated by the media declaring there is no evidence of terrorism .
She then links to the above post at LGF .
“ This has all the earmarks of an Islamic terrorist planning to release cyanide gas at the Democratic National Party in Denver , ” writes another neocon blogger .
“ While we may not be privy to the ongoing investigation , it seems quite obvious to us that this guy was a terrorist .
But , with the FBI working on the case , one does wonder if it will just be swept under the rug … ”
In fact , if anything , it has all the earmarks of a possible false flag attack that will be blamed on Muslims , as the crop of supposed Muslim terrorists of the recent past turn out to be mentally deficient patsies and government informers and operatives .
No doubt trouble is expected in Denver , as the Colorado Army National Guard is in the process of converting “ a private Denver university campus into a restricted military lodging area during the Democratic National Convention in August ” and plans “ to rent more than 500 rooms around the Denver area , ” according to the Colorado Independent .
Moreover , the Independent reported on July 30 that federal and state law enforcement officials will increase intelligence operations at a “ fusion center ” during the Democratic National Convention , “ overseeing an information war room that will be staffed around the clock with analysts who access a dozen databases while receiving reports of ‘ suspicious activity ’ — activity that some civil libertarians claim could be nothing more than engaging in anti-war protests or photographing federal facilities that could be targeted for terrorist attack . ”
At this point , it remains to be seen if the death of a Somali Muslim , who allegedly threatened Christians , and the highly unusual presence of a pound sodium cyanide at the crime scene will pan out into a larger plot against the DNC .
Addendum
IANS reports :
A top US counter - terrorism official has warned of a heightened risk of an Al Qaeda attack during the upcoming US election season with the terrorist outfit exploiting recent political turmoil in Pakistan to strengthen its sanctuary there .
While intelligence officials are unaware of specific plans for attacks inside the US , they expect an increase in threats in the run-up to US elections , Ted Gistaro , the national intelligence officer for trans-national threats , has claimed in an assessment .
But although Al Qaeda may use the election as an excuse for an attack , there is no evidence that Osama bin Laden hopes to tilt the race in favor of either of the two major presidential candidates , Gistaro , an Al Qaeda expert , said in a speech at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Tuesday .
In other words , the CIA has no plan to “ tilt the race in favor of either of the two major presidential candidates ” because there is no difference between the two selectees .

Microsoft Corp.’s
Xbox 360 video game console will be able to stream thousands of movies over the Internet , thanks to a deal announced Monday with Netflix Inc. that highlights the way gaming devices are expanding into all - purpose home - entertainment hubs .
The arrangement , revealed at the E3 Media & Business Summit in Los Angeles , will let Netflix subscribers stream 10,000 movies and TV shows to Xbox consoles for viewing on television sets , beginning this fall .
Xbox had movies and shows available for download before , but only half as many .
“ This generation of consoles will change the face of home entertainment more than any other generation before , ” said John Schappert , corporate vice president of Microsoft ’s interactive entertainment division .
Assume you want to hire a professional .
You post a project on p2w2 .
You get responses .
But you can smell from a bid that the professional did not read what you want .
She just has a personal rant about herself that she ‘ copy pasted ’ it into the bid .
What do you think about the bid ?
Will you choose her ?
It ’s mistake for a freelancer to keep a standard bid ready and dispatch it on any type of project .
So a buyer looking for a person skilled in fiction writing receives the same profile as the one looking for someone skilled in business writing .
The result ?
Both buyers reject the bid !
Every
bid must be uniquely tailored to meet buyer ’s specs .
This is because every project is different .
Every buyer is different .
Your objective in bidding is to convince the buyer , the decision - maker , that you are the best hire for the project .
Do you really suit the buyer ’s needs ?
Bid , only if the subject / project interests you and you have the necessary expertise .
Do n’t bid out of habit , as a morning routine .
Do n’t bid for the simple reason that it ’s a high value project .
In order to make the correct choice of a project , you need to first , carefully study the needs of the buyer :
What is he / she exactly looking for in the professional ?
Do you have the skill ?
Do you have relevant samples to show your credentials ?
Do you command domain expertise the buyer wants ?
Would you be able to meet the buyer ’s deadline ?
If not …. and if you are still very keen on the project
If your answers to most of these questions are yes , by all means , bid .
If not , do n’t waste buyer ’s time and your time .
Grab a buyer ’s attention : Tailor your bid to buyer ’s requirement
Assuming a standard projects gets an average of twenty bids in response to a project , a buyer spends less than a minute on each bid .
On bids a buyer is impressed with , he / she will spend more time .
To grab and retain his / her attention during this crucial one minute of cursory scanning , highlight how you have the skills and the expertise buyer wants .
For instance , if the project asks for domain expertise in environmental writing , begin with your experience in that field .
If the buyer asked you a question , start with answering that question .
That way , you can show that you listen to your customers and give importance to them .
Talk about how your experience suits the buyer ’s requirements .
Talk about aspects of the project description that were not clear .
Ask relevant questions that show to the buyer that you understand the work .
Show samples ; show proofs of your skills
Four to five samples is a good number and these must ALL be relevant to the project .
Your samples must demonstrate your creative value and worth to the project at hand .
Your samples must show the buyer who you are and how you approach a project .
Good and relevant work samples can prove it to the buyer .
Do n’t ever direct a buyer to a portfolio site .
You pick the ones that are the most relevant and send those out as attachments with your bid .
Learn how to pitch
You ca n’t swim , unless you are comfortable with water .
Likewise , an important point to bear in mind is feeling comfortable in telling your “ story , ” your accomplishments , bit by bit , as you would to an attentive listener , or a sympathetic friend .
Overcoming an ingrained reluctance to speak highly of our accomplishments is often essential to convince an employer to hire you !
Be honest
Be concise and do not stretch the truth .
If there is an aspect of the project that you have n’t understood or are not sure you can handle , own up to that shortfall before hand and be transparent .
Take responsibility .
It ’s always better to lose a project than commit to something and not deliver , or fall short of expectations .
Whatever you do , do n’t present inaccurate information .
Do n’t come across as phony or non-trustworthy .
Examples of that would be tall claims without any substantiating evidence .
Double check for grammar and brevity
Remember that what goes in first will stay on top of the employer ’s mind .
Double check your bid for grammatical errors , composition goof - ups and poor styling .
This is more important for non-native English speakers .
Simple typos or errors — in grammar , word choice , spelling , and length can be a major put off , especially if you are applying for an editing or a ghostwriting gig .
e.g. , “ Ability to meet deadlines while maintaining composer , ” ” Hope to hear from you shorty ( correct : shortly ) , ” “ Here are my qualifications for you to overlook ( correct : have a look at .. ) ”
If your bid , in which you should be at your best , is not in good shape , buyer can figure out what your output will be .
Don’ts
– Do n’t give an emotional or an intellectual overdose in your proposal ( “ I am new on this site , please give me ONE chance . ” )
– Do n’t use sarcasm , derogative or humor that does n’t work ( “ My services are not like those of a Chinese goods manufacturer ” )
– Do n’t use false claims ( “ I am the best that you can get on this pricing ” )
– Do n’t pepper your talk with heavy - duty words ( “ I can structurally embellish your concept like no one else can . ” )
How long is too long ?
That ’s a difficult question .
Since , it ’s a self - reported account ; a personal glorification tool , one page ( or 250 - 300 words ) is often more than sufficient .
Two pages are really over the top , where you have to present really sterling credentials .
But even here , you must show substance over fluff .
Finally , remember that you bid is the first impression of your brand for a buyer .
Protect and polish it before you present it .
No use spending two hours every morning aimlessly and randomly bidding on projects that are never going to fall into your kitty .
You might as well be shooting in the dark !

Disaster Movie
Over the course of one evening , an unsuspecting group of twenty - somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events .
DENVER , June 26 ( UPI ) --
One of the fastest - growing religions in North America and Europe is new - fashioned paganism , a Canadian group says .
The Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance estimates the number of people practicing some form of paganism doubles every year and a half , The Denver Post reports .
The group believes the number of pagans in the United States is now somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million .
Advertisement
Carridwen Brennan , a Wiccan , told the Post that pagans are a varied group .
The Wiccans , the largest group , practice a form of nature worship supposedly carried on by witches after Europe became Christian .
" We do n't really know the numbers , " Brennan said .
" Most witches and pagans are semi-closeted , or so deeply closeted because of prejudice we do n't even know they 're there . "
Colorado is believed to have about twice the percentage of pagans as the national average .
They include Jesse Walter , a self - described druid , who runs the Witches ' Brew coffee shop in Denver with his wife , Kantis , who calls herself a pagan .
Walter , an Army reservist and conservative Republican , fulfills his druidic obligation to trees by picking up litter in a park across the street from the coffee shop and leaving offerings there .
ACLU calls for probe of Chertoff over ' terrorist ' watch list Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 17 , 2008
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union wants Congress to investigate the Department of Homeland Security 's creation of " militarized zones " within the US in its overuse of a terrorist watch list and other programs that endanger privacy and civil liberties .
 The Department of Homeland Security has far too many ill - conceived programs that fail to account for privacy , due process and other principles that assure fairness to the innocent ,  Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office said in a news release .
 It is time for Congress to recognize the Bush administrations security apparatus is an emperor without any clothes . "
Fredrickson said DHS agents are overzealous in their patrol of the " border , " sending agents and border check - points up to 150 miles away from the border , in effect transforming " many towns into militarized zones . "
Homeland security Secretary Michael Chertoff was testifying Thursday before the House Homeland Security Committee Thursday about DHS 's border security procedures .
 DHSs collection of personal data on millions of U.S. citizens and its ever - expanding surveillance infrastructure should raise alarms for the committee , " Fredrickson said .
" DHS provides the illusion of security without the purported benefits to our nation . "
The department has previously come under scrutiny for seizing traveler 's electronic data without warrants in the course of border searches .
Chertoff defended the policy in a recent USA Today op - ed .
The ACLU previously has criticized the Transportation Security Administration , which was folded into DHS when it was created after 9/11 , for creating a terrorist watch list that has now ballooned to more than 1 million names .
 The Akif Rahman experience is an example of DHSs inept border screenings .
This week , during an event to mark the one millionth name record on the terrorist watch list , Rahman , an American citizen , spoke about how he has repeatedly been detained at the U.S. - Canada border .
Rahman has been interrogated extensively about the mosque that his family attends and his religious observances .
Yet , after being shackled and submitting to humiliating searches , he is always cleared to leave .
When he finally filed a lawsuit , he learned that many U.S. citizens of Arab or South Asian descent suffer the same degrading fate .
The committee should question Secretary Chertoff about the departments targeting of American citizens .
 The committee also needs to investigate reports of racial profiling at the immigration checkpoints that involve Latino residents being disproportionately stopped , " Fredrickson said .
Chertoff defended one border program , referred to as Operation Streamline , in a speech last month .
According to the Dallas Morning News DHS credits the zero- tolerance border policy with reducing the flow of illegal immigrants .
" These illegal migrants come to realize that violating the law will not simply send them back to try over again , but will require them to actually serve some short period of time in a jail or prison setting  and will brand them as having been violators of the law , " Chertoff said in a speech last month .
The ACLU says the cost of such programs is too high and denies too many citizens their rights .
" The presence of DHS and National Guard agents in the Rio Grande Valley as far as 150 miles into the U.S. has transformed many towns into militarized zones .
Customs and Border Patrol ( CBP ) have immigration checkpoints in the Texas towns of Sarita , Falfurrias and Laredo , " Fredrickson said .
" This past May CBP made announcements in the media that it intended to continue screening for immigration status at these checkpoints during natural catastrophes and emergency situations .
Fortunately , when Texas Governor Rick Perry pointed out that the checkpoint delays could cost lives , CBP retracted its statement but has yet to fully communicate this to the residents of the Rio Grande Valley . 
In which I shill for odd objects , some of which you might actually need .
But probably not .

Andrew L. Schlafly , son of prominent Phyllis
Andrew Layton Schlafly ( 1961– ) , also known as " Aschlafly " , is an American lawyer and homeschool teacher in his home state of New Jersey , where he has taught at least 250 homeschooled teenagers since 2002 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
He is the founder of a fundamentalist Christian wiki called Conservapedia , which promotes extremist versions of conservative , Republican , and American - exceptionalist values , and a strictly young Earth creationist view of the history of our universe , planet , and life .
Intended as an educational resource and promoted as " The Trusworthy Trustworthy Encyclopedia , " Conservapedia has caused great controversy in print , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] on the radio , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and online , primarily over the ( lack of ) accuracy of the information that it provides .
Background [ edit ]
Personal life [ edit ]
Born in Alton , Illinois , Andrew Schlafly is the son of John Fred Schlafly Jr. ( 1909 –1993 ) , a conservative lawyer , and Phyllis Schlafly ( née Stewart , 1924 –2016 ) , a conservative activist and founder of the Eagle Forum .
Their six children were homeschooled until the age of seven . [ 8 ]
Andrew Schlafly graduated from Saint Louis Priory School , a private Catholic boys ' school , in 1978 . [ 9 ]
He graduated from Princeton University in 1981 with a B.S.E. cum laude in electrical engineering . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
He went on to study law and earn a J.D. from Harvard Law School ( 1991 ) , where he graduated magna cum laude . [ 11 ]
He was a member of the editorial board of the Harvard Law Review ( at the same time as former US President Barack Obama , who was Editor - In - Chief of the journal ) , and he clerked for a federal appellate judge in Washington , D.C .
He married Catherine Agneta Kosarek at a Roman Catholic ceremony in 1984 .
Ms. Kosarek was a fourth - year medical student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and also a Princeton graduate . [ 10 ]
They have two children .
After earning his engineering degree , Schlafly worked as a device physicist for Intel , an electrical engineer at the applied physics laboratory of Johns Hopkins University , and finally at Bell Labs . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Schlafly became a member of the New York State Bar in 1993 [ 12 ] and served as an adjunct professor of administrative law at Seton Hall Law School in 1995 . [ 13 ] [ 2 ] [ 14 ]
He first worked as an attorney at New York City law firm Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen , & Katz . [ 15 ]
He is currently General Counsel for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , [ 16 ] and has filed three civil matters on their behalf in Connecticut and Texas District Courts .
He is their head counsel for their ongoing legal challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , arguing that the government has no business regulating the medical establishment at all , or demanding " evidence - based methodology " in research of new treatments .
Aside from his work for AAPS , records reflect that Schlafly has filed one appearance in federal court since his departure from Wachtell , Lipton . [ 17 ]
Schlafly has appeared on television [ 18 ] as a voice for the anti-vaccination movement .
According to his recent political campaign contribution declarations he is currently a self - employed attorney . [ 19 ]
For several years , he has taught classes in world history , U.S. history , and economics to homeschooled high school age children for a per-student fee .
As a volunteer , he teaches eight online courses at the Eagle Forum University , [ 20 ] largely from the same course material that he provides for his homeschooling program .
In June 2009 , Schlafly wrote an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Eagle Forum for a U.S. Supreme Court case , supporting California 's law banning sales of violent video games to minors . [ 21 ]
In the brief , he accused such games of being the cause of high dropout rates and lack of academic readiness of college freshmen . [ 22 ]
He was lead counsel for the committees to recall US Senator Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) [ 23 ] and US Senator Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) . [ 24 ]
In both cases , Schlafly argued that although recall for Senators was never provided for in the Constitution of the United States , a letter George Washington had written to his nephew indicated his " sincere " personal support for the idea , and therefore recall should have been considered implicit .
In both cases , the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling on November 18 , 2010 and the North Dakota Supreme Court on December 21 , 2010 [ 25 ] dismissed the petitions before them .
As of May , 2013 Andrew Schlafly is litigating against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( colloquially known as " Obamacare " ) on behalf of the AAPS in the state of Texas .
The thrust of his argument is that the Act violates the Fifth Amendment . [ 26 ]
Political career and current affiliation [ edit ]
In 1992 , Schlafly made a bid for the Republican Party nomination for a seat in the United States House of Representatives , but was defeated in the primary , garnering 11 % of the vote and finishing in fifth and last place [ 27 ] [ 28 ] after spending $ 85,000 of his own money .
In the 2008 presidential primaries , Schlafly contributed $ 1500 to the campaign of Republican candidate Mike Huckabee . [ 29 ]
In 2010 , he donated $ 500 to Art Robinson ( R - Oregon ) for Congress [ 30 ] , and in 2012 , he donated $ 700 to the campaign of Wayne Iverson ( R - California ) for Congress . [ 31 ] .
Public records do not indicate him supporting a candidate in the 2012 Presidential Election , and he repeatedly indicated his lack of support for Mitt Romney in his contributions at Conservapedia , primarily due to " RomneyCare " . [ 32 ]
Political activism [ edit ]
Schlafly has sat on the Board of Directors of Students for Life , a pro-life movement which aims to " end abortion by educating students about the issues of abortion , euthanasia , and infanticide " . [ 33 ]
He is a regular participant in the annual March for Life event that takes place in Washington , D.C .
In 2010 he " chartered two large buses for his trip to the March for Life , and hope (d ) to have 94 participants , the largest single contingent from New Jersey . " [ 34 ]
He claims to have filled three buses for the 2011 march . [ 35 ]
Religious beliefs [ edit ]
Schlafly was raised as a Roman Catholic , attended a Catholic boys school , and was married in a Catholic church . [ 10 ]
He interprets the Bible and the events that occur within it literally , believing the Global Flood to have happened approximately 5,300 years ago , [ 36 ] as well as holding Young Earth Creationist views .
He also seems to believe the God of the Bible to be highly interventionist in present day life , suggesting His or Its direct involvement with everyday occurrences such as the American sporting market and dreams . [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
Andrew Schlafly , homeschool teacher [ edit ]
When considering whether to employ Schlafly as an educator of your children , we feel there are a few issues which should be brought to the attention of potential students , parents and their families .
We list some of these , with links to his own statements on the issues , mostly from Conservapedia .
Qualifications ( or lack thereof ) [ edit ]
Outline legal status of homeschooling [ edit ]
Although the State of New Jersey requires no type of teacher certification for homeschool teachers , nor the use of standardized texts , instruction academically “ equivalent ” to that in the public schools is required . [ 39 ]
If legal action is initiated , parents must carry the burden of providing the local superintendent with evidence that the child is in fact receiving equivalent instruction .
However , ultimately it is the state that must prove “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” that the parents failed to provide their child with equivalent education . [ 40 ]
The law as it relates to homeschooling varies from state to state . [ 41 ]
Qualifications as an educator [ edit ]
There is currently no evidence in the public domain for his credentials or training in the fields of education or childhood / pre-college development , [ 2 ] nor did he declare any training or certification in education in his March 2009 application to the State of New Jersey to establish an education program . [ 42 ]
Educational standards [ edit ]
AP certification and his courses [ edit ]
Schlafly 's class is not AP - certified , [ 43 ] but he does suggest " Students seeking to earn college credit can take the CLEP or AP exams upon successful completion of this course . " [ 44 ]
Schlafly has said he will not seek certification for his course as he feels the board would " censor " him . [ 45 ]
An apparently experienced homeschooling parent has publicly discussed at length with Schlafly that his course is not at AP level and may poorly prepare students for the exam . [ 46 ]
A student taking the AP test upon completion of Mr. Schlafly 's class should not expect to be adequately prepared , and without additional preparation , it would be difficult to qualify for college credit .
This is rather ironic since his user page has a loud and proud list of college acceptances .
The list includes mostly Christian schools like Biola University and Liberty University .
The book Schlafly uses in his course is apparently a review book , [ 47 ] and not a proper textbook . [ 48 ]
AP courses use college - level textbooks .
A comparison between Schlafly 's course and the AP course can be seen here .
Oddly enough , Schlafly admits that he is not convinced of his own ability to qualify the children he teaches for college , [ 49 ] as he does not follow the expected curricula .
He had consequentially sought " suggestions " from his community of students and editors as to how he might do so .
Educational practice [ edit ]
Sexism [ edit ]
Schlafly believes that girls are less intelligent than boys and has said " Think girls can excel in math as well as boys can ?
Liberals teach they can , which is teaching a falsehood . " [ 50 ]
He also derided the findings of a report which showed no difference in educational ability between genders as " politically correct . "
His attitude is further apparent on the examinations for his American History course , in which girls are given 15 % fewer questions than boys but the same amount of time to finish it . [ 51 ]
Furthermore , he disapproves of inter-gender competition [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] and his course curriculum reflects this .
He has argued that gender differences are clear in mathematical ability in universities , [ 55 ] saying that there 's no reason God would have created men and women the same , and that they have very different physical appearances . [ 56 ]
The AP exam , SAT - II , and college exams make no such distinction for female students .
This opinion contrasts with most educational studies .
An American Psychological Association ( APA ) study found no difference in achievement across the gender gap in 7.2 million students nationwide , and the National Science Foundation found that " girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests " . [ 57 ]
And while there are indeed fewer women working today in science and mathematical fields than men , many studies [ 58 ] show that the reason for the imbalance is because women are in the minority and societal norms are being perpetuated . [ 59 ] [ 60 ]
The outstanding achievements of women scientists , [ 61 ] mathematicians [ 62 ] and astronauts [ 63 ] are well documented , and most teachers encourage their female students , but Schlafly actively discourages his from attempting to compete with boys .
There have even been public protests from his female students , [ 64 ] but nevertheless he continues to pursue his agenda .
Schlafly 's view on gender roles extends into adulthood — he has mocked the idea of a woman wanting to become a CEO of a Fortune 500 company , suggesting that a woman wanting to " act like businessman and aspire to run a restaurant is feminist . " [ 65 ]
In a news posting about the death of a female politician who had tried to pass an Equal Rights Bill " which would have required identical treatment of men and women , and boys and girls , " he referred to such a goal as " feminist . " '
Conservapedia's own article on sexual discrimination , which intentionally includes only instances of sexism against men , has a paragraph deriding women who want equal pay for similar jobs that men hold .
It ends with the ironically sexist statement : " The fact that women pursue family life and other non-monetary activities contributes to a false sense of inequality when equity is determined by average earnings .
Women are often fulfilled and fully equal when performing their traditional duties within the home . " [ 66 ]
Class size [ edit ]
Conventional educational wisdom dictates that smaller class sizes are preferable because of the individual attention a teacher can give each student , but Schlafly believes the opposite is true - that in fact larger class sizes are better .
This notion is particularly strange given his overwhelming support for homeschooling , which would be expected to have a very small class size .
He defended his ideas in an essay at Conservapedia . [ 67 ]
Our own defense of smaller classes , and a rebuttal to the individual points made by Mr. Schlafly , can be seen here .
The notion that smaller class sizes are preferable for a child 's education is so universally acknowledged that class size is an important factor in official college rankings ( smaller average class size yielding a higher rank on the listings ) . [ 68 ]
If you intend to enroll your child in one of Mr. Schlafly 's classes under the impression that your child will be in a smaller , more intimate environment , and will receive more personal attention than in a public school classroom , you are likely mistaken .
Inflated sense of expertise [ edit ]
Schlafly frequently claims expertise in whatever subject he is debating , and has repeatedly attacked and denied opinion , evidence , and references by qualified editors , making unsubstantiated claims that are opinion , assertion , or uneducated guesses , and of which he brooks no criticism .
He has declared himself supremely knowledgeable in the fields of anthropology , [ 69 ] astronomy , biblical scholarship and translation , [ 70 ] the entertainment industry , [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] microbiology , [ 77 ] nutrition , [ 78 ] oncology , [ 71 ] psychiatry , [ 79 ] [ 80 ] mathematics , relativity , [ 81 ] statistics , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] and world history . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ]
( For a detailed list of claims , see here . )
Schlafly is openly contemptuous of credentialed experts , [ 87 ] particularly so when they conflict with his uncited assertions .
His slogan " Do n't read a book to learn , write a book to learn " [ 88 ] underlines this stance , and while this statement may seem impressively philosophical at first glance , it becomes less so after one gives more than one second 's thought as to what it actually means .
Schlafly proposes that editing Conservapedia is a better way to learn than " reading a book , attending a seminar , ... discussing with people [ sic ] " [ 89 ] and that " In merely a few spare minutes or hours , the participants in The Conservative Bible Project have learned more than they could have after spending 10 x or 100 x many hours in any other medium . " [ 89 ]
He considers Conservapedia to be one of the greatest achievements throughout history . [ 90 ]
Despite his claims of expertise in numerous fields , Schlafly often makes distinctive errors both in his online lectures and when posting on Conservapedia .
Some of his more blatant factual errors are listed below .
Confusing England with the United Kingdom in the run up to the UK General Election , 2010 .
Mistaking the British Labour Party for the Liberal Party .
Arguing , against all evidence to the contrary , that Fidel Castro died sometime before December 2009 , [ 91 ] going so far as to suggest that the Pope was duped by a Castro double following their meeting in March 2012 . [ 92 ]
going so far as to suggest that the Pope was duped by a Castro double following their meeting in March 2012 .
Arguing , with no supporting evidence and against the fact that the monarch is officially the head of the Church of England , that Great Britain is " atheistic . "
Arguing that British people are poor at maths and spelling despite having no statistics to support this and frequently displaying a lack of skill in grammar and spelling himself .
Claiming that a correlation exists between atheism and obesity .
Lack of emphasis on grammar and spelling [ edit ]
Schlafly spends little time if any providing students with writing guidance . [ note 1 ]
He is a native English speaker , but his own contributions are rife with poor grammar , punctuation , and spelling , which remain uncorrected and unacknowledged .
Examples include :
" See if you can learn out to spell ' superior ' " [ 93 ]
" You 're ' sources ' for that ungrammatical claim are interesting ... " [ 94 ]
" You 'll be fine if you 're hear to teach and lear n " [ 95 ]
In spite of these mistakes , Schlafly often claims expertise in spelling , grammar and punctuation , and usually comments negatively when his students make spelling mistakes .
These responses typically have no bearing on the suggestions put to him , [ 96 ] [ 97 ] such as when Schlafly deflects attention from his unsubstantiated encyclopedia entries concerning Barack Obama as a Muslim . [ 98 ]
By criticizing the contributor 's spelling instead , and with an unrelenting emphasis on what he regards to be liberal , [ 99 ] the British English spelling of the word " honor / honour " for example is , on its own terms , taken as being not only non-American , but " liberal , " because it is non-American .
Ignoring and twisting facts to suit his agenda [ edit ]
Despite claiming to have taught a " World History " class , [ note 2 ]
Schlafly is not above ignoring history altogether , in order to support his own assertions .
Having previously decided that atheists do not support underdogs , [ 100 ] and thus by implication the " atheistic " British do not support underdogs , Schlafly went on to say firstly that " the Brits did not support the underdog in WWII , until they became one themselves , " [ 101 ] which he later clarified by saying , " Britain was just fine with Hitler running over neighboring underdog countries .
Did n't Neville Chamberlain even receive a hero's reception for siding with Germany ? " [ 102 ]
This shows either complete ignorance of a topic he is supposed to have taught to school children , or willful twisting of the facts to suit his current agenda .
Either trait is unbecoming behaviour in somebody with aspirations to be a teacher .
Public grading of homework [ edit ]
Mr. Schlafly grades his students ' homework publicly , online .
The students ' answers are posted , and Mr. Schlafly provides notes , commentary , corrections and gradings for all to see - not just other students , but anyone who happens to be reading Conservapedia , including people who are not supportive of the students .
Some educators would argue this is neither fair nor appropriate , and that a private teacher - student relationship when grading allows greater mutual understanding and a less judgmental educational environment .
Recent examples of public grading can be seen on Conservapedia . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]
Grade inflation [ edit ]
Schlafly derides grade inflation in liberal schools .
However , when grading his students ' homework , Mr. Schlafly has yet to give less than 8 out of 10 correct marks on any question ( except under exceptional circumstances ; see below ) , even if the answer is clearly wrong .
[ 107 ]
Additionally , a typical score for a homework assignment containing various errors and the most cursory of answers is 98 % . [ 108 ] [ 109 ]
The reasons for this inflation remain unclear , although it may just be because Schlafly himself lacks the proper knowledge to assess his students ' performance .
Whatever the reasoning , it should be obvious that a student who is used to receiving 98 % on poorly performed tests will not be sufficiently prepared for real - life grading , if they subsequently attend College or University .
Poor communication with students [ edit ]
Schlafly 's guidance as to how his American History course students should focus their studying time left many scratching their heads as to his intent :
“ ” You will spend a certain amount of time preparing for the midterm exam .
Call that amount of time " x " .
How you allocate that time to different areas of 1500 - 1877 will make a difference on how well you do on the exam .
If you spend 90 % of x on the period between 1500 and 1700 , then you will do poorly on 90 % of the questions , because they will be from the period 1700 to 1877 .
You would have done far better to spend the 90 % of x on the time period that will have 90 % of the questions .
[ 110 ]

You would have done far better to spend the 90 % of x on the time period that will have 90 % of the questions .
This kind of poor communication with his students perhaps explains the basic nature of many of his students ' examination answers .
Disdain for other students [ edit ]
Schlafly has a very poor opinion of public schools in the US , and repeatedly disparages them in comments , articles and on the Conservapedia " News feed , " [ 111 ] but he has also personalized this issue and mocked the students of such schools themselves . [ 112 ]
It provides an interesting insight into this educator 's mindset to see him publicly mock young students , even if he does not agree with their beliefs .
Attitude towards criticism [ edit ]
Schlafly will brook no criticism of his educational practices and standards — even when confronted by students with well - supported and thought - out critiques of his work .
A student named RexBanner , who claimed to represent a group of students taking Schlafly 's World History course in October 2011 , pointed to a number of inconsistencies in grading and wrong answers being given full marks .
[ 113 ]
Schlafly called the criticism " nitpicky . " [ 114 ]
Banner further queried Schlafly , questioning his competency and professionalism . [ 115 ]
After a second user asked about RexBanner 's concerns , and another message from Banner , Schlafly promised to look into the matter , [ 116 ] but subsequently " trimmed " the conversation from his talk page , leaving the criticisms unanswered . [ 117 ]
Schlafly has also almost consistently incorporated his personal opinion into comments , especially when the student is ( more ) factually accurate than he is .
In one example , a student doubted the idea that Adam and Eve are only six thousand years old because of cave paintings , and Schlafly said , " The cave paintings lack any corroborating evidence , and there are good questions to ask about whether the paintings were dated or simply some sediment nearby ( probably the latter ) .
If mankind were as old as 20,000 B.C. , then I would expect writings or civilizations , which are much older than what has been discovered , to be found , " [ 118 ] which suggests that he either a ) does n't know what " nomadic " means , or b ) is completely ignorant of the fact that humans were nomadic during the Paleolithic age .
Beliefs [ edit ]
Disdain for books [ edit ]
In a country where adolescents are struggling to maintain high literacy , Schlafly has voiced an unusual ( for an educator ) disdain for the printed word , approving of the anticipated closing of a city 's only bookstore as follows : " Nearly 250,000 people will soon be without a single bookstore .
Most books ( other than the Bible ) are liberal claptrap anyway , so this is probably good news . "
He has also celebrated the liquidation sales of some Borders bookstores , saying that " Liberal claptrap is available at record - low prices ! " [ 119 ]
Disrespect for academic qualifications [ edit ]
Schlafly is highly dismissive of academia and academics in general , [ 120 ] [ 121 ] and believes that " the process of inducing people to rely on ' the perceived view of experts ' is a misleading one . "
Schlafly 's view is that learning is best achieved by ignoring experienced , qualified researchers in any given field and instead " thinking for oneself . " [ 121 ] [ 122 ]
Throughout Conservapedia , many other examples of this philosophy exist .
Additionally , the Conservapedia article Professor values , created and written mostly by Schlafly , is clear in its disregard for academics .
In a March 2008 appearance on CBC 's late - night show The Hour , Schlafly stated about Conservapedia : " I do n't have to live with what 's printed in the newspaper , I do n't have to take what 's put out by Wikipedia .
We 've got our own way to express knowledge and the more that we can clear out the liberal bias that erodes our faith , the better . " [ 123 ]
Politicization of curriculum [ edit ]
Andrew Schlafly politicizes most topics he teaches .
He believes that movies , books and music have underlying political messages that are either liberal or conservative , and in particular has refused to watch any movie featuring Tom Hanks ( a well known liberal ) in the belief that his films push a liberal agenda . [ 124 ]
He furthermore claims that the dictionary has become affected by liberal bias as it contains an entry on CE ( common era ) . [ 125 ]
In October 2008 , in order to justify teaching a very large homeschool class , Schlafly claimed that all teachers ' unions were liberal , and seek smaller classes in order to enhance liberal mind control . [ 126 ]
He also contended that small homeschool groups are often liberal public school teachers teaching outside their class who are thoroughly indoctrinated in the small - class mind control . [ 126 ]
Seemingly innocuous words such as " efficiency , " " phonics , " or " radar " also fall under Schlafly 's dichotomy of liberal / conservative . [ 127 ]
Hygiene [ edit ]
Schlafly has unusual beliefs about hygiene , believing that hand - washing is an " irrational phobia " [ 128 ] ( " catching disease by having unclean hands at a meal is a grossly exaggerated risk , like other phobias " [ 129 ] ) .
His basis for this theory is that Jesus did not think that it was necessary . [ 130 ] [ 131 ]
This may not be an ideal approach in a classroom environment , as ' school bugs ' tend to pass rapidly amongst groups of children , and vigilant hand - washing has been seen by the CDC to reduce transmission of infections by between 30 and 70 % . [ 132 ]
School shootings [ edit ]
Andy Schlafly blamed the Sandy Hook massacre on video games , and said that it would n't have happened " if laws banning guns for self defense in public school were repealed . " [ 133 ]
Biblical skepticism [ edit ]
Perhaps most concerning of all to Christian parents , Schlafly has conflicting views on the Bible .
On the one hand , as a very conservative Christian with a literalist interpretation of the Bible ( he prefers the NIV , although he believes it is too liberal and is " written at only the 7th Grade level " [ 134 ] [ 135 ] ) , he views it as the authoritative work of history and science and thus believes that Genesis is a true description of the beginning of time .
As a result , he holds , along with other Conservapedia administrators , Young Earth Creationist views , believing that the Earth is 6,000 - 10,000 years old and that dinosaurs and humans co-existed until recent times .
On the other hand , Schlafly also believes that certain passages of the Bible are " suspect " and have been modified since the original passages were written .
In the case of the " adultress parable " ( John 7:53 - 8:11 [ 136 ] ) in which Jesus invited those without sin to cast the first stone at an adulteress , he believes that these passages were inserted later in order to support a liberal worldview in which sinners are forgiven . [ 137 ]
Schlafly views this behavior of Jesus to be the beginning of so - called " Moral Relativism , " of which he disapproves ; for this reason , he argues that this passage of the Bible is actually a hoax . [ 138 ]
Throughout Conservapedia , Schlafly uses examples from the Bible to prove his points , believing as he does that it is the infallible Word of God .
Yet his conflicting beliefs that certain passages of the Bible are hoaxes complicate that belief enormously .
His desire to revise the texts of the Bible and remove what he describes as " vandalism " to the Bible [ 139 ] to fit his own views disturbed many of even his closest peers at Conservapedia , as did his evident desire to disavow Christian forgiveness [ 138 ] of the adulteress in the story .
Conservative Bible Project [ edit ]
On Christmas Day 2008 , he became a false prophet by starting the ' Bible Retranslation Project ' , wherein he proposed a rewriting of the Bible to , for example , replace all instances of the term " The Word of God " with his own translation , " The Truth of God , " and the rewording of The Ten Commandments with the wording " Thou Shalt Not Murder " replacing " Thou Shalt Not Kill . " [ 140 ]
Schlafly went on to write that " no fully conservative translation of the Bible exists as of 2009 .
" img
Realizing that he did not have the knowledge necessary to translate the Bible from Greek , he began a less ambitious project , The Conservative Bible Projectimg , wherein English passages were re-written , as a campaign for a widescale rewrite of the Bible to match his own values , making references to the fact that all current versions of the Bible are " dumbed down , " contain passages of doubtful authenticity , are not gender - specific enough , and " improperly encourage the ' social justice ' movement among Christians , " [ 141 ] among other claims .
He also suggested the complete removal of Luke 23:34 , where Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing . "
He estimates the entire retranslation of the New Testament into a proper , conservative version could be achieved within three months by five translators starting from scratch .
However , he has admitted he 's ignorant of Greek , Hebrew and even Aramaic , the language Jesus spoke . [ 142 ]
Schlafly 's project has attracted the aggressive condemnation of one of the most well - known Christian conservative web sites , World Net Daily .
In October 2009 , the owner and editor of the publication , Joseph Farah , wrote an article strongly castigating the entire Conservative Bible Project , labeling it " incredibly stupid " and " profoundly dangerous . " [ 143 ]
Other reactions from pundits and bloggers from all sides of the political and religious spectrum have ranged from outrage to ridicule .
A selection of blogs and articles on the subject are listed here .
In 2009 , Schlafly was interviewed on The Colbert Report regarding his conservative bible project . [ 144 ]
Conservapedia [ edit ]
Typically part of his homeschooled courses will take place on his online encyclopedia , Conservapedia .
When considering whether to have Schlafly as a teacher of your students / children , please be aware of the environment they will be exposed to on Conservapedia .
History [ edit ]
Schlafly founded Conservapedia on November 21 , 2006 , with the help of his homeschooled history students , to counter what he perceived as a " liberal and atheist bias " in the highly popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia .
He felt the need to start the project after reading a student 's assignment written using Common Era ( C.E. ) , a type of dating notation the student found on Wikipedia , rather than the Anno Domini ( " In the year of the Lord " ) ( A.D. ) system that he preferred .
Schlafly strongly maintains his positions throughout the site .
He keeps a watchful eye on the content posted , and he and his administrators never allow suggestive , racy or obscene material , offensive language or terminology to remain on the site .
Unfortunately they do not allow anything on the site that questions their preconceived notions even when presented with credible evidence .
The articles on the Theory of Relativity and evolution are probably the best examples of this mindset .
He is clearly dedicated to the success of his site , and routinely makes 30 - plus edits a day to the content .
Initially , it was an interesting attempt to build a conservative , Christian - friendly , pro-American encyclopedia , with his students helping write short articles on various topics ( in " American History " , for example ) as part of their coursework in his class .
Internet commentators picked up on his project in early 2007 and created a rush of traffic to the site , and there has continued to be some interest in the site ever since .
Many editors from across the political spectrum were concerned about the site 's content and some of Schlafly 's assertions , and created accounts in order to contribute to the articles and join the discussions .
As a result , instead of a group of children building an encyclopedia and having fun while learning , the site has become the battlefield of a series of power struggles in the " Culture Wars " between adults .
Einstein's Theory of General Relativity [ edit ]
Schlafly made a fool of himself by claiming that Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity is a " liberal hoax " , [ 145 ] that it's " false " , " confuses people " , and " misleads people into stop reading the Bible " . [ 146 ]
He went on to create a page on his website called " counterexamples to relativity " .
Schlafly 's opposition to Einstein's Theory of Relativity is due in part to Laurence H. Tribe 's thanking Barack Obama in the footnote of a Harvard Law paper , and because Obama also assisted Tribe with his book entitled ' Abortion : The Clash of Absolutes ' , [ 147 ]
Andrew Schlafly conflated the Theory of Relativity with moral relativism , and because Schlafly believes that liberals have no positive morals , he determined that the Theory of Relativity is a " liberal hoax " .
" Gravity " ( gravitational ) waves [ edit ]
In 2012 , Schlafly also created a Conservapedia page , incorrectly titled " gravity waves " , in which he initially stated , " Gravity waves are predicted by the Theory of Relativity but , despite wasting millions of dollars looking for them , they have never been found . " [ 148 ]
Gravitational waves were a necessary component predicted by Albert Einstein for the Theory of Relativity to be proven correct , which is why Schlafly feels compelled to deny them .
He was corrected by User : 20 percent , [ 149 ] who provided an update on gravitational waves , who was then banned for the given reason of " inserting false information " , despite the information having been correct . [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
Instead , Schlafly prefers to make the generic and unbacked assertion that a " closer reading " of a 1993 paper reporting measurements of change in pulsars instead matched the data to the Theory . [ 152 ]
On 11 February 2016 , the day of a conference in Washington , D.C. , announcing the successful discovery of gravitational waves , [ 153 ] Andrew Schlafly ( User : Aschlafly ) , himself , commented on the discovery on his own " gravity waves " page , removing the point that User : 20 percent previous made : " this discovery strikes a blow to the anti-relavity argument " , and replaced it with an assertion that it 's all still a hoax , [ 154 ] based upon a 2010 prank that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory colleagues used to teach a lesson to always double - check their work .
Additionally , Schlafly makes the claim that " Gravity waves have never been directly observed " , [ 154 ] as if he expects gravitational waves to be seen with the naked eye , instead of recognizing that instruments must , inherently , be used to detect that which is invisible .
Based upon Michio Kaku 's suggestion that the landmark discovery deserves a Nobel Prize , Schlafly claimed that " demands immediately rang out for a Nobel Prize " , dismissing the importance of the discovery , and portraying those who appreciate scientific discoveries as aggressive " demanders " . [ 154 ]

Schlafly has published a handful of technical papers in the fields of engineering and law .
The following is a list of his publications that appear in journals of note .
