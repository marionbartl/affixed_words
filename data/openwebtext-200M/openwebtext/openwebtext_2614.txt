Silverlight Article Updates and PyCrypto for AMD64
I 've updated a couple of the Silverlight articles on my IronPython and Silverlight Pages :
From Silverlight to Javascript and Back Again
An article on using the Scriptable attributes to call from IronPython into Javascript and from Javascript into IronPython .
The update makes a couple of parts less confusing and corrects a mistake .
Thanks to Jimmy Schementi for pointing these out .
The download is unchanged .
Embedding IronPython in a C# Silverlight Application
Although the minimal example I had in this article worked , it had problems as soon as you tried to do anything non-trivial ( like import Python modules for example ! ) .
This has now been corrected ; thanks to Richard Klafter for pointing this out and providing the correction .
The example project for download has been extended with the new code .
I 've also posted online a binary distribution of PyCrypto 2.0.1 for Windows , for Python 2.6 , for AMD64 processors !
This was provided , by Jeffrey Foran .
Many thanks .
He says ( by the way ) :
It was built with the free MSVC compiler and some minor hackery ( minimal hackery to the pycrypto files , lots of hackery to the python and microsoft build tools ) .
It passes all the tests fine , but it was not fun to actually get together .
I tried very hard to build 2.5 also , but it was much more difficult for various reasons .
Resolverhacks : Unit Testing Spreadsheets and Importing CSV Files with Cell.
Formula
I 've created two new spreadsheets for the Resolver Hacks Website ( with more in the works ) .
I have n't yet written the articles that accompany them , but I 've linked to them here in case it takes me a while to get round to it ...
Both of these articles use new features in Resolver One 1.4 .
Resolver
One is a .NET programmable spreadsheet for developing applications and spreadsheet systems .
Spreadsheets created with Resolver
One are represented as IronPython programs which you can add code to using Python and .NET libraries : the dreamweaver of spreadsheets .
Both of these spreadsheets are hosted on the Resolver Exchange :
Importing CSV Files Using the Cell Formula Property
This spreadsheet is both a tool and an example .
Resolver
One does n't currently support importing from CSV files out of the box .
You can easily import CSVs from user code , but the import is repeated every recalc and you can't edit the values .
This spreadsheet allows you to import a comma or tab delimited file into a worksheet .
It uses a .NET CSV Parser shipped with Resolver One and so has no external dependencies .
Click the button on the ' Import ' spreadsheet and select the CSV file to import .
After importing , the contents of the file will be in the ' Data ' worksheet and you can delete the user code and save the spreadsheet with a new name .
Resolver One version 1.4 allows you to set data in the grid using the Formula property on cells .
As well as being a useful tool this spreadsheet provides examples of using the cell Formula property plus using the OpenFileDialog and MessageBox ( Windows Forms ) dialogs from user code .
Test Driven Development of Spreadsheets
One of the coolest features of Resolver One is RunWorkbook .
It can be used to create spreadsheet systems where the data is stored in a single spreadsheet and used in multiple places , or for turning spreadsheets into functions that can be called with new data to run calculations on .
RunWorkbook is an IronPython function that exposes the Resolver One calculation engine - and we can actually use it from IronPython to Access Resolver One spreadsheets from Python programs .
One of the interesting possibilities this opens up is doing Test Driven Development of spreadsheets .
You can write unit tests ( using the Python unittest module ) for the spreadsheets passing in known data to RunWorkbook and introspecting the returned workbook object to make assertions .
Although it will probably make more sense when the article is written , the zip file for download contains the spreadsheet and a unit test file that incrementally tests features in the spreadsheet .
See the note below about the setup needed to run the tests ( you need Resolver One 1.4 installed for starters ) .
Note Both of these spreadsheets require Resolver One version 1.4 .
You can download it from here .
In order to run the tests for the TDD example you will need to follow the instructions in Using Resolver One Spreadsheets from IronPython .
This means copying ipy.exe from IronPython 2.0.1 into the bin directory of your Resolver One install .
We also have a new Resolver One ad on The Daily WTF , this time promoting the Resolver One Spreadsheet Challenge .
You might have to refresh the page a few times to see it !
Resolver One 1.4 : IronPython 2 , Numpy , and R
Resolver One is the Python and .NET programmable spreadsheet created by Resolver Systems After a lot of work , Resolver One 1.4 is now released !
Version 1.4 took us a long time ; the main feature is that Resolver One is now built on IronPython 2 .
We worked closely with the IronPython team on improving the performance of IronPython 2 - Resolver
One exposed performance issues that only show up when you run a large Python application and IronPython 2.0.1 is largely the result of the work of Glenn ( Resolver Systems ) and Dino Veihland ( Microsoft IronPython team ) working together on it .
Tangible benefits this brings to Resolver One users include : Python 2.5 ( with statement - yay ! ) and improved compatibility with the standard library ( especially urllib2 which many users have requested ) .
Due to the new compilation technique startup is also slightly faster .
The three other major features in Resolver One 1.4 are :
The first step towards model side scripting - button handler code can now modify values and formulae in the spreadsheet ( see Cell. Formula documentation )
Support for Numpy arrays in the spreadsheet grid - through Ironclad ( see this screencast for an illustration of what is possible )
24 new statistical functions now supported by Resolver One ( see this list of all Spreadsheet functions in Resolver One )
You can read all about the release and a full list of all changes :
As always you can download a 31 days free trial , or if you are sharing the spreadsheets you create you can request an open source license : Download Resolver One .
The Resolver Challenge is still running and we 've just announced the winner of round two .
Marjan Ghahremani has worked out how to get Resolver
One to work with R , an advanced statistical system .
Marjan is a student at UC Davis , double majoring in psychology and anthropology .
Her interest is in doing research on social and developmental psychology , and for data analysis she needs a very strong statistical tool .
R fits the bill perfectly , and with her integration code she can call into it from the Resolver One graphical interface .
Many congratulations to Marjan , and a huge " thank you " to all the other entrants !
You can download the R integration code , along with an explanatory PDF file , from here .
In order to run complicated statistical analysis / modeling I use R ( an open source clone of the powerful commercial language S - Plus ) .
R is the most successful statistical library currently existing on the market .
R has different powerful libraries for data mining , genetics , portfolio optimization , asset allocation , etc .
Although R is the strongest tool for statistical analysis , unlike SPSS it lacks an easy to use yet a powerful spreadsheet .
On the other hand building a bridge between R and Resolver one is extremely difficult and involved a number of trial and errors and using Interop objects .
By using the provided framework one can enjoy the power of all of the R libraries with the comfort and the power of Resolver One .
The accompanying examples will help the reader to use similar strategies to solve complicated statistical problems and to develop exciting results and 2D / 3D graphs using OpenGL capabilities and drawing .
Users are able to develop fly - through 3D visualizations from Resolver One by using RGL library in R ( see screenshot ) .
I have made an effort to provide a complete framework with directions for how to write a program in this framework and how to do error handling between R and Resolver One .
All the complex libraries are provided in binary format and users only need to call them from within their Resolver One .
It will then enable them to use all the functionality of R inside their Resolver One spreadsheets and send them information successfully back and forth between these two programs .
The same component can be used to call SciLab functions ( a clone of MATLAB , a scientific computing environment ) , using the same procedure provided in the article , users are able to use SciLab similar to the way they use R inside Resolver One .
If you were n't able to enter this round of the competition , or want to try again , there are three more rounds to go - with a $ 2,000 prize for each - before the final " best of the best " $ 15,000 decision in May
Interface design , Usability and Kitchen Hobs
I 'm very interested in application usability .
I 'm aware that for those who are n't computer experts they can be complex and bewildering .
As someone who has been using using computers inside and out for years this is something that is easy to forget ; that the metaphors on which a modern OS is built are not ' intuitive ' to the average human .
To use modern computers fluently requires a huge amount of background experience that only comes from time , and even better from taking apart machines and programs to understand what is really going on underneath the metaphors .
Poorly designed applications and user interfaces on top of this make computers painfully difficult .
On the other hand computers and applications can be usable , and if the things we create do n't make people 's lives less painful then we 're wasting our time .
I 'm also interested in programming language design , and I like this quote from Guido van Rossum : " a programming language is an HCI " ( Human Computer Interface ) .
Programming languages are compromises between the language that computers speak ( an electromagnetic dance where even 1s and 0s are an abstraction for the sake of humans ) and a language that we 're capable of reading and writing .
User interface design is n't restricted to the world of computers .
My Dad is a health and safety consultant , specialising in health and safety as it applies to computer controlled systems .
This includes industrial plant and machinery , power stations , oil rigs and the like .
One of the most common causes of accidents , including fatal accidents , is operator error .
Behind the operator error is often a poorly designed user interface , making the system or machinery much harder to operate correctly under pressure : bad UIs kill !
Because of this my Dad has also been interested in interface design for many years .
He tells me that some of the best studies in the field are based on child psychology and there are aspects of interface design that can be categorised as objectively good or bad .
One thing that every child learns early in its development is the principle of one - to - one correspondence .
In its basic form you can see this in young children learning to use their limbs ; that signals they send from their brain result in a corresponding movement in their arms and legs is a fascinating voyage of discovery for young babies .
This principle of one - to - one correspondence is baked into us and applies to the HCI .
When we move the mouse physically with our hands the pointer moves in exact correspondence ; which makes it easy to learn .
One example of an astonishingly badly designed user interface is the kitchen hob .
The most common design has four cooking rings arranged in a square pattern .
If it had four control knobs arranged in the same pattern then everyone would know which knob corresponded to which ring intuitively .
The most common design pattern for hobs lays the four knobs out in a straight line ; violating one - to - one correspondence with the consequence that you have to look and work out which one you need to use ( and if you 're anything like me probably getting it wrong anyway ) .
If the knobs were arranged in the same pattern as the rings then everyone would find them straightforward to operate ; one - to - one correspondence at work .
Real World IronPython at QCon
Next week I 'll be at QCon in London , speaking on Real World IronPython :
IronPython is a port of Python , a popular open source dynamic language , to the .NET framework .
. NET has traditionally been programmed with statically typed languages like C# and VB.
NET .
Resolver Systems has been developing a full application with IronPython for the last three years .
In this session we 'll see how a dynamic language integrates with the .NET framework , learn what advantages it brings and look at several real - world use cases for IronPython ; including adding user scripting to .NET applications .
This will be a new talk for me , and I 'm looking forward to it .
I was invited to QCon by Ola Bini who is running the Emerging Languages in the Enterprise track .
Other speakers in this track include Martin Fowler , so I 'm in illustrious company !
If you 're at QCon come and say hi , see you there .

WASHINGTON  President Obama will propose further tax increases on the affluent to help pay for his promise to make health care more accessible and affordable , calling for stricter limits on the benefits of itemized deductions taken by the wealthiest households , administration officials said Wednesday .
The tax proposal , coming after recent years in which wealth has become more concentrated at the top of the income scale , introduces a politically volatile edge to the Congressional debate over Mr. Obama ’s domestic priorities .
The president will also propose , in the 10 - year budget he is to release Thursday , to use revenues from the centerpiece of his environmental policy  a plan under which companies must buy permits to exceed pollution emission caps  to pay for an extension of a two - year tax credit that benefits low - wage and middle - income people .
The combined effect of the two revenue - raising proposals , on top of Mr. Obama ’s existing plan to roll back the Bush - era income tax reductions on households with income exceeding $ 250,000 a year , would be a pronounced move to redistribute wealth by reimposing a larger share of the tax burden on corporations and the most affluent taxpayers .

In the Heart of the Tarantula Nebula
Credit : ESA , NASA , ESO , & Danny LaCrue
Explanation :
In the heart of monstrous Tarantula Nebula lies huge bubbles of energetic gas , long filaments of dark dust , and unusually massive stars .
In the center of this heart , is a knot of stars so dense that it was once thought to be a single star .
This star cluster , labeled as R136 or NGC 2070 , is visible just above the center of the above image and home to a great number of hot young stars .
The energetic light from these stars continually ionizes nebula gas , while their energetic particle wind blows bubbles and defines intricate filaments .
The above representative - color picture of this great LMC nebula details its tumultuous center .
The Tarantula Nebula , also known as the 30 Doradus nebula , is one of the largest star - formation regions known , and has been creating unusually strong episodes of star formation every few million years .
Hardly a week after Russia held regional parliamentary elections on March 1st , electoral monitors are bringing forth the sneakiest scandal to strike the country ’s electoral system .
As the Gazeta .ru online newspaper reports Tuesday ( Rus ) the alleged fraud involves something most commonly found in a practical joke catalog .
Just Russia , a minority political party , claims that voters were given pens filled with disappearing ink , with the result that any vote recorded would simply fade off the ballot .
Blank ballots are considered invalid under Russian law .
Nikolai Levichev , who leads the Just Russia fraction in the State Duma , said his party ’s observers noticed the faulty pens in 6 polling places in the southern city of Volgograd .
Levichev showed journalists videotape from one polling center that seemed to back his assertion .
In the video , an older pensioner fumbles near the ballot box , suddenly noticing that her ballot selection has disappeared , leaving her with a blank slip .
The pensioner turns to an incredulous election worker , who uses a pen from the ballot booth to write “ I do n’t believe you , ” on the ballot .
Several minutes later , the phrase fades from sight , much to the surprise of astonished onlookers .
A ballot count later found 285 invalid slips at the polling place , most of them blank .
A recount , conducted upon request from a local candidate from the pro-Kremlin United Russia party , was even more shocking .
Conducted on March 8th , the recount found an extra 206 votes for the United Russia party .
Levichev asserts that ballots that were initially blank now had “ writing and graphical representations made with the same handwriting . ”
In such a way , United Russia may have been trying to make a safety net and ensure that it received a certain percent of votes in the election , Levichev said .
Just Russia is not the first party to assert that disappearing ink was used in the recent elections .
The two other parties in Parliament , the Russian Communist Party ( CPRF ) and the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPR ) , expressed identical concerns .
“ Our observers recorded similar violations in tens of polling stations in the [ Volgograd ] oblast , ” said Sergei Ivanov , an LDPR deputy .
Russia ’s Central Electoral Commission ( CEC ) , which oversees elections , said that using invisible ink did not formally violate any laws , suggesting that the tactic was a sort of loophole .
As of yet , the Commission had not formally looked into the allegations .
CEC member Igor Borisov told Gazeta .ru that electoral law dictates that polling stations must contain a pen , but that the law does not define what the composition of the ink must be .
“ Although truth be told , we understand a pen to be a means of writing , whose mark does not rub off , ” he clarified .
“ That is to say , for instance , it ca n’t be a pencil . ”
Just Russia says it will consider all its options in the near future , and that it is prepared to take the matter to court .
They ’re probably hoping the case wo n’t simply disappear .
Wow .
Prohibition is OUT , Harm Reduction is in !.
OMG .
The Obama administration signalled today that it was ready to repudiate the prohibition and " war on drugs " approach of previous presidents , and steer policy towards prevention and " harm reduction " strategies favoured by Europe .
Just ... wow .
Note the reference to " previous presidents " .
Richard Nixon .
Ronald Reagan .
George Bush the 1st , Bill Clinton ( who could have done something ) and 8 years of Bush II .
Those would be the previous presidents .
David Johnson , an assistant secretary of state , said the new administration would embrace policies supporting federally funded needle exchanges .
The aim , he said , was to establish a policy based on public health needs .
" This will result in a policy that is broader and stronger than the one we had in the past , " Johnson said on the sidelines of a UN drug strategy conference in Vienna .
His words come days after the nomination of the Seattle police chief , Gil Kerlikowske , to the post of director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , the nation 's drug czar .
Kerlikowske has built a reputation in Seattle for pursuing drug policies based on harm reduction .
The state has an established needle exchange programme , has legalised marijuana for medicinal purposes and has made marijuana among the lowest priorities for law enforcement .
As I said to some people a couple weeks after Obam took control and began presidentin ' , " Our proverbial glass is now half full , no longer half empty " .
The change in attitude - even if the policies are n't as progressive as I 'd like at times - the ATTITUDE is totally different .
This huge decision is a reflection of that quantum change in viewpoints and " attitude " .
No ... nothing about " legalizing pot " , but there is the reference to Seattle and Washington State making pot arrests the last priority , instead of Job 1 .
Well , I spoke to soon !
Some of these comments came out of hearing in Washington DC last week in which the sentiments of several Latin American leaders , particularly concerned about the escalation of violence in Mexico [ 1 | 2 ] were heard :
Those hearings followed a report by the former presidents of Mexico , Colombia and Brazil , which dubbed the war on drugs a " complete failure " .
Ernesto Zedillo , César Gaviria and Henrique Cardoso , all conservative politicians , blamed the US emphasis on criminalisation for the continuing toll caused by drug trafficking , and called for an approach based on public health , including the legalisation of marijuana .
I am not holding my breath on the Obama Administration rushing out to relegalize marijuana , but I have heard some definitely wonderful things nonetheless .
Hooray for the Obama Administration !

It also had to be the priciest : $ 44.95 .
Flushed with annoyance , I forked over the money to the cable company with a click of the remote .
The show was about to start , and David was texting me from inside the MGM Grand arena to ask if I was “ in ” yet .
The price was almost a knockout blow .
Like everyone else , I have come to presume that TV — like all information — wants to be free .
Meaning , I want it to be free .
$ 44.95 is as far from free as it gets when we ’re talking media .
It ’s nearly the cost of a four - year subscription to Vogue , for heaven ’s sake , or a month of cable or three James Bond movies on Blu - Ray !
Protest was pointless , and submission was inevitable .
Once I paid my door fee , I was swept into a new world pulsing with color — a kind of red - light district with weird geniuses for tour guides who made the whole experience seem culturally crucial .
The commentators for the U.F.C. have a style of truculent harangue all their own .
Joe Rogan , in particular — the comedian , TV actor and host of “ Fear Factor ” — is so intense , relentless and silver - tongued that he made me feel as if I had wasted my life among slow - moving hayseeds and listless moralists until I lucked into the white - hot center of existence here with him .
As the preshow hype continued , I noticed an uncannily bright fighter named Frank Mir , who mixed analysis and bombast as if they were the only true martial arts .
In documentary - style interviews , he kept praising his opponent .
I could n’t believe , when I saw Mir handily win his fight , how brazen had been his pysch - out .
I was also struck by the worldliness of the fighters .
An early fight pitted Cheick Kongo ( “ fighting out of Paris , France ” ) against Mostapha Al Turk ( “ fighting out of London , England ” ) .
The Octagon is the ring for the U.F.C .
It has eight sides and is enclosed by a chain - link fence .
The name “ Octagon ” really seems like a way to keep you from calling it what it is : a cage .
In spite of this and other efforts to make Ultimate Fighting seem less thuggish — the immaculate pay - per - view display , the visibility of women in the audience and the intelligence of the spitfire commentary — you ca n’t miss the raw , back - alley character of the fights .
Veins bulge and faces go blue as fighters seem intent on choking their opponents .
Blood is shed ; bones break ; contusions develop before your eyes .
Men are felled by “ accidental ” strikes to the groin ( along with eye - gouging and biting , such strikes are prohibited , but I saw several ) .
The commentators insist that everyone ’s obeying regulations , but the fighters seem murderous nonetheless .
Until , that is , each fight is over , and the fighters are typically praised for showing “ class ” in making sure an opponent is still breathing .
One way the violence of the fights is muted is quite literal : the sound feels dialed down .
If “ Braveheart ” and other war movies have shown that the audio mix is what allows an audience to experience violence viscerally , then these U.F.C. telecasts , which do n’t amplify the sounds in the Octogon , suggest that a quiet fight comes across as a cleaner fight .
No crunch of bones , no crack of noses , no squish of damaged soft tissue .
From David ’s texts , I could tell he was “ feeling ” the fights much more than I was .
Too much has been made of John McCain ’s campaign to ban Ultimate Fighting as “ human cockfighting , ” but some of the illicit adventure of a cockfight did attend the U.F.C. telecast I saw .
I felt myself transported and included among people of high spirits , strong nerves and a clear - eyed sense of man ’s depravity .
( Joe Rogan called our violent urges “ weird , chimpanzee D.N.A. stuff . ” )
I ’m not in this company often , and it was heady .
We were seeing it all at once , all together .
David ’s texts grew more rapid .
“ I just saw Rampage ! ” he said , referring to his favorite fighter , Quinton ( Rampage ) Jackson .
Holder Says He Will Not Permit the Criminalization of Policy Differences Holder : People following orders should n't be charged .
But he leaves door open .
April 23 , 2009  --
As lawmakers call for hearings and debate brews over forming commissions to examine the Bush administration 's policies on harsh interrogation techniques , Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed to a House panel that intelligence officials who relied on legal advice from the Bush - era Justice Department would not be prosecuted .
" Those intelligence community officials who acted reasonably and in good faith and in reliance on Department of Justice opinions are not going to be prosecuted , " he told members of a House Appropriations Subcommittee , reaffirming the White House sentiment .
" It would not be fair , in my view , to bring such prosecutions . "
But Holder left open the door to some legal action , saying that though he " will not permit the criminalization of policy differences , " he is responsible as attorney general to enforce the law .
" If I see evidence of wrongdoing , I will pursue it to the full extent of the law , and I will do that in an appropriate way , " he added .
As part of the continuing fallout of the Justice Department 's release of memos from its Office of Legal Counsel last week , Holder faced questioning from a GOP lawmaker about the circumstances surrounding the documents ' release .
" I just think , in fairness to the American people , once you made a decision , once the administration made a decision to release the existing memos that you put out , then I think you have an obligation to release the rest of the memos , " Rep. Frank Wolf , R - Va. , told Holder .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney has claimed that the Obama administration released only documents that show the negative aspects of interrogations , and insisted that there are still classified documents -- which he is asking to be released -- that show the information gained from them helped keep the United States safe .
Of the existence of those documents , Holder said , " I 've heard that Vice President Cheney indicated that such memos exist .
I frankly have not seen them .
I do not know if they exist . "
Holder indicated a willingness to release more documents to give the public a better understanding of the Justice Department 's decision - making process and to inspire debate about future policies that are formed to be " consistent with our values and that can be supported by the American people .
" It is certainly the intention of this administration not to play hide - and - seek , or not to release certain things in a way that is not consistent with other things , " Holder said .
" It is not our intention to try to advance a political agenda or to hide things from the American people . "
Holder also noted that the effectiveness of enhanced interrogation techniques has been questioned by those who employed them .
" I 've also seen articles written by people who were involved in the use of these techniques who say those techniques in fact were not particularly effective , that the information could have been gotten by a more traditional means , " he said .
" So that is something , I guess , we 'll have to debate . "
However , some officials in the Obama administration have stated the opposite .
Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair admitted that he informed President Obama in a private memo that the harsh interrogation tactics conducted by the CIA did indeed yield valuable information from terror suspects .
He also added a caveat , saying in a statement : " We do not need these techniques to keep America safe .
...
The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances , but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means . "
Holder said at his confirmation hearing that he considers waterboarding torture .
Debate at Capitol Hill Continues
Today at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he backed the Obama administration releasing the Justice Department 's memos to the CIA , but that he was also concerned about a potential backlash in the Middle East .
" All of us wrestled with it , " he said , adding that there was " a certain inevitability that most of this would come out .
" There was the realization in the discussions that some of these disclosures could be used by al Qaeda and our adversaries , " Gates said while visiting a troops preparing to leave for Afghanistan .
" Pretending that we could hold all of this and keep it all a secret , even if we wanted to , I think was probably unrealistic .
So we 'll just have to deal with it .
...
There is a certain inevitability , I believe , that much of this will eventually come out .
Much has already come out . "
Former Bush official Philip Zelikow echoed the same sentiment when he was at the State Department after hearing of the memos from the Justice Department containing legal justifications for harsh interrogation techniques .
" Did folks really think Americans would never learn what we were doing in this program ?
That they'd think that it was going to stay a secret forever ? " he asked in an interview with ABC News .
" My conclusion , then , is it was inevitable that the American people were going to learn about this stuff .
And when you dig a really deep hole , you ought to think a little bit about whether you have a ladder to climb out of it . "
The Obama administration last week released previously classified Department of Justice memos that detailed how harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding -- a controversial interrogation technique that simulates drowning -- were formulated and authorized .
Republicans strongly denounced the release of the memos and any potential prosecution of officials involved in such techniques .
" I think it provides a chilling effect on our intelligence officers all 'round the world .
I think that 's unfortunate .
I do n't know how that 's going to help keep America safe , " said Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio .
However , in discussing how to deal with the information , Republicans oddly are using the same language as the White House -- that the government must look ahead rather than backward .
Obama has defended his release of the memos and said he does not want charges pursued against people who were following orders given to them by the Bush White House .
However , he indicated the decision on whether to pursue other charges rests with the Department of Justice .
He urged a bipartisan commission -- what many say might be like the 9/11 commission -- to investigate the issue .
" I do n't see a lot of value in looking back ... and this is another sideshow here in Washington , " Boehner said .
" When it comes to what our interrogation techniques are going to be or should be , I 'm not going to disclose , nor should anyone , have a conversation about what those techniques ought to be .
It 's inappropriate .
All it does is give our enemies more information about us than they need . "
Republicans such as Boehner say details of U.S. interrogation techniques and surveillance were provided to all congressional leaders and no objections were raised .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , who serves as chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , has said she was not present at the briefings where this information was presented , and that the Democrats did not know about waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , also flatly denied ever being briefed that some of the interrogation techniques debated in Congress , such as waterboarding , were used .
Before she became speaker , Pelosi was the top- ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee .
" Flat out , they never briefed us that this was happening , " Pelosi said .
" In fact , they said they would , if and when they did .
...
We were not , I repeat , we were not told that waterboarding , or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used . "
She added that House Intelligence Committee members were promised by the briefers that if and when harsh methods were ever used , Congress would be notified at that time .
Feinstein said the committee is reviewing the conditions and interrogation techniques .
The study will likely be completed in six to eight months , she said .
Pelosi hinted that there would be multiple congressional hearings on the issue and said that each case should be studied individually .
She said that a distinction had to be made between those were implementing the policy by following orders and those above them who came up with the legal opinions , as well as those who actually devised the policy .
" I , myself , do not believe that immunity should be granted to everyone in a blanket way , " she told reporters Wednesday , adding that she favors congressional hearings on the subject and the creation of a " truth commission " -- which also has been proposed by the White House and favored by Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy , D - Vt. , and several liberal Democratic senators , including Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , and Sheldon Whitehouse , D - R.I .
At the same time , Democrats are in disagreement about how to deal with the issue .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , told reporters he is against the idea of starting a truth commission .
For now , he suggested , the Senate Intelligence Committee 's investigation into the issue is adequate .
Until we get all the facts , Reid said , people should " relax . "
He added , " Justice should be served , but it should not be retribution . "
High - Level Officials Involved
Two separate Senate committees have released reports that provide a detailed narrative about the interrogation techniques and involvement of high - level officials in the Bush administration .
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence declassified a document that indicated that CIA proposed using waterboarding on terror suspect Abu Zubaydah three months before the Justice Department approved the harsh interrogation technique .
Another more - than - 200 - page document released late Tuesday by the Armed Services Committee shed new light on the authorization and implementation of harsh interrogation techniques at U.S. military prisons around the world .
" The report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration 's interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse -- such as that seen at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay , and Afghanistan -- to low - ranking soldiers , " said Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sen.
Carl Levin , D - Mich .
The report showed that senior officials knew about and authorized the interrogation tactics that are considered torture by some and are banned under the Geneva Conventions .
Question :
If you could live forever , would you and why ?
Answer : " I would not live forever , because we should not live forever , because if we were supposed to live forever , then we would live forever , but we cannot live forever , which is why I would not live forever "

The popular Germany - based file hosting service RapidShare has allegedly begun handing over user information to record labels looking to pursue illegal file - sharers .
The labels appear to be making use of paragraph 101 of German copyright law , which allows content owners to seek a court order to force ISPs to identify users behind specific IP addresses .
Though RapidShare does not make IP information public , the company appears to have given the information to at least one label , which took it to an ISP to have the user identified .
The issue came to light after a user claimed that his house was raided by law enforcement thanks to RapidShare , as reported by German - language news outlet Gulli ( hat tip ) .
This user had uploaded a copy of Metallica 's new album " Death Magnetic " to his RapidShare account a day before its worldwide release , causing Metallica 's label to work itself into a tizzy and request the user 's personal details ( if there 's anything record labels hate , it 's leaks of prerelease albums ) .
It then supposedly asked RapidShare for the user 's IP address , and then asked Deutsche Telekom to identify the user behind the IP before sending law enforcement his way .
Ars asked RapidShare for comment and confirmation of the situation , but did not receive a response as of publication time .
Gulli , on the other hand , offers a scanned copy of the court decision and also claims it was privy to a confirmation e-mail from RapidShare that it had handed over the information .
RapidShare has had a more than a few tussles in the German courts as of late .
In January of 2008 , RapidShare found itself pitted against GEMA ( the German version of the RIAA ) arguing that it was not responsible for the content that users uploaded to the site .
The D�sseldorf Regional Court did n't buy it , ruling against RapidShare , saying that the company is responsible for those files and would have to check every file for copyrighted material .
In October , the court spelled out its expectations a little more clearly , saying that RapidShare must remove infringing content proactively , despite RapidShare 's insistence that it had already hired on six staffers whose sole job was to go through uploaded material and respond to complaints about infringement .
Critics fear that that the latest series of events is evidence that the floodgates have been opened for a more " creative " interpretation of paragraph 101 .
After all , if they are able to obtain IP information , record labels may begin using it to go after users on BitTorrent and other P2P networks .
This is the same fear that fueled borderline levels of panic when rumors circulated about Last . fm handing over user data to the RIAA earlier this year , though both Last.fm and the RIAA vehemently denied the accusations .
Last.fm later said that it takes the privacy of its users very seriously and that it would never hand over personally identifiable data like e-mails or IP addresses .
There are , however , many differences between Last.fm and RapidShare .
For one , if Last.fm were to find itself in the position RapidShare is in with GEMA , it would be able to argue that the Safe Harbor provision in the DMCA protects it from liability as long as it removes infringing content after being presented with a takedown notice .
In Germany ( and many other countries ) , there is no equivalent , meaning that RapidShare has little choice but to comply with the rulings .
RapidShare 's incredible popularity — Germany - based deep packet inspection ( DPI ) provider Ipoque recently put out a report saying that RapidShare is responsible for half of all direct download traffic — has only made the issue more sensitive for the record labels and service providers alike .
Whatever the outcome , both situations highlight the precarious level of trust that users have with service providers .
If more of them cooperate with the requests of the record industry — court ordered or not — then users will start fleeing user - supported services like rats on a sinking ship .

­ Nothing has captured the imagination of humans like gold .
Egyptians considered the bright yellow metal to be divine and indestructible , a physical manifestation of the sun itself .
The Egyptian word for gold is nub , which survives in the name Nubia , an ancient region in northeast Africa that became a major supplier of the precious metal .
Aztecs used the word teocuitlatl -- " excrement of the gods " -- to describe gold .
And on the periodic table , gold is represented by the symbol Au , from the Latin aurum , which means " shining dawn . "
By any name , gold has always been associated with wealth and power .

Greed for gold fueled Spanish colonization of the Americas .
And the gold rushes of the 19th century , both in California and Australia , triggered a hunger for gold that has hardly been satiated today .
­ You might think that the constant searching , digging and panning would have yielded enough gold to line every road in Oz , but you 'd be wrong .
In all of history , only 161,000 tons ( 146,057 metric tons ) of gold have been mined [ source : National Geographic ] .
Compare that to the 5.6 million tons ( 5.1 million metric tons ) of aluminum produced by the United States -- in a single year [ source : International Aluminum Institute ] .
The rarity of gold , however , is just one reason why people value the metal .
Its unique physical and chemical properties also make it useful .
A one - ounce piece of gold can be hammered into a sheet five - millionths of an inch thick or drawn out into 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) of wire [ source : Temescu ] .
And it 's chemically inert , which means it wo n't react easily with other chemicals .
Of course , as Shakespeare once said , " All that glitters is not gold . "
The shiny wedding band on a bride 's finger has its dark underbelly .
Gold mining is bad for the environment , producing more waste per ounce than any other metal .
More troubling , it 's dangerous for the low - wage workers employed around the world to pry the metal from the Earth .
Hundreds of miners are killed each year by rockfalls and explosions .
Hundreds more are buried alive underground .
Understanding all of these issues is critical to understanding how gold works .
On the next few pages , we 'll study element number 79 on the periodic table and try to to understand the power it holds over our imaginations .
Let 's start by considering gold 's long history , a journey that will take us from the dawn of civilization to the great gold rushes of the late 19th century .

Sony Ericsson is one of the world 's largest makers of mobile phones
Mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson is to cut a further 2,000 jobs as it seeks to make 400 m euros of savings .
It comes as the firm revealed a pre-tax loss of 358 m euros ( $ 469 m ; £ 316 m ) in the first three months of this year .
" As expected , the first quarter of this year has been extremely challenging for Sony Ericsson due to continued weak global demand , " the firm said .
The job cuts come on top of 2,000 previously announced as part of another savings drive , now completed .
" The management intends to pursue an additional cost saving programme targeting a further annual operating expense reduction of 400 m euros , to be completed by mid-2010 , " said Sony Ericsson president Dick Komiyama .
Market contraction
Sony Ericsson will take a 200 m euros charge in order to shed the 2,000 jobs and implement the cost saving programme .
The firm said over the past 12 months the average selling price of its units had fallen by one euro to 120 euros .
The news comes a day after Nokia , the world 's largest mobile phone maker , reported a 90 % fall in profits for the first quarter of 2009 .
Sony Ericsson , the world 's number four mobile phone maker , said it had shipped 14.5 million phones during the first quarter , a decrease of 35 % compared with the same period last year .
Sales for the quarter were 1.7bn euros , a decrease of 36 % from a year ago .
Sales fell primarily as a result of continued weak consumer confidence , and both retailers and distributors cutting their stock .
Like Nokia the day before , Sony Ericsson also forecast that the global handset market for 2009 would contract by at least 10 % .
As soon as Derek Rodgers heard her voice , he dialed in .
He knew the host of radio program Maritime Morning was talking about the atheist bus campaign , but he did n’t know his friend Katie Kish was one of the guest speakers .
“ Hi there , Katie ? ” Rodgers said , after host Andrew Krystal put him on the air .
“ Halifax ? ” she said excitedly .
“ It ’s meeeeee , ” replied Rodgers , sending his deep warm voice over the Halifax airwaves .
“ Is this a private chat here ? ” asked Krystal gruffly , annoyed at the unexpected interaction .
“ What the hell ’s going on ? ”
Rodgers and Kish met at a conference last summer put on by the New York - based Centre for Inquiry ( CFI ) — an organization for free - thought activism .
Kish is part of the Toronto - based Freethought Association of Canada , a group that organized the campaign to put atheist ads in Toronto subways .
Rodgers — a Halifax - native and first - year Dalhousie student — is part of the Dal Atheist Community .
Both were on air to discuss ads that read , “ There ’s probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . ”
Rodgers is an advocate of free speech and thought .
When I first met Rodgers he was boldly declaring that as a gay man , he did n’t think hate speech should be censored .
“ As much as I like you as a person , I think you ’re a censor , ” he stood up and told a human rights lawyer who was arguing in favour of human rights commissions .
He thinks no progressive cause , including the gay rights movement , could have happened without offending people .
He started a free thought group when he was 15 , and he received an email last June from the director of CFI Canada , acknowledging his group as the only one of its kind in a Canadian high school .
CFI invited Rodgers to a conference in Buffalo , and he has just been invited to be a group leader at CFI ’s 2009 World Congress in Washington .
Two things struck me about Rodgers when he spoke at the debate : he is young and eloquent .
The human rights lawyer must have agreed .
“ Have you every considered going into law ? ” she asked him , when he finished his comment .
“ A lot of people have said that to me , ” said Rodgers , flashing a wide , dimply smile .
“ In good ways and bad . ”
As I sit with the 18 - year - old at a Halifax coffee shop , I ask if he has always been able to express himself so easily .
“ Public speaking ’s one of the hardest things to get over , ” says the shaggy - haired wide - eyed boy .
“ But I force myself when I have a justified opinion . ”
Given the current hype surrounding the atheist ad campaigns , Rodgers has another reason to speak out .
He has been working to bring the atheist transit ads to Halifax , after the Freethought Association of Canada raised thousands in support of the Toronto atheist ads .
But there might be a few hurdles ahead .
On Feb 2 , Halifax Metro Transit rejected an atheism ad on the grounds that it was “ too controversial . ”
The ad read “ You can be good without God . ” Metro Transit spokesperson Lori Patterson told the CBC , “ If anytime we feel there ’s a message that could be controversial and upsetting to people , we do n’t necessarily sell the ads . ”
Supporters of the ad are vowing to fight the decision — they ’ve organized on Facebook and at Atheistbus.ca .
Rogers ’ support of evolution comes from his love of science .
He ’s read hard science since he was young , and when he reached high school , he started reading philosophical texts .
After reading philosopher Carl Sagan ’s Demon Haunted World — a text that uses science to critically examine theories about the universe — he started reading science blogs and watching online debates about science and religion .
When a youth pastor started an inter-school Christian fellowship that met at Rodgers ’ high school once a week , he started going out of curiosity .
The pastor found out he was an atheist and wanted to debate the origins of the universe .
Using William Paley ’s argument of the watchmaker , the pastor said if the complexity of a watch requires an intelligent designer , the complexity of the earth requires the same .
Rodgers called this an argument an “ argument from ignorance ” — just because the pastor did not understand how complex forms developed through natural selection , he assumes they did not .
Round and round they would go , neither budging on their positions .
Rodgers says he is not trying to reform anyone .
He is an atheist because to him , the world is scientific , but most importantly , he is a free - thinker who believes in being critical .
“ Free thought puts the emphasis on not holding dogmatic beliefs , ” he says .
“ And exercising doubt about those beliefs , especially those advocated by authority figures . ”
He says a lot of atheists get a bad rep for holding negative viewpoints , but he says they merely prefer using human reason over spirituality to explain life .
Rodgers sees the atheism ad campaign as a discussion of belief — rather than a promotion of atheism , and a way of reaching out to similar thinkers .
“ There ’s a huge silent minority of atheists and agnostics who are tired of the stigmas attached to non-belief , ” he says to Krystal and Halifax radio listeners .
“ What will come of this is public debate and outreach , and I ca n’t see that being a bad thing . ”
Michael Abrash is a programmer at Rad Game Tools and the author of numerous books and articles on graphics programming and performance optimization .
One more grain of sand dropped on top of a pile of sand will usually do nothing more than make the pile a tiny bit larger .
Occasionally , though , it will set off an avalanche that radically reshapes the landscape .
Observations such as this form the basis of complexity theory , which holds that small events can have unpredictable , and sometimes disproportionately large , effects -- the relevance of which will become apparent momentarily .
Nearly five years ago Mike Sartain and I had just put the wraps on our x86 software renderer , Pixomatic .
We had done everything we could think of to speed it up , and while it had certainly gotten a lot faster , it was still so much slower than hardware that we knew we could never close the gap .
As we were setting up in the RAD Game Tools booth at Game Developers Conference one morning , I said to Mike : " Man , if only Intel had a lerp [ linear interpolation ] instruction ! "
Mike pointed across the aisle at the Intel booth .
" Maybe you should ask for one . "
The odds seemed long , to say the least , but I did n't have any better ideas , so I went over and talked with Dean Macri , our developer rep .
That resulted in a couple of maverick Intel architects , Doug Carmean and Eric Sprangle , coming over to chat with us later ; and somehow , over the course of five years , that simple question led to a team at RAD -- which grew to include Tom Forsyth and Atman Binstock -- working with Intel to help design an instruction set extension and write a software graphics pipeline for it .
Which brings us to the present day , when at long last I get to tell you about a fascinating , and very different , extension to the x86 instruction set called Larrabee New Instructions ( LRBni ) -- and if that 's not a perfect example of complexity theory in action , I do n't know what is .
The funny thing is , I never did get that lerp instruction !
Why Larrabee ?
To understand what Larrabee is , it helps to understand why Larrabee is .
Intel has been making single cores faster for decades by increasing the clock speed , increasing cache size , and using the extra transistors each new process generation provides to boost the work done during each clock .
That process certainly has n't stopped , and will continue to be an essential feature of main system processors for the foreseeable future , but it 's getting harder .
This is partly because most of the low - hanging fruit has already been picked , and partly because processors are starting to run up against power budgets , and both out - of - order instruction execution and higher clock frequency are power - intensive .
More recently , Intel has also been applying additional transistors in a different way -- by adding more cores .
This approach has the great advantage that , given software that can parallelize across many such cores , performance can scale nearly linearly as more and more cores get packed onto chips in the future .
Larrabee takes this approach to its logical conclusion , with lots of power - efficient in - order cores clocked at the power / performance sweet spot .
Furthermore , these cores are optimized for running not single - threaded scalar code , but rather multiple threads of streaming vector code , with both the threads and the vector units further extending the benefits of parallelization .
All this enables Larrabee to get as much work out of each watt and each square millimeter as possible , and to scale well far into the future .
What Is Larrabee ?
A Quick Overview
Larrabee is an architecture , rather than a product , with three distinct aspects -- many cores , many threads , and a new vector instruction set -- that boost performance .
This architecture will first be used in GPUs , and could be used in CPUs as well .
At the highest level , the architecture consists of many in - order cores , each with its own L1 and L2 cache , all sitting on a coherent interconnect bus -- which you can think of as a ring , although in fact the topology is considerably more complicated than that -- as in Figure 1 .
The cores are x86 cores enhanced with vector capability , and the memory system is fully coherent .
In short , Larrabee is an enhanced x86 architecture ; it supports all the familiar general - purpose programming techniques and tools used on CPUs for decades , and is much like programming a lot of Core i7 cores at once .
Because initial configurations are designed for use as GPUs , they lack chipset features needed to serve as a main CPU running , say , Windows ; nonetheless , they are fully capable of running operating systems and general applications .
For example , Larrabee , running as a GPU device under Windows , can bring up a BSD OS , with the Larrabee graphics pipeline running as just another BSD application .
Furthermore , each of those Larrabee cores supports multiple hardware threads per core ( currently four , although that may change in the future ) .
This is an important part of getting good performance out of the in - order cores ; if one thread misses the cache , the other threads can keep the core busy .
Threading also helps work around pipeline latency .
In effect , threaded in - order cores shift the burden of extracting parallelization and working around pipeline bubbles from instruction reordering hardware to the programmer and the compiler .
Without a doubt , that makes life more challenging for programmers , but the rewards are potentially large , thanks to the out - of - order hardware and associated power that can be saved .
Besides , if a program can be successfully parallelized across all those Larrabee cores , it should n't in principle be any more difficult to parallelize it across the threads as well .
However , while this is true to a considerable extent , in actual practice issues arise because there is only one set of most core resources -- most notably caches and TLBs -- so the more threads there are performing independent tasks on a core , the more performance can suffer due to cache and TLB pressure .
The graphics pipeline code on Larrabee works around this by having all the threads on each core work on the same task , using mostly shared data and code ; in general , this is a fertile area for future software architecture research .
So Larrabee has lots of cores , each with multiple threads , allowing software to readily take advantage of thread - level parallelism .
That 's obviously critical to getting a big performance boost -- lots of cores running at high utilization are going to be much faster than even the fastest single core -- and multithreaded programming is an essential , fascinating , and challenging aspect of Larrabee .
However , it 's also a relatively familiar challenge from existing multicore systems , albeit taken to a new level with Larrabee , so I 'm going to leave further discussion of multicore / multithreaded Larrabee programming for another day .
What I 'm going to delve into for the rest of this article is the third aspect of Larrabee performance -- the 16 - wide vector unit , and LRBni , the instruction set extension that supports it .
Together , these are designed to let software extract maximum performance from data - level parallelism -- that is , vector processing .
This is all somewhat abstract , so to make things a little more concrete , let me mention something I know for sure LRBni can do , because I 've done it : software rendering with GPU - class efficiency , without any fixed - function hardware other than a texture sampler .
It should be clear upon a little reflection that with a 16 - wide vector unit , you can run a pixel shader on 16 pixels at a time , with the nth element of each vector instruction operating on the nth pixel of a 16 - pixel block ; Kayvon Fatahalian 's presentation From Shader Code to a Teraflop : How Shader Cores
Work discusses how this works in some detail .
Somewhat less obvious is that it is possible to use LRBni to implement an efficient software rasterizer , using vector instructions to determine a triangle 's pixel coverage for 16 pixels at a time .
Unfortunately , those topics are far too complex to discuss here .
However , LRBni - based implementations of both rasterization and shaders will be discussed in detail in future articles .

St. Patrick ’s Day is just a week away .
Let ’s celebrate with some real green beer !
Americans age 21 and older go through about 5 pints of beer per week .
That adds up to over 30 gallons of beer per year !
We spend $ 4 billion dollars on beer just on St. Patrick ’s Day alone .
That is a lot of beer !
Imagine the difference it would make if we stuck to brews from these folks , who are doing their best to produce a low - impact , tasty pint ?
I could n’t resist starting this list with my favorite beer : Sierra Nevada .
Not only do they make an amazing IPA , they ’ve got a solar setup that covers most of the power used to make their tasty brew !
They ’ve also teamed up with E - Fuel Corp to produce ethanol from the yeast slurry that ’s a byproduct of beer production .
Great Lakes Brewing Company has almost too many projects to list here !
They recycle all of their cardboard , glass , plastic , steel / aluminum , paper and brewer ’s barley .
They ’re using a vermicomposting setup to produce fertilizer for the food served at the brewery ’s restaurant .
To read their laundry list of initiatives , check out their website !
Brooklyn Brewery has been powering their bottling plant with 100 % wind power since 2003 .
New Belgium works hard at producing a sustainable bottle of beer .
Kudos for the honesty and transparency of their sustainability report , too !
Full Sail brewery in Oregon just won the Governor ’s Sustainability Award for its green initiatives .
They constructed their brewery from recycled materials and have reduced the water they use to produce a gallon of beer by half !
I think it ’s interesting that my hunt for Earth - friendly beers turned up just as many “ conventional ” beers as it did organic ones .
The folks at Sierra Nevada , Great Lakes Brewing , Brooklyn Brewery , New Belgium , and Full Sail are n’t just saving resources – they ’re saving money .
Especially during tough economic times , I feel like that ’s the key to getting folks on board with making changes to lower their carbon footprints .
Maybe some other industries could learn from these outstanding breweries !

Chinese authorities are trying to stop protests by Tibetans A Tibetan monk has been shot after setting fire to himself during a protest at Beijing 's rule , reports say .
The incident happened in the Tibetan - populated town of Aba in southwest China 's Sichuan province during a gathering of more than 1,000 monks .
The monk , named Tapey , is said to have shouted slogans and waved a Tibetan flag , then used petrol to start a fire .
Campaign groups said witnesses then saw Chinese police shoot the man .
Banned meeting
The monk collapsed and was taken away by the police .
China 's official Xinhua news agency confirmed a man had set himself on fire , saying he was taken to a hospital and treated for burns injuries .
It made no mention of any gunshot wounds .
The protest began after more than 1,000 Tibetan Buddhist monks gathered at a temple in the town to celebrate the third day of the Tibetan new year .
Chinese officials had earlier banned the gathering .
After the incident , news agencies reported a heavy police presence on the streets of the town .
" There are many policemen on patrol in the street and all of them have guns , " an employee at a teahouse in Aba told the AFP news agency .
It is extremely difficult to independently confirm any information coming out of Tibetan areas .
China 's authorities have restricted access to the region .
Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the escape into exile of the Dalai Lama and China wants to make sure there are no Tibetan protests in support of the exiled spiritual leader like those of a year ago , says the BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing .
More than 200 Tibetans are thought to have been killed in a Chinese crackdown in the region , which it has ruled since an invasion in 1950 .
China claims
Tibet is part of its historic territory , but Tibetan groups in exile regard the invasion as a tragedy .

ARGENTINA -SOY PRODUCTION AND CHEMICAL USE .
Glyphosate , the herbicide used on soybeans in Argentina , causes malformations in amphibian embryos , say scientists here who revealed the findings of a study that has not yet been published .
" The observed deformations are consistent and systematic , " Professor Andrés Carrasco , director of the Laboratory of Molecular Embryology at the University of Buenos Aires medical school and lead researcher on the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research ( CONICET ) , told IPS .
Reduced head size , genetic alterations in the central nervous system , an increase in the death of cells that help form the skull , and deformed cartilage were effects that were repeatedly found in the laboratory experiments , said the biologist .
The news was reported Monday by the Argentine newspaper Página 12 .
The scientist explained to IPS that the conclusions were from " a research study that came up with precise data , " but that the final report was not yet ready for publication .
Nevertheless , he believed it was necessary to make the results public due to " a question of general interest . "
Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup , an herbicide produced by US biotech giant Monsanto , which developed Roundup Ready Soy , genetically modified to withstand high doses of the non-selective weed - killer .
Monsanto ’s head of communications in Argentina , Fernanda Pérez Cometto , told IPS that the company has " several studies that show that the herbicide is harmless to humans , animals and the environment . "
But the company " will not issue an opinion " until the University of Buenos Aires study is published , she said .
" It is essential to know what kind of methodology was used , which is why we have asked the laboratory for a copy of the study , " said Pérez Cometto .
She insisted , however , that Monsanto ’s herbicide was tested in 1996 by authorities in Argentina , who reported that it was unlikely to pose an " acute risk . "
" Obviously it is a substance that must be used correctly , with the safeguards listed on the label , just like insect repellent or bleach .
You ca n’t drink a glass of herbicide and expect it to have no effect , " she added .
Carrasco explained that in the first phase of the experiment , amphibian embryos were submerged in a solution of herbicide diluted in water in a proportion that was 1,500 times weaker than that used today on genetically modified soybeans in Argentina — the country ’s main crop .
The embryos suffered head deformations .
In the second stage , embryonic cells were injected with glyphosate diluted with water , without the additives that go into the commercial product .
The impact was even more negative , showing that the active ingredient accounts for the toxicity , rather than the additives , the biologist said .
" One should be able to suppose , with certainty , that the same thing that happens to amphibian embryos can happen to humans , " said Carrasco , whose team of specialists in biology , biochemistry and genetics has been working on the study for 15 months .
" It is clear that glyphosate is not innocuous and that it does not degrade or break down , but accumulates in cells , " he said .
A potent mix of glyphosate sprayed from airplanes is one of the tools used by the Colombian government to eradicate illegal coca crops .
But the destructive effects of the spraying on crops , livestock and people in areas across the border in Ecuador have prompted complaints by the Ecuadorean government .
Some 200 million litres a year of glyphosate are used in Argentina .
Soybeans cover around 50 percent of all farmland — nearly 17 million hectares — and are the country ’s main export product .
The herbicide is mainly applied by aerial spraying .
Agronomist Jorge Gilbert with the National Institute of Agricultural Technology ( INTA ) told IPS that glyphosate , like other chemicals used to combat weeds or pests , " is not good or bad in and of itself , but depends on how it is applied . "
INTA , a government agency that provides technical advice to farmers , has never taken a critical position towards genetically engineered soy .
To the contrary , many of its professionals believe the introduction of herbicide - resistant seeds represented an advance in rural development .
But environmental and social organisations have been complaining for at least five years that populated areas near fields of genetically modified soybeans have suffered a sharp increase in the number of cases of cancer , birth defects , lupus , kidney disease , and respiratory and skin ailments .
The Grupo de Reflexión Rural ( GRR � Rural Reflection Group ) , a local NGO that launched a " Stop the Spraying ! " campaign in 2006 in the provinces where soybeans are most extensively planted , published a report this year based on the accounts of rural doctors , experts and the residents of dozens of farming towns .
GRR lawyer Osvaldo Fornari told IPS that the federal courts were presented with the report and asked to investigate the approval process for herbicides and pesticides .
He also said that based on the cases of people whose health has allegedly been affected , the " precautionary principle " should be applied , and the use of Roundup should be preventively banned .
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ordered the creation of a committee made up of staff from the Health Ministry , the Secretariats of the Environment and Agriculture , and INTA , to investigate the health and environmental impacts of glyphosate .
We should realize that we gain far less info in an echo chamber than from being around folks with diverse views .
The latest Journal of Experimental Psychology says we just do n't get this :
The experimental task involved estimating the number of calories in measured quantities of different foods ( e.g. , a cup of yogurt , a bowl of cooked rice ) .
…
Participants were asked to generate a calorie estimate for each food and then indicate their confidence in it . … [ Then ] they were provided with the opinions of three advisors , and were given the opportunity to revise their initial estimates .
They were told that they would receive a bonus for making accurate judgments , … [ and ] were also asked to indicate their confidence in their final ( revised ) estimates and to bet on their accuracy . …
On half the trials ( independent condition ) the [ screen ] header stated that “ these estimates were randomly drawn from a pool of 100 estimates made by participants in a previous study , ” whereas on the remaining trials ( opinion - dependent condition ) the header stated that “ these estimates were selected from those closest to your own initial opinion in a pool of 100 estimates made by participants in a previous study . ” …
Receiving advice increased participants ’ confidence in the dependent condition , but not in the independent condition .
Participants indicated greater confidence in their final estimates in the opinion - dependent than in the independent condition .
In accord with the confidence results , the participants bet more often in the dependent ( 58 % ) than in the independent condition ( 42 % ) .
Mr Brewer moved state and adopted an assumed name after the killing
A US man who thought he was dying and confessed to having killed a neighbour in 1977 has been charged with murder after making a recovery , US media say .
James Brewer could now face the death penalty over the unsolved killing in Tennessee 32 years ago , reports say .
Convinced he was dying after a stroke , Mr Brewer reportedly admitted to police he shot dead 20 - year - old Jimmy Carroll .
The 58 - year - old , who had fled Tennessee after the killing , was arrested after his condition improved , reports say .
" He wanted to cleanse his soul , because he thought he was going to the great beyond , " said police detective Tony Grasso , who interviewed Mr Brewer in an Oklahoma hospital , The Oklahoman website reported .
Mr Brewer had reportedly moved to Oklahoma from Tennessee after jumping bail after he was originally arrested and charged with Mr Carroll 's murder in 1977 .
The former factory worker changed his name to Michael Anderson and settled down with his wife , Dorothy , in the town of Shawnee .
The couple became active members of the local church , where Mrs Brewer established a Bible study group , reports say .
After suffering a stroke , Mr Brewer called police to his hospital bedside earlier this month , where he reportedly made the confession .
Detectives said Mr Brewer had admitted killing Mr Carroll , who he believed had been trying to seduce his wife .
However , Mr Brewer survived the illness and surrendered to authorities in his former home town of Hohenwald , Tennessee , after they were notified by the Oklahoma police .

Ahhh - you thought psychics only delved into the future .
Not at all - we Foodies also take a long look at the past to see if we are , indeed , going Back to the Future .... I 've been boning up ( ha ) on what sort of meals and economical recipes were available during the first Great Depression , in the 1930s , to see any adaptable for today and even tomorrow 's health and frugally - conscious cooks .
This one certainly is !
I found it in The Wilken Family cookbook , circa 1935 .
It is simple to make , economical and rich - tasting !
( how 's that for irony ? )
Poor Man's Pudding
You will need : one egg , small amounts of sugar , molasses , flour .
Small amounts of cinnamon , soda , water , salt and shortening .
A half - cup or so , raisins .
A mixing bowl , of course a nice Depression glass or McCoy bowl would be grand , and a greased pudding mold ( or china or pottery deep dish ) .
Directions :
Beat the egg , add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 cup molasses .
Meanwhile , sift together 1 1/2 cups flour , a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon .
Add these ingredients to the molasses mixture .
Add 1 teaspoon of soda , dissolved in 1/3 cup of hot water and beat into the mixture thoroughly .
Add 2 tablespoons melted shortening ( your choice of liquid or melt butter or Crisco ) .
Then add 1 /2 up raisins , lightly dusted in a sprinkle of flour .
Pour into the greased pudding mold 3 / 4 full , cover tightly , and steam 1 1/4 hours .
Serve : Hot .
The Wilkens , who owned a whiskey distillery , suggested adding a whiskey sauce ( we tried a small whisper of cognac ) , but you can also garnish with delicious fresh fruit ( we used strawberries ) and / or a scoop of vanilla ice cream or dream whip .
This Pudding tastes more like gingerbread than what we think of as pudding ; its consistency is more like bread pudding , and the color is molasses brown .
It tastes fresh , rich and healthy .
Plus , it contains no milk - perfect for lactose intolerant .
Food Note# 1 : We placed the mold on a vegetable steamer in a large , deep soup pot , which we then covered .
Food Note # 2 : Since we 're talking Depression , it 's fun to use vintage 1930s utensils ( Bakelite ) , pottery , Depression glass .
I have some charming green Depression glass sherbet glasses , perfect for serving this pudding a la mode .
Part of the enjoyment of any dish is how you serve it , is n't it ?
Food Note # 3 : I have a sizable vintage cookbook collection , but very few of the older cookbooks ( even those published in the 1930s ) mention the Depression or offer economical recipes , like we find today on the internet and on Factoidz .
Of course , there we many people who were doing well , or even okay , during the 1930s ; perhaps their worst calamity was having to let a maid go .
So , most cookbooks were directed to the woman who was more used to dining out than in .
She might have had little expertise in preparing the food herself .
The popular magazines chose to ignore The Great Depression ( in part , because their readers were those who could afford to buy a magazine ) .
Some home - style restaurants that managed to stay in business did publish cookbooks that contained recipes for " inexpensive , every - day meals . "
But the word " Depression " was never mentioned .
Please watch this space for more vintage frugal food ideas .

Satoru Iwata unveiled some new features for the Wii Global sales of Nintendo 's Wii console have passed 50 million , the company 's boss Satoru Iwata has said .
The Wii is now the fastest - selling games console in history , surpassing the PlayStation 2 .
Mr Iwata also said that Nintendo's handheld DS console had shipped 100 m units around the world .
" Almost no one expected them to reach the current level of mainstream acceptance .
It 's even beyond what we possibly hoped for , " Mr Iwata said .
" The market has expanded as video games have been accepted by more consumers than ever before , " the Nintendo president , told the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco .
" It 's a cliche but it 's not just the 18 - year - old kid , it 's the mom on the train , it 's the high - school girl after she 's done with her homework , everyone plays games .
" ' Outside the box ' " The Wii and DS have made games more accessible , " Tameka Kee of PaidContent.org told BBC News Jay Lauffer from Blizzard Entertainment was impressed by the figures and put it down to Nintendo 's approach .
" I imagine its successful because Nintendo seems to be shifting what is kind of a traditional sit - down environment to getting people up and moving . "
Iwata said he wanted Wii products to provide increased enthusiasm Remy Lavoie , a programmer with DTI Software said : " If Nintendo has such a big share of the market it 's pretty impressive .
" They are thinking outside the box and its clearly paying off . "
To create some excitement among developers , Mr Iwata unveiled some upgrades for the Wii which included a much - hoped - for new storage system .
It lets users store and launch WiiWare and virtual console games from high capacity SD cards .
It is available for download now .
" Your games will no longer be competing on space for system memory , " said Nintendo 's Bill Trinen during a demonstration .
New titles Rock ' N ' Roll Climber , a new mountain - climbing game that uses the Wii Fit's Balance Board was also demonstrated to the audience .
The player 's character rocks out on a guitar when he reaches the top .
To date sales of the board have hit 14 million units with pre-orders on Amazon for the new DSi ahead of its launch next month reaching record levels said Mr Iwata .
Some new titles were announced for the Virtual Console including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a Darklord and Final Fantasy IV : The After Years for later in 2009 .
Another addition is the Virtual Console Arcade which is available today with classic games like Space Harrier , Gaplus , Star Force , Solvalou , The Tower of Druaga , and Mappy .
Nintendo's GameCube came a distant third in the console rankings
For the DS , clips of a new upcoming Legends of Zelda : Spirit Tracks were greeted with applause .
But none of it convinced Robert Sindt , an associate professor at Johnson Community College in Missouri , that the Wii or the DS is the developers ' dream .
" I think they are great platforms but I guess I am a tad sceptical what will become of it .
I 'm not sure developers will embrace it .
Sony is pretty impressive and a better platform . "
Software sells hardware While Mr Iwata highlighted the success of the Wii and DS , he noted Nintendo did not achieve this on its own and thanked partners , press and consumers for their support .
He said that the major reason that the company is where it is is because " one rule always remains the same : Software sells hardware " .
For developers who remain unsure about developing for either device , Mr Iwata said more third - party games were sold on these platforms last year than on any other platform .
Throughout his speech he continued to dazzle the audience with statistics and stressed that in the US , some 20 % of owners had never owned a console before buying the Wii .
He also noted that 47 % of DS sales were made by women .
While Mr Iwata ended by acknowledging hard economic times , he also stressed that they tend to lead to real innovation .
" The great depression in the 1930s resulted in the jet engine , TV and chocolate chip cookies .
" As developers I believe anything is possible .
The future of video games is in your hands and I can't wait for you to show us your surprises , " Mr Iwata concluded .

Rove says he wo n’t , his lawyer says he will comply with congressional subpoenas
Profoundly disabled students were forced into “ fight club ” style battles by the employees hired to care for them in at a school in Corpus Christi , Texas .
How did authorities find out ?
the same employees recorded the fights .
The video was only discovered when one lost his phone , and it was handed to an off - duty policeman .
The footage shows staff goading young , male school residents into physical altercations , then shoving them at each other until fights ensued according to local reports .
The videos go back as far as 2007 , with the most recent “ event ” taken last month .
Eleven current or former state school employees were identified in the videos , state officials said .
The local school board said that it would introduce supervisors for the disabled children overnight ; despite in - residence schooling ( the students live on school grounds ) , there was no supervision between 10 pm and 6 am , when the fights took place .
Of course , even if they did have supervision , the supervisors were among those believed to be betting on the fights .

But on SBS '
Insight program last night , Senator Conroy said " it 's mandatory refused classification , and then parents - if the trial says that it is possible to go down this path ... have the option to block other material " .
This about - turn has done little to assuage the concerns of online rights groups , the Federal Opposition and the internet industry , as the RC category includes not just child pornography but anti-abortion sites , fetish sites and sites containing pro-euthanasia material such as The Peaceful Pill Handbook by Dr Philip Nitschke .
Sites added to the blacklist in error were also classified as RC , such as one containing PG - rated photographs by Bill Henson .
And the websites of several Australian businesses - such as those of a Queensland dentist - were classified RC and blacklisted after they were hacked by , as Senator Conroy described , " the Russian mob " .
They were on the blacklist even though they changed hosting providers and cleaned up their sites several years ago .
" The guidelines are so broad that RC can't help but hoover up political speech even if only as collateral damage , " said Internode network engineer Mark Newton , describing Senator Conroy 's comments last night as " the great walkback of 2009 " .
Senator Conroy conceded many of the decisions regarding what sites appeared on the blacklist were made by " faceless bureaucrats " .
He said he was working to build in " further safeguards " , but would not abolish the policy because some sites were found to be put on the blacklist in error .
" I do n't think Senator Conroy really even knows what his own policy in relation to filtering is .
It seems to change on an almost daily basis ; it is vague and contradictory and there is little public confidence in his ability to implement it , " said Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin .
" RC can apply to a range of different subjects , not just sexually explicit , but also the controversial , which under Labor 's proposal would all be filtered . "
Colin Jacobs , spokesman for the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , said he was pleased the Government was " distancing themselves from the current flawed blacklist , which as we have seen is chock full of legal and harmless sites " .
But Jacobs was not convinced that a new " RC only " list would be a big improvement .
" Swapping one secret list for another does n't mean that fewer mistakes will occur or that everything on the new list will be uncontroversial , " he said .
" Not all RC material is illegal , so we 'd probably still see euthanasia sites and the like on the list . "
Others sites confirmed by ACMA as being included on the blacklist include a YouTube clip showing an excerpt from a horror movie and an astrology website .
ACMA said the horror movie clip was added because it is classified as R18 + but " not subject to a restricted access system that prevents access by children " .
" At the time of investigation , access to the YouTube content required only a declaration of an age of 18 years or older which was not verified by evidence of proof of age , " ACMA spokesman Donald Robertson said .
On the astrology website , ACMA said it was blacklisted because , at the time it was being investigated , it had been defaced with " an image which depicted an adult female posed naked and implicitly defecating on herself " .
This image has since been removed and ACMA said it was in the process of removing the astrology site from the blacklist .
ACMA conceded innocent sites could be blacklisted if they are defaced with content not usually associated with the site .
Robertson acknowledged this material was often only visible for a short period before being removed by the site owner .
" To deal with the transient nature of online content , ACMA undertakes regular reviews of the list of URLs notified to filter makers to remove those which no longer lead to prohibited content , " he said .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has test - fired a new air - to - surface missile , Iranian media reported on Sunday , in the Islamic Republic ’s latest display of its military capability .
The missile test was carried out despite the offer by the administration of new U.S. President Barack Obama to engage Iran in direct talks if it “ unclenches its fist ” .
Iran ’s Fars News Agency said the domestically produced missile had a range of 110 km and was designed for use by military aircraft against naval targets .
“ Now these jet fighters have acquired a new capability in confronting threats , ” the semi-official news agency said .
Iran ’s Press TV initially said a long - range missile had been tested , but later also used Fars ’ way of describing it .
Iran often stages war games or tests weapons to show its determination to counter any attack by foes such as Israel and the United States .
Israel and Washington accuse Tehran of trying to develop nuclear bombs .
Iran says its nuclear programme is a peaceful drive to generate electricity so that the world ’s fourth - largest oil producer can export more of its gas and crude .
Israel , believed to be the only nuclear - armed Middle East state , has said Iran ’s nuclear plans threaten its existence and has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to end the dispute .
Iran has said it would respond to any attack by targeting U.S. interests and Israel , as well as closing the Strait of Hormuz , a waterway between the Gulf and the Sea of Oman through which about 40 percent of the world ’s traded oil is shipped .
One Western defence analyst said he believed the missile test was a signal by Iran that “ we can severely disrupt traffic ” in the Gulf if attacked .
“ That ’s what would be the frightening thing for the West and the Middle East , ” Andrew Brookes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies think - tank in London said by phone .
The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the Iranian press reports .
Military experts say Iranian missiles often draw on technology from China , North Korea or other countries .
“ They ’ve taken Chinese missile technology and converted and developed it to take out ships , ” said Brookes .
“ It is not a new development , it has been going on for some years . ”
The air - to - surface missile ’s range of 110 km would be far less than that of the surface - to - surface Shahab missile , which Iranian officials say can travel about 2,000 km , enabling it to reach Israel and U.S. bases in the Gulf .
A top Iranian military commander last week said that Iranian missiles could now reach Israeli nuclear sites .
Iran has often said it has missiles able to reach the Jewish state but had not previously mentioned such specific targets .
Feb. 22 , 2009  --
Call it a modern - day tale of two cities .
For decades , Las Vegas , ripe with new construction and economic development , burgeoned into a shimmering urban carnival .
Detroit , once the fulcrum of American industry , sagged and rusted under its own weight .
These days , it 's the worst of times for both .
Las Vegas edged Detroit for the title of America 's most abandoned city .
Atlanta came in third , followed by Greensboro , N.C. , and Dayton , Ohio .
Our rankings , a combination of rental and homeowner vacancy rates for the 75 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , are based on fourth - quarter data released Feb. 3 by the Census Bureau .
Each was ranked on rental vacancies and housing vacancies ; the final ranking is an average of the two .
Click here to learn more about America 's emptiest cities at our partner site , Forbes.com .
Cities like Detroit and Dayton are casualties of America 's lengthy industrial decline .
Others , like Las Vegas and Orlando , are mostly victims of the recent housing bust .
Boston and New York are among the lone bright spots , while Honolulu is the nation 's best with a vacancy rate of 5.8 percent for homes and a scant 0.5 percent for rentals .
Still , empty neighborhoods are becoming an increasingly daunting problem across the country .
The national rental vacancy rate now stands at 10.1 percent , up from 9.6 percent a year ago ; homeowner vacancy has edged up from 2.8 percent to 2.9 percent .
Richmond , Va. 's rental vacancy rate of 23.7 percent is the worst in America , while Orlando's 7.4 percent rate is lousiest on the homeowner side .
Detroit and Las Vegas are among the worst offenders by both measures -- the Motor City sports vacancy rates of 19.9 percent for rentals and 4 percent for homes ; Sin City has rates of 16 percent and 4.7 percent , respectively .
" It 's a mess , " says Vegas developer Laurence Hallier .
" Right now , things are just frozen .
Everybody 's scared . "
Hallier , 40 , knows from experience .
His $ 600 million Panorama Towers complex was a tremendous success at its inception three years ago .
The first of his four planned residential skyscrapers sold out in six months ; the second , which opened in 2007 , sold out in 12 weeks .
As the third tower neared completion last fall , Hallier had sold 92 percent of its units .
Then the recession hit , and only half the units ended up closing .
Hallier says it will take years to break even , and plans for the fourth tower have been delayed indefinitely .
There are others who 've made -- and lost -- far worse gambles on Vegas property .
In 2007 , Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva and partner Nochi Dankner paid $ 1.25 billion to buy a 34.5 - acre site on the Strip , with plans to build an $ 8 billion mega- casino modeled after New York 's Plaza Hotel .
By November , the value of the lot had plummeted to $ 650 million -- half what they paid for it .
Groundbreaking on the casino has been pushed back to 2010 , and today , the land may be worth less than the $ 625 million Tshuva and Dankner borrowed to buy it .
The Plaza debacle is emblematic of the problems afflicting millions of property owners in Vegas and around the country -- and can explain , in large part , the origins of America 's housing crisis .
As real estate prices skyrocketed during the boom , consumers took out massive loans to buy homes , assuming values would continue to rise .
Instead they took a nosedive , especially in places like Las Vegas , Florida and Phoenix , where the housing boom had created excess inventory and so - called " bad loans " were rampant .
Many homeowners suddenly found themselves with properties worth far less than the mortgages they 'd taken out .
In the worst cases , banks foreclosed , leaving people without homes -- and with more debt than they 'd had to begin with .
The situation in places like Las Vegas is bad enough , but Detroit 's problems run much deeper .
Though its vacancy rates are marginally better than Sin City's , Motown has been on the empty side for decades .
An industrial boomtown during the first half of the 20th century , Detroit 's population swelled from 285,000 in 1900 to 990,000 in 1920 , reaching a peak of 1.8 million in 1950 .
But starting in the 1960s , Detroit began a precipitous decline .
Detroit 's population is now 900,000 -- half what it was in the middle of the century -- and many of its neighborhoods languish in varying states of decay .
Most scholars blame rapid suburbanization , outsourcing of manufacturing jobs , and federal programs they say exacerbated the situation by creating a culture of joblessness and dependency .
Yet after more than half a century , countless scholars , politicians , community organizers developers and nonprofit workers have been unable to come up with a solution to fix Detroit .
Will Las Vegas eventually suffer the same fate ?
" I do n't think Vegas is overbuilt , " says Hallier .
" Despite what everybody says , Vegas still has 2 million people . "
Time will tell if this sort of optimism is warranted .
Cynics who 've witnessed Detroit 's decline might liken Hallier 's opinions to another Dickens oeuvre : Great Expectations .
Let the Human - Capital Exodus Begin
One effect of President Obama ‘s $ 500,000 salary cap on the executives of bailed out firms ( if it has any effect at all ; Gary Becker thinks it wo n’t ) could be an exodus of human capital from the top echelons of the finance industry .
A new paper suggests that talented people are likely to leave finance in droves anyway , once tighter regulations set in .
Contrary to popular belief , bankers did n’t always command sky - high salaries .
Tomas Phillipon and Ariel Resheff found that , over the last 100 years , finance workers have mostly been paid wages proportionate to professionals in other industries — except for two periods : in the 1920 ’s through the start of the Great Depression , and in the 1980 ’s through the start of this economic downturn .
During the boom times , wages in banking skyrocketed and talent flowed into the industry .
During the bust cycles , that wage premium vanished .
What kept down wages in between ?
According to the paper , the culprit is a strict regime of federal regulations on banking enacted in the 1930 ’s and gradually repealed starting in the 1980’s .
The authors conclude that regulations on banking stifle innovation , which keeps down earnings and wages , drawing fewer talented workers into the field .
Tamping down the level of innovation in the financial sector , of course , might not be an entirely bad thing .
( Credit default swaps , anyone ? )
Furthermore , as financiers ’ wages became far higher than those of government regulators , it made it that much harder for the latter industry to attract top talent .
Accordingly , the authors note , “ the flow of talented individuals into law and financial services might not be entirely desirable , because social returns might be higher in other occupations , even though private returns are not . ”
If all of this talent does start to flow out of the banking sector and into the rest of society , what other good could come of it ?

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The Israeli military on Monday rejected allegations that its soldiers committed atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza .
Israel says the majority of Palestinians killed during " Operation Cast Lead " were " terror operatives . "
The conclusion follows a military police investigation into claims made at a conference that the army had intentionally killed civilians and damaged property during Israel 's incursion into Gaza in December and January .
Israeli military advocate general Brig .
Gen. Avichai Mendelblit concluded " the stories told were purposely exaggerated and made extreme , in order to make a point with the participants of the conference . "
The allegations were " based on hearsay " and were " not supported by the facts as determined by the investigation , " Mendelblit said in a statement .
Israeli human rights organizations condemned the speed with which military police reached their conclusion .
" The speedy closing of the investigation immediately raises suspicions that the very opening of this investigation was merely the army 's attempt to wipe its hands of all blame for illegal activity during Operation Cast Lead , " as the Gaza operation was called , nine human rights groups said in a joint statement .
They reiterated their call for a civilian investigation , which Attorney General Menachem Mazuz has rejected .
" The closing of the Army 's own investigation only strengthens the need for the attorney general to allow for an independent non-partisan investigative body to be established in order to look into all Israeli Army activity during Operation Cast Lead , " said the organizations .
The groups -- The Association for Civil Rights in Israel , Bimkom , B'tselem , Gisha , Hamoked , The Public Committee Against Torture , Yesh Din , Physicians for Human Rights , and Adalah -- said accounts by Palestinians raise the possibility that acts by the military were worse than previously suspected .
Israeli soldiers said earlier this month Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel 's military campaign in Gaza , according to Haaretz , an Israeli newspaper .
About 1,300 Palestinians died during " Operation Cast Lead , " which aimed to stop militants from firing rockets into Israel from Gaza .
The accounts in Haaretz were from Israeli soldiers who graduated from a pre-military course at an Israeli college .
In them , Israeli soldiers complain that the rules of engagement often defied logic and left the impression with Israeli troops that " inside Gaza you are allowed to do anything you want . "
None of the soldiers who alleged the wrongdoing admitted taking part in those acts themselves .
The country 's top general had already dismissed the claims .
" I do n't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood , but we shall wait for the results of the investigation , " Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi said last week .
He blamed Hamas , the militant Palestinian group which runs Gaza , for choosing " to fight in heavily populated areas .
" It ( was ) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent , " he said , according to an IDF statement .
There have been numerous allegations of Israeli atrocities during the three - week campaign , including the charge that Israel fired white phosphorus shells " repeatedly over densely populated areas . "
Human Rights
Watch made the accusation in a report last week .
White phosphorus burns on contact with oxygen .
It is legal to use as an illuminant , but the human rights organization alleges that Israel used it as a weapon .
Israel has rejected those claims as well .
Other Israeli investigations into the conduct of its troops in Gaza continue .
A United Nations report released last week also criticized the Israeli military 's actions during the offensive in Gaza .
It said that Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm 's way during their 22 - day offensive .
The report said investigators had documented and verified reports of violations " too numerous to list . "
A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the report another example of the " one - sided and unfair " attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council , which requested it .
long - term effects of Vaping Ever since the introduction of vaping in the mid-2000s , it was first thought that nicotine e liquid would not have the same negative long - term impacts such as lung cancer that traditional tobacco cigarettes have on health .
AJN , has been conducting research into scholarly articles that provide both experiments and long - term research into the health deterioration of traditional smoking and vapers .

Vaping : legalising of marijuana ?
Nicotine e liquid is just one major application for e-cigs and vapes , in recent years , vapers have been known to mix and utilise cannabis oils into their vape claiming that this would “ filter ” out any harmful smoke or chemicals from being breathed into their lungs .
Although we have not been able to find any definitive answers to whether this is true or not – there is some positive benefits such as using cannabis oils instead of vape juice with nicotine being the main ingredient keeps smokers addicted .

Apple is preparing to launch not one , but two new devices with Verizon , according to yet another new rumor .
Two " people familiar with the matter " speaking to BusinessWeek have leaked details about an alleged " iPhone lite " and a tablet - like device , one of which may launch as early as this summer ( we assume to coincide with the release of iPhone OS 3.0 ) .
These claims seem to support evidence of multiple new devices discovered in the latest iPhone OS 3.0 beta last month .
At that time , we dug up product identifiers for yet - to - be - released iPod touch and iPhone models , plus two mystery products referred to as " iProd " and " iFPGA " respectively .
iFPGA did n't conform to Apple 's standard numbering scheme for the iPhone and iPod touch , and iProd had a product number of 0,1 , indicating that it could be a prototype under development .
From BusinessWeek 's sources , there are very few details offered on the smaller , cheaper iPhone , but the other device would be a " media pad that would let users listen to music , view photos , and watch high - definition videos . "
The media pad is supposedly smaller than Amazon 's Kindle , but with a larger touchscreen .
" The media pad category might go to Verizon , " one of the sources is quoted saying .
" We are talking about a device where people will say , ' Damn , why did n't we do this ? '
Apple is probably going to define the damn category . "
The piece is actually a bit of a tease , as does not say which of these two products might launch this summer .
The talks with Verizon go back at least half a year , these sources claim , though a deal is not yet sealed .
This both confirms and contradicts a rumor that came out just this morning about Apple being in talks with Verizon for a CDMA iPhone in 2010 .
It 's possible that the " iPhone lite " is the CDMA iPhone , though the language in the piece indicates that Verizon fans should hold off on their celebrations until a deal is more solid .
What about AT&T ?
Everyone is already aware that AT&T has been looking to extend its exclusive iPhone relationship with Apple , which is set to expire soon .
That may still be happening — after all , Apple COO Tim Cook said during Apple 's recent quarterly earnings call that the company is " very happy " with its relationship with AT&T and does n't have immediate plans to change that .
Additionally , Apple 's deal with AT&T may only involve the original and 3G iPhones , and not these newfangled devices .
Of course , launching different devices with different carriers would make the situation complex for customers , and that 's just not how Apple rolls .
Either way , let 's just say that our curiosity is piqued , and we are now more sure than ever about those new product identifiers .
Editor 's Note ( 3/12/2019 ) : This article was originally published on March 12 , 2009 .
It is being re-posted on the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web .
Twenty years ago this month , a software consultant named Tim Berners - Lee at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( better known as CERN ) hatched a plan for an open computer network to keep track of research at the particle physics laboratory in the suburbs of Geneva , Switzerland .
Berners - Lee 's modestly titled " Information Management : A Proposal , " which he submitted to get a CERN grant , would become the blueprint for the World Wide Web .
The Web was not an overnight success .
In fact , it took nearly two years before Berners - Lee — with help from CERN computer scientist Robert Cailliau and others — on Christmas Day 1990 set up the first successful communication between a Web browser and server via the Internet .
This demonstration was followed by several more years of tireless lobbying by Berners - Lee , now 53 , to convince professors , students , programmers and Internet enthusiasts to create more Web browsers and servers that would soon forever change the world of human communication .
On Friday March 13 , Berners - Lee , Cailliau and other Web pioneers will gather at CERN to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that original proposal .
To get the inside story on how the Web came to be , not to mention the man behind the idea , SciAm.com spoke with Scientific American editor Mark Fischetti , who in 1999 collaborated with Berners - Lee to write Weaving the Web : The Past , Present and Future of the World Wide Web by its Inventor , a seminal work that analyzed and commemorated Berners - Lee 's achievement a decade after the Web 's birth .
[ An edited transcript of the interview follows . ]
Why was the Web invented at CERN ?
Tim Berners - Lee was a software consultant at CERN in the 1980s when he began writing Tangle , an application to help him keep track of CERN 's many scientists , projects and incompatible computers .
Thousands of researchers would travel to CERN , do their experiments using their own computers ( which they brought with them ) , and then go home to crunch the data .
It was a major pain at CERN to accommodate the many incompatible computers , which also had to work with the CERN mainframe that actually ran the mammoth particle accelerators .
Tim was responsible for helping everything and everyone work together .
He thought it would be a whole lot simpler if the computers could swap their information directly , even though , at that time , computers did n't communicate with one another .
March 2009 marks 20 years since Tim Berners - Lee first proposed a project that would become the World Wide Web .
What inspired the larger vision ?
He made the proposal to CERN management in March 1989 for funding and an official okay to use some of his time to work on this project .
But in thinking about solving the incompatibility problem , he realized that it would be even more cool if the scientists , after they went back to their labs , could still share their data .
They might even be able to run some of their experiments at CERN over a network from wherever they were located , if the distant CERN computers could talk over the Internet .
The Internet itself is just a set of wires and a protocol for sending information over those wires .
The Web would be an application that ran on the Internet .
It just so happens that the Web turned out to be the killer app of all time .
( Other Internet applications already existed , including File Transfer Protocol , or FTP , and e-mail . )
What were the key innovations that formed the Web ?
Who created them ?
The three main innovations are HTTP ( hypertext transfer protocol ) ; URLs ( universal resource locators , which Tim originally referred to as URIs , for universal resource indicators ) ; and HTML ( hypertext markup language ) .
HTTP allows you to click on a link and be brought to that document or Web page .
URLs serve as an address for finding that document or page .
And HTML gives you the ability to put links in documents and pages so they connect .
Tim created all three of these pieces of software code from October to December of 1990 .
What 's the best analogy for explaining how the Web works ?
Tim likens it to a market economy : anyone can trade with anyone else without having to go to a physical market square to do it .
The traders just need to know the rules .
The hardest thing for people to grasp about the Web is that it has no center ; any computer ( or node , in mathematical terms ) can link to any other computer directly , without having to go through a central connection point .
They just need to know the rules for communicating .
Berners - Lee accessed the first Web page , on the first Web server , using the first Web browser on Christmas Day 1990 .
Why did it take until 1993 before the public became aware of the creation ?
Once Tim and Robert Cailliau established that the Web worked , they wanted to spread the word .
After getting CERN to buy in , Tim spent 1991 flying around the world meeting with people who were interested in hypertext and the Internet and linking to create Web browsers to access what was a growing repository of information on Tim's CERN computer .
He also encouraged enthusiasts to start their own servers .
From there , listservs helped spread the word ; so did university computer science programs , which saw the coding of browsers and servers as a great way to get students to experiment .
( One of the best known of these projects was headed by the University of Illinois 's Marc Andreessen , who would later transform his creation into the Netscape Web browser . )
Tim began to get concerned , though , about universities and companies like Microsoft creating their own networks that might compete with the Web , or charging for content , which would violate his core principle : that everyone should be able to communicate freely with everyone else .
To stop this from happening , he got management at CERN to release all of his source code under a general license so that any programmer anywhere could use it for free .
He thought that if the whole world was building the Web together , no one company could take control of it .
What caused the Web to finally take off ?
Tim designed the Web to be a social medium , first , rather than a technical one — a system that would connect people through their computers , and the grassroots building [ of the Web ] took off because of that .
However , the general public did n't really enter that picture until the mid-1990s , when companies like Netscape and AOL [ America Online ] commercialized browsers .
These companies would snail mail free CDs with their browser software so people would get on the Web , hoping that once they got there , they would discover services the companies offered for a fee , such as e-mail .
Why did Berners - Lee abruptly leave CERN to begin the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 , just as the Web began to rapidly expand ?
At that point , the Web was clearly becoming a juggernaut , and commercial forces did indeed threaten those core principles .
CERN was not in the business of overseeing Internet systems or applications — it existed to do high - energy physics experiments .
Tim could n't be the caretaker and stay there , so he moved on to M.I.T.'s Laboratory for Computer Science , which became the host for a new World Wide Web Consortium , where Tim has been ever since .
What has most surprised him about the Web 's evolution ?
What surprised Tim most is that for years people were so much more interested in simply browsing for and reading content rather than in creating it .
His very first browser — WorldWideWeb — was actually both a browser and an editor .
It let you write your own pages , post them online , and edit pages posted by others .
But the commercial browsers did n't offer editing capabilities .
This frustrated him for a number of years .
The whole point of the Web , to him , was not to just see information but to publish it , too .
This did n't really happen until blogs emerged , followed by sites like Facebook , where people can easily post content .
What does the future hold for the Web , given that the openness that Berners - Lee built into it is continually exploited by miscreants ?
It 's hard to implement controls on the Web — because it was created in the ethos of the Internet — in that it 's totally open .
But for Tim , confronting issues like privacy and protection of intellectual property is not a matter of a technical fix .
First , you need a social fix .
If the Web is open to good people , it 's open to bad people , too .
The way you deal with security and other problems on the Web is the same way you deal with it in society :
You need laws and social conventions that guide people 's behavior .
Once those are developed , then the technical ways to implement them can be created .

Chapter 4 – Adopting Technology
Interviews with David Liddle , Mat Hunter , Rikako Sakai , David Kelley , and Paul Mercer
David Liddle , project leader for the design of the Xerox Star , the founder of Metaphor Computer , and head of Interval Research ,
explains that a technology is adopted in three phases2 — the enthusiast phase , the professional phase , and the consumer phase — and that these phases apply to the technology of a remote control or camera just as much as to a computer .
Mat Hunter was lead interaction designer in the team at that developed an interaction architecture for digital photography with Kodak .
Rikako Sakai from Canon developed the screen interactions for PhotoStitch , the feature that helps photographers connect images together to form a panorama .
David Kelley , Chairman of IDEO , traces the development of interaction design from screen graphics to complete experiences , and proposes a future where designers act as integrators .
Paul Mercer , an inventive software engineer with a background at Apple , as well as founder of Pixo and Iventor , tells the story of the iPod development in the context of his more general contribution to the creation of software tools for the design of portable devices .

( CNN ) -- Paul
Harvey , the legendary radio host whose career sharing " the rest of the story " with listeners spanned more than 70 years , has died , according to ABC Radio Networks .
Paul Harvey received the Medal of Freedom from President Bush in 2005 .
He was 90 .
Harvey died at a hospital in Phoenix , Arizona , where he kept a winter home , said Louis Adams , a spokesman for the networks .
He was surrounded by family members when he died , Adams said .
Known for his deliberate delivery and pregnant pauses , Harvey 's broadcasts were heard on more than 1,200 radio stations and 400 Armed Forces networks and his commentaries appeared in 300 newspapers , according to his Web site .
iReport.com : Share your memories of Paul Harvey
He had been hosting his radio shows part - time for much of the past year , after recovering from physical ailments including pneumonia and the death of his wife , Lynne " Angel " Harvey , in May 2008 .
" My father and mother created from thin air what one day became radio and television news , " said Harvey 's son , Paul Harvey Jr. , in a written statement .
" So , in the past year , an industry has lost its godparents and today millions have lost a friend . "
Born in Tulsa , Oklahoma , Harvey began his radio career in 1933 at KVOO - AM there while he was still in high school , his Web site says .
He helped clean the station and was eventually was allowed to fill in on air , reading news and commercials .

" Paul Harvey was one of the most gifted and beloved broadcasters in our nation 's history , " ABC Radio Networks President Jim Robinson said in a written statement .
" As he delivered the news each day with his own unique style and commentary , his voice became a trusted friend in American households . "
Some critics faulted Harvey for the way he seamlessly intertwined news stories with advertisements , which he often read in his own voice in the middle of a story .
But his accolades were plentiful -- from his 1990 induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame to receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from then - President George W. Bush in 2005 .
" Paul was a friendly and familiar voice in the lives of millions of Americans , " Bush said Saturday in a written statement .
" His commentary entertained , enlightened , and informed .
Laura and I are pleased to have known this fine man , and our thoughts and prayers are with his family . "
The cause of Harvey 's death was not immediately known .
He was forced off the air temporarily in 2001 because of a virus that weakened a vocal cord .

China 's nuke submarines up for maiden parade
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-04-21 09:12
QINGDAO -- China will display its nuclear - powered submarines for the first time in history during a fleet parade to mark the 60th anniversary of the People 's Liberation Army Navy , a senior navy officer said in Qingdao Monday .
The Chinese navy 's missile destroyer 115 Shenyang is docked at Qingdao Port April 20 , 2009 for an international fleet review to be held on April 23 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Liberation Army Navy .
[ Agencies ] More Photos
Ding Yiping , deputy commander of the PLA Navy , said : " It is not a secret that China has nuclear submarines , which are key to safeguarding our country 's national security , " adding that the number of China 's nuclear submarines were far less than those of the United States and Russia .
Ding stressed that China 's national defense policy and nuclear strategy is purely defensive in nature , and that the country 's naval forces would not pose any threat to other countries .
" The PLA Navy will continue to make contributions to maintain world , regional and maritime peace , " he said .
In addition to the fleet parade , there will also be seminars and a sampan race that will be held off the coast of the eastern city of Qingdao during the four - day celebration .
The fleet parade will strive to be grand , practical , safe and frugal , Ding was quoted as saying by the Xinhua News Agency .
The parade would be grand as it was unprecedented in terms of the celebration scale .
Dozens of Chinese naval ships and planes and 21 naval vessels from 14 countries will participate in the fleet review , slated for Thursday , he said .
He said it is the first time for the country to have a fleet parade participated by high - level naval delegations from 29 countries .
Frugality is the professional virtue of both the Chinese navy and their foreign counterparts , he said .
The whole celebration will feature the concept of practicality .
All activities must have an actual effect rather than just being aesthetic and pompous .
To ensure the safety of the celebrations , the navy and local public security departments had worked out a detailed security plan which had referred to that of the Beijing Olympics , he said .
All the Chinese naval vessels and weapons displayed during the fleet review were domestic - made .
Most of the participant naval vessels were from the Beihai Fleet , with a few from the Donghai Fleet and Nanhai Fleet .
Some of the Chinese vessels are new while some of them have already served for some time , he added .
Ding called the maritime gathering a naval " Olympics " as a variety of foreign vessels would participate in the fleet review , ranging from warships to auxiliary vessels , and from big naval ships with a displacement more than 10,000 tonnes to smaller ones with several hundred tonnes .
The Chattanooga Police Department has decided that an officer who assaults two people , including pushing one through a plate glass window , will not be criminally charge .
Det. Kenneth Freeman is truly a free man after , on Christmas Eve , shoving 71 - year - old Wal - Mart greeter Bill Walker to the ground .
Why ?
Because he was asking for a receipt check .
Freeman then reportedly shoved Gholom Ghassedi through a glass door when he tried to assist Walker .
The police routinely charge people with battery and resisting arrest if they touch the sleeve of an officer .
Even hugging an officer or passing gas near an officer has led to a charge of assault .
Yet , the Chattanooga Police Department can’t imagine what it would charge Freeman with after assaulting an elderly man and shoving a good samaritan through a glass door .
Collegedale Judge Kevin Wilson reviewed the complaint filed by Walker and decided that there was no room for an assault charge .
Walker said an alarm went off when Det. Freeman and another city police officer , Edwin McPherson , were leaving the store .
He tried to stop Freeman and pushed against a soft drink machine and to the floor .
He said the officer then stood over him in a threatening manner as he lay on the floor .
A customer , Gholom Ghassedi , then told Freeman , “ You ca n’t push down an old man ” and began struggling with him only to be shoved through a glass door .
He was bleeding from his neck when officers arrived .
Cpl. Larry Robbins Jr. of the Collegedale Police said he decided not to bring assault charges against Det.
Freeman because the incident was a misdemeanor not committed in the presence of an officer — not counting the officer doing the beating of course .
He further insisted that , since Gholom Ghassedi , did not seek medical attention , it did not meet that criteria .
Finally , he explained “ there were no other crimes committed along with the possible simple assault . ”
If that seems a bit ridiculous , it is .
There is a host of possible charges here in the abuse of an elderly person and assault on not one but two individuals .
The police department had to struggle to find a way not to charge Freeman , insisting that they were “ unable to determine at the scene that there was any intent to commit an assault . ”
Well , whatever his intent , he succeeded in knocking an elderly man to the ground and throwing another through a door .
Was that all involuntary muscular reflex ?
By the way , Freeman was involved in a scuffle with attorney Lloyd Levitt at the Courts Building in May 2007 .
What is clear is that the problem is not just Det. Freeman , but the Chattanooga Police Department itself .

The critical role of forests as massive " sinks " for absorbing greenhouse gases is " at risk of being lost entirely " to climate change - induced environmental stresses that threaten to damage and even decimate forests worldwide , according to a new report released April 17 .
The report will be formally presented at the next session of the United Nations Forum on Forests ( UNFF ) taking place 20 April - 1 May 2009 at the UN Headquarters in New York City .
" Adaptation of Forests and People to Climate Change – A Global Assessment " was coordinated by the Vienna - based International Union of Forest Research Organizations ( IUFRO ) through the Collaborative Partnership on Forests ( CPF ) , an alliance of 14 international organizations that each has substantial forestry programs .
Authored by 35 of the world 's top forestry scientists , it provides the first global assessment to date of the ability of forests to adapt to climate change and is expected to play a key role in the UNFF discussions .
The report presents the state of scientific knowledge regarding the current and projected future impacts of climate change on forests and people along with options for adaptation .
" We normally think of forests as putting the brakes on global warming , but in fact over the next few decades , damage induced by climate change could cause forests to release huge quantities of carbon and create a situation in which they do more to accelerate warming than to slow it down , " said Risto Seppälä , a professor at the Finnish Forest Research Institute ( Metla ) and Immediate Past President of IUFRO , who chaired the expert panel that produced the report .
Scientists hope the new assessment will inform international climate change negotiations , set to resume in December in Copenhagen , where forest - related deliberations thus far have focused mainly on carbon emissions from deforestation .
The analysis shows that officials also must consider how the world 's forests are likely to suffer — and perhaps severely — as the earth gets warmer .
While deforestation is responsible for about 20 percent of greenhouse gases , overall , forests currently absorb more carbon than they emit .
The trees and soils of the world 's forests are capturing and storing more than a quarter of the world 's carbon emissions .
The problem , scientists say , is that this critical carbon - regulating service could be lost entirely if the earth heats up 2.5 degrees Celsius ( 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit ) or more relative to pre-industrial levels , which is expected to occur if emissions are not substantially reduced .

The study notes that the higher temperatures — along with the prolonged droughts , more intense pest invasions , and other environmental stresses that could accompany climate change — would lead to considerable forest destruction and degradation .
This could create a dangerous feedback loop in which damage to forests from climate change significantly increases global carbon emissions which then exacerbate the greenhouse effect .
The warning from scientists that forests are in danger of flipping from a net sink to a net source of carbon emerged from an exhaustive analysis of how different forest ecosystems worldwide would be affected under specific climate change scenarios developed by the Nobel - prize winning UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The authors of the report , some of whom also serve on the IPCC panel , noted that the impacts in different ecosystems would vary over time .
In fact , the authors found that the risk of losing forests as a net carbon sink is significant even in relatively conservative scenarios in which countries achieve modest emissions reductions and stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations .
The loss becomes much more likely in scenarios where curbs fail to take effect and emissions continue on their current , upward trend .
" Policymakers should focus greater attention on helping forests and the people who live around them adapt to anticipated problems , " said Professor Seppälä .
" For example , wider application of well - understood sustainable forestry practices , which offer a range of benefits , could help forests avoid some of the damage induced by climate change . "
Threats ,
But also Benefits , of Climate Change
The study observes that as climate change progresses over the next decades :
Droughts are projected to become more intense and frequent in subtropical and southern temperate forests , especially in the western United States , northern China , southern Europe and the Mediterranean , subtropical Africa , Central America and Australia .
" These droughts will also increase the prevalence of fire and predispose large areas of forest to pests and pathogens , " the study says .
In some arid and semi-arid environments , such as the interior of the American west , forestry experts worry that climate change could be so dramatic that timber productivity could " decline to the extent that forests are no longer viable . "
Decreased rainfall and more severe droughts are expected to be particularly stressful for forest - dependent people in Africa who look to forests for food , clean water and other basic needs .
For them , the scientists predict climate change could mean " deepening poverty , deteriorating public health , and social conflict . "
In certain areas , climate change could lead to substantial gains in the supply of timber .
The combination of warming temperatures and the fertilizing effect of increased carbon in the atmosphere could fuel a northward expansion of what is known as the boreal forest , the coniferous timber lands that run across the earth 's northern latitudes and include forests in Canada , Finland , Russia and Sweden .
Research from the report indicates that climate change could cause more than a 40 percent increase in timber growth in Finland .
In fact , the study concludes that the increased growth in boreal forests could be large enough to spur a drop in timber prices worldwide .
However , over the long - term , if climate change continues at the current pace the boreal expansion eventually will be offset by an increase in insect invasions , fires , and storms .

The scientists warn that efforts to adapt to climate change may end up providing forests with only a temporary respite .
" Even if adaptation measures are fully implemented , unmitigated climate change would , during the course of the current century , exceed the adaptive capacity of many forests , " said Professor Andreas Fischlin of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , who is one of the lead authors of the study and a coordinating lead author with the IPCC .
" The fact remains that the only way to ensure that forests do not suffer unprecedented harm is to achieve large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions . "
Forestry experts acknowledge that more research is needed to better understand precisely how climate change will impact forests and how effective different adaptation responses will be .
But they say the challenge to policy makers is that they must act even in the face of imperfect data because " climate change is progressing too quickly to postpone action . "

Believe it or not , there really is a best day of the week to make your best deal on an airline ticket , and it ’s neither Monday nor Friday .
It ’s Wednesday !
And there ’s even a best time on Wednesday to buy that ticket .
Why Wednesday ?
Thank the small , upstart airlines .
In the airline business , fare wars are started by the weakest competitors , and the big guys tend to be the ones to raise fares .
And all of that tends to happen on Fridays .
So how did Wednesday become the ideal day to strike a deal ?
Let ’s say Airline A decides to raise fares .
It usually does so at a late hour on a Friday night .
By Saturday , Airline A ’s major competitors will probably match that fare increase .
Warning : Book your tickets over a weekend , and you might spend a whole lot more than you should .
But what if the major competitors do n’t match the higher fares ?
Then the instigator of the fare increase drops its fares back down late on Sunday night or on Monday morning .
If you already paid a higher fare , you still may be out of luck .
Why ?
Because although you might still qualify for a lower fare and a ticket exchange , that terrible $ 100 change fee could wipe out your savings !
Here ’s another example .
Let ’s say upstart Airline B decides to begin a fare war .
Again , it happens late on a Friday night .
Usually , some ( but not all ) of the majors will match that fare on routes where they compete with Airline B .
Does that mean you should still book tickets over the weekend ?
Absolutely not .
Remember , I said some , but not all , of the majors will match that fare .
By late Monday , depending on how that new fare is doing in the marketplace , Airline C might jump into the battle and offer an even lower fare , so look for all the other airlines to rush to match that one – usually by Tuesday – and the war is on .
Prices might go even lower on Wednesday .
And that ’s when you strike .
Wait any longer than Wednesday , and you may be in trouble .
The wars usually end by Thursday morning .
Why ?
Friday is just around the corner !
And the cycle starts all over again .
What ’s the best time to buy your ticket on Wednesday ?
One hour after Tuesday midnight ( 1 a.m. Wednesday morning ) .
Why ?
At about midnight , the airlines usually reload their computers with the latest low - cost fares that were announced the previous day but will be canceled if they are not purchased within 24 hours .

• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
As the US Navy moves additional ships to the Indian Ocean to attempt to free the American captain held hostage by pirates , some are criticizing Washington 's tactics and calling for strikes on the Somali pirates ' land bases .
The Daily Telegraph reports that the US is sending additional naval vessels to join the USS Bainbridge , which has been in a standoff with the pirates who took an American captain hostage Wednesday .
But experts say that an increased US naval presence will not solve the ongoing issue of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the western Indian Ocean , writes The Wall Street Journal .
" I actually think this naval response is not the right thing to be doing at all , " said [ Peter Chalk , an expert on piracy at the Rand Corp. , ] of the presence of the USS Bainbridge , a guided missile destroyer which reached the Maersk Alabama early Thursday morning .
" We have ratcheted up the situation . " ...
" Governments like the US have little choice , given the public pressure and the political pressure , " Mr. Chalk said .
" I do n't think that the naval presence out there has anything to do with the protection of ships .
It 's been politicized . "
Rather , argues Mr. Chalk , the US needs to target the pirates ' bases in Somalia , where they have had free reign to establish camps in various port cities of the failed state .
In a commentary for CNN , Tom Wilkerson of the United States Naval Institute , a nonprofit professional association , also advocates targeting the pirates ' home bases , which he says is a lesson " we seem unable to learn from our own history . "
In 1804 President Thomas Jefferson said " Enough " to paying 20 percent of the US national budget as tribute to Barbary pirates .
His response was clear and successful – build a strong naval task force , equip it with a sizeable contingent of Marines , and send it to attack and defeat the pirates in their lair .
The sailors and Marines sent on that mission did just that – and in the process wrote a stirring page in our nation 's early history .
The problem today is that we have refused to take the Jefferson model .
We 've confined our anti-piracy efforts to the open seas and left the pirates ' home bases on land as a sanctuary .
Thus , the pirates continue to operate with relative freedom and stealth .
We and our allies only respond , never seizing the initiative .
The Jefferson model is a better answer :
Take on the pirates where they are , rather than guessing where they will be .
In short , attack them at their home bases .
Roger Middleton , an expert on piracy for Chatham House , notes in The Independent that increased naval presence in the Gulf of Aden since last year has reduced the number of attacks there .
However , he notes that " the navies have fallen victim to their own success . "
The effectiveness of the patrols in the Gulf of Aden seem [s ] to have caused the pirates to refocus their attentions on the western Indian ocean .
...
Now hijackers are threatening an area of up to two million square miles , they are much harder to locate .
European , US , and other navies are still overwhelmingly concentrated off Somalia 's northern shore , hours or even days journey away from the recent attacks .
Although the pickings may be slimmer and the sea more dangerous in the ocean the pirates have found an easier place to work and the western Indian Ocean may soon be as notorious as the Gulf of Aden .
While national governments decide how to resolve the Somali pirate problem , sailors are left to consider their own measures to protect their vessels .
The Christian Science Monitor reports that some US maritime academies are considering adding weapons and defensive training to their curriculums .
The Monitor adds that shipping companies are also reviewing new ship defenses .
In November 2005 , a cruise liner , the Seabourn Spirit , used a sonic blast from a " long - range acoustic device , " or LRAD , to repel pirates who were trying to board .
Shocks from an " electric fence " have also been tried , along with night - vision systems to prevent pirates from being able to get close to the vessels .
Indeed , outrunning pirates is still one of the best approaches .
Although pirate boats are faster , a large ship moving at 16 knots or more creates an enormous wake that makes it hard to board .
Razor wire ringing the ship is another technique .
The extra security is n't cheap .
Sonic deterrent equipment and operators can cost $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 per trip , according to documents on the US Maritime Administration website .
Radio Netherlands notes that some companies are considering posting security personnel to their vessels .
But they add that Pottengal Mukundan , director of the piracy watchdog International Maritime Bureau , believes that such an approach could make matters worse .
" We feel that arming merchant vessels is not really the answer .
Given the current legal framework in which merchant shipping operates , we may be creating more problems than trying to solve them . "
There are several reasons why arming merchant vessels may not be the best option .
First , the presence of armed security agents would not guarantee that fewer ships would be hijacked .
Second , the pirates have rarely harmed captives and arming these ships could increase the likelihood of injuries and deaths .
Furthermore , if only some ships are armed and others are not , then the armed ships may remain safe while exposing the unarmed ships to increased violence .
Im Bundesland Berlin wurden im vergangenen Jahr 1052 Telefonanschlüsse von 511 Personen überwacht , gab die Senatsverwaltung für Justiz nach der Vorlage des Jahresberichts über die Telefonüberwachung bekannt .
Die Überwachung der Telefonanschlüsse erfolgte im Rahmen von insgesamt 157 Strafverfahren .
Wie die Justizsenatorin Gisela von der Aue erklärte , wurden dabei über 1,1 Millionen Telefonate abgehört – im Jahr 2007 wurden noch 937.000 Telefonate abgehört .
Die Anzahl der überwachten Telefonanschlüsse liegt um rund ein Fünftel über dem des Vorjahrs .
Die Zahl der Personen , deren Telefonanschlüsse überwacht wurden , sank dagegen im Jahresvergleich um 46 Prozent .
Der Bericht zeige , wie die Telefonüberwachung in Berlin eingesetzt werde : " Maßvoll und effektiv " , meinte die Justizsenatorin zu dem Bericht .
Telefonanschlüsse würden nur bei begründetem Verdacht überwacht .
Und viele Strafverfahren würden durch Erkenntnisse aus der Telefonüberwachung beschleunigt und verkürzt , erklärte Oberstaatsanwalt Sjors Kamstra laut dem Tagesspiegel .
Der Schwerpunkt bei der Telefonüberwachung liege in Strafermittlungen zu Wirtschafts - und Drogenkriminalität sowie die Verfolgung von Straftaten wie Raub und Erpressung .
Dass die Anzahl der abgehörten Telefonate und überwachten Anschlüsse gestiegen , die Anzahl der überwachten Personen aber abgenommen habe , erklärte von der Aue ganz einfach mit dem veränderten Kommunikationsverhalten der Verdächtigen : " Durch die zunehmende Verbreitung von Prepaid - Handys verfügen verdächtige Personen oft über mehrere Mobiltelefone .
Zudem erfasst die Statistik aus technischen Gründen nicht nur tatsächlich hergestellte Verbindungen , sondern auch den versuchten Verbindungsaufbau . "
Die Einschätzung der Justizsenatorin mochte die Berliner Opposition so nicht teilen : " Es ist unseriös , wenn die Justizsenatorin die Telefonüberwachungspraxis in Berlin als ' maßvoll und effektiv' bezeichnet " , kommentierte Björn Jotzo , datenschutzpolitischer Sprecher der FDP im Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus , laut dem Tagesspiegel .
Mit der jetzt erreichten Zahl von mehr als einer Million abgehörten Telefonaten sei " der Trend der letzten Jahre zu immer mehr überwachten Gesprächen ungebrochen " .

Digital cinema systems have been around for some time , even the high - end " 4 K " variant .
Digital cinema upstart RED , however , is making the high - resolution format more accessible for both filmmakers and theaters .
And its technological breakthroughs could trickle down to consumers in the not - too - distant future .
At the beginning of this decade , it became apparent that the resolution specifications for HDTV — even the pixel - dense 1080 p mode — just were n't adequate to digitally project feature films in movie theaters .
Both the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers as well as a new group , Digital Cinema Initiatives , began work to define standards for digital cinema playback .
DCI , formed by several large Hollywood studios , released version 1.0 of the " Digital Cinema System Specification " in 2005 ; the current 1.2 version of the spec was formalized last March .
The spec defines both a 2 K and 4 K resolution , similar to HDTVs specification of 720 and 1080 formats .
Unlike HDTV , which specifies the maximum vertical resolution , 2 K and 4 K refer specifically to the maximum horizontal pixel counts of 2048 and 4096 , respectively .
The spec defines 2 K as 2048x1080 ( HDTV is 1920x1080 , for comparison ) and 4 K as 4096x2160 , both with 36 - bit color .
The actual pixel counts can vary depending on the aspect ratio a film is shot in , which usually is n't 16:9 ( 1.78:1 ) .
To get some idea of these resolutions , 2 K projectors can display 2.2 megapixels and 4 K projectors can show 8.8 megapixels .
That might not seem like much compared even to entry - level DSLRs that shoot as high as 12 megapixels , but movies run at 24 frames per second , so there is n't much time for hardcore pixel - peeping .
To get an idea of the data requirements for these digital formats , uncompressed 2 K needs 228MB /s and 4 K needs 911 MB / s ( that 's megabytes , not bits ) .
Given these data rates , it 's understandable that the DCI spec allows for compression of the video data .
Even with compression , though , current digital projection requires high - performance RAIDs , fiber optic connections , and loads of processing power , not to mention high - priced , top - of - the - line 2 K or 4 K digital projectors .
Even now , most theaters might have just a screen or two capable of handling 2 K resolutions .
Why bother ?
With few theaters even equipped to project 2 K , why even bother with 4K ?
Almost any digital photographer or audio engineer can tell you that it 's always easier , and usually better , to start out with more resolution than needed and then resample down if necessary .
So , a 4 K source will look better sampled down to 1080 p HDTV than direct 1080 p HD video .
2 K , and more commonly 4 K , are also used as digital intermediates for post - production work .
The film that was shot is digitally scanned for editing , color correction , effects work , etc. before being transferred back to film for projection or sampled to 2 K for digital projection or sampled down to make DVDs or high - def Blu-ray discs .
All of this is great technology for studios and theaters .
But RED , known for making great strides in moving the world of film into a fully digital realm with its 4 K RED ONE digital cinema camera , is stepping up once more to make 4 K resolution digital projection cheaper and more efficient with its RED RAY playback device .
Announced in 2008 , the company 's Red Ray player is capable of 4 K and 2 K playback as well as 720 and 1080 HD formats from " standard DVDs . "
The feat is accomplished via wavelet compression encoding that is capable of getting 4 K resolution down to as little as 10 Mb / s ( yes , that time I meant bits , not bytes ) .
HDTV is finally going mainstream and Blu-ray still has n't reached the mass - adoption that studios been hoped for , but RED RAY tech makes real the possibility of home 4 K players or relatively trivial network streaming of 4 K resolution video .
Such video will look great downsampled to playback on today 's HDTVs , but future home theaters will be built around 4 K flat panels or projectors .
RED , with its RED RAY playback technology , as well as digital cinema cameras capable of 6 K or higher resolution , plans to be ready for that future , well , today .

Josh Gerstein reports :
House Republicans are pressing for a change in federal law that could force Michelle Obama and future first ladies to do more of their policy work in public .
But Democrats warn President Obama may take the attempt personally “ as an attack on his wife . ”
The GOP effort is being led by the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) , whose initial salvo was rebuffed recently at a contentious committee markup session .
Under Issa ’s amendment , any government policy group that Mrs. Obama or another first spouse regularly participates in would be subject to a law requiring meetings to be announced in advance and , in most instances , public .
At the March 10 markup , Issa ’s proposal triggered more than 35 minutes of impassioned debate .
I ’ve linked video of the exchange below , but Democrats clearly seemed to be recoiling at what some viewed as an effort to target Mrs. Obama .
Rep. William Clay ( D - Mo. ) suggested President Obama might see the legislation as a personal provocation that could trigger a fight .
“ Let me … caution my friend from California that , as you ’re probably aware , this president is very guarded about his family , ” Clay said .
“ I think that , no matter what you ’re intending with this amendment , that the president may view this as an attack on his wife .
And I ’m just saying , you know , let ’s be careful -- if we want to open up that can of worms .
Let ’s not go in that direction . ”
“ We are trying actually to protect the historic role of the first lady , ” Issa insisted , repeatedly invoking the “ transparency ” mantra of the Obama administration .
“ I believe this is open government at its finest . ”

“ We strongly condemn this criminal move , ” said Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem , the Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations , adding that the government would no longer work with aid groups it deemed hostile .
“ It amounts to an attempt at regime change .
We are not going to be bound by it . ”
But many human rights groups and Darfur exiles saluted the judges ’ decision .
Niemat Ahmadi , of the Save Darfur Coalition , called the warrant a lifeline for those living in camps .
“ It will change the mood of frustration and helplessness for our people , ” Ms. Ahmadi said .
Richard Dicker , a director of Human Rights Watch , said the warrant was likely to isolate Mr. Bashir internationally .
“ This means he will be a fugitive , a man on a wanted poster , ” he said .
In their statement , the judges called for the cooperation of all countries  not just the 108 that are members of the court  to bring Mr. Bashir to justice .
Legally , Sudan is obliged to arrest Mr. Bashir , but that seems unlikely .
The court has no police force or military , and the United Nations peacekeepers in Sudan have no mandate to detain war - crimes suspects .
Beyond that , Mr. Abdalhaleem said , there is little chance that the president will be arrested in a friendly country , because many African and Arab states have rejected the prosecution of Mr. Bashir as counterproductive to peace efforts .
The question of genocide has also been divisive , but the judges said 2 to 1 that the prosecutor had not provided sufficient evidence of the president ’s specific intent to “ destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , ” the most crucial issue in determining genocide .

I love the original Watchmen graphic novel .
But it has some problems .
It really does .
And Zack Snyder ’s film , while flawed , manages to fix many of the source material ’s more obvious problems .
I ’ve come at this whole thing from a different perspective .
While some fans of the graphic novel have been waiting for 22 years to see this movie , I have n’t .
I first learned about the novel from Shep who is an insane die - hard fan ( find his review HERE ) .
By this time , images were already popping out and the movie looked cool .
I figured maybe I should stay totally uninitiated with this one …just come at it from a complete outsider ’s perspective .
But as all my friends read the novel and talked about it at - length , sometimes threatening to spoil key plot points , I caved .
I picked up Alan Moore ’s Watchmen around Christmas and read it in a couple of days .
I loved it .
I loved the ideas .
I love that the ending ( SPOILER ) renders who we thought of as our heroes impotent .
I love what it says about pragmatism versus morality , and I adore the idea that good intentions can lead to a worse world .
This is a novel of ideas , about philosophies , and concerned with tearing apart political institutions .
While many “ comic books ” may have stopped with “ nuclear war is bad , ” Alan Moore had the balls to say , “ yeah , but is there something worse ?
And does it really matter , anyway ? ”
But the novel , as I said , had some flaws when it came to the narrative .
If you are uninitiated , this might be a good time to stop reading , but I feel like most of you already know the basic Watchmen story .
The big squid monster always rubbed me the wrong way .
I realize it was a bit of a sendup of sci - fi comics , but in the novel it felt somewhat forced and , even in the heightened reality of this world , unrealistic .
I also had a huge problem with Veidt .
He did n’t seem to have anything to do in the novel except wait around to reveal his true plans .
As such , I saw his “ villainy ” ( or heroism , depending on who you ask ) coming a mile away .
If he was n’t behind these attacks , there was no need for him to even be in the novel .
It was frustratingly sloppy storytelling .
Now , as I said before , Zack Snyder ’s film fixes some of these key problems .
Is it better than the book ?
Hell no .
Not really .
It is , as would be expected from a big - budget Hollywood film , a lot more mainstream and action oriented .
It ’s a lot more fun , and a lot more funny .
I ’ll start with how Snyder attacked the above problems with the novel .
( SPOILERS ! )
By excising the squid and replacing that MacGuffin with a series of explosions containing Dr. Manhattan ’s power signature , Snyder kills two birds with one stone .
First , the big climax feels organic .
It now centers around the characters we have spent over two hours getting to know .
Dr. Manhattan becomes central to the plot instead of being just an innocent bystander who has to be alienated for Veidt ’s plan to work .
Also , it gives Veidt a central role in the rest of the movie as he is actively working with Dr. Manhattan to replicate Manhattan ’s energy signature .
So he ’s around , he talks about his plans , and it makes the story more cohesive .
Besides , Manhattan just makes more sense as a common enemy than a “ giant alien squid monster . ”
Half the world is already afraid of him …
Veidt just taps into that .
Okay , so we ’ve gotten the specifics out of the way .
What about the film as a whole ?
Well , it is something that I wholeheartedly did n’t expect , and that is why I think it ’s getting a lot of bad press .
It ’s not the overly dark and brooding socio-political satire of the novel .
It ’s a superhero movie ( GASP ! ) .
These characters do n’t have any overt superpowers , just like Snyder ’s warriors in 300 were supposed to be ordinary men .
Both worlds , though , are different , and the characters are more strong , fast , and dextrous than we can expect any human to be .
They take more punishment .
In this world these are simply individuals who dressed up as costumed heroes , but they ’re like Batman in that they have gadgets and training and the ability to make themselves something more than a man in a mask .
It ’s not realistic , but it ’s also not the real world .
Snyder has created a full - on comic book world much more detached from reality than Moore ’s original novel .
And this world is bloodier , more action - packed , and more fun .
Snyder ’s film does n’t take itself quite as seriously as the novel .
When I realized this , I breathed a sigh of relief .
“ Thank God .
This is going to be a lot of fun . ”
Things that are 100 % serious in the novel are played in a more funny way , like Dreiberg ’s impotence and Rorschach ’s penchant for over - the - top violence .
The action in the movie is extended and stylized , allowing audiences to get more hopped up on adrenaline than they would reading the novel .
I ’m convinced this is an approach Alan Moore would hate ( if he ever deigned to see the film , which he wo n’t ) , but I think it was the only way to make this material work .
By stylizing this reality and not taking itself too seriously , the movie allows itself to be entertaining and non-competitive with the brilliance of the novel–all without losing the thematic elements inherent in the source material .
It reminds me , honestly , of what Gus VanSant did with the universally panned Psycho remake .
His question was this : if you make a movie shot for shot like the original but direct it to your own sensibilities , will it be the same film ?
His movie was an unmitigated ( but interesting ) failure .
Here , Snyder stays insanely faithful to almost every frame of the graphic novel , but takes liberties to connect the frames .
He puts his own spin on how scenes should be played , and the result is a film that is at once wildly faithful and completely its own work .
From the first moment of The Comedian watching television , we understand that this is different from the graphic novel .
Historical figures are caricatures , violence is over - the - top , and locations truly reflect the hyper - realism of an alternate 1985 .
The movie is n’t all a success .
Carla Gugino ’s aging Sally Jupiter takes the comic - book - goofy element too far , pulling us out of the movie , and her daughter ( played by Malin Akerman ) has some very awkward acting moments .
Also , Veidt is played with the mannerisms , speech patterns and dialogue of a weaselly evil genius from frame one , undercutting the “ all - American ” tortured hero character from the novel that I found so interesting .
These flaws , though , are offset by great performances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian , Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg , Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan , and , most strikingly , Jackie Earle Haley whose emotionally starved and violent Rorschach must go down as one of the screen ’s most interesting and well - played anti-heroes .
Overall , I feel like a lot of those giving this movie negative reviews are either taken aback by its length and complicated plot or are upset that Snyder allowed himself to work the material into a more fun-loving tone .
I think it works great .
In fact , it might have been the only way to make such a dense and dark novel work on screen .
Here ’s hoping this one makes several truckloads of money so Hollywood will continue to adapt source material that is interesting , challenging , and fun .

SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico —
Many detainees locked up at Guantanamo were innocent men swept up by U.S. forces unable to distinguish enemies from noncombatants , a former Bush administration official said Thursday .
“ There are still innocent people there , ” Lawrence B. Wilkerson , a Republican who was chief of staff to then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , told The Associated Press .
“ Some have been there six or seven years . ”
Wilkerson , who first made the assertions in an Internet posting on Tuesday , told the AP he learned from briefings and by communicating with military commanders that the U.S. soon realized many Guantanamo detainees were innocent but nevertheless held them in hopes they could provide information for a “ mosaic ” of intelligence .
“ It did not matter if a detainee were innocent .
Indeed , because he lived in Afghanistan and was captured on or near the battle area , he must know something of importance , ” Wilkerson wrote in the blog .
He said intelligence analysts hoped to gather “ sufficient information about a village , a region , or a group of individuals , that dots could be connected and terrorists or their plots could be identified . ”
Wilkerson , a retired Army colonel , said vetting on the battlefield during the early stages of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan was incompetent with no meaningful attempt to discriminate “ who we were transporting to Cuba for detention and interrogation . ”
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman , declined to comment on Wilkerson ’s specific allegations but noted that the military has consistently said that dealing with foreign fighters from a wide variety of countries in a wartime setting was a complex process .
The military has insisted that those held at Guantanamo were enemy combatants and posed a threat to the United States .
In his posting for The Washington Note blog , Wilkerson wrote that “ U.S. leadership became aware of this lack of proper vetting very early on and , thus , of the reality that many of the detainees were innocent of any substantial wrongdoing , had little intelligence value , and should be immediately released . ”
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney fought efforts to address the situation , Wilkerson said , because “ to have admitted this reality would have been a black mark on their leadership . ”
Wilkerson told the AP in a telephone interview that many detainees “ clearly had no connection to al - Qaida and the Taliban and were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Pakistanis turned many over for $ 5,000 a head . ”
Some 800 men have been held at Guantanamo since the prison opened in January 2002 , and 240 remain .
Wilkerson said two dozen are terrorists , including confessed Sept. 11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who was transferred to Guantanamo from CIA custody in September 2006 .
“ We need to put those people in a high - security prison like the one in Colorado , forget them and throw away the key , ” Wilkerson said .
“ We ca n’t try them because we tortured them and did n’t keep an evidence trail . ”
But the rest of the detainees need to be released , he said .
Wilkerson , who flew combat missions as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and left the government in January 2005 , said he did not speak out while in government because some of the information was classified .
He said he feels compelled to do so now because Cheney has claimed in recent press interviews that President Barack Obama is making the U.S. less safe by reversing Bush administration policies toward terror suspects , including ordering Guantanamo closed .
The administration is now evaluating what to do with the prisoners who remain at the U.S. military base in Cuba .
“ I ’m very concerned about the kinds of things Cheney is saying to make it seem Obama is a danger to this republic , ” Wilkerson said .
“ To have a former vice president fearmongering like this is really , really dangerous . ”

On January 22nd I had a major operation .
They opened a 13 centimer section of my spinal cord and removed a tumour .
The doctors say they have never , in thousands of operations , ever seen a tumour like it .
It looks like a salamander and has clearly defined eyes and a tail .
I took a picture of it with my cell phone camera .
It may be what was responsible for the weird visions I had of the nature of the universe .
Since it was on my spinal cord it was directly attached to my brain .
As I said before , it has what appears to be eyes and a mouth and the doctors reported some hard matter ( spine ? ) in the tail of the creature .
It was 8.3 cm long .
I have asked the doctors for hi rez pictures .
It has been sent to a lab for testing but results are not expected for 10 days .
However , one of the doctors told me the tail seemed to have a bony structure in it .
That is not something you would expect to find in a tumour made of nerve cells .
Also , you can see what look like eyes .
This really is bizzare .
By the way , I feel just fine except for the fact they sawed open my back - bone .

I think that this is some kind of parasite , probably native to tropical regions .
Parasites stranger than this are common in the tropical regions .
If Ben had travelled to a tropical country recently and went hiking in the jungle , that 's likely where it came from .
It 's also possible that a young version of this parasite was placed under his skin by his enemies .
I 'm not a doctor , but I 'm sure if one looks for this in medical texts , it will show up as a tropical parasite .
From M.A. Guinnane I 've come to believe Fulford is a looney tunes type .
I mean , all his talk about some Ninja telling the Illuminati to cool it or they 're dead meat , etc. etc. , makes me believe he 's lost touch with reality .
Completely .
This eel that was in his spine supposedly . . . probably came out of a swamp somewhere and he fabricated the surgery story , delusional to the point of believing his own lies .
Well , I hope I 'm wrong .
Would n't it be terrific if some trained assassins brought down the Illuminati ?
We tend to believe what we want to believe , however , till it becomes so far - fetched that your intellect refuses to swallow it .

Hi there what ever this object is , would one say that this is a normal thing to remover from one 's spine erea ... i doubt it ... i'm sure it must be some creature that like a ring worm has planted itself into his spine , , What ever it is ..
' WERID ' YUK ... must be an alien transplant From Ellen B . I seem to remember a doctor in California who had removed a lot of implants , and odd " stuff " from people .
I 'm going to do some digging , and will get back to you if I find his name .he might know something about this .
I can't help but wonder if Ben 's getting picked up while he 's sleeping , by some strange folks / creatures ?
Maybe some hypnosis therapy will help him .
Best of luck to you , Ben .
You are in my prayers .

Thirty years ago I took a college - level course in parasitology ( I am a med lab tech , by the way ) and would have to say that whatever it is fits into the parasitic category .
It is too large to be a bacterium , virus , rickettseae , etc .
I know that the cause of Leishmoniasis Donovani enters near the ear and eyes and somehow enters the brain .
Parasites need a healthy host from where they can attach and gain nutrients , etc .
And they are usually more complex than the creatures one studies in microbiology .
Was Mr. Fulford someplace where this could have entered through his anus or rectum ?
Possibly a hot - tub - like environment ?
That might explain the TYPE of parasite it is .
Another explanation which is very bizaare is that certain nerves when misplaced can grow together into a kind of faux nervous system thus giving the appearance of an entirely different organism .
Naturally , that is extremely rare .
If possible , I would have the thing checked for DNA .
It looks like a fish but in early stages so do many forms of embryos for humans , mammals , reptiles , etc .
Just looking at it makes me think of one of those white goldfish - only with an odd tail developing into an unknown appendage .
Goldfish are a kind of carp and carp live well on garbage and junk found in rivers .
DO NOT THROW IT OUT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS !
It could re-attach itself to someone or something else !

It 's possible that it's an undeveloped TWIN !
From Don M.
In response to the latest article about Benjamin Fulford : Are we to believe this is real ?
There is nothing on Fulford 's website .
Also who undergoes a major operation and goes back to work the next day ?
Is this an effort to make people think Fulford is delusional ?
Maybe he was delusional as " he " alluded to in this latest article ?
The " tumor " has eyes and a spinal cord next to Fulford 's own spinal cord .
This sounds like a parasite from the old Star Trek series or something from " Matrix " .
I am going to wait and see where this goes .
Right now it seems very strange and coincidental considering Fulford 's past articles .
This is another example to remind me to be very careful to consider the sources of articles and be a critical reader .
It 's really difficult to separate fact from fiction when you are so removed from the original source .
Sadly , I am skeptical about nearly everything I read or hear these days as a result .
From John Remember that Vincent Price movie back in the 60 "s ?
The Tingler ?
That is what comes to mind when looking at the creature they retrieved from Mr. Fulford 's spine .

There are rare medical instances where one of a set of twins stop developing in utero and is absorbed by it 's sibling .
The now single is born , grows and never knows it was actually a twin until something triggers the absorbed undeveloped fetus to begin developing again wherever it happened to lodge .
It is then diagnosed as a tumor and removed surgically , only to be correctly diagnosed as a malformed twin after surgery .
This looks like the same condition .
I hope this helps From Tweishar Welcome to the world of modified genetics , airborne chemicals , and various types of radiation .
We see the horrific results of depleted uranium on the unborn .
Throw in the strange looking animals , puberty at age eight , and bee colony collapse , and a salamander tumor seems normal .
The more the chemical , cell phone , and weapons industries deny risk , the more cases we seem to find .
We are entering one of those science fiction movie scripts , just waiting for the monster created by chemicals and radiation .
DNA is part of the balance of nature , and Monsanto , Lockeed , and AT&T are disrupting it .
Maybe the barium and aluminum chemtrails will cause the migrating geese to lay golden eggs .
From Leslie Bell s Looks like he had an undeveloped twin .
Not uncommon .
Usually the non-viable twin material is absorbed completely by the surviving twin in vitro , but due to the location in the bone it seems like it was impossible .
Fulford might have developed into Siamese twins conjoined at the spine .
Some children are born with partially or fully formed twins that usually present as large tumors .
As they are obvious at birth , they are usually taken care of .
Some are not discovered until adulthood , fully internal , and are common tabloid fodder .
As this " twin " was at an extremely early embryonic stage , it 's doubtful that it had any kind of a brain that could have been communicating with Fulford through his spine and nerves .
The early Church taught that the soul entered the body at birth , not at conception , so it 's doubtful that Fulford was communicating with his twin on the other side either .
But we can't really be sure until we get there ourselves .
At least he can rest assured that what happened to him is n't abnormal , or even that uncommon , and certainly not paranormal or extraterrestrial .
I 'm surprised the doctor did n't immediately know exactly what it was and just tell him .

The fact that the increasingly social Internet allows " the conversation " to spread across comments , Twitter posts , and news aggregators is both a blessing and a curse .
On one hand , it is a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy and discuss content with a community in just about any way you can imagine .
Publishers and enthusiasts , however , are still scrambling to keep up with and follow what others are saying about their content across all these services .
uberVU , a new service in private beta , may finally be what we have all been looking for , so Ars sat down to track some conversations and have one of our own with cofounder Vladimir OANE .
UberVU 's concept is simple : give it a URL for a story you like ( or one you have published ) , and it will chomp through a broad selection of services like Twitter , Digg , Flickr , FriendFeed , and WordPress to find what people are saying about the story .
UberVU follows through most URL - shortening services to make sure it is tracking the right comments , and you can label and sort the stories that you follow .
In short , UberVU is a bit like an RSS reader , except in the inverse : instead of tracking multiple news stories from a single source ( or searching them ) , it tracks what the rest of the world is saying about a particular story .
As uberVU finds new comments , they are marked separately from the total number of comments beside each story 's headline .
Clicking the new comment badge displays just those comments , and all comments are listed in chronological order , along with the user 's avatar and the service 's badge to help identify which service the comment was left on .
You can even reply to comments on a handful of services right from uberVU , including Twitter , Flickr , YouTube , blogger , and Picasa , though this requires handing over relevant credentials for some services ( Twitter can get around to implementing OAuth any day now ) .
This turns uberVU into not just a window into the conversation , but a tool for participating it .
Replying to a Twitter users from within uberVU
UberVU is a Romanian company with three founders who , after winning a Seedcamp startup event and some venture funding , moved operations to London .
OANE 's team is using Amazon 's storage services to help scale , building in Python and Django .
While the company just launched and is not yet bringing in revenue , it is exploring a number of plans to do so , including tiered accounts for power users and journalists , as well as charging publishers and businesses for API access .
That 's right , there is an API for for harnessing uberVU 's stream of comments or embedding them in your site or blog .
Despite uberVU 's impressive approach to rounding up all these fragmented conversations , it is still an early beta .
OANE says that , while his company can track obfuscated URLs from most of the URL - shortening services , some use " strange formulas " that allow for things like multiple hashes for a single URL .
The site also features some impressive UI tools and even a bookmarklet for easily adding stories to track , but there are still plenty of conversations that uberVU cannot track due to its dependency on specific platform support .
For example , uberVU can show us comments that users post to Digg about our stories , but it cannot show us comments from our own forums because we use Groupee , a less popular platform .
Platform APIs create a conundrum for OANE 's company — while they provide rich access for collecting comments that probably cannot be done ( at least easily ) any other way , they also create blind spots for uberVU 's eyes .
It is also sometimes difficult to get back to the source of a comment , though this will undoubtedly improve with time .
Some posts , such as those from Twitter and the Disqus hosted comment system , offer links to view the original , but comments on Digg and FriendFeed do not .
Perhaps a more significant drawback to uberVU is the inability to filter comments and services , or sort by relevance or clout .
There is no way to turn off Digg comments or Twitter posts ; you simply enter your URL and uberVU returns everything it finds .
You also cannot sort Twitter posts to see what the most popular ( or , perhaps more accurately , " most followed " ) users are saying about your stories .
Viewing the entire conversation around your stuff is useful , but filtering to see what influencers are saying would be killer .
Beta gripes aside , uberVU is still an ambitious service that launched with a solid set of very unique conversation tracking features .
Even in this early ( private beta ) stage , uberVU lends itself to everything from customer service to interactive journalism .
As the company grows , look for more service compatibility and filtering options for making more use out of all these conversations .
Walker 's botnet skimmed millions from private bank accounts A top New Zealand telecommunications company has hired a teenager who admitted to taking part in an international cyber - crime network .
TelstraClear said former hacker Owen Thor Walker was advising corporate customers on internet crime .
Mr Walker had been at the centre of a criminal network that infiltrated more than a million computers globally .
He was investigated by the authorities in the US , Europe and New Zealand while he was just 16 and still at school .
As well as taking part in an advertising campaign , Mr Walker had delivered a series of seminars to help senior executives and customers understand the security threats to their networks , said TelstraClear spokesman Chris Mirams .
" It was really just ... to let them know the type of cyber threats that are out there , developing , " said Mr Mirams , according to the Associated Press news agency .
Bank details
Last year Mr Walker pleaded guilty to six cyber crime charges and being a key member of the gang , which is said to have stolen at least $ 20.4 m ( £ 13.9 m ) from private bank accounts .
He had not taken money from people 's accounts , but he was paid nearly $ 31,000 ( £ 21,100 ) for software he designed that gave the cyber-ring access usernames , passwords and credit card details .
He was ordered to pay $ 10,000 damages but was discharged without a conviction after the court heard he suffered from a form of autism .
New Zealand police said Mr Walker had begun committing the crimes at school , and had designed an encrypted virus that was undetectable by anti-virus software .
He had been detained in the North Island city of Hamilton in 2007 as part of an investigation with US and Dutch police into global networks of hijacked PCs , known as botnets .
A botnet can be controlled over the internet by a single computer .
It installs malicious software on PCs to collect information such as login names , bank account details and credit card numbers .
Investigators called Mr Walker 's program one of the " most advanced " they had seen .
TelstraClear , New Zealand 's second largest telecommunications company , is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian firm , Telstra .

Students have been handed another excuse to skip class from an unusual quarter .
New psychological research suggests that university students who download a podcast lecture achieve substantially higher exam results than those who attend the lecture in person .
Podcasted lectures offer students the chance to replay difficult parts of a lecture and therefore take better notes , says Dani McKinney , a psychologist at the State University of New York in Fredonia , who led the study .
“ It is n’t so much that you have a podcast , it ’s what you do with it , ” she says .

Skipping class
Launched less than two years ago , Apple ’s iTunes university offers college lectures on everything from Proust to particle physics to students and the public .
Some universities make their lectures available to all , while others restrict access to enrolled students .
Some professors even limit downloads to encourage class attendance , McKinney says .
To find out how much students really can learn from podcast lectures alone – mimicking a missed class – McKinney ’s team presented 64 students with a single lecture on visual perception , from an introductory psychology course .
Half of the students attended the class in person and received a printout of the slides from the lecture .
The other 32 downloaded a podcast that included audio from the same lecture synchronised with video of the slides .
These students also received a printed handout of the material .
The researchers told the students they would be tested on the material in a week , and they also asked students to hold onto their class notes .
Clear results
Students who downloaded the podcast averaged a C ( 71 out of 100 ) on the test – substantially better than those who attended the lecture , who on average mustered only a D ( 62 ) .
But that difference vanished among students who watched the podcast but did not take notes .
Students who listened to the podcast one or more times and took notes had an average score of 77 , McKinney says .
Motivation might have been an issue , as the experiment did not count for class credit , though the highest scorer in each group earned a $ 15 iTunes gift certificate .
McKinney want to now test how podcasts affect learning across an entire semester , rather than from just a single lecture .
Students might find them more useful early on in a class , when the material is still new , she says .
Though her team ’s paper is subtitled “ Can podcasts replace Professors , ” McKinney thinks these technologies can buttress traditional lectures , particularly for a generation that has grown up with the Internet .
“ I do think it ’s a tool .
I think that these kids are programmed differently than kids 20 years ago , ” she says .
Darren Griffin , a geneticist and education researcher at the University of Kent in Canterbury , UK , says podcast lectures are good for lecturers too .
They free him up to spend precious class time interacting with his students , rather than just talking at them .
To further coax them into the classroom , he gives his students brief quizzes before each class .
“ I get 98 % attendance that way , ” he says .

Dan Gillmor is a BoingBoing guest - blogger .
This is Obama 's air - traffic controllers opportunity .
In 1981 , not long after taking office , President Reagan faced a strike by the nation 's air - traffic controllers .
He fired them , broke the union and set in motion a generation of anti-labor policies that were a tenet of Republican orthodoxy .
Whether those policies were ultimately more positive or negative is still a topic of political and economic debate , ( I think the aggregate outcome was damaging ) but Reagan 's decisive action made a huge difference that reverberated through his presidency and several more .
Today , we face corporate arrogance that is almost transcendent and vastly more damaging than any of organized labor 's excesses .
Wall Street 's barons , and the people who have been running and allegedly governing many of the nation 's biggest companies , have raised a collective middle finger to America even as they 've forced us to bail out the enterprises they 've run into the ground .
When commentators fret about corporate leaders ' tone - deafness , they are implying that the executives simply do n't get it .
Oh yes they do .
In coming to Washington for bailouts , they said : " This is a stick - up .
Give us the money or we 'll kill the economy . "
In creating their disgusting compensation schemes , they said : " Pay us as usual , not for performance but because this is our just due as masters of the universe .
And because we deserve anything we can loot from whoever has the money , whether it 's shareholders , customers , taxpayers or anyone else . "
The puzzle of the past week is not that Americans are furious .
Only an idiot ( or a Wall Street banker ) would n't be angry upon learning of the unconscionable " bonuses " renegade ward - of - the - taxpayers AIG wants to pay to its employees — including well over $ 100 million to people in the same unit that completely screwed the company and then threatened to take down the entire global economy if we refused to subsidize ( so far ) to the tune of $ 170 billiion .
No , the mystery is why this outrage has n't come to the surface sooner .
And why it 's not more dangerous .
Why , for example , did n't Americans take to the streets earlier this year when we found out that Merrill Lynch and its conniving buyer , Bank of America , had paid almost $ 5 billion in bonuses — a number that makes the AIG bonus money seem small — after taking tens of billions from taxpayers ?
Why did n't we scream bloody murder when the Bush administration flatly refused to disclose where the hundreds of billions in bailout money was going in any kind of detail ?
One reason , perhaps , is that we are a soft and lazy and uncurious people .
We are quick to being pissed off at relatively small things — typically minor but sensationalized stuff that tabloid TV news programs ( i.e. CNN , MSNBC and Fox and local stations ) decide to make into issues — but slow to grasp the significance of the really big and crucial stuff until it 's so powerfully in our faces that we can't avoid it any longer .
AIG 's bonus payout tipped the scales , or , maybe more accurately , removed another kind of scales from people 's eyes .
It demonstrated precisely what suckers the Wall Streeters have been taking us for .
How can we blame them for deciding that they were entitled to loot us , again and again ?
We were electing politicians of both parties who have been corrupted by and enablers of the very system that created the credit bubble and its catastrophic outcome .
We were n't demanding accountability from anyone , including ourselves .
But now it 's time .
The American public is not blameless in what 's happened .
But we are finally waking up to the level of arrogance that dominates wide swaths of corporate America , particularly Wall Street .
These transcendently greedy people , who are n't just indifferent to what the rest of us think but who actually believe they 're entitled to loot the treasury and our children 's futures , need a slapping down .
President Obama has a chance to turn this in a positive direction , but he 's going to have to risk a lot of his political capital .
He 's going to have to admit that he , too , has been player in the corrupt system , albeit a relatively bit player .
Then he has to say , and mean it , that this crap is going to stop , right now — and explain how he 's going to do something about it .
We have a chance to reform the corrupt political and corporate governance that has created a system in which the people at the top brazenly tell the rest of us to go screw ourselves .
It 's a small chance , but if we do n't do it now we will never do it , and the market economy itself will have no real future .
One institution can most effectively lead the charge in a way that can create change that does n't turn into a mob - driven frenzy : the presidency .
Is this president up to it ?
The World Water Forum ( WWF ) held in Istanbul last week has turned out to be a more highly contentious event than anticipated by many .
Â
The forum got off to a rough start when Turkish police fired tear gas and detained activists who protested against the privatization of water , the most charged and controversial issue surrounding the triennial event and for water activists worldwide .
Protesters were heard shouting slogans including â€œwater for life , not for profit.â€ 
According to Democracy Now , two activists from the non-governmental organization International Rivers were deported after holding up a banner reading â€ œNo Risky Damsâ€ just prior to the conference ’s commencement .
This video , which we first discovered courtesy of the Sacred Water Project , shows the activists protesting and the Turkish police making arrests .
Representatives of the People ’s Water Forum ( PWF ) are shocked at how the World Water Council ( the organizers of WWF ) and the members of the forum itself , has turned a blind eye to the actions of the police , and a deaf ear to protests .
Â
When asked about the apparent indifference towards outside goings - on at the conference , Maude Barlow , the senior adviser on water issues to the United Nations General Assembly , said “ They ’ve just accepted it and enjoyed it and taken advantage of the tough security measures here . ”
Why is this happening ?
PWF holds that WWF ’s ultimate agenda is less about addressing the critical issues related to water and more about promoting water privatization .
Says Barlow ,
“ For several years , the World Water Council has used this forum to create the illusion of global consensus around risky privatization schemes .
But privatizing water systems is not an effective means of delivering this essential resource to the 6.7 billion people who rely on it to live .
Water is a public trust and a human right .
It is not a commodity , nor should its value be determined by corporate interests.â€ 
Wenonah Hauter of Food and Water Watch points to extremely high costs for water in twenty U.S. states thanks toÂ profit - oriented private companies who now control the utility .
“ Privatization is not more efficient , and there are dozens and dozens of studies from around the world , the developed world and the Global South that prove this .
It ’s more expensive .
It causes more environmental problems .
And the incentive is to not conserve water , but to use as much water as possible and to spend as much money as possible in building and fixing infrastructure , ” says Hauter .
Our own Jennifer Lance also pointed out in her article last week covering the WWF that the World Water Council is dominated by two of the worldâ€™s largest private water corporations , Suez and Veolia .
Both have promoted policies of Public - Private Partnerships ( PPPâ€™s ) that put water services under private ownership , usually resulting in price hikes and decreased pollution control .
FRANKFURT  Adolf Merckle , the German billionaire whose speculation in volatile Volkswagen stock had pushed his sprawling business empire to the edge of ruin , has committed suicide , his family said Tuesday .
Mr. Merckle , 74 , was found dead on railroad tracks near his villa in the southern German hamlet of Blaubeuren on Monday evening .
German authorities in the nearby city of Ulm confirmed the death and said there was no sign anyone else was involved .
“ The distress to his firms caused by the financial crisis and the related uncertainties of recent weeks , along with the helplessness of no longer being able to handle the situation , broke the passionate family businessman , and he ended his life , ” the family said in a statement .
The police said a suicide note had been found ; its contents were not publicly released .
More than any other single investment , Mr. Merckle ’s poorly timed bet on Volkswagen shares caused the financial distress that led to his death .
Living in LA
I ’ve grown pretty desensitized to seeing weird crap while driving , but I ’ve become hypnotized by an insane roving roadside vendor in Hollywood who sells not fruit nor rugs nor jewelry nor CD ’s , but …
Tigers .
Stuffed tigers .
Some small , some gigantic .
But just tigers .
On the street .
Perhaps you ’ve seen the stand yourself .
Perhaps it has already bedeviled your dreams too .
It raises so many damn questions .
Namely …
Why ?
Why tigers ?
Why only tigers ?
Why on the street ?
Where did they come from ?
Did they find an abandoned truck full of them ?
Do they ever sell any ?
I had to have answers to these questions .
So the last time I spotted the stand – on the corner of Highland and Melrose – I finally stopped my car .
And what did I learn ?
Well , for one - it ’s called LA Tigers , and upon closer inspection they do n’t only sell tigers .
They also had two lions , a cheetah and a handful of those ridiculous paintings of waterfalls and ocean views that you plug into the wall and they ’ll light up and make sounds .
They had one of The Last Supper , which I was very excited about ( what sort of sounds would that make ? ) , but the dude I talked to said it did n’t move or make sounds cause that would be “ weird . ”
Keep in mind he said that standing in front of 40 stuffed tigers set up outside a Mobil station .
As for the tigers themselves : they ’re imported from China , and supposedly have light - up eyes and roar .
None had batteries , so who knows if that ’s true .
Oh , and the largest ones can purportedly hold 400 lbs on their back !
As to why tigers - that question got me a dirty look .
As did whether or not he ever sold any .
“ Everyday ” was the answer I got .
I also learned that there are two such “ shops , ” which helps explain its creepy ever - presence in Hollywood .
The dude directed me their website ( latigers.com ) which did n’t seem to exist when I went on - line later .
I ’m still left with questions .
Why tigers ?!
Why not monkeys or puppies or bears ?
Is the whole thing a front for something else ?
Once they ’ve sold all the tigers will they activate them and wreak terrible horrors upon Los Angeles ?
Be afraid .
A vision of the future ...
Quotes from the 2002 report from the
Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs " Cannabis : Our Position for a Canadian Public Policy " " Scientific evidence overwhelmingly indicates that cannabis is substantially less harmful than alcohol and should be treated not as a criminal issue but as a social and public health issue . "
- Senator Pierre Claude Nolin , chair of Canada 's Senate Committee reviewing marijuana laws " Legalization would prove beneficial , not only for users , but also for the federal and provincial governments because of the considerable revenue they might well derive from the sales taxes on such a popular product . "
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use " We know our proposals are provocative , that they will meet with resistance .
However , we are also convinced that Canadian society has the maturity and openness to welcome an informed debate . "
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use " Clearly , current approaches are ineffective and inefficient .
Ultimately , their effect amounts to throwing taxpayers ' money down the drain in a crusade that is not warranted by the danger posed by the substance .
It has been maintained that drugs , including cannabis , are not dangerous because they are illegal but rather are illegal because they are dangerous .
This is perhaps true of other types of drugs , but not of cannabis . "
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use " In short , it is remarkable that , over seventy - five years later , we should still not know why cannabis was placed on the list of prohibited drugs . "
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use Here 's what Senator Tommy Banks had to say about MJ laws : " There has never , in history , been a good reason presented for marijuana being illegal , " said Senator Banks .
" It 's fundamentally important for people to understand that it 's never been based on the facts .
It 's non -toxic , it 's not addictive and has no provable , long - term irreversible effects . "
Senator Tommy Banks , chair of Canada 's Senate Committee reviewing marijuana laws " We estimate the cost of enforcing cannabis drug laws to be closer to $ 1 - 1.5 billion per annum .
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use
The costs of externalities attributable to cannabis are probably minimal ; no deaths , few hospitalizations , and very little loss of productivity . "
- Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drug Use " Cannabis is widely used in every part of the world , does not have the harmful effects ascribed to it , and poses little risk to public health . "

A 32 - year - old man has survived with minor injuries after being hit by a flat - bed truck that was rammed by a train in Turkey .
CCTV footage shows Cem Tokac disappear under the wheels of the truck as it collides with the train .
Mr Tokac has said he remembers nothing of the incident and that life is ' beautiful ' .
Jon Brain reports .
The Professor would be proud of David Butcher of San Jose , California .
He built his first pedal generator prototype in 1976 .
Every morning , he spends 45 minutes on the stationary bicycle generator to charge up a bank of salvaged batteries .
Having mastered the machine , Butcher now sells plans so you can build your own .
The cost of the parts is around $ 230 , he says , or much less if you recycle an old bike .
If you 're interested in learning more , Butcher hangs out in a videochat room when he 's pedaling away every morning .
Apparently , he cranks out 1.8 kilowatt - hours a month .
Of course , er , YMMV .
Butcher has videos demonstrating the generator directly powering a blender ( video above ) , washing machine , and breadmaker .
His bike blender was even featured on a recent episode of MAKE : TV .
From Butcher 's site :
My pedal generator is in the garage , hooked up through the Trace C12 controller in my Micro Solar Energy System to a recycled battery pack from my Sparrow Electric Car .
I work out in the early morning , and it 's dark .
It would be pointless to use as much energy to light the workout area as I generated with the workout , so I light the area with the 12 volt LED Bar Light I put together several years ago .
It uses white LED 's to light the workout area .
They require almost no power , so virtually everything I generate ends up in the batteries .
The San Francisco Chronicle profiled Butcher last year .
Butcher digs alternative power tech in general , having installed solar panels on his roof and X10 modules throughout his house for intelligent control of appliances and other devices .
From the SF Chronicle :
Butcher , who lives alone after a divorce , traces his environmental leanings to the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill , which marred miles of coastline with 200,000 gallons of crude oil .
Butcher was 14 at the time and witnessed it firsthand .
He built his first pedal generator when he was in his early 20s .
" I was always interested in alternative energy and solar in particular , " he says .
" I was living in Portland , Ore. , where solar is not as much of an option .
So I thought , ' What else could I do ? '
" I 'd been on a swim team for years and I was in pretty good shape , and I thought there must be a way to get some power going . "
Butcher 's prototype bicycle was chain - driven and featured a welded steel frame .
Today 's version , with its simplified drivetrain and bolted frame , can be assembled with basic hand tools .
When he took up his pedaling regimen two years ago , Butcher tipped the scales at 180 pounds .
Today , at age 53 , he weighs a lean 150 and possesses a pair of legs that would n't look out of place on the Olympic cycling squad .
Butcher 's pedaling has become so efficient that he has pretty much abandoned his car ( electric , incidentally ) in favor of bicycling , reducing his carbon footprint still further .

A few days ago I wrote a piece criticising the arguments of author Maggie Jackson on the effects of digital technology and concentration .
The piece garnered some fantastic reader comments , including a thoughtful response from Jackson herself , which I ’ve reproduced below :
In my interview with Wired and my book Distracted , I do n’t argue that we need to venerate unbending concentration and single - tasking .
In fact , that ’s a monochromatic Industrial Age vision of attention that I reject !
In cultures where work and productivity are now information - based , we do need to hone skills related to multitasking and split - focus , skimming and non-linear reasoning .
But in the US and other tech - centric societies today , we ’ve become so reliant on this narrow band of skills that we ’ve begun to undermine our ability to go deeply in thought and relations .
We ’re fragmenting and diffusing our multifaceted attentional abilities – and this is not by any means “ progress . ”
As for cooking and babies , I ’d agree that at any time in history , the environment makes demands on our attention .
Attention is in essence how we interact with our environment !
But attention is also central to the pursuit of goals , to planning , judgment , vision .
The point is , are we using our powers of attention well by cultivating environments of interruption , fragmentation , and skimming , and by losing time / space for reflection , disciplined problem - solving , deep reading ?
In short , the “ concentration oasis ” is a myth I do n’t subscribe to .
And yet it ’s truly short - sighted to fail to consider the costs of cultivating a culture of distraction and inattention .

Opposing Viewpoints On Open Source In Government
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 24 , 2009
Whether you think that open source is gaining traction in the U.S. government or losing its foothold depends on which Web site post you read first today .
ZDnet 's Dana Blankenhorn makes a great case for why the recently formalized arrangement between the Open Source Software Institute ( OSSI ) and the Department of Defense is a huge deal for the advancement of open source at the government level .
However , Tod Newcombe , editor of GoV-log : Editor 's Video Blog , says government IT executives ' enthusiasm over open source is waning .
Who 's right ?
Well , both .
Blankenhorn had a email chat with the executive director of OSSI , John Weathersby , who explained what the DoD 's interest in open source means in the long - term .
He says it demonstrates the government 's ongoing commitment to consider open source options during the decision - making process , and may perhaps even find its way into discussions about the use of open source in President Obama 's national health care initiatives .
Blankenhorn writes ,
" The most important point is that the military approached [ Weathersby ] .
Project leader Dick Nelson wanted a full open source strategy , and eventually noted lawyer Larry Rosen was even brought in to work with government legal counsel .
This was not slapped together . "
Evidently , the government is ready to be pro-active when it comes to open source .
Or , maybe not .
Newcombe points to a survey published in the latest issue of Public CIO that indicates government IT executives rank open source low on their list of technology priorities for 2009 .
He says execs are troubled by the costs associated with training and integration , and the general unwillingness of vendors to work with open source .
Newcombe wo n't go so far as to say open source is completely DOA .
" Despite the problems , open source appears to be embedded in many IT systems , especially at the state and federal level ( though some local governments have embraced it wholeheartedly ) .
What you do n't hear is a lot of talk about these open source projects .
For the most part , they seem to be flying under the radar . "
Is open source technology an acceptable option in government that has n't filtered down to the rank and file yet , or do the people closer to the front lines have a more realistic perspective of its usefulness ?
Of course , it will be years before we see how the issue plays out , but it 's interesting to ponder in the meantime .
General Motors has released the viability plan it expects to win more bailout loans from Congress - - another $ 16.6 billion , to keep it operating until it can begin repaying the loans in 2012 .
Like the earlier filing by Chrysler , GM 's plan involves trimming down in the number of models it sells , and betting heavily on electrified vehicles like the 2011 Chevrolet Volt .
Unlike Chrysler 's plan , though , GM 's sketches include the sale , spin - off , or shuttering of three brands : Saab , Saturn and HUMMER .
Saab is the most likely to survive the cuts .
That 's only because the Swedish government is negotiating with GM to inject $ 3 billion into the automaker , recenter production of Saabs in Sweden , and relieve GM of all responsibilities to market and engineer cars for the brand .
In short , it 's spinning off the brand to the Swedish government .
If that plan fails , Saab could be shut down .
A less happy future is likely for HUMMER .
If a sale to any one of several interested companies -- late speculation has a Chinese car company taking control by March 31 -- the brand will be shut down .
Saturn will be closed in 2011 , unless a buyer can be found for its assets .
The brand was launched in 1990 but has never turned a profit -- and GM is content to keep selling the current lineup through 2011 and then to end sales , negotiating an out clause with several hundred Saturn dealers in the process .
GM says it will press ahead with new vehicles for its core brands -- Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC .
Pontiac will continue as a niche nameplate under the Buick - GMC brand .
The planned launches include the 2011 Chevrolet Volt , the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze , the 2010 Chevrolet Equinox , the 2010 Buick LaCrosse , and 2010 Cadillac SRX .
Hidden deeper in the document available at the GM Web site is the slowdown in introductions of new product -- by the time GM begins to repay its taxpayer loans , it will be introducing 5 new vehicles a year .
And trucks will be the least loved - on vehicles in its lineup -- the company says it will focus new vehicle development primarily on cars and crossovers .
The release follows ; see the full PDF at the GM Web site .

WASHINGTON - General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) today presented the United States Department of Treasury with an updated plan that boldly responds to the weaker global auto market conditions and details the company 's long term viability .
The plan , which provides a comprehensive review of key aspects of GM 's restructuring , is the first of two status reports required by the loan agreement signed by GM and the U.S. Treasury on Dec. 31 , 2008 .
The plan submitted today addresses the key restructuring targets required by the loan agreement , including a number of the critical elements of the turnaround plan that was submitted to the U.S. government on Dec. 2 , 2008 .
Among these are : U.S. market competitiveness ; fuel economy and emissions ; competitive labor cost ; and restructuring of the company 's unsecured debt .
It also includes a timeline for repayment of the Federal loans , and an analysis of the company 's positive net present value ( NPV ) .
The plan also details the future reduction of GM 's vehicle brands and nameplates in the U.S. , further consolidation in its workforce and dealer network , accelerated capacity actions and enhanced manufacturing competitiveness , while maintaining GM 's strong commitment to high - quality , fuel - efficient vehicles and advanced propulsion technologies .
GM 's viability plan actions result in a projected GM North America ( GMNA ) earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) breakeven point of 11.5 - 12.0 million units in the U.S. , compared to the 12.5 - 13.0 million unit range indicated in the Dec. 2 , 2008 plan .
The operating and balance sheet improvements outlined in GM 's viability plan are forecasted to result in a significant enterprise value and positive net present value , positive adjusted EBIT in 2010 and positive operating cash flow for its North American operations in the same year .
Overall adjusted operating cash flows are expected to approach breakeven levels in 2011 , and improve to more than $ 6 billion in the 2012 - 2014 period , reflecting both the full effect of GM 's global restructuring initiatives and recovering industry volumes .
GM 's need for government support was driven by the global financial market crisis , dramatically weaker economy and the resulting precipitous decline in vehicle demand .
These conditions have impacted the entire auto industry , which in the U.S. is down approximately 40 percent from its peak in 2005 , to the lowest per capita sales rate in 50 years .
Though the impact has been most severe in the U.S. and Western Europe , automakers around the world are reporting large losses , with many seeking government assistance to weather the downturn .
Following the steep decline in U.S. industry sales in December 2008 and January 2009 , GM responded by further lowering its forecast for 2009 U.S. industry sales to 10.5 million units ( 57.5 million units globally ) for viability planning purposes .
These industry planning volumes are more conservative than those being used by most other industry sources .
" The U.S. and global auto industries are facing times of unprecedented challenge , " said GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner .
" These conditions dictate that we must take very tough actions to accelerate GM 's restructuring efforts .
We 've made a lot of progress since the plan we submitted on December 2 , 2008 , and we have more to do before March 31 .
The plan we delivered today to the U.S. Treasury is aggressive but achievable .
It provides a clear pathway for GM that continues to support American manufacturing and technology innovation , which are vital to the future of our nation 's economy . "
Since the original plan submission on Dec. 2 , 2008 , GM has made significant progress in a number of areas , including the following :
Dealers and Brands
Evaluating Hummer sale options
Completed strategic review of global Saab business and sought buyers for the business
Saturn review complete ; sale or spin - off possible ; if not , phase out the brand at the end of current product lifecycle
Further reduction in model nameplates
Accelerated consolidation of GM 's dealer network
Cost Competitiveness
Further reduction in U.S. manufacturing capacity beyond Dec. 2 targets
Significant progress with the UAW to address labor cost competitiveness
Special hourly attrition program , salaried employment reductions
Canada restructuring discussions advancing
Engaged with European labor partners to achieve $ 1.2 billion in cost reductions
Balance Sheet
Term sheets exchanged with UAW and bondholder committee advisors
Initiated bond exchange negotiations with bondholder committee advisors
UAW and bondholder committee advisors conducting extensive due diligence
Building on progress GM has already made , the company is taking a number of additional actions to reduce costs , streamline its business and improve its competitive position .
Marketing and Revenue Improvement
In the U.S. , GM will focus on its core brands ; Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC .
Pontiac will serve as a focused brand with fewer entries , within the Buick - Pontiac - GMC channel .
GM will have a total of 36 nameplates in 2012 , down 25 percent from 2008 levels .
The plan also provides additional detail on the Hummer , Saturn and Saab brands .
GM expects to make a decision to sell or phase out the Hummer brand by Mar. 31 , with a final resolution expected no later than 2010 .
GM has conducted a strategic review of the global Saab business and has offered it for sale .
Given the urgency of stemming sizeable cash demands associated with Saab operations , GM is requesting Swedish government support prior to any sale .
The company has developed a specific proposal that would have the effect of capping GM 's financial support , with Saab 's operations effectively becoming an independent business entity Jan. 1 , 2010 .
While GM hopes to reach agreement with the Swedish government , the Saab Automobile AB subsidiary could file for reorganization as early as this month .
Saturn will remain in operation for the next several years , through the end of the planned lifecycle for all Saturn products .
In the interim , if Saturn retailers or other investors present a plan that would allow a spin - off or sale of Saturn Distribution Corporation , GM would be open to any such possibility .
If a spin - off or sale does not occur , GM plans to phase out the Saturn brand at the end of the current product lifecycle .
GM 's dealer count is also projected to be further reduced , from 6,246 in 2008 to 4,700 by 2012 , and to 4,100 by 2014 .
Most of this reduction will take place in metro and suburban markets where dealership overcapacity is most prevalent .
The result will be a smaller , but healthier GM dealer network .
Technology / Regulation Compliance
As indicated in the Dec. 2 , 2008 plan , GM is moving ahead aggressively with plans to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicles and develop a broad range of advanced propulsion technologies .
The company is investing significantly in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies in the 2009 - 2012 timeframe , supporting the expansion of GM 's hybrid offerings and development of the Chevrolet Volt 's extended - range electric vehicle technology .
For example , GM in January announced construction of a new U.S. manufacturing facility to build lithium - ion battery packs for the Volt .
Lithium-ion batteries are an essential technology for advanced hybrids and electrically driven vehicles , and an important energy storage technology for other applications .
GM has also committed to increasing its number of hybrid models to 14 by 2012 , and to making more than 60 percent of its fleet alternative - fuel capable .
The investments in this restructuring plan will allow GM to become a long - term global leader in the development of fuel efficient and advanced technology vehicles .
In doing so , the company will contribute to the development of this country 's advanced manufacturing capabilities and support the growth of " green " industries in the U.S .
Cost Reduction and Operational Actions
In order to improve capacity utilization and cost competitiveness , GM has consolidated its manufacturing footprint considerably by closing 12 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. between 2000 and 2008 .
Given the current very difficult market conditions , GM will close an additional 14 facilities by 2012 , five more than were included in the Dec. 2 , 2008 plan .
Agreements with the UAW concerning several items have been completed and are now being implemented .
First , a special attrition program has been negotiated to assist restructuring efforts by reducing excess employment costs through voluntary attrition of the current hourly workforce .
Second , the UAW and GM 's management have suspended the JOBS program .
The program provided full income and benefit protection in lieu of layoff for an indefinite period of time .
In addition , GM and the UAW have reached a tentative agreement relative to additional wage and benefit changes .
GM 's management estimates that these competitive improvements will further substantially reduce GM 's labor costs and represent a major move to close the competitive gap with U.S. transplant competitors .
In addition , GM and the UAW have agreed to improve competitive work rules , which will also significantly reduce labor costs .
While these changes materially improve GM 's competitiveness and help the company realize a substantial portion of the labor cost savings targeted in the financial projections , further progress will be required to achieve the full targeted savings .
GM plans to report these changes to the U.S. Secretary of Labor , who must certify GM 's competitiveness relative to the U.S. transplants .
Outside of the U.S. , GM has accelerated restructuring plans for its Canadian , European and Asia - Pacific operations , all of which will be funded from sources outside the U.S .
Canada - Discussions are well advanced with the Canadian Federal and Ontario governments regarding long - term financial assistance to execute the restructuring actions necessary for long - term viability and with the Canadian Auto Workers ( CAW ) union on achieving competitive labor costs .
The CAW has committed to achieving an hourly cost structure that is consistent with what is ultimately negotiated with the UAW .
Progress has also been made with the Canadian Federal and Ontario governments toward an agreement focused on maintaining proportional levels of manufacturing in Canada and on providing GMCL with a level of long - term financial assistance that is proportional to the total support provided to GM by the U.S. government .
GMCL is continuing dialogue with its unions and the Canadian government with a target to finalize both agreements in March 2009 .
GM remains optimistic both agreements can be completed by that time , which would enable GMCL to achieve long - term viability and enhance the value of GM .
In the event that an agreement cannot be reached , GM will be required to reevaluate its future strategy for GMCL since it would not be viable on a standalone basis .
Europe - Europe is a highly competitive environment that is unprofitable for many vehicle manufacturers , and has a relatively costly restructuring environment .
GM has engaged its European labor partners to achieve $ 1.2 billion in cost reductions , which include several possible closures or spinoffs of manufacturing facilities in high cost locations .
In addition , GM is restructuring its sales organization to become more brand focused and better optimize its advertising .
GM is also in discussions with the German government for operating and balance sheet support .
A sustainable strategy for GM's European operations may include support from partnerships with the German government and / or other European governments .
The company expects to resolve solvency issues for its European operations prior to Mar. 31 , 2009 .
Asia -Pacific -
In light of current market conditions , GM is reconsidering the pace of its expansion in the Asia Pacific region .
As such , some of the proposed capacity expansion projects and product programs in the region are no longer financially feasible and will not proceed without financial support from either the respective governments or from other partners .
GM is holding discussions with its stakeholders to address the required support .
Capitalization
As outlined in the GM viability plan , approximately $ 27 billion in unsecured public liabilities currently on the company 's balance sheet will be converted to a combination of new debt and equity , for a net debt reduction of at least $ 18 billion .
Negotiations are progressing with advisors of the ad hoc bondholder committee .
Term sheets have been exchanged and due diligence regarding GM 's restructuring has commenced .
The company anticipates that the bond exchange offer will commence in late March , consistent with requirements in the U.S. Treasury loan documents .
Under the term sheet proposal , a substantial majority of the pro-forma equity in GM would be distributed to exchanging bondholders and the UAW VEBA .
Discussions with representatives of the UAW VEBA have also been progressing , and due diligence is also proceeding with respect to reaching agreement to convert at least half of future VEBA payments to equity .
A draft term sheet has been provided to the UAW , and they have indicated their desire to discuss the VEBA situation with government officials prior to signing any such term sheet .
Closing of the conversion of VEBA obligations and unsecured debt to equity should be complete in May of this year .
Government Funding
To complete its aggressive restructuring and fund its ongoing operations amid an uncertain economic environment , GM is requesting the U.S. government to consider funding the company with a combination of secured term loans , revolving credit , and preferred equity .
In the Dec. 2 submission , GM indicated that under a U.S. downside volume scenario , the company would need funding support of approximately $ 18 billion .
In addition , GM assumed that the $ 4.5 billion U.S. secured revolver credit facility would be renewed when it matures in 2011 .
In the current baseline forecast , near - term industry volumes are similar to the December 2 downside scenario , and so GM 's forecast indicates the company will need the $ 18 billion that was requested in December .
In addition , based on current credit market conditions , it cannot be assumed that the company will be able to rollover the $ 4.5 billion revolver in 2011 .
Therefore , GM is requesting federal funding support of $ 22.5 billion under its current baseline industry volume scenario .
If the U.S. industry deteriorates further , a scenario depicted in the company 's new , lower downside volume scenario with U.S. industry volume of 9.5 million units in 2009 and 11.5 million units in 2010 , GM would require further federal funding , estimated currently at an additional $ 7.5 billion , which could bring total Government support up to $ 30 billion by 2011 .
Under the company 's baseline outlook , repayment of federal support is expected to begin in 2012 .
Additional financial support might be required in 2013 and 2014 if GM has to make contributions to our U.S. pension funds .
In an update to the Dec. 2 , 2008 submission , recent valuations indicate that GM's U.S. pension plans are currently under - funded as of Dec. 31 , 2008 .
At this point , it is premature to conclude whether the company will need to make additional pension contributions , as the funded status of the pension plan is subject to many variables , including asset returns and discount rates .
GM is currently analyzing its pension funding strategies .
During 2009 - 2014 , GM also is requesting funding support from the governments of Canada , Germany , the United Kingdom , Sweden , and Thailand , and has included an estimate of $ 6 billion in funding support by 2010 to provide liquidity specifically for GM 's operations in these countries .
Finally , the plan submitted today discusses the issue of bankruptcy as a potential option for restructuring , concluding it would be a highly risky , extremely costly and time - consuming process .
This reaffirms management 's position that bankruptcy is not in the best interests of GM or its stakeholders .
The overriding risks are the significant impact a bankruptcy would have on the company 's revenue stream and the resulting huge debtor - in - possession funding support that would be required from the government , as such funding is not available from traditional sources in today 's market conditions .
Accordingly , accomplishing GM 's restructuring out of court remains by far the best approach for all constituents .
" Our viability plan requires significant sacrifices from all GM stakeholders : management , employees , unions , suppliers , dealers , investors and bondholders , " Wagoner said .
" But these are the kind of actions we need to take to survive the current industry crisis , and position GM for sustainability and success .
This plan , in effect , signifies the reinvention of General Motors for the 21st century .
We are working non -stop to put this plan into action , and we greatly appreciate the support and encouragement we continue to receive as we take these important steps toward viability . "
GM 's leadership team will continue to work with its key stakeholders and the newly formed Presidential Task Force on Autos as it proceeds with its restructuring .
In accordance with the loan agreement , GM will submit its second progress report to the U.S. Treasury on March 31 .
This progress report will be the basis for the Task Force to issue a ' Plan Completion Certificate ' to Congress , which confirms GM 's long - term viability .
For additional details on GM 's restructuring , the complete plan will be posted online at http://media.gm.com.

The Pirate Party has gathered a huge following in Sweden .
More than half of all men under 30 are considering voting for the party in the upcoming European Parliament elections .
However , being affiliated with the party is not without risks - even in a democracy .
For several years the media in Sweden has reported that interest in politics among the youth is decreasing at an alarming rate .
In 2006 , more than 40 % of young Swedes who had been elected for a public seat in the previous elections had quit their assignments .
Jonas Bergling is one of the young politicians who believes in being politically active for the public benefit .
His story , however , may shed some light on why the young voices are effectively silenced in the daily grind of politics .
Last Monday , Jonas Bergling took part in a chat session with the local newspaper Nerikes Allehanda ( NA ) in the city of Örebro , Sweden .
He was there in his spare - time position as head of the constituency for the Pirate Party in Örebro .
Readers of the newspaper were invited to ask him questions regarding topics such as anti-piracy efforts , the Pirate Bay trial and the politics of the Pirate Party .
Since Sweden ’s Pirate Party is running for seats in the upcoming elections for the European Parliament , there was a lot of interest in what he had to say .
For Bergling , maybe it turned out to be too much interest .
When not pursuing his political interests in his spare time , Jonas ’ day job used to be as an IT consultant for EDB Business Partner .
It used to be , because the chat with the newspaper did n’t go unnoticed by the company ’s Chief of Security , who was n’t amused .
Three days later the aspiring politician was fired because of the political opinions he ’d aired in the chat .
“ When I left work on Thursday , I got a call from my boss who told me I could n’t come in on Friday morning and that I had to hand in the keys and security card .
It does n’t feel good to be treated this way .
This is n’t how it should be in a democracy , ” Jonas said to NA .
According to Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge ’s blog , the decision to fire Jonas came from the head office in Stockholm , where the management group made its decision despite protests from Jonas ’ local bosses in Örebro .
“ It came from the highest ranks within EDB and that makes this a dead serious matter , ” writes Falkvinge .
“ To me , it does n’t matter if the harassment stems from someone being a pirate , socialist , capitalist or feminist – to harass someone in this way is completely and fundamentally unacceptable . “
“ I ’ve always been careful not to mix my political views with my work , ” Jonas told NA , and he said his supervisor knew of his involvement with the Pirate Party when he was given the job .
As his employment terms were more like those of a consultant rather than an employee , EDB did not break Swedish work legislation when they canceled his contract , even though the termination was explicitly due to his political views .
This is n’t the first time that someone has lost his job for taking a ‘ pro- piracy ’ stance .
Back in 2005 , Alexander Hanff , the ex-admin of the now defunct DVDR - Core tracker , appeared on the BBC ’s Newsnight show to discuss the Grokster decision .
His computer training company employer gave him the time off to appear on the show – then promptly fired him .
The ISS ( International Space Station ) and the Space Shuttle Discovery currently attached to it were forced March 22 to change orbit to avoid being smacked by 10 - year - old debris from a Chinese satellite launch .
The maneuver was successful but marked the third time in three weeks the ISS has been threatened by orbiting space junk .
Last week , a breakaway piece of a Russian satellite came close enough to the ISS for NASA engineers March 17 to consider moving the space station and recalibrating Discovery 's track to the ISS .
The previous week , a piece of a Russian spacecraft motor came close enough to the ISS that the three - man crew was forced to evacuate to the Soyuz TMA - 13 capsule , which is attached to the space station to transport astronauts back in an emergency .
" Space debris is becoming an ever - increasing challenge .
When it comes to dodging junk , it 's a big deal .
It 's very tiring .
Sometimes it 's exhausting , " said flight director Kwatsi Alibaruho .
NASA 's ongoing problems with increasing space debris raises the obvious question : just how much junk is out there ?
The U.S. - operated SSN ( Space Surveillance Network ) tracks 17,300 artificial objects in space larger than 10 centimeters .
About 800 of those objects are operational satellites .
But the SSN tracks only a fraction of the junk orbiting Earth .
According to the Secure World Foundation , which is meeting in Washington this week to promote space situational awareness , estimates 300,000 total objects are out there , the flotsam of a half - century of space exploration .
The junk includes discarded fuel tanks , screws , blots , paint chips , foil scraps and other objects .
The Secure World Foundation estimates there are also billions of bits and pieces smaller than one centimeter circling the planet , each following its own orbit .
During an eight - year period ending in 2002 , the Hubble Space Telescope 's solar panels were struck 725,000 times with approximately 5,000 of those impacts large enough to be seen by the naked eye .
" All sizes of orbital debris , even down to less than a millimeter , can have a devastating effect on anything they hit because of their high relative impact velocities , " the Secure World Foundation explains on its site .
" While overall levels of space debris are somewhat manageable at this time , we face a looming problem with escalating amounts of debris in the most heavily used orbits .
This scenario will sharply increase the probability of damaging collisions between space debris and operational spacecraft . "
The ISS was designed with shielding to protect against impacts from debris ranging from one millimeter to one centimeter in size .
" A hit in a critical area by larger objects would cause significant and serious damage .
Most space systems do not even have this level of shielding , because of the added weight and launch costs , and thus are highly vulnerable to loss of service from debris impacts , " the Secure World foundation states .
As the quantity of space debris increases within popular obits , the organization predicts a ramp up in space collisions , " creating a cascade effect leading to increasing amounts of threatening debris . "
A NASA study forecasts a 10 - fold increase in the probability of collision with debris over the next 200 years .
" While this forecast is a cause for concern in itself , it is considered an underestimate because for modeling purposes the study 's forecast was based on the assumption that no further launches would be undertaken during this period , " the Secure World Foundation states .
" Since orbital launches are expected to continue , the probability of future collisions with orbiting debris will almost certainly be higher . "
NASA was also consulted before the Chinese government in 2007 successfully launched a missile to destroy a defunct satellite .
Striking the dead satellite at an altitude of 869 kilometers , the explosion created a cloud debris generating more than 150,000 pieces of space junk larger than one centimeter .
There are no existing international agreements banning the deliberate creation of debris but consensus is building in the international scientific community to address the problem of space debris .
" In order to manage international problems that will naturally develop as the space environment surrounding Earth becomes more crowded , we must begin on the creation of space resource management mechanisms to reduce the creation of new debris , " says the Secure World Foundation .
" Our continued ability to maintain a secure and safe space environment depends on it . "
A little late again today .
One of these days I 'll get my act together .
I do n't know how many of you noticed , but the whole site was down " for maintenance " for several hours yesterday .
Sorry for the inconvenience .
I 'm trying to do some things to make the site more efficient .
I guess it was too efficient , though , as you were done as soon as you tried to load it up .
I think everything is back to decent working order but of course let me know if you see any steaming piles of broken links around .
Today was supposed to be a good day .
The sun is shining , it 's Friday , I had an awesome breakfast .
And one bizarre occurance is looming to threaten the entirety of my existence .
Boo -yah .
Not what my stress levels needed .
Well .
At least it 's Friday .
Also , in the comic , I used " whomever " but I 'm not 100 % sure that 's correct .
So feel free to complain .

Alvin Perez , 41 , was suspended for two months without pay after an internal - affairs investigation and then was reinstated to the force , people familiar with the case said .
A criminal complaint stated that on May 28 , 2008 , Perez saw a rabbit close to where he was standing outside the Denver County Jail during his break .
He then got a can of Mace and sprayed the rabbit for no apparent reason in front of other deputies , the police report stated .
Perez pleaded guilty last year to one count of animal cruelty .

Pinochet judge seeks criminal probe of Bush ' torture lawyers '
Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday March 28 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE : A Spanish judge has approved a probe of torture complaints against former Bush officials .
Details below ...
Spanish official says arrest warrants ' highly probable '
Six Bush - era officials responsible for crafting the legal justifications permitting the military prison at Guantanamo Bay are the subject of a Spanish criminal probe which could place the men under serious risk of arrest if they travel outside the United States .
" [ Spanish newspaper ]
Público identifies the targets as University of California law professor John Yoo , former Department of Defense general counsel William J. Haynes II ( now a lawyer working for Chevron ) , former vice presidential chief - of - staff David Addington , former attorney general and White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , now a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , and former Undersecretary of Defense Doug Feith , " noted Scott Horton at Harper's .
He called them Bush 's " torture lawyers . "
On March 17 , Lawrence B. Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , published an editorial in the Washington Note which accused Bush officials of knowingly holding innocent men in Guantanamo Bay for years .
" The case was sent to the prosecutors office for review by Baltasar Garzón , the crusading investigative judge who indicted the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , " reported the New York Times .
" The official said that it was ' highly probable ' that the case would go forward and could lead to arrest warrants . "
If the judge decides to open an investigation , it will be the first such legal action outside the United States , the private Cadena Sur radio said .
The Association for the Dignity of Prisoners , which filed the case , said the six should be taken to task for virtually authorizing torture at the center , where more than 800 men and teenagers have passed through since it opened in January 2002 .
The full criminal complaint , translated from Spanish to English via Google , is available on - line .
" The move was not entirely unexpected as several human rights groups have been asking judges in different countries to indict Bush administration officials , " noted the Times .
" One group , the Center for Constitutional Rights , had asked a German prosecutor for such an indictment , but the prosecutor declined . "
Spain operates under the principle of " universal jurisdiction , " a doctrine that allows courts to reach beyond national borders in cases of torture , terrorism or war crimes .
A similar probe is ongoing in the United Kingdom .
3-29-09 update : A senior Spanish judge has ordered prosecutors to investigate former Bush officials to determine if they should be charged with crimes related to the torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay Detention Center , CNN reported Sunday .
Prosecutors will review the complaint and make a decision about whether a crime was committed within five days .
From the CNN report :
Investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon has passed a 98 - page complaint to prosecutors that accuses former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and five others of being the legal architects of system that allowed torture in violation of international law , human rights lawyer Gonzalo Boye told CNN ...
Garzon accepted the complaint under Spanish law because there were several Spaniards at Guantanamo who allegedly suffered torture .
The complaint was filed in March 2008 by Boye and the Association for the [ Dignity ] of Prisoners .

THORNHILL , Ont - Prime Minister Stephen Harper is urging all Canadians to confront what he calls a " rising tide of anti-Semitism " around the world .
Harper passionately reaffirmed his government 's support for the state of Israel in a speech to hundreds of members of the Jewish community in the Toronto suburb of Thornhill .
Harper was interrupted by several standing ovations -- at the grand opening ceremony for a community centre .
Harper , who was joined by Conservative MP Peter Kent , who represents the area , urged all Canadians to " confront " anti-Semitism as a " moral evil . "
He said the Conservatives have been taking continual leadership on that issue , including when Kent spoke out against recent anti-Semitic incidents on some university campuses .
The speech comes amid the government 's refusal to allow British MP George Galloway from entering Canada , apparently because of links to Hamas .
The federal government says Galloway is inadmissible because he engaged in terrorism and was a member of a group that engaged in terrorism .
That charge is apparently based on the fact that Galloway delivered humanitarian goods to war - torn Gaza and gave $ 45,000 to the Hamas government .
Hamas is a banned terrorist organization in Canada .
Galloway 's lawyers are challenging the entry ban and are considering a civil action .
Intel ’s short run as an operating system maker has come to an end .
On Thursday , the nonprofit Linux Foundation plans to announce that it will take over the “ stewardship ” of the Moblin project from Intel .
In this case , stewardship means access to the code of Moblin , which is an open - source operating system based on Linux .
It was designed to run computers in products as diverse as netbooks and cars .
Essentially , Intel has loosened its grip on the project a bit and put the central control of Moblin in neutral hands .
“ This is a departure for Intel , ” said Jim Zemlin , the executive director of the Linux Foundation .
“ This is a company that has the resources and internal staff to create innovative technology on their own .
They obviously see Moblin as a strategic platform . ”
Mr. Zemlin is thinking that broad interest in Moblin could help spur the sales of Intel ’s Atom processors , which the company has aimed at netbooks for now and all types of small devices including phones , cars , refrigerators and elevators in the future .
“ It ’s so hard to figure out when the next big thing will happen , ” Mr. Zemlin said .
“ By opening it up to many people as possible , you increase your odds of participating in whatever turns out to be big . ”
Intel has historically stayed out of operating systems , preferring not to step on the toes of partners , like Microsoft .
With Moblin , however , Intel created a slick , flexible operating system as a base that others can modify for various uses .
By doing so , Intel can push along the software at its own pace rather than relying on Microsoft ’s timetable and also ensure that it has something available for its own chips at a time when companies are tweaking Linux on mobile devices for rival ARM - based products .
The Moblin project has received top priority at Intel , and the company has poached some of the elite Linux talent .
Alan Cox , for example , is one of the main Linux developers and used to work at Red Hat before moving to Intel .
While Google ’s Android and Canonical ’s Ubuntu receive far more attention , Moblin should have a strong showing at the Computex trade show this June in Taipei .
The Genivi Alliance , which includes car makers BMW and GM , is expected to show off a new Moblin - based software dashboard at the show , and a variety of netbook makers should have Moblin - based devices as well .
Intel will maintain strong control over the software since it employs the top Moblin developers .
But that could change over time as outside developers show interest in the software .
“ As people earn their stripes , it will open up , ” Mr. Zemlin said .
The Linux Foundation is supported by companies like Hewlett - Packard , Oracle , Google , Dell , Adobe and I.B.M .
Fast food chains like Burger King and McDonald ’s are n’t known for being particularly healthy , gourmet , or sustainable .
It does n’t matter if tomatoes or potatoes are n’t in season–McDonald ’s customers want their fully - garnished burgers and fries .
And factory - farm meat , well , that ’s always in season .
Enter Burgerville , a 39 - restaurant gourmet fast food chain in the Pacific Northwest .
The chain already uses local and sustainable ingredients in its food , and now Burgerville is taking its commitment to the locavore movement a step further with new seasonal food combinations .
Each menu item highlights a single in - season ingredient sourced from local farms committed to sustainable practices .
This month , for example , Burgerville is featuring a rosemary chicken sandwich and rosemary shoestring potatoes , priced at $ 5.99 and $ 2.99 , respectively .
April ’s spinach focus will bring a spinach florentine pastry and spinach salad .
Many of Burgerville ’s items come from family farms like T. Malatesta Farms in Canby , Oregon and Liepold Farms in Boring , Oregon .
In the past , such small farms have been virtually ignored by the fast food industry .
Meat eaters at Burgerville can also rest easy knowing that they are eating antibiotic and hormone - free beef .
Burgerville ’s supplier is Country Natural Beef , a company whose sustainable practices are third - party certified by the Food Alliance .
So far , Burgerville ’s strategy is working .
Company CEO Jeff Harvey believes that Burgerville ’s continued growth and expansion is largely due to its commitment to sustainability .
Just today , the company was recognized by Greenopia with a three out of four leaf rating for its sustainable practices .
Burgerville is n’t the only green fast food joint to pop up recently .
Seller ’s Markets in San Francisco , O’Burger in LA , and Nat. in Berlin , Germany all feature free - range meat and organic food options .
But none of these restaurants have expanded to as many locations as Burgerville , and none of them feature rotating menus .
Local , seasonal food is often presumed to be the exclusive domain of the rich–or at least those who have access to the new farmers market - locating Locavore iPhone app .
Perhaps Burgerville can begin to change that .

The Washington Post today carries a revealing article that highlights the ongoing agenda to forge a “ new economic world order ” with a vastly empowered IMF acting as a ‘ bank of the world ’ .
Under the headline A Bigger , Bolder Role Is Imagined For the IMF –
Changes Suggest Shift in How Global Economy
Is Run , Anthony Faiola describes how the IMF is on course to be transformed into “ a veritable United Nations for the global economy . ”
Faiola envisages a scenario where “ central bankers and finance ministers would meet to convene a financial security council of sorts . ”
“ Serving almost as ambassadors to the IMF , they would debate ways to put out the world ’s economic fires and stifle reckless policies before they ignite new ones . ” he continues .
“ Bowing to a new economic world order , the IMF would grant fresh powers to the likes of China , India and Brazil .
It would have vastly expanded authority to act as a global banker to governments rich and poor .
And with more flexibility to effectively print its own money , it would have the ability to inject liquidity into global markets in a way once limited to major central banks , including the U.S. Federal Reserve ”
The article then explains that this imagined scenario is taken directly from internal IMF documents , interviews and think - tank reports .
The details were thrashed out at the recent G20 summit , and though they may take years to fully implement , this model represents the global financial elite ’s blueprint for the near future .
The IMF will discuss it ’s role in the new world order at it ’s biannual assembly in Washington this weekend .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( Article continues below )
The Post article essentially describes the ongoing agenda to empower a group of unelected central bankers with the authority to usurp state sovereignty by overseeing benchmarks for national financial governance and setting regulations for financial institutions all over the globe .
The Post ’s description echoes that of World Bank President and Bilderberg elitist Robert Zoellick , who earlier this month openly spoke of using the economic crisis to give global financial bodies the power to regulate national policy as part of the larger creation of global government .
“ If leaders are serious about creating new global responsibilities or governance , let them start by modernising multilateralism to empower the WTO , the IMF , and the World Bank Group to monitor national policies . ”
Zoellick stated .
Of course , The Washington Post can openly announce this , as can every other major media outlet in the world .
However if you or I discuss it , it is still dismissed as a “ conspiracy theory ” by the unwitting majority of the population .
As we have previously reported , both the IMF and the United Nations have thrown their weight behind proposals to implement a de-facto global financial dictatorship .
Both bodies have expressed support for new world reserve currency system to replace the dollar as part of the acceleration towards a new economic world order .
Earlier this month after the G20 summit , the London Telegraph ’s international business editor also highlighted the agenda , noting that under a clause in Point 19 of the communiqué issued by the G20 leaders , the IMF ’s power to create money outside the control of any sovereign body was activated .
The new reserve currency would be formed from Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , a synthetic paper currency issued by the IMF that has lain dormant for half a century .
“ The world is a step closer to a global currency , backed by a global central bank , running monetary policy for all humanity . ”
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard wrote .
As we have repeatedly warned , the introduction of a new global currency system , with an overarching regulatory body , is a key cornerstone in the move towards global government , centralized control and more power being concentrated into fewer unaccountable hands .

Government website now offers ' suicide warning signs ' for victims of recession John Byrne
Published : Tuesday March 31 , 2009
Print This Email This
When the government starts warning you not to commit suicide , you know things have gotten bad .
The US Department of Health and Human Services now has a webpage for the current recession , " Getting Through Tough Economic Times . "
Headlined under the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration ( www.samhsa.gov/economy/ ) , the guide offers tips on " how to deal with the effects financial difficulties can have on your physical and mental health . "
The site went public Tuesday .
Among the deleterious health effects the recession may spawn , the government says , is suicide .
" Unemployment and other kinds of financial distress do not ' cause ' suicide directly , but they can be factors that interact dynamically within individuals and affect their risk for suicide , " the site says .
" These financial factors can cause strong feelings such as humiliation and despair , which can precipitate suicidal thoughts or actions among those who may already be vulnerable to having these feelings because of life - experiences or underlying mental or emotional conditions ( e.g. , depression , bi-polar disorder ) that place them at greater risk of suicide . "
Other health risks the agency lists are depression , anxiety , compulsive behaviors and substance abuse .
" It is important to be aware of signs that financial problems may be adversely affecting your emotional or mental well being -- or that of someone you care about , " the agency notes .
The recession 's toll is spelled out in specific terms .
These signs include : persistent sadness / crying , excessive anxiety , increased drinking , apathy and " not being able to function as well . "
On the plus side , the agency offers tips for managing stress -- " trying to keep things in perspective " and " strengthening connections with family and friends , " as well as engaging in regular exercise .
Other steps ?
" Acknowledge that economic downturns can be frightening to everyone , but that there are ways of getting through them - from engaging in healthy activities , positive thinking , supportive relationships , to seeking help when needed from health professionals , " the site writes .
" Encourage community - based organizations and groups to provide increased levels of mental health treatment and support to those who are severely affected by the economy . "
But should things go sour , the Department of Health and Human Services offers these warning signs for the friends and family of those who 've been through economic turmoil .
* Threatening to hurt or kill oneself or talking about wanting to hurt or kill oneself
* Looking for ways to kill oneself
* Thinking or fantasying about suicide
* Acting recklessly
* Seeing no reason for living or having no sense of purpose in life
If someone you know is encountering these problems , the site suggests calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK ( 8255 ) .

EXPERIENCE suggests that shares in defence companies can offer a safe haven for investors during periods of economic turbulence .
During the previous two recessions , American defence shares outperformed the market .
That is not surprising : more than any other industry , defence is a client of government .
And governments set military budgets according to their involvement in wars and their perception of external threats — neither of which has much connection with the business cycle .
But in this downturn , something different is going on .
So far this year the S&P 500 index has fallen by 14 % , but defence shares have fallen by 22 % .
The cloud hanging over the industry is the gloomy conviction that after eight years of George Bush , during which the Pentagon 's budget more than doubled to $ 666 billion , Barack Obama is determined to change things .
The reduction in spending is not exactly imminent .
The budget for 2010 , which will be announced next month , was largely set by the outgoing administration and will be close to 2009's $ 654 billion .
Because of the winding down of operations in Iraq , the Office of Management and Budget currently expects a 4 % increase in base funding over 2009 — not exactly short rations .
It is what will happen in the subsequent years that is worrying the industry .
He has not gone into specifics , but in the past few weeks Mr Obama has given glimpses of his thinking .
At a White House fiscal - responsibility summit on February 23rd , he singled out the project to produce a new presidential helicopter as “ an example of the procurement process gone amok ” , and assured his former rival , John McCain , that curbing procurement excesses was one his most urgent priorities .
The next day , in a speech to Congress , Mr Obama promised to “ reform our defence budget so that we 're not paying for Cold War - era weapons systems we do n't use . ”
On March 4th he went further .
Citing a recent report from the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , which found that 95 big weapons contracts were over budget by a total of $ 295 billion , he contrasted projects “ designed to keep the American people safe ” with those “ designed to make a defence contractor rich . ”
Adding congressional firepower to the president 's statement of intent is a bill introduced in February by Carl Levin , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and Mr McCain , the committee 's senior Republican .
Its aim is to force the Pentagon to get tough with military contractors that fail to deliver the goods .
It seems clear that Mr Obama is willing to scale back or scrap projects that are of decreasing relevance to America 's 21st - century security requirements , or have become embarrassing money pits .
The VH - 71 programme to replace the helicopters used to carry presidents around certainly falls into the embarrassing category .
Lockheed Martin and its partner Augusta Westland , a subsidiary of Italy 's Finmeccanica , are on course to supply 28 helicopters at a cost to taxpayers of $ 13.2 billion .
But more important are the really big - ticket items that are likely to face much tougher scrutiny under the new regime .
The air force would like a second batch of F - 22 fighters to add to the 187 it will already have by 2011 .
But after spending more than $ 62 billion so far on the Lockheed Martin / Boeing plane , spectacularly capable though it is , Mr Obama and Congress may decide that enough is enough .
The F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter is another programme that looks vulnerable .
The GAO said this month that the total investment to acquire 2,456 planes and support them in service will exceed $ 1 trillion .
The GAO and the Pentagon are also at odds over the army 's $ 159 billion Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) project , led by Boeing and SAIC , a systems integrator .
The GAO reckons FCS is running about $ 21 billion over budget , and said last week that the programme had “ spent about 60 % of its development funds , even though the most expensive activities remain to be done before the production decision ” .
Nobody would be surprised if Mr Obama opted for a cheaper , later and less ambitious version of FCS .
The same applies to missile defence , only more so — Mr Obama is a declared sceptic about the whole idea .
Defence firms still have some attractions for investors .
As Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs points out , most have strong balance - sheets and cashflow , and the geopolitical landscape is no less threatening .
And shares of European defence firms have not been hit as hard as those in America .
Having largely missed out on Mr Bush 's party , they are facing less of a hangover now .
But with a military budget almost as big as the rest of the world 's combined , even quite small changes in American defence spending have big consequences for the industry .
Military spending moves in long cycles .
After ten fat years , some lean ones are in store .
First they came for the teenagers .
Could toddlers be far behind ?
Nope .
Thanks to the good folks at YouTomb , we ’ve learned that Warner Music ’s automated takedown net has now caught two videos of little kids being little kids .
Of course we ca n’t show you the videos since they ’re , well , censored , but the YouTomb snapshots tell most of the story .
One showed a 4 year old lip - syncing to the old Foreigner hit , “ Juke Box Hero . ”
The other apparently showed a baby smacking its lips to the tune of “ I Love My Lips ” — a song originally sung by a cucumber in an episode of “ Veggie Tales . ”
Both videos are obvious fair uses ( these are transformative , noncommercial videos that are not substitutes for the original songs , and there is no plausible market for " licensing " parents before they video their own children singing ) and perfectly legal — just like the video of a baby dancing to a Prince song that Universal Music Group took down in 2007 .
These are just a few of the thousands of videos Warner has instructed YouTube to block in the past few months .
According to statistics kept by YouTomb , there were twice as many videos removed from YouTube in January 2009 as in the entire previous year combined .
The numbers are all more appalling because , thanks to Warner 's reliance on YouTube ’s automated , censorship - friendly Content I.D. tool , there is no reason to think that Warner even bothered to watch these videos to decide whether it actually objects them before blocking them .
We ’ve said it before , and we ’ll keep saying it until the folks at Warner come to their senses : it ’s time to stop the censorship .
The Content ID system should be set to flag possible infringing works and then Warner should have a human review those works before they are taken down .
And if Warner wo n’t reverse course altogether , it should at least promise that no one will be sued for simply disputing a Content I.D. removal .
Warner loses nothing by this : even after a user files Content I.D. dispute , Warner still has the option of using a DMCA takedown notice to target videos to which it really objects .
By publicly committing to using the DMCA process , Warner will reassure fair users that they can raise the red flag without fear of finding themselves in the middle of an expensive and unexpected lawsuit .
For more details on what YouTube users can do when their videos are removed , read our " Guide to YouTube Removals " page .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - A new Afghan law that has drawn Western condemnation for restricting women ’s rights does not allow marital rape as its critics claim , but lets men refuse to feed wives who deny them sex , the cleric behind it says .
Afghan cleric Ayatollah Mohammed Asef Mohseni speaks during an interview in Kabul in this February 7 , 2007 file photo .
REUTERS / Ahmad Masood / Files
Ayatollah Mohammed Asef Mohseni’s
Shi’ite personal status law sparked controversy abroad because of a provision that “ a wife is obliged to fulfill the sexual desires of her husband . ”
This was read by some as an open door to marital rape , and together with clauses restricting women ’s freedom of movement denounced as reminiscent of harsh Taliban - era rules .
The law has been criticized by Western leaders with troops fighting in Afghanistan , including U.S. President Barack Obama , who called it “ abhorrent . ”
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai , who signed the law last month , has since put it under review .
But Mohseni said the law -- which only applies to the 15 percent of Afghans who are Shi’a Muslims -- has been misinterpreted by critics .
Its sexual clauses aimed only to ensure men ’s sexual needs were met within marriage , because Islam prohibited them seeking satisfaction with other women .
“ Why should a man and woman get married if there is no need for a sexual relationship ?
Then they are like brother and sister , ” he told Reuters in an interview in his recently built central Kabul mosque and university complex .
A man and wife can negotiate how often it is reasonable to sleep together , based on his sex drive , and a woman has a right to refuse if she has a good reason , said the bearded cleric .
“ It should not be compulsory for the wife to say yes all the time , because some men have more sexual desires than others , ” he said , adding that husbands should never force themselves on their wives and the law does not sanction that .
But women do have a duty to meet their husband ’s needs .
“ If a woman says no , the man has the right not to feed her , ” Mohseni said .
The law allows women to work , so they could theoretically refuse sex and support themselves , but in mainly rural Afghanistan most women are dependent on husbands .
The law is milder than the severe restrictions imposed by the Sunni Muslim Taliban , who banned all women and girls from any work or study , and from leaving the home without a male relative .
But opponents still consider it a step backwards .
They also want to strike down a provision that says women can leave their home freely for work , education or medical care , but otherwise require their husband ’s permission to go out .
Mohseni said this was not a final word -- if women want more freedom of movement , they can ask for it to be included in their marriage contract : “ If he says no , she can marry someone else . ”
But in Afghanistan most marriages are arranged and women ’s low social status would make it hard for most to refuse a union .
MAKE -UP ON DEMAND
Another measure in the law described as demeaning by rights groups is a requirement that women wear makeup if their husbands wish .
The soft - spoken cleric said this was to protect relationships .
“ When men venture outside they see lots of other women with makeup , but he comes home and finds his own wife with a dirty face , ” Mohseni said .
“ This is mentioned to encourage men to have more interest in a social and personal life with his wife . ”
Opponents of the law say it codifies traditional practices that are in fact not required by Islam .
Qazimiya Muhaqaq , professor of Political Science at Katib University and one of a group of women involved in a street demonstration against the law this week , told a news conference on Thursday the law makes women bow to their husbands .
“ A woman and man must satisfy each other , it ’s natural , they are in a relationship .
But this law states that whenever a man wants , the woman is obliged to satisfy her husband , ” she said .
Reuters asked Mohseni several times if he could detail the religious reasons for restricting women ’s movements , and requiring them to wear makeup , but he did not provide them .
Mohseni has been closely following the international debate about the law , condemning NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer for his criticism and saying U.S. President Barack Obama had spoken in ignorance when he called it “ abhorrent . ”
The cleric had hoped that after speaking about the law last week its critics would seek him out to get a better understanding of its contents , but said he was disappointed by them .
“ After my press conference I was expecting a delegation from the West to come and meet me but they are just playing politics . ”
“ Without proper reading people make their own opinions about the law , which I really regret , ” he added .
I just created a new Twitter account , and it got me to thinking about all the data visualization I ’ve seen for Twitter tweets .
I felt like I ’d seen a lot , and it turns out there are quite a few .
Here they are grouped into four categories – network diagrams , maps , analytics , and abstract .
Network Diagrams
Twitter is a social network with friends ( and strangers ) linking up with each other and sharing tweets aplenty .
These network diagrams attempt to show the relationships that exist among users .
Twitter Browser
Twitter Social Network Analysis
The ebiquity group did some cluster analysis and managed to group tweets by topic .
Twitter Vrienden
Twitter in Red
I ’m not completely sure how to read this one .
I looks like it starts from a single user and then shoots out into the network .
Twitter Network
Maps
When you create a Twitter account , you can enter where you are located , so in my case , I put New York .
Because Tweets often have location attached to them , maps naturally lend themselves to tweet visualization .
TwiterVision
Yeah , it ’s a Google Maps mashup , but a bit better than what you ’re used to seeing .
TwitterVision3d
It ’s TwitterVision taken to the next dimension .
Analytics
Maybe you do n’t care so much about the relationships or locations , but what you ’re really after is what everyone is Twittering about .
These analytic visualization serve as a Twitter zeitgeist .
TweetStat
TweetVolume
TwitStat
TwitterMeter
Abstract
They ’re not quite maps , not quite network diagrams , and not quite analytic tools .
Rather they all follow some metaphor and encourage exploration .
24 o’clocks
Is it just me , or does this sound like a really good name for a band ?
TweetPad
Created at the Visualizar workshop , it ’s actually more than just curves .
In fact the blobbies are meant more for background while the main event is playing with the tweets .
Twitter Fountain
Twitter Blocks
Created by the folks at Stamen .
I posted about Blocks when it came out .
TwitterPoster
TwitterVerse
A lot , huh ?
All of these were made possible by the Twitter API that allows developers to access Twitter data for free .

According to the security firm , four hoax applications have become available on the social network along with a new variation of the Koobface virus , which was first detected at the end of last year , and directs users to a fake YouTube page where they are encouraged to install malware .
Two of the hoax applications that have been downloaded by Facebook users include ' F a c e b o o k - closing down !!!' and ' Error Check System ' .
By downloading the app , users are giving hackers access to their profile and personal information , and also unwittingly forwarding fake messages to their friends , also encouraging them to download the programs .
Rik Ferguson , senior security advisor at Trend Micro told the BBC : " It 's been a pretty bad week for social networking in general " .
" It 's almost as if the applications we have seen this week are a proof of concept , " he said .
" It would be much better for them to generate rogue applications that did not look like rogue applications . "
Ferguson also revealed that he believes hackers are currently working on creating apps that do n't initially appear to be malicious .
He predicts these apps will appear on social networking sites very soon .
" One of the problems is that Facebook allows anybody to write an application and third party applications are not vetted before they are released to the public .
Even as Facebook stamps out one malignant application , it can pop up in another place , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos
However , it appears Facebook is still refusing to vet apps before they are made available on the social network .
Founder Mark Zuckerberg told Radio
One last month : " Our philosophy is that having an open system anyone can participate in is generally better " .

It seems strange to call Pericles noble , given that to become the leading man in Athens , he displaced the aristocracy and bullied the oligarchy that remained .
Pericles ’ legacy is undoubtedly one of unleashing populist forces , but given his skillful management of the people and ( relatively ) gentle treatment of political enemies , should we not call him noble ?
Ultimately , the distinction between Pericles and Cimon , the latter representing the height of aristocratic Athens , is that the former was noble simply , whereas the latter was noble and in a sense pious ( cf. Strauss , “ Preliminary Observations on the Gods in Thucydides ’ Work ” ) .
It may be easier to call Pericles immoderate : the populace thought him full of hubris , although he was continent .
But this only leads to the obvious line of inquiry that Plutarch wants us to pursue .
For apparently no reason , the name “ Socrates ” is dropped into the narrative , and key parts of the life of Pericles mirror that of Socrates .
1. Before we compare Pericles and Socrates , we should make the strongest case for why any of us might want to examine Pericles , or even be like Pericles .
Plutarch speaks of his “ mind and upright temper and demeanour , and … [ the ] capacity to bear the cross - grained humours of [ his ] fellow - citizens and colleagues in office , which made [ him ] both most useful and serviceable to the interests of [ his ] country . ”
Now if we want to know where Pericles got his “ mind and upright temper and demeanour ” from , it came from a “ lofty and , as they call it , up - in - the - air sort of thought . ”
He went beyond what was “ natural , ” getting
… elevation of purpose and dignity of language , raised far above the base and dishonest buffooneries of mob eloquence , but , besides this , a composure of countenance , and a serenity and calmness in all his movements , which no occurrence whilst he was speaking could disturb , a sustained and even tone of voice , and various other advantages of a similar kind , which produced the greatest effect on his hearers .
To not put a too - fine point on it , Plutarch offers the following story :
Once , after being reviled and ill - spoken of all day long in his own hearing by some vile and abandoned fellow in the open market - place , where he was engaged in the despatch of some urgent affair , he continued his business in perfect silence , and in the evening returned home composedly , the man still dogging him at the heels , and pelting him all the way with abuse and foul language ; and stepping into his house , it being by this time dark , he ordered one of his servants to take a light , and to go along with the man and see him safe home .
So alright , his manners were perfect , so perfect that they translated into incredible patience , gentleness , and mesmerizing political rhetoric ( of which we have nearly nothing left , save what Thucydides says his Funeral Oration “ basically ” said ) .
So what ?
What did he do ?
2 . To obtain power , he sided with the people ’s party against the oligarchic / aristocratic parties .
Now the best of the aristocrats , Cimon , gave much to the poor , “ inviting every day some one or other of the citizens that was in want to supper , and bestowing clothes on the aged people , and breaking down the hedges and enclosures of his grounds , that all that would might freely gather what fruit they pleased . ”
Pericles had an idea to combat Cimon ’s sharing of private wealth :
Aristotle states … [ Pericles ] turned to the distribution of the public moneys ; and in a short time having bought the people over , what with moneys allowed for shows and for service on juries , and what with other forms of pay and largess , he made use of them against the council of Areopagus …
The Areopagus , to grossly oversimplify – the power and setup of all these institutions differ significantly – was regarded like the House of Lords ; the Ecclesia , the full assembly of the male population , is how the House of Commons would be esteemed today , esp. after the Areopagus , not coincidentally in Pericles ’ time , had been rendered toothless .
From the Ecclesia we get all the fun stories of recalling generals to stand trial even while they ’re in the middle of a campaign .
Having been generous with wealth that was n’t his , and securing an entire city with it , Pericles embraced an ambitious imperial project .
To do this , he turned allies into subjects .
There was a common fund the allies had for their defense :
Athens under Pericles took the money and said “ they were in no way obliged to give any account of those moneys … so long as they maintained their [ Athens and the allies ] defence , and kept off the barbarians from attacking them . ”
Pericles sent Athenians as colonists , military aid and even provisional rulers to all the “ allies , ” while sending out large numbers of them out on galleys to learn seamanship for 8 months at a time .
The money was going into building a powerful navy and an army that controlled strategic points , to be sure , and nascent democratic movements abroad were helped .
But the money also went into massive public works that gave employment to numerous Athenians in the arts , so they did n’t feel left out .
The Parthenon , the chapel at Eleusis , the entrances to the Acropolis , tons of statuary and friezes and walls all were funded with other people ’s money :
Pericles ’ works are especially admired , as having been made quickly , to last long .
For every particular piece of his work was immediately , even at that time , for its beauty and elegance , antique : and yet in its vigour and freshness looks to this day as if it were just executed .
There is a sort of bloom of newness upon those works of his , preserving them from the touch of time , as if they had some perennial spirit and undying vitality mingled in the composition of them .
An ambitious imperial project has enormous costs , of course , but it is n’t clear that Athens ever really paid the price because of Pericles .
In fact , under Pericles , there were plenty of successful campaigns , a consolidating of the empire , and some charges laid against the Spartans towards whom Pericles urged war were exactly correct .
The charge that Sparta , then the leading power in Greece , was n’t taking its role in keeping the Greeks united and free against the Persians seriously turned out to be exactly right .
Sparta only won the war against Athens , long after Pericles died , with Persian help .
Athens near the end also sought that help , but by that point had decayed severely .
What is stunning about Pericles , Plutarch never fails to remind us , is how gracious he is compared to the run of the mill viciousness of Athenian politics .
3 . We have made the case for Pericles simply , with some reservations .
Now we will embark on another line of thought , presenting another side entirely .
In our day and age , just getting someone to list reservations is considered “ the other side . ”
The most glaring non-reference to Socrates occurs in a discussion of Pericles ’ education :
But he that saw most of Pericles , and furnished him most especially with a weight and grandeur of sense , superior to all arts of popularity , and in general gave him his elevation and sublimity of purpose and of character , was Anaxagoras of Clazomenae ; whom the men of those times called by the name of Nous , that is , mind , or intelligence , whether in admiration of the great and extraordinary gift he had displayed for the science of nature , or because that he was the first of the philosophers who did not refer the first ordering of the world to fortune or chance , nor to necessity or compulsion , but to a pure , unadulterated intelligence , which in all other existing mixed and compound things acts as a principle of discrimination , and of combination of like with like .
Anaxagoras is the philosopher Socrates mentions with his nearly last words in the Phaedo , when describing his “ second sailing , ” his rethinking that is the beginning of philosophy properly speaking .
What Anaxgoras proposed is that mind is purely a differentiating power : Hobbes says something similar in the opening pages of Leviathan , when he says those who only notice similarities are not philosophers .
The trouble with saying “ mind only differentiates ” is quite obvious : does n’t mind also combine ?
It surely combines more than “ like with like : ” that sort of union seems to be a consequence of discrimination .
In the Phaedo , this problem hits crisis proportions – the truth is we do n’t really have a way of combining body and soul simply that is n’t pure mythology .
Yet the self most certainly exists , and does more than endure or assert itself : self - knowledge , the deepening of a relation between body and soul , is most certainly real .
Here , Anaxagoras gives Pericles the idea that “ knowledge is power ” rather than giving him questions .
This helps create the calm , the graciousness , the ability to “ steer ” the ship of state : Pericles is the noblest and most impious of men , as he truly believes in the full power of knowledge .
He believes man can master this world – his unleashing of the populace is not done cynically or only for his own power .
He ’s a genuine lover of humanity who believes the Enlightenment project entirely : his means resemble contemporary social democracy , his rule that of the Progressive notion of the President , who is in tune with the voice of the people and understands it fully .
The only aversion people today have with him would be his going to war , but many who deplore the US as imperialistic because it is the hegemon would have the same sneering envy and resentment for Sparta .
So Pericles may represent the height of political rule : an intelligent “ first among equals ” who can govern naturally and in accordance with what the people desire .
Only once is it implied that Pericles truly forced the agenda , regarding war with Sparta .
But Athens still complied .
The contrast with Socrates is that Socrates broke from Anaxagoras , whereas Pericles took the logic to an extreme , not seeing that “ fortune ” and “ divinity ” may be obstacles that can be overcome , but not in a lifetime .
“ Divinity ” especially cannot be neglected if one rules : reverence for one ’s homeland , for those who rule , is part of piety .
The basis of Periclean rule was never what he did alone , but what he evoked in people ’s imaginations .
He was even mocked as being like Zeus , having a head so big the state emerged from it .
While there are other points of comparison / contrast , I do want to skip to the last moments of Pericles ’ life , after the plague had wrecked his own health and his attempt to secure victory in the War :
When he was now near his end , the best of the citizens and those of his friends who were left alive , sitting about him , were speaking of the greatness of his merit , and his power , and reckoning up his famous actions and the number of his victories ; for there were no less than nine trophies , which , as their chief commander and conqueror of their enemies , he had set up for the honour of the city .
They talked thus together among themselves , as though he were unable to understand or mind what they said but had now lost all his consciousness .
He had listened , however , all the while and attended to all , and speaking out among them , said that he wondered they should commend and take notice of things which were as much owing to fortune as to anything else , and had happened to many other commanders , and , at the same time , should not speak or make mention of that which was the most excellent and greatest thing of all .
“ For , ” said he , ” “ no Athenian , through my means , ever wore mourning . ”
Pericles and Socrates had the same goal – how do we find happiness in life , despite fortune ’s slings ?
Pericles went an Enlightenment / populist route : in seamanship , the people were educated , and Thucydides talks much of the technical marvels Periclean Athens achieved .
Piety was rejected entirely , science embraced .
The project succeeded insofar as Pericles was the greatest politician ever , nothing less .
But we note that Socrates ’ final moments involved him asking and taking questions as well as relating a story from his own past for others ’ sake .
Happiness was n’t given , as much as left for others to find for themselves .
Freedom does n’t lie entirely in asserting oneself against the world , but in discovering .
Pericles ultimately had to burn other cities in order to keep Athens lavish and win a monumental legacy .
One wonders if Socrates is a kid with a treasure map , telling his friends it might be fun to go out today and see what they can find .
Childbirth is the leading reason for hospitalization in the USA and one of the top reasons for outpatient visits , yet much maternity care consists of high - tech procedures that lack scientific evidence of benefit for most women , a report says today .
U.S. hospital charges for maternal and newborn care jumped from $ 79 billion in 2005 to $ 86 billion in 2006 , the authors write .
More than $ 2.5 billion a year is spent on unnecessary C- sections , which now represent nearly a third of all deliveries .
Reducing expensive techniques such as C- sections and increasing low - cost approaches such as childbirth assistants called doulas would improve mothers ' and babies ' health while cutting costs , the authors say .
BETTER LIFE :
More pregnancy news
The report was produced by the Milbank Memorial Fund , the Reforming States Group of government health policy leaders ; and Childbirth Connection , a research and advocacy group .
" Everybody recognizes that our health care system 's in trouble , " says Childbirth Connection 's Maureen Corry , co-author with colleague Carol Sakala .
" But when it comes to maternity care , no one talks about it . "
Yet , she says , with 4.3 million babies born annually , nearly one in four people discharged from U.S. hospitals are new mothers or newborns .
On the outpatient side , only checkups , follow - ups and coughs rack up more visits than maternity care .
In 2005 , the average hospital charge for an uncomplicated vaginal birth was $ 7,000 , compared with $ 16,000 for a complicated C-section , Corry reports .
" I think a lot of people have no idea about the cost , " she says .
The University of Wisconsin's Douglas Laube , a former president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , blames " very significant external forces " for the overuse of expensive technologies in maternity care .
" I do n't like to admit it , but there are economic incentives " for doctors and hospitals to use the procedures , says Laube , who reviewed the new report before its release .
For example , some doctors might get bonuses for performing more labor inductions , which adds costs and increases the risk of C - sections , which , in turn , increase hospital profits because they require longer stays .
In addition , some doctors order unnecessary tests and procedures to protect against malpractice suits , Laube says .
Bonnie Jellen , head of the American Hospital Association 's maternal and child health section , had n't seen the report .
She says women 's preferences and doctor 's malpractice concerns have helped raise the C- section rate .
Says Corry : " A lot of people think pregnant women are accidents waiting to happen .
It 's just crazy . "
( CNN ) --
Twenty - five years ago , America discovered " one of England 's loudest bands , " courtesy of documentarian Marty DiBergi and his film , " This Is Spinal Tap . "
Christopher Guest , Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will perform Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs on tour .
It was all parody -- DiBergi was director Rob Reiner , and cohorts Christopher Guest , Michael McKean and Harry Shearer played the heavy - metal musicians in Spinal Tap -- but for a fictional band , Spinal Tap has had a long afterlife .
The film gave birth to several catchphrases , including one -- " up to 11 " -- that 's made it into the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary .
There are Web sites devoted to the Tap , including at least one , http://tap-albums.s5.com/, that offers a complete discography of the fictional band 's nonexistent albums .
And Guest , McKean and Shearer have never left their spandexed alter egos behind .
The band reunited for a 1992 album , " Break Like the Wind , " and again for a 2001 tour .
For the latter , the opening act was another Guest - McKean - Shearer collaboration , the Folksmen from Guest 's film " A Mighty Wind . "
Now Shearer , McKean and Guest are hitting the road again , but not as Spinal Tap or the Folksmen .
They 're playing ... themselves .
" We 're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us , and only us , " says Shearer in a phone interview discussing the trio's " Unwigged & Unplugged " 30 - date acoustic tour , which kicks off Friday in Vancouver , British Columbia .
" And because we do n't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we 're trying to dress it up as a treat , a rare treat , to see us as ourselves . "
The group will be performing both Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs , though , Shearer adds , " [ we 'll be ] doing these songs kind of in a different way because we 're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters . "
Have no fear , however , Tap fans : A new album , " Back from the Dead , " is due out in June .
Shearer took some time out from tour preparations to talk about Spinal Tap 's origins , the similarities between Tap and Metallica , and how " Start Me Up " became more closely identified with the Folksmen than the Rolling Stones .
The following is an edited version of that interview .
CNN : It 's been 25 years since " This Is Spinal Tap , " but it 's been much longer since Spinal Tap came together .
Do you remember what brought it about -- and who it 's based on ?
Shearer :
You know , I would like to make a little book composed of all the bands that people have guessed Spinal Tap actually is -- there would be a lot of bands in there .
And in fact it is about a lot of bands -- it 's never been about one band .
When we did this , the Pythons had already done [ the Beatles parody ] the Rutles , so there had been a piece that ... was a really specific spoof of a really specific band .
That was something we did n't want to do -- that had been done .
Our notion was to ... sort of encapsulate everything we know about rock ' n ' roll -- and everything we found funny or amusing about bands -- into one band .
So it was a process of smooshing all that stuff into this fictional band .
CNN : Are you familiar about this new movie called " Anvil " ?
[ The documentary , about a real heavy - metal band , has been compared to " This Is Spinal Tap . " ]
Shearer : I 've been reading about it and hearing about it a lot , but I have n't seen it .
...
It sounds interesting .
The last thing I 've seen along that line was " Some Kind of Monster . " ...
Was that amazing .
That was stupefying .
...
I heard they had a therapist .
But it was n't really a therapist -- it was a life coach .
Which is different -- and worse ( laughs ) .
Even more humiliating .
It 's one thing to have somebody who 's a therapist , but ... did you ever see " Starting Over " ?
The daytime series on NBC ?
CNN : No .
Shearer :
Oh , four or five women in a house with two life coaches .
Oh my God , it was just shocking .
Well , " Some Kind of Monster " is in that vein .
CNN : How do you guys go about writing songs ?
The songs on the first album were wonderful pastiches of various heavy metal - type things .
On the second album you had more styles and brought in guest musicians , including [ renowned session pianist ]
Nicky Hopkins for " Rainy Day Sun . "
Shearer : My God , yeah .
Nicky had actually come in , I think , to audition for the movie but could n't do the movie or something , but we 'd always dreamed to work with Nicky .
How we write the songs -- ... every one is a different experience .
In the case of Tap , it 's what seems like a funny idea sort of leads to a riff or some lyrics .
In the case of the Folksmen , I think there was more -- at least the stuff Michael and I wrote together -- a sense these certain kinds of songs that became clichés in that era of folk music , and we sort of have to touch each of these bases .
CNN : Like " Blood on the Coal , " a combination of coal mining and train song .
Shearer : Yeah !
We saved you the time .
It was a twofer .
...
There were a lot of songs in that era that were kind of based loosely or less loosely on the Bible , so we wrote " The Good Book Song , " and then of course the great cliché of folk music is the rambler or wandering song , so we wrote " Never Did No Wanderin ' , " about a guy who just stayed home .
CNN : Since you 're going to be performing as you , are you worried that people will show up wondering where the costumes are , or perhaps yell out , " Hey Harry , I want to hear Smithers , " or " Hey Chris , do Harlan Pepper " ?
Shearer : Each seat will be [ affixed ] with Taser equipment to discourage that .
...
Hopefully , we 'll be so entrancing that they wo n't be even thinking of talking to us , except if we ask for questions .
But as to what people are expecting , we 're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us , and only us , and because we do n't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we 're trying to dress it up as a treat , a rare treat , to see us as ourselves and doing these songs kind of in a different way , because we 're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters .
CNN : Are you planning to do covers on the order of " Start Me Up " ?
[ The Folksmen covered the Rolling Stones song on the " Mighty Wind " soundtrack . ]
Shearer : " Start Me Up " is actually the only song that we did n't write that 's in the show .
I ca n't resist [ it ] -- none of us can -- but I have a personal affection for it .
After the Super Bowl a few years ago in Detroit , where the Stones played halftime , a few weeks later I met somebody who said that " the soundtrack record of ' A Mighty Wind ' is my 6 - year - old son 's favorite CD , and at the Super Bowl that day during halftime , I was in the kitchen making lunch for him and his sister , and the 6 - year - old ran into the kitchen as excited as I 'd ever seen him in his life and said , ' Daddy daddy daddy , they 're doing a Folksmen song on the Super Bowl ! ' "

Former vice president Dick Cheney was on CNN’s State of the Union today , and he absolved himself , the Bush administration , and the Republican Party of any blame for the economic crisis .
Instead , he blamed Barney Frank , and Chris Dodd , but press releases from the Bush administration say otherwise .
In their own words , here is why Cheney and Bush should be blamed for the economy .
Host John King asked Cheney if the Bush administration left Obama with an economic mess .
Cheney answered , “ Well , I do n’t follow the news quite as closely as I once did .
But there ’s no question that what the economic circumstances that he inherited are difficult ones .
You know , we said that before we left .
I do n’t think you can blame the Bush administration for the creation of those circumstances .
It ’s a global financial problem .
We had , in fact , tried to deal with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problem some years before with major reforms and were blocked by Democrats on the Hill , Barney Frank and Chris Dodd . ”
Later on the interview Cheney continued the Republican mantra of blame the Democrats , “ I do remember , and I mentioned earlier , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
As best I can tell , from looking at the evidence , the failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was one of the key ingredients that caused the subsequent financial problem and economic recession .
We did try , earlier in the administration , to impose reforms on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and we ran into a stone wall on Capitol Hill in the form of the chairmen and — of the Banking Committee in the House and the Senate , Barney Frank and Chris Dodd .
The Democrats absolutely opposed any effort to reform those two institutions , and I think the collapse of those two institutions , as much as anything , contributed to the financial difficulties we ’ve been living with since . ”

Cheney ’s view point is interesting because he seems to have forgotten that it was his administration who as early as 2004 was encouraging sub - prime lending through their having a federally government sponsored “ zero down payment ” mortgage plan .
I think it is self explanatory what a zero down payment mortgage is .
Other sponsored Bush government mortgage programs allowed people to buy a home without a down payment , and financed mortgages that had no monthly payments for the first two years .
One Bush mortgage program did not even require the borrower to verify their identity .
In a October 2004 speech to the National Homebuilders Association Bush was the Cheerleader in Chief for the housing bubble , “ We ’ve doubled funding for education and counseling services to help first - time homebuyers navigate the lending process , understand the fine print , and avoid predatory lenders .
Homeownership rates are an alltime high in America , nearly 70 percent .
I love that statistic .
[ Laughter ]
Think about that .
More and more people own a home in America .
More and more people have a chance to realize the great dream of our country .
Minority homeownership is at record levels as well .
In 2002 , I set a clear goal , 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade .
And in just 2 years , more than 1.6 million minorities have become homeowners .
America is a stronger country every single time a family moves into a house of their own . ”
The Bush administration made it their policy to encourage and not regulate sub - prime lending .
It is a flat out lie for Congressional Republicans and Cheney to blame the Democrats , who did not even take control of Congress until January 2007 .
The pieces were put in place for a collapse by the Bush administration years before the Democrats took power .
The problem for Democrats is that this easy lending mortgage idea started with President Bill Clinton , and Congressional Democrats did not even provide token opposition to the Republican plans that allowed the housing bubble .
This should be painful for members of both parties to hear , but they all are to blame .
Instead of contemplating the long term effects of risky lending and a lack of regulation , everyone saw a political advantage in riding the housing bubble wave , so they stayed quiet .
The Bush administration encouraged sub - prime lending and cut regulation , so they deserve most of the blame , but Congressional Democrats and Republicans are n’t blameless because they put the pieces in place for a crisis years before the collapse came .
We have all heard heated arguments between developers who use scripting languages and developers who use Java .
One of the reasons for the war between these two factions is that the process of integrating the two was so difficult that developers on both sides were almost forced to choose one or the other .
Java Specification Request ( JSR ) 223 addresses this issue .
In this article , I present examples of how the standard framework and API defined by JSR 223 makes it easy for Java programmers to take advantage of the benefits of using a scripting language while retaining the benefits of using Java .
The Scripting API
The entire scripting API is contained in the package javax . script , which was first delivered with Java 6 .
This lightweight package contains six interfaces :
Bindings
Compilable
Invocable
ScriptContext
ScriptEngine
ScriptEngineFactory
five classes :
AbstractScriptEngine
CompiledScript
ScriptEnginemanager
SimpleBindings
SimpleScriptContext
and a single exception :
ScriptException
Rather than describing each of these interfaces , classes and exceptions , I present a series of five Java programs and five scripts in three languages to show just how little effort is required to make them work together .
Scripting Engines
The ScriptEngine interface , which lies at the heart of any implementation of JSR 223 , defines methods that provide basic scripting functionality .
These methods provide mechanisms for executing scripts and for getting and setting values that are shared between Java and a scripting language .
The methods defined by the ScriptEngine interface form the framework that brings uniformity to interoperating with different scripting languages .
Although it does not mandate any specific scripting engine , Java 6 includes the Mozilla Rhino engine for the JavaScript language .
If you visit https://scripting.dev.java.net, the home of the scripting project , you will see an impressive list of more than two dozen scripting engines that have been implemented to date .
ListScriptingtEngines.java ( Listing One ) displays a list of scripting engines available to the JVM in which it runs .
I start by creating an instance of ScriptEngineManager .
The documentation for this class states that it implements a discovery and instantiation mechanism for ScriptEngine classes and also maintains a collection of key / value pairs storing state shared by all engines created by the Manager .
It does this by using the service provider mechanism to enumerate all implementations of ScriptEngineFactory .
The service provider mechanism is described in the JAR file Specification .
package ca.tremblett ; import java.util.
List ; import javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory ; import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager ; /** * * @author ptremblett */ public class ListScriptingEngines { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; List < ScriptEngineFactory > engines = manager.getEngineFactories ( ) ; if ( engines.isEmpty ( ) ) { System.out.println
( " No scripting engines were found " ) ; return ; } System.out.println
( " The following " + engines.size ( ) + " scripting engines were found " ) ; System.out.println ( ) ; for ( ScriptEngineFactory engine : engines ) { System.out.println ( " Engine name : " + engine.getEngineName( ) ) ; System.out.println ( " \tVersion : " + engine.getEngineVersion ( ) ) ; System.out.println ( " \tLanguage : " + engine.getLanguageName ( ) ) ; List < String > extensions = engine.getExtensions ( ) ; if ( extensions.size ( ) >
0 ) { System.out.println ( " \tEngine supports the following extensions : " ) ; for ( String e : extensions ) { System.out.println ( " \t\t " + e ) ; } } List < String > shortNames = engine.getNames ( ) ; if ( shortNames.size ( ) >
0 ) { System.out.println ( " \tEngine has the following short names : " ) ; for ( String n : engine.getNames ( ) ) { System.out.println ( " \t\t " + n ) ; } } System.out.println ( "========================= " ) ; } } }
Listing One
After creating the instance of EngineManager , I invoke its getEngineFactories ( ) method .
This method returns a List of all the ScriptEngineFactory classes found by the discovery mechanism .
For each ScriptEngineFactory in the list , I obtain metadata describing the engine class by calling methods such as getEngineName ( ) , getEngineVersion ( ) , getLangugeName( ) , getExtensions ( ) , and getNames ( ) .
I then simply display this metadata .
If you run the ListScriptingEngines program , you will see the following output displayed :
The following 1 scripting engines were found : Engine name : Mozilla Rhino Version : 1.6 release 2 Language : ECMAScript
Engine supports the following extensions : js Engine has the following short names : js rhino JavaScript javascript ECMAScript ecmascript =========================
If you are using OS - X and have Java 6 from Apple installed , the output from the program looks like this :
The following 1 scripting engines were found : Engine name : AppleScriptEngine _Version : 1.0 _Language : AppleScript _Engine supports the following extensions : __scpt __applescript __app _ Engine has the following short names : __AppleScriptEngine __AppleScript __OSA =========================
Remember , Java 6 does not mandate any specific scripting engine and Apple has chosen to deliver an engine for their AppleScript .
Since the examples I present in subsequent sections of this article use Ruby , Python , and Groovy , I needed to make these engines available also .
To do so , I went to the scripting project site previously mentioned and download jsr223-engines.tar.gz from the " Documents & files " link ( there is also a .zip file if you are using a platform that does n't deal with tar balls ) .
When expanding the file , I observe that there is one directory for each language ; this directory contains a build subdirectory that contains a JAR file that is the engine for the language .
I add this jar to my classpath .
In addition to making the engine available , I must also make all of the JAR files used by the scripting language implementation available on my classpath .
The README .TXT file in each language 's directory contains a URL from which this implementation can be downloaded if you do not already have the language installed .
The following is the content of the README .
TXT for groovy :
This is JSR - 223 script engine for the < a href = " http://groovy.codehaus.org "

We have built and tested Groovy version 1.5.6 .
If you examine the " Libraries " section of the NetBeans project JavaScriptingDemo ( see Listing Six ) , you will see that supporting the three languages I 'm using requires these JAR files :
antlr -2.7.6.jar
asm -2.2.jar
groovy - 1.5.7.jar
groovy-engine.jar
jruby -engine.jar
jruby.jar jython-engine.jar

As a convenience , I have included the aforementioned JAR files in the JavaScriptingDemo NetBeans project in the required_jars directory .
These are snapshot of the files at the time this article was being written .
I recommend that you obtain the latest versions of these JAR files .
If you run ListScriptingEngines with the appropriate JAR files on the classpath , the program generates output that is too lengthy to include here but which you can see in Listing Two .

I wish I would have able to see this dude .
Imagine driving down Morse Rd. and seeing that guy raging in front of Sun TV .
Another one of my favorite videos of 2009 .
Big props to Kelley B. aka Roads Between
Us for the video .
He slipped off the roof of his family home and landed on a the five foot - long iron rod that was left standing on a building site .
How do you want to die ?
It 's not a cheerful or a very welcome question , but it 's the one we 'll all have to ask one day .
How would you want it to happen – quietly , violently , quickly , slowly ?
Should it be philosophical or action - packed ; unashamedly secular or swathed in religious observance ; done by your own hand or with the help of another ?
Should it be in private or in public ?
" I want death to find me planting my cabbages , " wrote the French savant Michel de Montaigne , and there 's much to be said for the pottering - in - the - garden option , the fate that extinguishes Don Corleone in The Godfather as he sprays his tomato plants and tries to frighten his grandson with vampire teeth made from orange peel .
I think we can agree that his was a better death than those suffered by his many victims , shot , stabbed or garrotted in cold blood .
But would we really want the Don Vito heart - attack and the nasty moment of consciousness telling you , inarguably , that it 's all over ?
Would n't it be better to die in your sleep , never knowing your spirit had packed up and fled while you were suspended in dreamland ?
Then again , if you knew nothing about it at all , would you miss an important life - experience : the final stocktaking , the profit - and - loss account of how you lived , the counting of blessings , the regrets ( you 'll have a few ) for transgressions you can't now undo ?

Death is preying on our minds because of the Jade Goody total - surveillance project .
Other cancer victims ( mostly journalists who treated death as a subject like any other – John Diamond , Ruth Picardie ) have minutely notated their path to the grave for the edification of newspaper readers .
But Goody 's decision to let a film crew follow her around during her last few weeks , recording her gradual decline in return for money , is unprecedented .
So is the concept of a magazine buying the rights to someone 's death , after already bidding for the rights to the wedding and first - baby pictures .
Much is being made of Jade 's " bravery " , her management of celebrity to ensure that her children get an expensive education , the exploitation of her imminent demise to persuade more young women to have cervical smear - tests .
But dying in public , in front of a camera that will relay to millions of television watchers the dwindling of light in your eyes – what kind of choice is that ?
Is it disgustingly ghoulish ?
Or is it a recognition that humanity likes to inspect the extremes of its own nature ?
In her confessional poem " Lady Lazarus " , Sylvia Plath reported from the edge of her third suicide attempt and bragged , with a certain bitter pride , " Dying / Is an art like everything else . / I do it exceptionally well . "
She looked at her role as the most confessional of poets , and imagined her verses as unwrapping the grave - clothes of her near - death for the amusement of the crowd .
" There is a charge , " she wrote : " For the eyeing of my scars , there is a charge / For the hearing of my heart –/ It really goes ./
And there is a charge , a very large charge /
For a word or a touch /
Or a bit of blood /
Or a piece of my hair or my clothes . "
That was written in October 1962 , 47 years before Goody announced her own tariff of charges for inspecting her death .
Should we believe that a good death is one that transforms our final experience into a work of art , to be consumed by the public as something beyond everyday life and everyday death ?

Many writers down the years have disdained the traditional deathbed scene , with weeping relatives gathered round a stricken matriarch , exchanging their goodbyes and putting their affairs in order .
Dylan Thomas in 1951 directed his father to " Rage , rage against the dying of the light " , to curse and bless him with " fierce tears " , but not simply to drift away .
Fifteen years later , the Liverpool poet Roger McGough published " Let Me Die a Youngman 's Death " , embracing a number of vivid scenarios ( being run over , aged 73 , at dawn by a red sports car while coming home from an all - night party ; or being discovered , aged 101 , by a mistress , in bed with her daughter , and cut to little pieces by the former ) rather than endure " a free from sin tiptoe in / candle wax and waning death / not a curtains drawn angels borne / ' what a nice way to go ' death . "
It 's a brave conceit , to shout , or laugh , in the face of Death and go out in a blaze of glory like James Cagney , dying on the top of the gasometer in White Heat , shouting " Made it , Ma !
Top of the world ! "
Taking Death down a peg has been a preoccupation with artists , from John Donne 's " Death be not Proud " with its clever , if effortful , logic ( " Thou art slave to Fate , Chance , kings and desperate men , / And dost with poison , warre and sicknesse dwell , / And poppy , or charmes can make us sleepe as well , / And better than thy stroake ... " ) to the knight who challenges the Grim Reaper to a game of chess in Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal .
And Dennis Potter , the playwright behind Pennies From Heaven and The Singing Detective , who , when he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at 58 and given only months to live , offered a final interview to Melvyn Bragg .
It was intensely moving : he talked with furious glee about politics , media , religion and the decline of television while smoking cigarettes clutched in his psoriatic hands , alternately drinking champagne and sipping from a hip flask of liquid morphine .
He announced that he'd named his cancer after Rupert Murdoch , whom he blamed for " the pollution of British life " .
He died two months later .
We know , though , in our secret heart , that none of these brave strategies will actually stave off the Big Inevitable .
And that a mature response to the idea of death is not to ignore it , pretend it 'll never happen , or fight the idea of it , but to anticipate its arrival , to embrace the idea of it , always to be aware of its proximity .
Montaigne , in his essay " To Philosophise Is To Learn How To Die " , insisted that " Death has us by the scruff of the neck at every moment , " and counselled : " To begin depriving death of its greatest advantage over us , let us adopt a way contrary to the common one ; let us deprive death of its strangeness ; let us frequent it , let us get used to it ; let us have nothing more often in mind than death .
At every instant , let us evoke it in our imagination under all its aspects .
In the midst of joy and feasting , let our refrain be one which recalls our human condition ...
That is what the Egyptians did : in the midst of all their banquets and good cheer , they would bring in a mummified corpse , to serve as a warning to the guests . "
The mummified corpse is perhaps overdoing it , but you see what he means .
Montaigne thought we should have our noses rubbed in mortality to free us from being afraid of our human condition .
" A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave , " he wrote later .
" Knowing how to die gives us freedom from subjection and restraint . "
Few things illustrate this better than the English funeral , when compared to its Irish counterpart .
In England , mourners gather at the church , see only the closed casket and the flowers , bury them in a graveyard and retire to a relative 's house for tea and cakes .
In Ireland , an easy familiarity with death is the norm : friends and neighbours descend , en masse and uninvited , to view the deceased , lying on a bed or in an open coffin , to inspect their dead faces , stroke their hair , pat their flesh , clutch their arms and kiss them goodbye .
In England , mourners are hopeless at expressing sympathy or knowing what to say , relying on " Abide With Me " and priestly bromides to get by , while struggling not to give way to grief .
In Ireland , everyone says the same formulaic words ( " I 'm sorry for yer trouble " ) after which they tell stories about the deceased , get drunk and weep like the Kaieteur Falls .
And everyone goes home hoping their own funeral will be equally boisterous and fondly disposed towards the departed ( or , please God , even more so ) .
A good death , from the point of view of the bereaved , is a massive send - off with crowds of friends , speeches of admiration and a collection of meaningful music tracks from the dead person 's long , well - travelled and busily mouvemente life .
From the perspective of the dying person , who will know nothing of these happy funeral details , a good death is one that 's prepared and stage - managed , in which you get to say goodbye to those you love , put your affairs in order and " take a last look / at sunshine and brook , " before retiring to your deathbed , the prayers and the priests .
The trouble with this is knowing when to cease making final arrangements .
We are bewildered by the ideal of completion .
When do you decide you 've done enough to leave the world behind ?
An extreme case of pre-death micromanagement appears in the pages of Julian Barnes 's mature rumination on death , Nothing To Be Frightened Of .
It concerns Eugene O'Kelly , the 53 - year - old chief executive of a US accountancy firm and the boss of 20,000 employees , an A - type personality and a firm believer in management by schedule .
When diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer and given three months to live , he goes into scheduling overdrive .
He draws up " the final and most important to - do list of my life " for his last 100 days , identifying goals , targets and priorities .
He arranges his own funeral ( so it would be " the best death possible " ) , writes a book about death with the help of , appropriately , a ghost , and finally sets out to say goodbye .
" O'Kelly lists and categorises the friendships he needs to unwind , " Barnes writes .
" Even before he gets to his inner circle there are , astonishingly , a thousand names in his book .
But with the speed and attack of one used to closing deals , he completes the job in three weeks flat : sometimes with a note or phone call , occasionally with a brief meeting which might perhaps contain ' a perfect moment ' . "
He also made an urgent call to Almighty God , a slightly transparent piece of life - or - death insurance , having shown no inclination towards religious observance before .
Was he over - organising his own demise ?
No ; he was just retrospectively ordering his life like a man tidying up his desk , neatly arranging his files and stationery , his friendships and family baggage so that he could leave them all with a clear conscience .
Others , faced with the final , most awful deadline , might race to the Taj Mahal , the Pyramids and the Grand Canyon to tick them off their to - see list .
The vast majority , though , will settle for being at home , in bed , surrounded by favourite works of Trollope or Conan Doyle , listening to mid-period Pink Floyd or late Beethoven , dining on pâté and steak , vodka and Chateau Musar until they become incapable of anything stronger than intravenous sugar solution , with their loved ones only a couple of rooms away , ready at a moment 's notice to change the spring - loaded morphine drip ...
***
Maybe , though , the best death is simply the one you can organise for yourself , when the pain in your body exceeds your capacity to medicate it .
Take the case of the multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy .
Wheelchair - bound since 2001 , with her ability to perform everyday tasks progressively impaired , she went last autumn to the High Court ( fruitlessly , as it turned out ) to find out whether her husband , Omar , could be prosecuted ( and jailed for 14 years under the 1961 Suicide Act ) for helping her to kill herself .
A one - time jungle trekker and parachutist , she has watched her life slowly winding down since she was diagnosed with MS in 1995 .
As she becomes unable to use a wheelchair and enjoy the vestiges of an ordinary life with her husband , she 's prepared to step into oblivion at a moment she chooses , with help from Omar or from a Swiss clinic called Dignitas .
And who 's to say her moment of self - annihilation is n't superior to all the stage - managed , steak - and - wine - and - Beethoven deathbed scenes ?
Who would blame Jade Goody if , instead of waiting for the End to arrive , lik e a vast black night - bus , she seized the moment to kill the pain permanently , and stage - managed it for the TV cameras ?
Both Goody 's embrace of death - in - the - camera - lens and Purdy 's appeal to the courts call into question our relationship with death : how we conceal it , how we choose not to discuss it , how we approach its sudden acceleration in our lives , how it sits there at the end of our long journey like a dismal flag .
But also , how its abrupt nearness makes us contemplate our lives with a new clarity , to see all that is most precious to us in a new light , and to hold our loved ones closer .
And suddenly death does n't seem a cold , hostile and terrifying thing , but a kind of dark mirror that reflects your years of life and your identity back at you – that simultaneously finishes you off and makes you whole at last .
Final thoughts :
Touched by death
Felicity Warner
Author of ' Gentle Dying ' , and founder of the Hospice of the Heart Trust
I think we have an impoverished attitude to death , and it's a taboo that 's increasing .
We live in a culture focused on youth and materialism , but death is the one thing we can never resolve in our favour , so it produces huge fear .
People put off thinking about it , and hit it full - on without preparation .
We 're also not used to seeing death .
It used to be part of community life , but we have handed it over to the experts , who preside over it in institutions .
In losing that link , we have lost the comfort zone that comes with it and thrown away an important rite of passage .
Death brings its own wisdom and riches .
It 's a time when families get together , bring difficult issues to a close , and honour people .
I worked with a man called John who , aged just 37 , suffered complete organ failure after a heart attack .
He ended up in intensive care and , while he was surrounded by hi-tech machinery and incredible expertise , nobody was there to touch him or talk to him .
It illustrated how clinical modern death has become .
There is a better way .
I once worked with a woman in her forties who was in the final stages of breast cancer .
She was at home , so her children could snuggle up to her and play music , and was happy and serene , which often minimises pain and other symptoms .
She died , but her family 's involvement gave them a sense of empowerment that helped with grieving .
Havi Carel
Author of ' Illness ' and sufferer of a potentially fatal disease
I was diagnosed with a rare degenerative lung disease in April 2006 , when I was 35 .
My parents live in Israel , where I had the first scan .
When I confronted the radiologist , I spotted a line in his manual describing the disease .
It said that I had a prognosis of 10 years .
It was like a terrible nightmare .
For the first week I was in shock and did n't want to be alone .
You feel angry and jealous of others , and depressed and disempowered .
I had to learn to appreciate my finite existence and that every day is special .
You can no longer sustain the illusion that everything 's going to be OK .
It 's a bit like being a child ; you 've got this innocence and once it 's broken , you never get it back .
I 'm now taking an experimental drug that shows good results in some patients , and I 've been stable for a long time , which is good because you get tired of thinking about when you 're going to die .
Barry Albin
Funeral director at F A Albin & Sons , south London
My parents were funeral directors – you could say I 'm a thoroughbred .
There was a stigma attached to death when I was growing up ; children did n't want to come to my house to play , and shouted silly things at me .
My sons grew up above the shop , as I did , and have a healthy view of death .
I never had to explain what was behind the doors because they were never closed – the boys would see the work , and the bodies .
My mother died when I was 17 .
It was the worst thing she ever did to me , and the greatest gift she ever gave me , because I understood how painful grief can be .
For some , it 's like a cold that can be brushed off ; for others , it 's like life - threatening pneumonia .
A funeral is the most important event in a person 's life .
The bigger and better attended it is , the longer memories of the deceased last .
Children are the hardest to deal with .
Recently we did the funeral for a little boy who died of a terminal illness .
His sister has the same disease and the family know that when she 's the same age , she wo n't be with them either .
That funeral was the hardest thing I 've had to do .
Every evening since , at 5.30 pm , the father comes to my memorial garden to be with his son .
For him , building a new life is going to be hard , but he will .
He inspires me every time I see him .

I have been going into people 's homes for the past 28 years to nurse the terminally ill .
It 's very rewarding because you work so closely with patients and families .
A lot of our work is to give them a break .
Given the choice , I think we would all like to die in our own bed .
This is an important decision for families .
It means they are involved until the end and helps them to create good memories .
I recently nursed a 42 - year - old man who wanted to be treated at home so he could be involved in his children 's lives for as long as possible , and we helped that happen .
It 's impossible not to form a relationship with patients , especially in cases like that .
But it 's not as if you can't cry in front of the family when someone dies .
It shows that you care .

Bereaved son
Five years ago , my father , Leonard , died of lung cancer .
He was 78 , but might have lived to 100 if he had n't smoked all his life .
It was a shock to see this big strong man in bed , so weak and bruised .
I told him that I was proud of him .
We had n't always seen eye to eye , but I told him that I was grateful for the opportunities he 'd given me and for his being a really great dad .
He shrugged , quizzically , but I 'm glad I said it , and I think it meant something to him .
It sounds perverse to view deaths as good , but my dad had a good death .
He did n't go out in a blaze of glory , but he was at home surrounded by people that loved him .
Angela Carby
Cancer patient
Six years ago , I discovered a lump in my breast .
My mum had died of breast cancer so it was n't a great shock .
I had it removed and had radiotherapy , but it was too late – the cancer had already spread to my lungs and beyond .
Since then I 've had surgery , radiotherapy , hormone treatment and chemotherapy – everything they can throw at it .
My oncologist has produced cards from up his sleeve when we have hit brick walls , but there 's nothing much he can do about the tumours in my brain .
I can't think too much about the future .
One of the few things I 've been able to plan is my funeral .
I do n't want a flashy coffin or anything like that – I think it 's a waste of money .
I want single roses and I 've made a CD of the music I like .
When the time comes , I 'd like it to happen the way I like it .
Death is always there in the background , especially on off days .
But you 're born , you live , you die – that 's how I look at it .
I 'm only 50 but I 'm prepared for the inevitable .
For me , death is something I no longer fear .
Cathy Newsam
Ward sister , St Wilfrid 's Hospice , Chichester
People imagine hospices to be full of sadness , but there 's actually a lot of laughter .
And it 's not as if everybody who comes in dies – a good percentage of patients go home in the end .
It 's a wonderful place to work .
We have time to get to know patients and their families , and it's a privilege to work with them .
I think I 'd find it hard to work in a hospital with all that rush and bustle – hospices have peaceful atmospheres .
We have lovely rooms that , in the summer , open on to the garden , and patients are pushed in their beds into the sunlight .
Cats and dogs can visit , and we even had a horse visit a patient once .
You can't nurse like that in a hospital .
Our aim is to allow patients to have a peaceful death .
It is n't always possible but it's what we strive for .
We 're sad when people die – it would n't be right if we were n't – but knowing we 've done our best to make their final journey as comfortable as possible helps us to cope .

No matter how sophisticated modern medicine becomes , common ailments like fungal infections can outrun the best of the world 's antibiotics .
In people with compromised immune systems ( like premature babies , AIDS victims or those undergoing chemotherapy for cancer ) the risk is very high : contracting a fungal infection can be deadly .
Now Tel Aviv University zoologists are diving deep into the sea to collect unique chemicals — drugs of the future — to beat unnecessary death by fungal infection .
And their secret weapon is the common marine sponge .
Prof. Micha Ilan from the Department of Zoology at TAU , who is heading the project , has already identified several alternative antibiotic candidates among the unique compounds that help a sponge fend off predators and infections .
He and his graduate students are now identifying , isolating and purifying those that could be the super - antibiotics of the future .
The research group at TAU has found and isolated thousands bacteria and fungi , including a few hundred unique actinobacteria .
So far , several tens hold promise as new drugs .
From the Sea to the Lab
" Resistance to antibiotics has become an unbelievably difficult challenge for the medical community , " says Prof .
Ilan .
" Sponges are known for hosting an arsenal of compounds that could work to fight infections .
We 're now culturing huge amounts of microorganisms , such as actinobacteria , that live in symbiosis with marine sponges . "
Marine sponges were recently made famous by the popular Nickelodeon TV cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants , which features a sea sponge who lives in a pineapple beneath the ocean .
In real life , sea sponges are animals whose bodies consist of an outer thin layer of cells and an inner mass of cells and skeletal elements .
The sedentary creatures do n't really have the sort of adventurous life that the cartoon depicts .
Marine sponges can't move .
Glued to the seafloor , they must rely on the flow of water through their bodies to collect food and to remove waste .
This has led to a unique adaptive response to enemies and competition .
Sponges do n't have teeth , or shells , but protect themselves by building associations and partnerships with bacteria and fungi .
Tel Aviv University is tapping into these relationships — looking at the same chemicals that the sponge uses for defense to fight infection in humans .
Research Combines Several Fields of Study
Drug developers have known for decades about the potential goldmine of pharmaceuticals in the marine environment , particularly among sedentary life like marine sponges .
" One of the major problems is that these novel and natural compounds are found in very small quantities , " Prof .
Ilan explains .
Collecting and extracting such large amounts of these unique chemicals would require huge quantities of animals to be sacrificed , a practice which is not in line with zoological conservationist values .
So Prof .
Ilan takes cultures from sea sponges with minimal damage to the natural environment .
He then grows their symbionts and tests them in a " wet " laboratory .
The methods Prof .
Ilan has perfected can now be used by other scientists developing pharmaceuticals from marine sponges .
" Our research is unique in that we take both an agricultural and microbiological approach — not found often in the drug discovery community , " says Prof .
Ilan , whose work is done in collaboration with the School of Chemistry 's Prof .
Yoel Kashman and Prof. Shmuel Carmeli .
A man walks into a restaurant with a full - grown ostrich behind him .
The waitress asks them for their orders .
The man says , ‘ A hamburger , fries and a coke , ’ and turns to the ostrich , ‘ What ’s yours ? ’
‘ I ’ll have the same , ’ says the ostrich .
A short time later the waitress returns with the order ‘ That will be $ 9.40 please , ’ and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment .
The next day , the man and the ostrich come again and the man says , ‘ A hamburger , fries and a coke ’
The ostrich says , ‘ I ’ll have the same . ’
Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change .
This becomes routine until the two enter again .
‘ The usual ? ’ asks the waitress .
‘ No , this is Friday night , so I will have a steak , baked potato and a salad , ’ says the man .
‘ Same , ’ says the ostrich .
Shortly the waitress brings the order and says , ‘ That will be $ 32.62 . ’
Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table .
The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer .
‘ Excuse me , sir .
How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time ?
‘ Well , ’ says the man , ‘ several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp .
When I rubbed it , a Genie apeared and offered me two wishes .
My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything , I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there . ’
‘ That ’s brilliant ! ’ says the waitress .
Most people would ask for a million dollars or something , but you ’ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live .
It ’s brilliant !’
‘ That ’s right .
Whether it ’s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce , the exact amount of money is always there , ’ says the man .
The waitress asks , ‘ What ’s with the ostrich ? ’
The man sighs , pauses and answers , ‘ My second wish was for a tall chick with a big butt and long legs who agrees with everything I say . ’

A senior U.S. official Thursday expressed strong disagreement with the British decision to begin contacts with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , revealing a rare split between the two closely allied nations .
The official said the Obama administration does n’t believe , as the British do , that there are separate military , political and social wings of the Shiite Muslim militia group , and that it is acceptable to deal with the political wing .
He expressed revulsion for the group , which is a major part of Lebanon ’s elected government but officially listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization .
“ We do n’t see the differences between the integrated leadership that they see , ” said the official , who was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity , citing the diplomatic sensitivity of the discussions .
Hezbollah , with support from Iran and Syria , is a dominating presence in the Shiite communities of central and southern Lebanon .
It includes a social welfare organization as well as a political party and a military force .
Hezbollah has been behind a number of killings , its targets including Americans , and it is a major antagonist of Israel .

British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said last week that the British government had decided to begin low - level contacts with the group as a means of communicating with an organization that has an important role in the governing of Lebanon .
He said the British intended to emphasize in these talks , for example , that it was time to disband militias that exert factional power in the ethnically divided country .
Gordon Duguid , a State Department spokesman , said Friday that the United States was not ready to follow the British example , but he did not criticize the decision .
The Obama administration ’s readiness to reach out to adversary regimes , such as Syria and Iran , has been a key point of its foreign policy .
But the administration has shown no interest in talking to groups on its terrorist registry , such as Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas .
A State Department official explained that the difference is that governments such as Syria and Iran , though they may support terrorism , can be productively engaged because they can be swayed on the basis of their national interest .
Unlike groups branded as terrorist , “ they have the interests of states and may respond to interaction , ” this official said .

The senior U.S. official said the British had discussed their plans with the Bush administration but had not communicated on the subject with the new administration .
The official said he was appalled that Hezbollah has been hanging posters in Lebanon celebrating the slain Imad Mughniyah , an accused terrorist mastermind that Hezbollah has long said was not connected to its organization .
Mughniyah , assassinated in Damascus , the Syrian capital , in February 2008 , was believed responsible for a long list of attacks and had a U.S. bounty on his head .
The British , who discontinued talks with Hezbollah in 2005 , last year added the organization ’s military wing to their list of designated terrorist groups .
Europe as a whole has been divided on the wisdom of engaging with the group .
British Embassy officials in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment .
David Schenker , who was a Pentagon specialist on the Middle East during the Bush years , said the British may be positioning themselves to deal with Hezbollah if the group wins elections in June that could put it and its allies in control of the government .

But he said the British move would be “ unhelpful ” to the Obama administration ’s efforts to begin collaboration on Mideast issues that could involve Iran , Syria and Lebanon , and to further the Israeli - Palestinian peace effort .
Hezbollah leaders , who have been eager to win international legitimacy , have praised the British action .

About this time last year , Roger Clemens was on Capitol Hill fending off the testimony of his former personal trainer , who said he injected the pitcher with steroids and human growth hormone .
One year later , Clemens remains in the news -- a federal grand jury has convened in Washington to determine whether to indict him for lying under oath to Congress when he denied taking performance - enhancing drugs , ESPN.com 's Mike Fish is reporting .
The events have led Astros owner Drayton McLane to say that Clemens will not attend spring training next month in Kissimmee , Fla. , to work out with and instruct Houston 's minor league players .
" We have no plan for Roger Clemens , " McLane told the Houston Chronicle for Thursday 's editions .
" His [ oldest ] son , Koby , is in our minor league system and is making progress , and if [ Roger ] wants to come and be a fan , absolutely . "
The 46 - year - old Clemens last pitched in the majors as a New York Yankee in 2007 after having spent the 2004 - 06 seasons with the Astros .
Last February , he threw batting practice to Astros minor leaguers at spring training on a voluntary basis .
He has a 10 - year personal services contract with the club that will not kick in until he officially retires .
" He kind of came on his own last year and I thought that presented too much confusion , with all the media around these 19 - to 25 - year - olds , " McLane told the New York Daily News on Tuesday .
" That 's putting a lot of pressure on these young men . "
Clemens has yet to indicate when he would retire officially .
" [ The clause in his personal services contract ] would not go into effect until he 's ready , " McLane told the Daily News .
" And then I 'd talk with him and Alan and Randy Hendricks [ the pitcher 's agents ] .
Neither Alan or Randy has contacted me in the last two years .
" We 'll let the case develop , but I have n't yet pursued that avenue [ of voiding the personal services clause ] . "
The Astros are n't alone in distancing themselves from Clemens .
In November , the seven - time Cy Young Award winner was asked to end his involvement with a charity golf tournament he had hosted for four years because of the fallout from the Mitchell report .
In December , it was announced that the year - old Roger Clemens Institute for Sports Medicine would no longer carry his name .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Our article last Friday exposing the familiar old rightwing corporate machine behind the fake “ tea party ” protests , and Rick Santelli ’s highly questionable role as the one - man MC for the protests ’ launch event , wound up crashing the tea party ’s mojo , and forcing Santelli to issue a giant apologia on CNBC ’s site .
It ’s titled “ I Want To Set The Record Straight , ” but it should be called , “ I want to keep my shitty second - fiddle job and not get thrown out of my 2,500 square foot house . ”
You can hear Rick ’s pain as the spiked CNBC legal department butt - plug is shoved deeper and deeper in , paragraph after paragraph … especially this one line that will have Santelli sleeping on his stomach for months , where he bleats : “ I hope that the President and the final stimulus plan succeed . ”
Thank you sir , may I have another !
Meanwhile , CNBC ’s attack dogs are now after the tea party sites to make sure that the damage to their credibility is contained .
An article just published on AP , headlined , “ CNBC says ranting Rick Santelli is not affiliated with political site that uses his name , ” says that CNBC forced one of the Santelli - promoting tea party sites to take down his likeness and come clean about its very un-grassrootsy character :
Santelli ’s name was stripped from headlines on the home page of http://www.reteaparty.com
Monday after its operator was made aware of CNBC ’s dissatisfaction .
The site was operating within 24 hours after the reporter ’s self - described rant on Feb. 19 , when he said the president ’s plan to help people in danger of home foreclosure was “ promoting bad behavior . ”
… Before it was altered Monday , the Web site described “ Rick Santelli ’s Re- Tea Party ” four times on its home page , urging people to organize for protests .
It had an “ About Rick ” link with the CNBC on - air editor ’s profile , saying he “ voiced the sentiment of millions of Americans on the stock market floor . ”
Scroll down to the small print at the bottom of the page and there ’s a disclaimer saying the site is a grass - roots effort promoted by the Political Exploration and Awareness Committee and that the “ opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Rick Santelli . ”
Which is interesting , because wouldntchaknowit , the rightwing Republican magazine Weekly Standard just posted an article this weekend strangely timed to promote the now - discredited ( by Re- Tea Party itself ) AstroTurf image that the website is just a basement DIY project .
Titled “ Gonna Have A Tea Party , ” its author , Jonathan V. Last , makes himself the last journalist on this planet to get to the real truth behind Re-Real Tea Party ’s PAC - funded heart :
Anthony Astolfi bought the domain reTeaParty.com about 10 hours after Santelli ’s rant .
Astolfi is a 24 - year - old web designer and small - time political consultant who dabbled in the Ron Paul world last cycle .
He thought the tea party idea had a chance to catch on and decided to organize them for July 4 .
Working with his roommate and a cousin , they finished building a website by midnight .
Then they turned to promoting the project .
They did Google searches for “ Santelli ” and left comments pointing to their new site on high - ranking result pages .
They spent a couple hundred dollars on a small number of Google and YouTube ads and finally went to bed around 5 A.M .
They awoke to 40,000 emails , their site having become a minor sensation .
Astolfi says they now have 11,000 people a day coming to reTeaParty.com .
Ten thousand people have signed up to get information on the tea parties , and 5,000 have “ pledged ” to attend one of so - far eight tea parties on July 4 .
Jeepers
Wally , is n’t it amazing what a couple a kids acting on their own grassroots selves can do ?
With just a li’l elbow grease , enthusiasm , and , er , a shady PAC sugardaddy … but we wo n’t talk about that in the Weekly Standard , will we ?
For some reason — call it “ fear of getting busted ” — all sorts of Santelli / Tea Party shills have been coming out of the closet with their shady affiliations .
Like Megan McArdle , who has been leading the attempt to discredit our investigation from her blog at the mighty Atlantic Monthly online .
Yesterday she threw in this disclaimer at the end of one of her many obsessive blog posts attacking our article :
“ Full disclosure :
It ’s pretty much an open secret in DC , but given the content of the article I ’m discussing , I think I ought to mention that I live with Peter Suderman , who once worked for Freedomworks .
Other than giving me the name of the right employee to email to make inquiries ( no word back yet ) , I have n’t asked him about his former employer , and he has n’t told me anything .
I debated whether to write about this , but since I ’m not actually defending Freedomworks , I think it ’s kosher . ”
Right , so even though Megan has about as gigantic a conflict - of - interest as is humanly imaginable–namely , she spoons every night with a guy who was on Freedomworks ’ payroll — and even though her article absolutely defends Freedomworks by attempting to discredit Freedomworks ’ critics — she nevertheless concludes , against all logic , “ I think it ’s kosher . ”
Speaking as two Jews to a McArdle , we want you to know that your conflict - of - interest is about as kosher as a bacon - cheese - and - crab - melt sandwich .
Elizabeth Strout 's " Olive Kitteridge " Wins Pulitzer Prize for Fiction
Get ready to discuss this book with your mom and her book club friends .
Elizabeth Strout has won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel " Olive Kitteridge , " a discontinuous narrative ( a bunch of linked short stories ) about a 7th grade math teacher in small town New England .
You get 10 grand for winning a Pulitzer .
The book has to be about America somehow .
I have n't read " Olive Kitteridge , " nor have I ever heard of it before .
It 's hard to say anything about a book you have n't read , but I think this book is a difficult sales proposition : " Hey , you want to read about the private strife and anxiety of that junior high math teacher that you hate so much , the flinty obese lady all full of bitterness , rage , and contempt , the one that made you hate math forever , which is why now you are poor and useless to the World of Science and Business ? " Maybe I do and maybe I do n't .
Of course , the only reason I would read such a book would be for medicinal purposes .
Some kind of enema of the soul to purge myself of my own sins .
Here are the other finalists , according to the official citation : " Also nominated as finalists in this category were : " The Plague of Doves " by Louise Erdrich ( HarperCollins ) , a haunting novel that explores racial discord , loss of land and changing fortunes in a corner of North Dakota where Native Americans and whites share a tangled history ; and " All Souls " by Christine Schutt ( Harcourt ) , a memorable novel that focuses on the senior class at an exclusive all - girl Manhattan prep school where a beloved student battles a rare cancer , fiercely honest , carefully observed and subtly rendered . " Maybe I am a horrible person , but these selections all seem like the books you have to read in 7th grade .
You know , they come in " class sets " and each one has a number written in magic marker on the top left front cover .
You have to turn them back in when the unit on " novels " is done .
You have to discuss themes , characterization , irony , and metaphor .
Every time you are called on to speak you get a point .
You have to get ten points to get an A .
You have to write a two - page essay at the end of the six weeks and you can't write in pen .
" Discuss how Olive changes over the course of the novel and what she learns from her life experiences .
Compare and contrast her experience to the life journeys of either Tom Joad or Macbeth .
" Reading these books , you start to hate literature .
Even if you do still like books , you start to avoid the Pulitzer Prize winners at all costs if you can help it .
You only read cheap romance novels .
You turn to drugs .
You get pregnant .
You end up working at Denny 's and dealing meth out of the kitchen .
You abuse your kid and your boyfriend abuses your kid even worse .
The kid grows up and becomes a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist for her book about race relations in Montana during the 1960's .
At night , she eats huge plates of greasy eggs and undercooked bacon from shitty New York diners and weeps ...
The thing that stands out most to me about Ghostpatrol 's street graffiti is how each of his pieces are so remarkably different and original .
Incredibly innovative and driven by creative impulses , Ghostpatrol has been described as dark , moody , energetic and passionate .
A self taught illustrator who currently resides in Melbourne , Australia , GP specializes in fine ink drawing , graffiti , commissioned murals and soft sculpture .
Here are some of his best street pieces .

Israelis on Friday got a fuller dose of rank - and - file angst over their army ’s winter assault on the Gaza Strip , as newspapers elaborated on allegations that commanders created a permissive attitude toward the killing of civilians .
Soldiers ’ accounts of two killings of women and children appeared Thursday in Haaretz and Maariv .
Both papers followed up Friday with lengthy excerpts of the soldiers ’ comments about confusion and doubt over the rules of engagement during the 22 - day offensive , which left an estimated 1,400 Palestinians dead .
The accounts came from a Feb. 13 discussion at a military preparatory academy .
The school ’s director , Danny Zamir , who led the discussion , disclosed the transcript this week .
Here are recollections of Aviv , a squad commander in the elite Givati Brigade , other Givati soldiers and an air force pilot .
The transcript did n’t use their full names .
--

AVIV : Toward the end of the operation , there was a plan to go into a very densely populated area inside Gaza City .
In the briefings , they started to talk about orders for opening fire inside the city , because as you know they used a huge amount of firepower and killed a huge number of people along the way , so that we would n’t get hurt and [ Hamas militants ] would n’t fire on us .
At first the specified action was to go into a house . . . with an armored personnel carrier . . . and start shooting inside .
. . .
I call this murder .
. . .
We were supposed to go up floor by floor , and any person we identified , we were supposed to shoot .
I initially asked myself , “ Where is the logic ? ”
They said it was permissible because anyone who remained in the sector was in effect condemned , a terrorist , because they had n’t fled .
I did n’t really understand .
. . .
They do n’t have anywhere to flee to .
. . .
This scared me a bit .
I tried to exert some influence , insofar as is possible [ in ] my subordinate position , to change this .
In the end the specification involved going into a house , operating megaphones and telling [ the occupants ] , “ Come on , everyone get out .
You have five minutes .
Leave the house .
Anyone who does n’t get out gets killed . ”
Advertisement
I went to our soldiers and said , “ The order has changed .
We go into the house , they have five minutes to escape , we check each person who goes out . . . to see that he has no weapons , and then we start going into the house floor by floor to clean it out .
. . .
This means going into the house , opening fire at everything that moves , throwing a grenade , all those things . ”
One of my soldiers came to me and asked , “ Why ? ” I said , “ What is n’t clear ?
We do n’t want to kill innocent civilians . ”
He goes , “ Yeah ?
Anyone who ’s in there is a terrorist , that ’s a known fact . ”
I said , “ Do you think the people there will run away ?
No one will run away . ”
He says , “ That ’s clear , ” and then his buddies join in , “ We need to murder any person who ’s in there .
Yeah , any person who ’s in Gaza is a terrorist , ” and all the other things that they stuff our heads with , in the media .
And then I try to explain to the guy that not everyone in there is a terrorist , and that after he kills , say , three children and four mothers , we ’ll go upstairs and kill another 20 or so people .
. . .
I tried to explain why we had to let them leave .
. . .
It did n’t really help .
This is really frustrating , to see that they understand that inside Gaza you are allowed to do anything you want , to break down doors for no other reason than it ’s cool .

Aviv then described how a sharpshooter killed an elderly woman who had come within 100 yards of a commandeered house .
--
ZAMIR : I do n’t understand .
Why did he shoot her ?
AVIV : That ’s what is so nice , supposedly , about Gaza :
You see a person on a road .
. . .
He does n’t have to be with a weapon . . . and you can just shoot him .
With us it was an old woman , on whom I did n’t see any weapon .
The order was to take that person out , that woman , the moment you see her .
Advertisement
ZVI : Aviv ’s descriptions are accurate , but it ’s possible to understand where this is coming from .
And that woman . . . she was n’t supposed to be there , because there were announcements and there were bombings .
Logic says she should n’t be there .
The way you describe it , as murder in cold blood , that is n’t right .
It ’s known they have lookouts .
GILAD : Even before we went in , the battalion commander made it clear to everyone that a very important lesson from the second Lebanon war was the way the [ army ] goes in : with a lot of fire .
The intention was to protect soldiers ’ lives by means of firepower .
In the operation , the [ army ’s ] losses really were light and the price was that a lot of Palestinians got killed .
--
Ram , who serves in a Givati Brigade operations company , described a sniper ’s killing of a woman and her two children as they walked near a no - go area by mistake .
Advertisement
ZAMIR : After a killing like that , do they do some sort of investigation in the [ army ] ?
MOSHE : The attitude is very simple :
It is n’t pleasant to say so , but no one cares at all .
We are n’t investigating this .
This is what happens during fighting and this is what happens during routine security .
ZAMIR : Among the pilots , is there talk or thoughts of remorse ?
For example , I was terribly surprised by the enthusiasm surrounding the killing of the Gaza traffic police on the first day of the operation .
They took out 180 traffic cops .
As a pilot , I would have questioned that .
GIDEON : Tactically speaking , you call them “ police . ”
In any case , they are armed and belong to Hamas .

We already know that IKEA is debuting a line of solar - powered lights ; could the Swedish giant actually enter the eco-friendly car market ?
The Internet is abuzz about a mysterious yet official - looking French website that appeared today .
The site touts the LEKO , an environmentally - friendly IKEA - branded concept car .
A video on the LEKO site says that the car is a modular design that can act as either a coupe or convertible .
The car apparently also has the full backing of the World Wildlife Fund France , though it ’s not clear if that means the WWF is contributing to the LEKO ’s development or just endorsing it .
There ’s a distinct possibility that the LEKO video and site are the viral warning shots for someone ’s April Fools ’
Day hoax .
The LEKO is absent from the IKEA website , and most importantly , the car will be unveiled on April Fools ’ Day .
But hey , stranger things , right ?
April 1 - 7 is France ’s Sustainable Development Week , and IKEA already offers “ kit homes ” shipped in flatpacks to customers in Northern England and Scandinavia .
I hope we can get a LEKO in Swedish blue and yellow .
We wonder , though , if a car made by IKEA might ship to customers in pieces to DIY like the images below .
Scientists Develop Ultra-Efficient Biomass Charcoal Heater
February 10th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Millions of people around the world heat their homes with charcoal burned on small grills .
Now a group of Japanese scientists has developed a biomass charcoal combustion heater with a thermal efficiency of 60 - 81 percent — a big step up from current biomass stoves , which have an efficiency of 46 - 53 percent .
The heater could be especially useful in Japan , where biomass is a plentiful source of renewable energy .
According to scientists , large - scale use of the biomass charcoal combustion heater could potentially cut CO2 emissions by 4.46 million tons .

Have you ever been dissatisfied with your life or perhaps have complained because of a disability condition that prevents you from doing things you ’d like to do ?
Just be glad that you do n’t have any of the rare conditions on this list .
If you ’re interested in weird phenomenon , take a look at this list of top 24 strange diseases .
24 . Moebius Syndrome
Simply put , Moebius Syndrome is a condition that causes facial paralysis .
It forms at birth and is also thought to be some sort of genetic disorder .
Existent in only 2 to 30 people out of every 1 million , Moebius Syndrome affects the person ’s ability to follow objects with his or her eyes , and show facial expressions .
People with this disorder are also unable to close their eyes and are normally cross eyed .
People with this disease can live a normal life with no major medical issues caused by this disease .
However , they will most likely have social issues since they ca n’t show emotion through their facial expression .
It cold also be said that they ’re limited in the occupations that they choose as customer service opportunities would n’t be a good fit as the public could mistake their intentions and feel that they are disinterested .
Examples of Moebius Syndrome : Take a look at the old school cartoon character Droopy Dog ( 1943 – 1958 ) .
Does Droopy suffer from Moebius Syndrome ?
Could be !
23 . Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva ( FOP ) , present in approximately 1 million people , is a genetic disorder in which muscle tissue , ligaments , and tendons are gradually replaced with bone .
Over time this can cause serious issues with mobility , speaking , and even eating .
Some people with the disease suffer from malnutrition due to their difficulties with eating .
This disease can also affect the person ’s breathing as there can be extra bone that forms around the rib cage .
The disease tends to progress further with injuries .
So a person with this disease should be careful on stairs and avoid such activities such as football , skate boarding and rough sex .
Whew !
Are n’t you glad this is a rare disease ?
22 . True Hermaphroditism
True hermaphroditism is a disease in which a person is born with both male and female reproductive organs .
Though this may sound like a novelty as you can imagine that with this disease one would not ever have to or want to date , the disease is really a burden and quite serious .
Hermaphrodites are usually born with smaller and not completely formed genitals and reproductive organs .
Now it does n’t sound as appealing , does it ?
In earlier years , doctors and parents would guess at which gender the child should be raised which would be very confusing to the child and often times the opposite gender was dominant in the child .
Nowadays , they do DNA testing to determine which gender is dominant in the child ; however , it does n’t really take away the feelings of confusion and embarrassment for the individual .
21 . Jumping Frenchman of Maine Disorder
The Jumping Frenchman of Maine Disorder is a disease that affects the neurological center .
A person with this condition will overreact or have an exaggerated reaction when startled .
If a person without the disorder were to jump a little from something that startled them , someone with this disorder may jump so that it ’s more visible , flail their arms , and / or shout out loud .
Another side effect of this disorder is that when startled , the person will obey a command when given .
For instance if you were standing on a cliff with a person with this disorder and you unexpectedly yelled , “ JUMP OFF THE CLIFF ” they would most likely comply .
Though these people may seem fun at parties , this disorder must be a horrible burden to someone who has it since it ’s quite possible that they are tormented by others .
So , if you feel you have this disorder , stop reading now so you do n’t get startled – BOO !
20 . Cutaneous Porphyria ( Vampire Disease )
Cutaneous Porphyria is also often referred to as the “ Vampire Disease ” .
It ’s actually a deficiency of enzymes in the body .
The main symptom and inconvenience with this disease is that when the person is exposed to sunlight , they develop horrible , itchy blisters and welts .
So , from that you can figure out why this condition is nicknamed “ Vampire Disease ” ; these people must stay out of the sunlight .
19 . Proteus Syndrome
This is a disease where there is unusual bone growth of the skin and head causing the individual with the disease to look deformed .
The syndrome often precedes tumors all over the person ’s body .
This is a very rare condition and there are currently just a little over 100 cases currently worldwide .
An individual with the disease will most likely experience other health issues due to this disorder .
The individual ’s head will be growing at an accelerated rate , which could cause health issues .
Other health issues may include pulmonary problems due to the malformation of blood vessels .
An example of this disease was depicted in the movie “ Mask ” ( 1985 ) with Cher and starring Eric Stoltz as Rocky Dennis ( the boy with the disease ) .
18 . Congenital Insensitivity to Pain
Imagine that you ’re using a knife in the kitchen and all of a sudden you cut yourself .
It breaks the skin and in fact , the cut is rather deep .
The problem is that you do n’t feel the pain .
This is what congenital insensitivity to pain is all about .
It ’s a rare disorder , but it does exist .
Its cause is that there are too many endorphins being released to the brain at one time .
You may ask yourself what the problem is .
There are times that we would give anything not to feel any pain .
However , consider the consequences of this .
If you did n’t feel any pain , you may not notice that you ’re cutting your finger .
There ’s no reaction to pull away , so you could quite possibly cut off your finger .
You could experience third degree burns and broken bones without even knowing that anything ’s wrong .
Essentially people with congenital insensitivity to pain are at risk for seriously damaging their body .
The up side to this is that a kid with this disorder does n’t have to worry about losing many fights !
17 . Cotard ’s Syndrome ( Often called Walking Corpse Syndrome )
Cotard ’s syndrome , named after the neurologist that discovered the disorder in one of his patients is a rare mental disorder in which a person thinks that they ’re dead or that they do n’t have a soul .
Often nicknamed “ walking corpse syndrome ” , this disorder is believed to be linked to other psychological disorders such as schizophrenia .
This is actually dangerous to one ’s health because in some cases , the people have been known to starve themselves because they think they ’re dead and do n’t have to eat .
In one particular case , a man was starving himself because he believed that he did n’t have a stomach .
16 . Capgras Syndrome
Can you imagine waking up one morning next to your spouse to discover that they ’re not your spouse at all , but rather an imposter ?
People who suffer from Capgras Syndrome would know exactly how that feels .
This is a mental disorder where the individual is under the delusion that a person , normally someone close to them such as a close family member or spouse has been replaced by an identical looking imposter .
Though it would be almost too easy to torment someone with this condition for your own amusement , it ’s a serious disorder that could potentially be dangerous .
If the person feels threatened by the so called “ imposter ” , he or she could potentially kill them out of what they believe would be self defense .
15 . Blaschko’s Lines
Blaschko’s lines is a very rare condition in which an individual develops marks on their skin resembling stripes .
Generally , the person will exhibit “ V ” shapes on his or her back and spine area and “ S ” shaped swirls on his or her stomach or back .
This is not just a disease that people get , but there have also been know occurrences in cats and dogs .
14 . Trichotillomania
Have you ever been so stressed , angry , or upset that you ’ve threatened or joked about pulling your hair out ?
This is actually a real mental disorder that about 1 % of the population has and it ’s called Trichotillomania .
This disorder is where an individual has the urge to pull out his or her hair ; not just on his or her head , but all hair !
The person can have the urge to pull out scalp hair , facial hair , nose hair , eyebrows and eyelash hair , and even pubic hair .
This disorder usually shows up in teens due to stress , confusion , and pressures that teens face .
However , there have been reports of such from children as young as one year old .
13 . Jerusalem Syndrome
Whenever you go on vacation and go site seeing with the rest of the tourists , you expect to have a relatively good time and you also expect to come back just as sane as you left .
However , there have been quite a few cases where people have visited the Jerusalem and lost their minds !
Jerusalem syndrome is an occurrence where a person visits Jerusalem and has religious delusions or psychotic events .
Most times when this happens , the individual returns to the same mental state as before once he or she leaves the city .
However , there have been some cases where the person has stayed in this state of psychosis .
12 . Genital Retraction Syndrome
Just the name of this disorder is enough to make you wince , is n’t it ?
Do n’t worry ; no one ’s genitals are retracting .
Genital retraction syndrome is a mental disorder in which an individual ( mainly men ) thinks that their penis ( or breasts for women ) is shrinking and in some cases think that it has completely disappeared .
Hence , this disorder is also sometimes called “ penis panic ” .
What I find ironic is that name of the disorder indicates that the penis is shrinking or retracting back into the body .
If you have this disorder and you really feel that this is the case , your fears are only confirmed when you hear what the name of your disorder is .
11 . Blue Skin Disorder
Do you remember watching “ Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory ” ( 1971 ) when you were younger ?
Do you remember the little girl whose skin turned blue because she was turning into a blueberry ( Violet Beauregarde played by Denise Nickerson ) ?
There is a real disease out there in which the skin really does turn blue .
Blue Skin Syndrome is a very rare disease and is caused by an abnormality in the hemoglobin .
10 . Alien Hand Syndrome ( AHS )
In the movie “ Evil Dead II ” ( 1987 ) , we watch Ash fight his own hand because his hand is trying to kill him .
There is actually a real disease where the individual ’s dominant hand will seem to take on a mind of its own .
Though it ’s highly unlikely that this rogue hand would try to injure or kill someone , it ’s very possible that it could stroke or grope an object or another person .
The individual with AHS has no idea that this is going on with their hand until they see it with their own eyes or it ’s brought to their attention .
This type of neurological condition can occur after brain surgery or in stroke patients .
9. Alice in Wonderland Syndrome ( AIWS )
Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is a rare condition is which objects are distorted in size .
If you recall the Walt Disney movie “ Alice in Wonderland ” ( 1951 ) Alice would get really large and then would shrink in size .
A person with this disorder does n’t get the sensation that they ’re getting larger or smaller , but rather the object around them are changing size , and in some cases shape .
8. Aquagenic Urticaria
As you may suspect because of the prefix “ aqua ” , aquagenic urticaria is an allergy to water .
This a very rare condition in which a person gets itchy hives , and in severe cases , painful welts when coming in contact with water .
Could you imagine even taking a shower would be uncomfortable or even painful for you ?
7. Pica
Do you remember the child in elementary school that would always eat the paste ?
It ’s possible that he or she had an eating disorder called pica .
It ’s prominent in about 25 % of all children and is a disorder where a child craves non -food items such as glue or paste , dirt , clay , laundry starch , cigarette butts , dirt , clay , laundry starch , feces , and toothpaste .
It must be an adventure for other children around them .
Can you imagine what other kids will try to make them eat ?
It kind of turns your stomach does n’t it ?
6. Trimethylaminuria
Often called “ fish odor syndrome ” or “ fish malodor syndrome ” , trimethylaminuria is a metabolic disorder which makes an individual ’s breath , urine , and perspiration have a strong fish odor .
Caused by an enzyme deficiency , these people are often not popular among humans , but have a great following with the feline population .
5. Progeria
Progeria is an extremely rare genetic condition that only happens in one out of every 8 million births .
Often called the rapid aging disease , children with progeria have an average life span of only 13 years old though there have been a few rare cases of people surviving into their late teens and early twenties .
If you ’re familiar with the disease , you ’ll notice that all children with it have similar physical characteristics .
4. Elephantiasis
Elephantiasis is a disorder where there is a severe thickening in the skin that normally occurs in the limbs ( particularly the legs ) and genitals .
An affected man ’s scrotum can be enlarge up to the size of a basketball .
So , you could quite literally say that he has “ great big ones ” .
This disease is caused by parasitic worms and transmitted by mosquitoes .
Most cases of elephantiasis are found in Africa .
3. Parasitic Twin
A parasitic twin is similar to a Siamese or conjoined twin , but with a major difference .
The cause is the same in that the twins never fully separated .
The difference is that a parasitic twin is completely dependent on survival from the other twin .
The parasitic twin may appear as an additional leg , for example .
Is this what they mean with statistics that show that the average family has 2.5 kids ?
2. Hypertrichosis
Hypertrichosis is a very hairy situation .
Also called the “ werewolf syndrome ” , this is a rare disorder where an individual has hair all over his or her body .
This is so rare that there have only been about 50 cases verified in history .
Just remember this disorder when you complain about shaving your face every morning .
Could you imagine going in for a wax ?
Ouch !
1. Necrotizing Fasciitis
Often called “ flesh eating bacteria ” or “ flesh eating disease ” , necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deep layers of skin on a person ’s body .
Actually , the term “ flesh eating ” is very misleading because the bacteria does n’t actually eat the flesh but instead deteriorates the flesh .
When , in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one to dissolve the political bonds which have connected him with his government , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature entitle him , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that he should declare the causes which impel him to the separation .
I hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
That to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends , it is one ’s right to alter or to abolish one ’s allegiance , in the hopes of instituting a new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is the right of the individual , it is his duty , to oppose such government , and to do what ’s necessary to provide new guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of citizens of these United states ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government .
The history of most recent past and present presidents and legislators of the United States of America is a history of repeated civil rights violations , constitutional travesties , usurpations of state ’s rights , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute political control over these states .
To prove this , let facts be submitted to a candid world .
The unconstitutional regulation by at least one federal agency , office , commission , bureau , or department of all goods and services traded domestically and internationally .
Establishment , in direct violation of the constitution , of a privately governed central bank whose sole purpose is to manipulate the monetary markets and which is not subject to public scrutiny and whose actions undermine the value of the American dollar to the detriment of the welfare of these United states .
Unconstitutional invasion , overthrow and occupation of sovereign foreign countries which pose no threat to the security of these United states based on political ideology to the detriment of the foreign nation and the welfare of the citizens of these United states .
Unconstitutional presence in allied foreign countries which pose no threat to the security of these United states and which levies unconscionable debt on the current and future citizens of these United states .
The implementation of an electoral system intended to marginalize third parties thereby limiting the choices presented to the electorate and giving an unfair advantage to the incumbents and leading to one party and / or one family or members of previous administrations also holding high - ranking offices in successive administrations , effectively creating an unconstitutional monarchy .
Unconstitutional manipulation of the tax laws to serve political agendas to the detriment of the welfare of these United states .
Unconstitutional alliances with special interests and big businesses to the detriment of the welfare of these United states .
Severe unconstitutional civil rights violations to include :
Restrictions on the freedom of speech .
Restrictions on our rights to bear arms .
Restrictions of use of private property .
Unconstitutional wire tapping on the citizens of these United states .
Torture .
Suspension of habeas corpus .
Furthermore , the consistently irresponsible behavior on the part of the elected congress in passing , without fully reading or understanding , legislation which violates the civil rights of these United states and levies unconscionable debt on the current and future citizens of these United states .
The impractical and logistically impossible size of the federal government makes it , by definition , an inefficient leviathan to the detriment of the welfare of these United states .
In every stage of these digressions citizens of these United states have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms : our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A president or legislator , whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
I , therefore , a citizen of the United states of America , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of my intentions , do , in the name , and by the authority given to me by nature and the constitution of these United states , solemnly publish and declare , that I am , and of right ought to be free and independent from the federal government ; that I am absolved from all allegiance to the federal government , and that all political connection between myself and the federal government , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as a free and independent citizen of these United states , I have full power to bear arms and defend myself against the federal government , conclude peace with the federal government , contract alliances , establish commerce , and to do all other acts and things which independent citizens may of right do .
And for the support of this declaration , with a firm reliance on the human spirit and the American spirit , I pledge to these United states my life , my fortune and my sacred honor .
The Best of Don Cooper
Expect the Groundswell to continue , in which people connect to each other –rather than institutions .
Consumer adoption of social networks is increasing a rapid pace , brands are adopting even during a recession , so expect the space to rapidly innovate to match this trend .
Clients can access this report , but to summarize what we found , in the executive summary we state :
Today ’s social experience is disjointed because consumers have separate identities in each social network they visit .
A simple set of technologies that enable a portable identity will soon empower consumers to bring their identities with them — transforming marketing , eCommerce , CRM , and advertising .
IDs are just the beginning of this transformation , in which the Web will evolve step by step from separate social sites into a shared social experience .
Consumers will rely on their peers as they make online decisions , whether or not brands choose to participate .
Socially connected consumers will strengthen communities and shift power away from brands and CRM systems ; eventually this will result in empowered communities defining the next generation of products .
We found that technologies trigger changes in consumer adoption , and brands will follow , resulting in five distinct waves , they consist of :
The Five Eras of the Social Web :
1 ) Era of Social Relationships : People connect to others and share
2) Era of Social Functionality : Social networks become like operating system
3 ) Era of Social Colonization : Every experience can now be social
4 ) Era of Social Context : Personalized and accurate content
5 ) Era of Social Commerce : Communities define future products and services
Update : CRM
Magazine has more about the five eras , focus in on the graphic .
Timing of the Five Overlapping Eras :
It ’s important to note that these eras are n’t sequential , but instead are overlapping .
We ’ve already entered and have seen maturity for the era of social relationships , have entered social functionality but have n’t seen true utility , and are starting to see threads of social colonization with early technologies like Facebook connect .
Soon these federated identities will empower people to enter the era of social context with personalized and social content .
The following diagram demonstrates how we should expect to see the eras play out in the future –with social commerce the furthest out .
Interviews with 24 of the top Social Companies :
Research is n’t done in a vacuum , that ’s why we conducted qualitative research to find out what we should come to expect .
We came to these conclusions based on interviews with executives , product managers , and strategists at the following 24 companies : Appirio , Cisco Eos , Dell , Facebook , Federated Media Publishing , Flock , Gigya , Google ( Open Social / stack team ) , Graphing Social Patterns ( Dave McClure ) , IBM ( SOA Team ) , Intel ( social media marketing team ) , KickApps , LinkedIn , Meebo , Microsoft ( Live team ) , MySpace , OpenID Foundation ( Chris Messina ) , Plaxo , Pluck , Razorfish , ReadWriteWeb , salesforce.com , Six Apart , and Twitter .
How Brands Should Prepare
What ’s interesting is n’t this vision for the future , but what it holds in store for brands , as a result , companies should prepare by :
Do n’t Hesitate :
These changes are coming at a rapid pace , and we ’re in three of these eras by end of year .
Brands should prepare by factoring in these eras into their near term plans .
Do n’t be left behind and let competitors connect with your community before you do .

Prepare For Transparency : People will be able to surf the web with their friends , as a result you must have a plan .
Prepare for every webpage and product to be reviewed by your customers and seen by prospects –even if you choose not to participate .

Connect with Advocates : Focus on customer advocates , they will sway over prospects , and could defend against detractors .
Their opinion is trusted more than yours , and when the power shifts to community , and they start to define what products should be , they become more important than ever .

Evolve your Enterprise Systems :
Your enterprise systems will need to connect to the social web .
Social networks and their partners are quickly becoming a source of customer information and lead generation beyond your CRM system .
CMS systems will need to inherit social features –pressure your vendors to offer this , or find a community platform .

Shatter your Corporate Website :
In the most radical future , content will come to consumers –rather than them chasing it– prepare to fragment your corporate website and let it distribute to the social web .
Let the most important information go and spread to communities where they exist ; fish where the fish are .

" You only get a project like this once ...
Some romances were so passionate that strong emotions still remain even after years of not being together .
Many people still feel an attraction to their ex , and it is not uncommon for them to wonder what it would be like if they were reunited .
Distant hearts are reconnected everyday across the world , but the majority of people never act on their desire to seek out a lost love .
The decision to leave the past behind is not always healthy .
The only way to truly find closure in these situations is to satisfy your curiosity and reach out to your ex .
Ask Yourself Why First
Before you begin this emotional journey you should ask yourself what your goal is ?
It is easy to say you are still in love , but please make sure this is the real reason .
Do n’t seek out your ex only because you are struggling with life 's other challenges .
This is n’t a vacation from your real problems … it is your last shot at reuniting with a true love .
If you do it for any other reason then you will be disappointed in the end .
Do Your Homework
Unless you have kept in close contact with your ex over the years then you likely have a lot to learn about them .
For all you know they may have found a fulfilling life after you parted ways .
Find out the essentials before you make contact with them .
Are they married ?
Do they live close enough for you to see each other ?
Are there children involved ?
Consider all of these obstacles carefully before proceeding .
Connecting with Your Ex
Thanks to the internet it is easier than ever to find people we have lost track of .
Social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn are great places to start .
Not only can you connect with your ex through these channels , but you can also find important clues about their current life by reading their profiles .
If they have made their profiles “ private ” you can always try setting up a fake account just to be added to their friends list .
This will let you secretly peek into their life and learn more about their situation .
Reaching Out After Multiple Years
The hardest part of getting your ex back is making the first contact with them .
The best thing you can do here is keep it short and friendly .
Even a simple message like “ long time no see… how are things with you ? ” can be very effective .
If they have even the slightest curiosity about your whereabouts they will respond .
On the other hand , be prepared for silence or even rejection if your break up ended badly .
In this case try giving it one more shot with a short message that explains how you wish things would have ended differently .
Explain that you understand their hesitation to talk , but you just could n't let things end the way they did without trying to clear the air .
Finish by saying you wo n’t bother them again , but they can call you if they ever want to talk .
Give it a month or two …if it does n't work then maybe it is best to move on with your life .
Seeing Your Ex Again for the First Time
Let 's assume that things go well with the small talk and you eventually decide to meet for coffee or lunch .
This is a big step that will lay the foundation for your future together .
Do everything you can to keep the conversation away from the problems you had at the end of your relationship .
Do n’t apologize for the past unless it is absolutely necessary .
Keep the focus on your current lives and listen closely for any clues that the door may still be open for another chance at love .
Some of the ways you can tell if your ex is still interested in you is by the way they dress , how they look at you , and the questions they ask .
If they made an obvious effort to look their best , and they smile and laugh while looking into your eyes then you are off to a good start .
Lots of questions from your ex is another good sign , especially if they are about your dating status , accomplishments , and goals for the future .
Just make sure you have the answers they want to hear !
Do n’t Rely on the Past to Make Your Future
As your relationship progresses from old friends to something more affectionate you have to be careful not to fall into the same traps that led to your first break up .
Do n’t try to recreate the past by visiting the places you used to go to together .
Make new memories together and show your ex that you have “ grown up ” from when you last dated .
If you only talk about “ how things used to be ” you will end up reminding them of why you broke up .
When you compliment them or flirt – do it in the present tense .
Tell them they are just as stunning today as the first day you laid eyes on them .
Make things special for today and the future … do n’t use the past as a reason to get back together .
Life is Short – Enjoy Your Time
Of course even the best laid plans do n’t always lead to a Hollywood ending .
There are so many variables that have changed since the last time you were together .
You may still have a vibe between you , but it may not be enough to last forever .
The important thing is to enjoy the moments you get with your second chance .
Do n't force a love that is not meant to be .
Your reunion might not last past a one - night - stand … but at least you wo n't have to live with the regret of wondering what could have been .

Via the Thinkhammer blog and the I ’m Not Really A Geek blog , this great little cautionary tale / wake - up call for people who do n’t quite grasp that EVERYTHING they post on the internet is 100 % public .
If you are n’t familiar with this story yet , let me set it up for you :
1. Dude gets job with Cisco .
2 . Dude posts less than enthused opinion about the Cisco job on Twitter ( actually naming Cisco as his new employer ) .
3. Cisco employee on Twitter spots the post and promptly responds .
4 . Dude blocks his Twitter updates ( hides them from public view ) … but it ’s too late .
The damage is done , and he probably spends most of the day wondering if Cisco will now rethink its job offer .
Check this out :
And the response by the Cisco guy :
Ouch .
@theconnor probably did n’t expect that , did he ?
But the question is …
What did he expect ?
That a comment posted on a public stream in the fastest growing social media “ channel ” on the planet , one currently used by 2,000,000 people and feeding into other services like Facebook and MySpace would go unnoticed ?
Just because your boss , coworker , spouse or neighbor does n’t know about Twitter , does n’t read blogs and refuses to join FaceBook does n’t mean your comments on the web wo n’t get back to him / her .
What you post on the internet today may not come back to haunt you tomorrow , but it definitely will someday .
Everything on the web is archivable , which means it is also searchable .
Comments you make today will be popping up in searches ten years from now .
What does this all mean ?
Simple : Everything you say / write can and will be used against you in the court of public opinion someday , somehow .
Your behavior on the web can cost you a new job , a promotion , your career , your marriage , your friendships , endorsements , and even take you out of contention for college scholarships , military / law enforcement service , or public office .
So please , please , PLEASE , for your own sake THINK about what you are about to post to the web ( especially blogs , social networking sites and Twitter ) .
Before you click “ send , ” “ publish ” or “ update , ” assume that everyone you know will read your comment .
And by everyone , I mean your boss , coworkers , parents , grandparents , exes , recruiters , future employers , and yes , even your kids ( even if you do n’t have any yet ) .
Use your brains .
The internet is a very public place .
More so even than the water cooler .
Exercise the same common sense and decorum you would in “ real life ” social situations .
Have a great Thursday . 🙂
Update : Based on the comments I have received over the weekend , it seems that @theconnor may have actually been a woman , not a “ dude . ”
That information was not available to me when I published this post .
Thanks for letting me know .
Update # 2 : I am not sure that this is actually written by the real @theconnor or pointed to by the real Tim Levad , but it ’s a good post and a nice way to continue the conversation on this topic .

Dear friends :
After MPP passed the medical marijuana ballot initiative in Michigan and the marijuana decriminalization ballot initiative in Massachusetts — both on November 4 — I thought the MPP staff might get a little downtime to regroup for the 2009 - 2010 election cycle .
Not so .
In the last four months , the MPP staff and our allies have been working almost nonstop to respond to — and take advantage of — the many opportunities that have been presenting themselves across the country .
I 've never seen so much evidence of positive change in such a short amount of time ...
1. MARIJUANA THE BIGGEST ISSUE :
Two huge surveys of citizen activists across the country — one on Change.gov on December 12 , and one on Change.org on January 15 — showed that the number - one issue on people 's minds is ending the government 's war on marijuana users .
2. BONG HIT SEEN AROUND THE WORLD : On February 1 , the world learned that Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps had used marijuana a few months before , demonstrating yet again that using marijuana is compatible with being wildly successful in our society .
When Kellogg 's dropped its endorsement contract with Phelps — and MPP and other organizations responded by calling for a boycott of Kellogg 's — the public 's perception of Kellogg 's took a nose dive .
3. EL PASO RESPONDS TO MEXICAN VIOLENCE : Responding to the prohibition - caused violence just over the border in Mexico , on January 6 the El Paso City Council unanimously passed a resolution calling for " an honest , open national debate on ending the prohibition of narcotics , " which drew the ire of some Texas politicians but also sparked a great deal of positive media coverage nationwide .
4. NATIONAL POLLING HIGHEST EVER : Between January 11 and February 14 , three different national polls indicated that either 40 % , 41 % , or 44 % of the American people now support ending marijuana prohibition .
This is the highest level of support since marijuana was first prohibited in 1937 , with support having risen by 1 % a year since 1995 .
5. REVOLT IN LATIN AMERICA : On February 12 , a commission led by three former presidents from Brazil , Colombia , and Mexico released a long - awaited report that blasted the U.S. drug war and called for the decriminalization of marijuana .
6. ENDING THE DEA's RAIDS IN CALIFORNIA : On February 25 , Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the DEA would no longer be raiding medical marijuana clinics in California and the 12 other states where medical marijuana is legal .
7. MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILLS MOVING : MPP 's medical marijuana bills are moving through the Illinois , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Hampshire , and New York Legislatures , and the Drug Policy Alliance 's similar legislation is moving in New Jersey .
We have a real chance of making medical marijuana legal in four of these six states this year and — in the meantime — it 's very possible that Montana and Rhode Island will expand their existing medical marijuana laws , too .
8. BROADER MARIJUANA BILLS MOVING : California shook the nation when a bill to tax and regulate marijuana was introduced on February 23 .
And even before that happened , the Hawaii , Montana , Vermont , and Washington Legislatures had already begun considering bills to decriminalize marijuana .
9. MPP DOMINATING ON YOUTUBE :
As of today , MPP 's channel on YouTube.com is the 10th most subscribed of all nonprofit channels , and MPP 's videos are consistently in the top 10 most - viewed of all nonprofit videos in any given week .
( And our 65,000 friends on MySpace.com places MPP among the top 10 most popular nonprofit organizations there , too . )
10 . ONGOING MEDIA EXPLOSION : According to the weekly reports we get from Google , MPP has been getting its message into the news in the last month at 10 times the volume of previous months .
And four different national TV specials are tentatively scheduled to look at marijuana over just a two - month span : CNBC looked at the marijuana industry in northern California on January 22 , NBC's " Dateline " covered the Rachel Hoffman tragedy in Florida on January 23 , ABC's " 20/20 " with John Stossel will be looking at medical marijuana on March 13 , and MSNBC with Al Roker will be looking at the multi-billion - dollar marijuana industry on March 15 .
Thank you for anything and everything you 've done to help bring all this attention and success to our movement .
If you 'd like to help even more , please make a donation today so that we may continue with the onslaught of work that continues to pile up on our plates .
Sincerely ,
Rob Kampia
Executive Director
Marijuana Policy Project
Washington , D.C .
P.S. As I 've mentioned in previous alerts , a major philanthropist has committed to match the first $ 2.35 million that MPP can raise from the rest of the planet in 2009 .
This means that your donation today will be doubled .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. troops killed by hostile action in Iraq fell in March to the lowest level since the 2003 invasion , but total civilian deaths remained above January ’s low point .
The number of U.S. troops killed by bombs or gunfire in Iraq fell to four , down from 11 in February , according to statistics from Web site www.icasualties.org, which collates official data .
Iraqi Ministry of Health figures showed 180 civilians died violent deaths in March , down from 211 in February , but still above January ’s all - time low of 138 , making March the second lowest monthly toll since the invasion .
The sectarian violence that left bodies piling up in the streets of Baghdad has ebbed , but al Qaeda and other insurgents continue to launch attacks in Baghdad and Iraq ’s restive northern Diyala and Nineveh provinces .
At least 4,262 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq , from both combat and non-combat related causes , since the March 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein .
Close to 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in Iraq in violence during that time , according to www.iraqbodycount.org.
A perfect correlation among the G - 5 : the earlier you abandon the gold standard , the better you are doing in 1937 .

Wipe Your Shame - Cave , Honey
My daughter has n’t got the hang of the potty yet , but she ’s learning .
And after she urinates , she wipes her vulva .
Because that ’s what it ’s called .
Over at Feministe , Jill posted an Onion piece that is laugh - out - loud funny about the shame and embarassment people display over female genitals .
Being one of those humorless feminists , though , I ca n’t help pointing out that there is a lot to take seriously about whether we call girls ’ genitals what they are or some cute nickname : this is where it starts .
We either teach our kids that their bodies are normal and natural , or we teach them that we ca n’t talk about them without stammering and blushing .
And in this , so many people fail their girls .
I know lots of parents who can call a boy ’s penis a penis without stiffling a snicker .
Boy parts are ordinary body parts with names .
Ear , elbow , penis .
Many of these same folks ca n’t use proper terms for their daughters ’ genitals .
Girl parts are unmentionable .
They have cute names and euphemisms .
That ’s how it starts .
We teach girls they cannot deal openly and forthrightly with the bodies the way boys can , and then later we teach them they can’t deal openly and forthrightly with their sexuality , even if boys can .
Boys have penises , boys have desire , boys have sex .
Girls … the adults would rather not talk about .
And so we fail .
First , we ca n’t call a vulva a vulva .
Then we ca n’t call a vagina a vagina , even when it ’s an award - winning play .
Then we ca n’t have these conversations , because we never laid the groundwork ; never built the foundation to allow us to parent our children from kids to adults — whole , sexual adults .
We need to get over it , the only way that works : a little at a time , starting with baby step .
It ’s called a vulva .
The Guardian reports that " Britain is preparing for a summer of rage . "
Has President Obama failed to reinstate Posse Comitatus because he is expecting and preparing for riots in the USA ?
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
I just spoke to a friend who knows someone who is trying to get out of the military because they are training returning troops for riot control to take over US cities and he does n't want to be a soldier dealing with US citizens .
On top of that , these returning Iraq vets are burned out and " fried " with PTSD and exhaustion .
And he does n't want to pick up arms against his own country .
This same source says the military is setting up a separate communication system .
In the military , securing or taking out communications is one of the first steps .
If you are an invader , you need to bring your own communication system because you have to assume that the existing system will be destroyed or compromised .
This is the kind of talk that gets labeled tinfoil hat , except ... riots have already happened in Iceland , Greece , Latvia , Nigeria , Pakistan , Guadeloupe , South Korea .
Naomi discussed riots in her recent article , All of Them Must Go - " ¡ Que se vayan todos ! "
Klein points out that like the rioters in Argentina , in 2002 , the new rioters are challenging the politico - economic system .
Glen Greenwald wrote about the beginnings of what I just heard about back in September last year , in his Salon article , Why is a U.S. Army brigade being assigned to the " Homeland " ?
Greenwald cites an Army Times article , about " an on call federal response force . "
They 'll learn new skills , use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it .
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
. . .
The 1st BCT 's soldiers also will learn how to use " the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , " 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
" It 's a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they 're fielding .
They 've been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we 're undertaking we were the first to get it . "
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
" I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , " said Cloutier , describing the experience as " your worst muscle cramp ever -- times 10 throughout your whole body " .
. . .
The brigade will not change its name , but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF ( pronounced " sea- smurf " ) .
Greenwald observed , back in September , that there was no risk of Bush cancelling elections , but , he said , " the deployment is a very dangerous precedent , quite possibly illegal , and a radical abandonment of an important democratic safeguard .
As always with first steps of this sort , the danger lies in how the power can be abused in the future . "
How long should we wait before it looks bad , that Obama has failed to reverse the end of Posse Comitatus ?
Or should we expect this administration to keep it in anticipation of the riots we are likely to see ?
Yes .
I think we 're going to see riots here .
The economic crisis has not it 's bottom .
More jobs are being lost .
More businesses are going under .
Even if the level of monthly unemployment figures started to drop , we 'd still see , by the end of the year , millions more unemployed .

( the area on conjugation in Papiamentu is less complete than the one for Spanish , but even this small portion shows you how easy it is - conjugation is carried out by simply using an auxiliary in front of the main verb )
more neutral
Many are n't aware of this , but the world has a language problem : the problem is that there is no universal second language through which everybody can communicate .
It 's true that basic English will do fine for most airports and a lot of major cities in the world , but this is communication at its most basic level ( " one coffee ... and big size please " ) , and not even communication at this level is guaranteed .
Using interpreters costs the police in Suffolk £ 20,000 a month translation costs the EU around a billion euros per year , and English hegemony is n't even guaranteed considering the growing strength of languages like Chinese and Spanish , plus French ( French ?
Really ?
Yes - the number of French speakers in Africa is expected to increase to 600 million in 2050 .
French is n't going anywhere ) .
Even Turkish is strengthening its position in Europe and throughout Central Asia .
Add all this together and you can see that the world is heading for a bit of a linguistic deadlock .
One of the problems with the current situation is simply that the most prominent languages in the world are often extremely hard to learn for others - English orthography is a mess , French is only slightly better but has grammatical gender and weird verb conjugation , Spanish has excellent orthography but requires a lot of work on memorizing verb conjugation , Chinese ... well , Chinese is written in Chinese .
One solution proposed to this problem is a constructed language , created to be easy for anyone to learn , and thus we have languages like Esperanto , Ido , Interlingua , Lingua Franca Nova , Occidental , Novial , and so on .
Though I and a lot of people like me do support this idea , the world on the whole does n't seem to like constructed languages .
The reasons for this are twofold : 1 ) they come across as being too artificial , and 2 ) they have very few speakers and thus almost no economic clout .
It 's hard to say whether any constructed languages will ever succeed .
Luckily , there may be another solution , and it's a language called Papiamentu .
Papiamentu is spoken right here : ( plus a few other islands nearby ) This small corner of the world is part of the Netherlands Antilles , an overseas territory of the Netherlands where Papiamentu was born .
Papiamentu is a creole , with vocabulary mostly from Portuguese and Spanish , with about another quarter of its vocabulary from Dutch and a few other words from various languages .
And because it's a creole that means it has an extremely simplified grammar in addition to the large comprehensibility at first sight .
Let 's compare the verb conjugation of Papiamentu with Spanish .
First the Spanish verb comprar , to buy And now the same verb ( kumpra ) in Papiamentu :
In addition to that you now do n't have to worry about grammatical gender anymore .
In short , Papiamentu is the language you wish you had learned in school instead of Spanish or French .
It 's not only easy to learn but because its vocabulary comes from prominent European languages it provides a benefit to students who intend to go on to other languages afterwards .
Okay then , what about neutrality ?
One of the common arguments given for a constructed language is that it provides a neutral playing field in that everyone is using the language as a second language , so those using it as a mother tongue will not be given an unfair advantage .
This is true to a certain extent , however : 1 ) The definition of neutrality is always a pretty vague one .
Does a language get to be considered neutral simply because nobody speaks it as a first language , or does the vocabulary itself have to be derived from languages around the world ?
If a language derives too much of its vocabulary from one source is it then not neutral ?
Neutrality is good to a certain extent , but focusing too much on the perfect neutral language is an impossible task .
In reality , is about as good as we can hope to get .
2 ) Certainly Papiamentu would given an unfair advantage to the people that speak it as a mother tongue ... but these people live on a few islands close to South America and number only about 300,000 , hardly the same thing as giving an advantage to the hundreds of millions of people that speak other languages like English , French or Spanish .
Finally , how complete a language is Papiamentu ?
Can you do everything you can do with other languages using Papiamentu ?
The answer is yes .
Here are some examples of Papiamentu being used in practice .
Here it is being used to give a code of ethics to journalists :
Here it is being used to give information on a drug bust :
Here it is being used to discuss languages in education :
And here it is sung :
So yes , Papiamentu is as complete and functional as any other language .
You 'll also notice that if you speak a fair amount of Spanish or Portuguese ( and French / Italian / Latin etc. to a certain extent ) that this language is already pretty easy to understand at first sight .
There are of course other creole languages in existence , and most of them are fairly easy to learn in comparison with other languages that are usually studied in school .
None of these , however , have the advantages that Papiamentu has :- Tok Pisin and Bislama ( Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu ) are spoken in a very isolated part of the world , and the countries in which they are spoken are still largely undeveloped - Haiti speaks a creole as well , but once again the country is unstable and undeveloped - Mauritius speaks a French - based creole , but is n't all that interested in promoting it as a written language -
Seychelles does a better job at promoting their French - based creole than Mauritius but it's once again quite isolated and the population there is quite lowWhereas Papiamentu is spoken in a stable and well - developed part of the world , is technically a part of the Netherlands which is an EU member , and it's also quite close to both North and South America .
It also has a larger amount of non-Romance vocabulary and thus represents a more varied swath of population than other creoles do .
Okay , so Papiamentu is a pretty good candidate for a universal second language , but how could this be accomplished in practice ?
That 's hard to say .
At the moment since it's not even considered to be a candidate for a universal second language the best way to get the ball rolling would probably be to conduct studies on the use of the language as a bridge in between English and Spanish speakers in the United States .
A few studies showing how easy it is for people with different linguistic backgrounds to learn the language to communicate would probably be the best way to get people thinking about this language 's potential as an interlinguistic tool ... or you could just write about it on your blog and see whether that gets people interested in the idea .
The computer industry has hit upon its Next Big Thing .
It is called a phone .
Emboldened by Apple ’s success with its iPhone , many PC makers and chip companies are charging into the mobile - phone business , promising new devices that can pack the horsepower of standard computers into palm - size packages .
The companies are also shifting gears because their technological feats of the last two decades  smaller laptops with faster chips to deliver snazzier graphics  no longer impress consumers , who increasingly find their three - year - old computers adequate for everyday tasks .
“ The action is really with the smartphones where everyone is competing to cram the most features into a phone , ” said Linley Gwennap , a veteran chip industry analyst and head of the Linley Group .
“ I think of PCs as just kind of boring these days . ”
The new smartphones promised by PC companies will , among other things , handle the full glory of the Internet , power two - way video conferences , and stream high - definition movies to your TV .

Operating out of an undisclosed location , former Sen. Norm Coleman 's attorney , Ben Ginsberg , announced that the Coleman legal team had filed a notice of appeal with the Minnesota Supreme Court , seeking to overturn the three - judge panel decision [ PDF ] declaring that Al " Franken received the highest number of lawfully cast ballots in the November 4 , 2008 general election for United States Senator and is entitled to receive the certificate of election . "
Ginsberg asserted that the appeal was based on the same contentions made during the course of the election contest , especially as it relates to equal protection and an alleged disenfranchisement of some 4,400 Minnesota voters .
Franken attorney , Marc Elias , responded , noting that five of the six claims made by Coleman 's appeal seek not to add additional votes but to delete votes already counted .
Elias announced on TheUptake.org that he plans to file a motion on Tuesday with the MN Supreme Court asking that the court order expedited briefing , with Coleman 's brief to be filed by Monday Apr. 27 , and Franken 's response on May 2 .
There 's not a whole lot new or unexpected yet here , for the moment , though a review of the political balance of the MN Supreme Court who will hear Coleman 's appeal is probably worth a quick look , right about now ...
In our last post on this matter we set forth the reasons why we felt a Coleman appeal continues to be " dead in its tracks , " as we originally argued as long ago as February , as based on information already on the public record even then .
In particular , in the more recent piece , we observed that in alleging the disenfranchisement of 4,400 Minnesota voters .
Ginsberg is referring to the three - judge panel 's February 13 , 2009 ruling which found that Minnesota 's strict standards for the opening and counting of absentee - ballots must be applied on a ballot - by - ballot basis .
Ginsberg will be appealing this ruling to a MN Supreme Court which , in Coleman v Ritchie ( March 6 , 2009 ) , already ruled [ PDF ] that those strict standards must be applied .
The 7 - week election contest , which concluded last week , was heard before three judges who were appointed by a Republican governor , a Democratic governor and an Independent governor , yet their decisions throughout were unanimous .
Coleman 's appeal has been filed with a seven member MN Supreme Court .
Here 's the general political makeup of the MN Supremes :
Four of the Justices , Chief Justice Magnuson and Justices Gildea , Dietzen and G. Barry Anderson were all appointees of Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty appointees .
Gov. Tim Pawlenty appointees .
Justice Paul H. Anderson was appointed by former Republican Governor Arne Carleson .
Governor Arne Carleson .
Justice Meyer was appointed by the Libertarian - leaning independent Gov. Jesse Ventura .
Gov. Jesse Ventura .
Former NFL
Hall of Famer , Justice Alan Page , who formerly served on the staff of a Democratic Attorney General , was elected ( as opposed to appointed ) in 1992 .
The Chief Justice and Justice G. Barry Anderson have recused themselves from the Coleman / Franken proceedings because they served on the MN state canvassing board , as appointed by Democratic Sec. of State Mark Ritchie , to oversee and adjudicate the recount last Decemeber .
The state canvasing board certified Franken as having received 225 more vote than Coleman on Jan. 5 , 2009 .
While some commentators have suggested that Justice Dietzen should recuse himself because he has twice donated to Coleman campaigns , that contribution does not , in and of itself , establish bias .
Though critics might rightly argue that there is , at least , an appearance of conflict of interest .
If Dietzen ends up siding with Coleman 's argument , it could be a basis for questioning the court 's ruling .
If donations to a political candidate were the sole determinant on whether a Justice should recuse themselves from this case , however , Republicans might similarly urge the recusal of Ventura - appointed Justice Meyer who has made contributions to Democrats , though none to either the plaintiff or defendant in this particular case to our knowledge .
If Dietzen decides to recuse himself , the makeup of the court hearing Coleman 's appeal would be 2 Republican - appointees , 1 Democratic - appointee , and 1 Libertarian - appointee who has a record of contributing to Democrats ) , so we could consider that as 2 Rs and 2 Ds. If Dietzen does n't recuse , the court would be made up of 3 Rs and 2 Ds .
Beyond all of that , and pending review of any unknown surprises in Coleman 's actual filing ( which has not yet been posted as of this writing ) nothing new has occurred to alter our opinion that Franken will prevail on this appeal .
That is a perception that the Senator - elect , who has now named a state director so he can " hit the ground running on day one " , apparently shares .

How To Apply For A Bad Credit Loan , And Get Accepted
Anyone can fall on hard times and find themselves needing to borrow money .
The problem is , banks and building societies can be very particular about who they lend to – if you ’ve got a bad credit history , you might struggle to get credit .
Bad credit loans , as they ’re informally known , are unsecured personal loans specifically designed for people whose poor credit scores would normally prevent them from getting credit .
Understanding Your Credit File
Lenders take into account a number of different variables when assessing you for credit .
They get most of their information from your credit report .
Your credit report contains details of all your credit accounts – credit cards , loans , phone contracts , utilities companies etc. and notes whether you have missed payments , paid late or defaulted .
The three major companies ( or credit reference agencies ) in the UK which compile credit reports are Experian , Equifax and Call Credit ( Noddle ) .
These reports are used by lenders to assign you a credit score .
More info on credit reports here .
Lenders all calculate credit scores and their criteria for lending differently and , contrary to popular belief , there is no such thing as a ‘ credit blacklist ’ .
This means you might be declined for a loan by one lender but accepted by another .
You can view your own credit report , free of charge , and it is a good way to check where you stand .
Can I Get A Loan If I Have Bad Credit ?
Yes .
While numerous mainstream lenders turn away people with poor credit ratings , some companies specialise in providing unsecured loans to those with bad credit history .
These loans typically come with higher interest rates and more restrictions .
First - Time Borrowers
It can be just as hard to get a loan with no credit history as it is with bad credit history .
If you ’ve never borrowed before , you have no track record , good or bad , so it is difficult for lenders to determine your reliability .
Bad Credit Loans With No Guarantor
You do n’t require a guarantor for any of the loans in our comparison table , so you wo n’t need to rely on friends or family to repay your loan if you ’re unable to .
How Much Could I Borrow ?
This will vary from lender to lender , but the loans in our comparison table go up to £ 5,000 .
Similarly , the time you can take to repay your loan will vary – from 1 month to 5 years .
High Rates Of Interest
One of the key things to watch out for with bad credit loans is the interest rates .
Because you present more of a risk to lenders , interest rates are typically higher .
APR ( annual percentage rate ) is a useful tool when comparing credit products as it is calculated in a standardised way .
It shows annual cost of borrowing money , including the interest rate you ’ll pay and any other mandatory fees .
Lenders must advertise the representative APR of their products – this is the rate at least 51 % of people will pay .
It ’s a good indicator for the cost of borrowing , but you need to bear in mind that the actual rate you receive may differ from the advertised APR .
As with any product , you should shop around for the best deal .
Why Have I Got A Low Credit Score ?
Your credit score indicates your creditworthiness .
If you always repay your debts on time , chances are you have a good credit score .
However , if you have a history of regularly missing credit card payments or making loan repayments late , this can have a negative impact on your score .
You may also have encountered more serious financial difficulties like CCJS , IVAs or bankruptcy which can further damage your rating .
How Can I Improve My Bad Credit Rating ?
Your credit score is not set in stone , so you can make changes to improve it .
Some changes are simple like registering to vote and ensuring your details are up - to - date .
Avoid making too many applications for credit too , as lenders are often deterred if you have previously been declined .
Start by downloading your credit report here .
Others steps take a while longer , but , if you decide to take out a poor credit unsecured loan , you could boost your score by ensuring that you make your loan repayments in full and on time each month .
Before taking out any loan , it is paramount to consider whether you can afford the repayments .
Look At The Alternatives
There are many alternative options for borrowing money , even if your credit score is low .
These include :
Credit unions
Peer - to - peer loans
Budgeting loans
Bad credit credit cards
Guarantor loans
Secured homeowner loans
Shopping catalogues
Pros
You could get a loan despite having a poor credit rating
Borrow up to £ 5,000 over up to 5 years
Paying in full and on time each month could improve your credit score
You wo n’t require a guarantor
Cons
More restrictions – you might not be able to borrow as much over as long a term
Higher interest rates
FAQs
Will a bad credit loan affect my credit score ?
Yes .
Your application will be visible on your credit report for lenders to see .
If you make your loan repayments on time each month , it could improve your credit rating , but if you miss any repayments it could cause further damage to your score .
Will my credit history be checked for a bad credit loan ?
Yes .
Lenders will still check your credit history , but are more forgiving with bad credit loans .
This means they will often be willing to lend to you despite your poor credit rating .
How much can I borrow ?
This varies from one lender to the next and depends on the type of loan you choose .
You could borrow up to £ 50,000 with an unsecured loan .
What is the maximum loan repayment term ?
Again , this will vary .
Bad credit loan repayment terms usually range from 1 month up to 15 years .
What happens if I ca n’t make the repayments ?
If you ca n’t make a repayment , you will be charged and may damage your credit rating .
You will also end up paying more interest as your loan term will be extended .
You could be at risk of more severe financial difficulties if you persistently fail to make repayments .
You should always speak to your lender , even if the problem is only short - term .
What does APR mean ?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate .
It is a standardised way for lenders to show the yearly cost of borrowing money , including the interest rate and other mandatory charges .
Lenders must calculate the APR of their products in the same way and must tell you how much the APR is before you sign an agreement .
APR can , therefore , be a useful tool when comparing credit products .
The advertised APR is a representative APR .
Bearing in mind yesterday 's revelations , this really sticks out for me :
Mr. Obama condemned what he called a " dark and painful chapter in our history " and said that the interrogation techniques would never be used again .
But he also repeated his opposition to a lengthy inquiry into the program , saying that " nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
I think this is wrong .
More than that I think it 's dismissive , silly and bordering on insult to any literate human being .
In point of fact " spending our time and energy laying blame for the past " is exactly what the justice system does .
By Obama 's logic murderers would go free in the streets .
The real question is not whether you 're going to lay blame for the past , but who your going to lay it on , and for which past .
What Obama is really saying in this statement is he wo n't hold this particular group accountable , for this particular past .
This is a dangerous course because it does n't simply not " lay blame for the past , " it shrugs off arguably the solemn responsibility of safeguarding the future .
The price of doing nothing , of not enforcing laws , is the implicit statement that it really is OK to torture , that the most you 'll face is a wag of the finger .
The concern is n't mere vengeance .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s believed amongst a few that banks need to realize another $ 400b of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœbad assetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ write - downs , thus requiring further US government capital injections .
The innuendos and rumors , all denied by Treasury , has 16 of the 19 financial institutions failing the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstress testÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and being insolvent .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s hard to believe that the US government first of all would allow this and secondly , they have not completed the final results which do not become public until May .
However , BoAÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s stock closing down - 24 % as they increased their bad loan provisions significantly , has sent investors scrambling to close out some of the 6 - week equity gains we have witnessed .
These reversals in global equity markets have triggered a risk aversion attack and the dumping of the FX Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcarry tradesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
How do we believe the banks ?
Even Citi made $ 2.5 b betting on itself to survive and padding their quarterÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s numbers .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all optics !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conference board leading indicators fell more than forecasted last month ( - 0.3 % vs. - 0.2 % ) , implying that a swift recovery from this deep recession , the worst in over 50 - years is many months away ( itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a forward looking indicator for 3 - 6 - months ) .
The index really has very little impact on the markets as most of the indicators that comprise the number had been previously released .
Rising unemployment and tight credit mean that the recent gains in consumer spending , the biggest part of the US economy ( +70 % ) , can not be sustained .
This is further evidence that this sharp contraction will remain with us for most of this year , thus putting ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s time line under pressure .
The USD $ currently is weaker against the EUR +0.11 % , GBP +0.03 % , CHF +0.00 % and higher against JPY - 0.19 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.02 % and AUD +0.79 % .
The loonie has continued this week where it left off on Friday , under pressure .
The currency fell to its lowest level in more than a week as investors coveted the safety of the greenback ahead of corporate earnings this week that is expected to highlight the severity of this slowdown .
With risk aversion strategies the order of the day , investors are shying away from commodity based and cyclical currencies .
It did not help that oil plummeted the most in nearly 2 - months .
The market has been transfixed on todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s anticipated BOC announcement .
Already there has been a rumor of a Medley report revealing that the BOC will slash 25 bp and initiate quantitative easing measures .
Markets remain thin and volatile and somewhat at the mercy of commodities and equities ahead of the BOC 9 am EST release .
Carney is due to announce guidelines on April 23rd about quantitative easing ( Cbanks buy government debt to try to revive economic growth ) .
Expect traders to be better buyers of USD on pull backs once again .
The AUD has managed to rally from its 3 - month lows that were printed yesterday after BoA plummeted 24 % when it increased it bad loan provisions significantly .
RBA governor Stevens gave the currency a boost this morning when he stated that the Australian economy is in a good position to rebound from its 1st - recession in 18 - years because the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœfinancial system is strong and companies will benefit from a pickup in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
However , that been said , investors risk appetite remains fragile and the market seems to realize that the recent recovery may have been excessive , hence the aggressive pull back so far this week .
But , with European policy makers unable to come to a consensus may heighten recession fears again .
For now , look for traders to continue to sell on upticks ( 0.7024 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 45.88 down - 1 c ) .
Finally fundamentals are starting to kick in .
Yesterday , oil pared the most in nearly 2 - months on the back of a stronger greenback which reduced the appeal of commodities and on speculation that supplies will rise as the recession reduces demand .
With a stronger dollar , it makes commodities less attractive as a natural inflation hedge .
For a number of weeks we were getting ahead of ourselves , a strong USD and so - so equity market combined with record inventory levels did not justify higher oil prices .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report showed that inventory levels had climbed to a new 19 - year high .
Crude stocks advanced + 5.67 m barrels to +366.7 m vs. an expected + 1.76 m , the highest levels since Sept. 1990 .
More importantly , demand destruction remains an issue with total daily demand averaging +187 m barrels over the past 4 - weeks , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s down – 5.2 % , y/y .
Gas inventories declined - 944 k barrels to +216.5 m , while distillate fuels ( includes heating oil and diesel ) , fell - 1.17 m barrels to +139.6 m .
US
Refineries are operating at + 80.4 % of capacity , down - 1.5 % , w/w , and the lowest level in 7 - months .
The fundamental data is abysmal .
OPEC for an 8th - consecutative month cut its forecast for oil demand this year ; they lowered it by - 430 k barrels a day to +84.18 m and expect demand in industrialized countries to fall even further , while developing economies are likely to see only minor growth .
They next meet on May 28th to review production quotas .
Until we see inventories decline substantially and sustainable demand destruction , there will not be a sustainable price gain .
Gold rallied + 2 % yesterday as the safe - haven demand related to renewed credit worries more than offset investment interest in ETFÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s .
With inflation a non-issue and the threat of the IMF needing to offload 3500 + tons of the yellow metal , the market had being selling on upticks ( $ 889 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,711 down - 213 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,530 up + 44 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,005 up +15 .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 6 bp yesterday ( 2.84 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .
FI has managed to reverse all of last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s losses as global equities remain in the red .
The rally was further enhanced as the Fed prepares to buy US debt twice this week .
Once again concerns arising over BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s credit losses combined with traders making the Fed pay up for off - the - run product will have FI better bid on pull backs .

2. Ginger
You may know that studies have demonstrated that ginger is effective in preventing the
symptoms of motion sickness , especially seasickness .
In addition , it can
be useful in reducing the nausea and vomiting brought on by pregnancy .
To get the stomach - calming benefits , simply steep an ounce or two of
fresh gingerroot in a cup of hot water .
Ginger also contains an
inflammation - fighting substance called gingerol , which may help reduce
pain and improve function in people who have arthritis .
BDSM
BDSM
for your version of An Owned Life .
A quick question : would you ever marry someone without ever having dated before ?
The answer for most sane people is " absolutely not " .
If that is the case , they why do people choose to submit without knowing what being a sub entails .
I see so many who are new to this lifestyle who rush to give themselves to another without having any idea what that person is like .
To me , this is insane .
The online world rarely reflects reality .
Life exists offline .
What people do while online is not true life .
For most , it is a fantasy played out .
The transference to real time becomes difficult since they believe in the fairy - tale .
This is the equivalent to believing that a relationship reflects what is portrayed in a romance film .
Again , reality differs from fantasy .
It is important to research aboutas much as you can .
There are many different facets to this way of life .
It is wide and versatile .
One is free to choose a relationship that fits him or her .
I always say there is no " one size fits all " template .
I wrote in an effort to explain to new people the aspect of BDSM known as M/s ( Master / slave ) .
This is a facet where one makes a total commitment to another .
The drive to submit within this person is strong .
A total exchange of power is the end result .
From the feedback received , those who read this book told me it cleared up a lot of confusion on their part .
The pictures online depicting BDSM are wonderful .
Personally , I enjoy seeing how others live their life .
Unfortunately , few are real life depictions .
Most are professional actors and actresses .
While still a bit educational , they are far from the everyday life that most experience .
There is so much more to BDSM than just sex .
I suggest reading all that you can before making the decision to commit to someone .
There are many blogs written by both Doms and subs .
This will provide insight into the approach each takes .
You will come to understand the mindset of each of these people while being able to compare it to how you feel .
Seek those that talk more about the life as opposed to sex .
If you want a sex story , pick up Penthouse forums .
Spend your time learning about the lifestyle .
It is crucial to learn what you are getting into .
There will come a time where one is confronted with making a life decision .
This is something that affects others .
Knowing what the decision entails is the responsible approach .
There is a lot more to consider than just what one sees in some pics on asite .

“ Are you saying that you think Vice President Cheney is still having a chilling effect on people who might otherwise be coming forward , ” asked Gross .

Probably up to a point , a minor point .
But he ’s still there .
He ’s still a presence .
Over the last few years , I ’ve read a ton of time management books and tried out literally hundreds of systems and standalone ideas for maximizing the effectiveness of my time , particularly in terms of my work .
There ’s a huge , direct benefit for me when I find a productivity tip that really works .
It enables me to get more work done in the same amount of time ( allowing me to “ grow ” The Simple Dollar by writing in more venues or doing other things ) or get the same amount of work done in less time ( allowing me to spend more time with my family ) .
Here ’s the problem with productivity tips , though .
Most of them do n’t work .
Some are simply inefficient .
Others are only efficient in certain situations .
Still others only work well for people with certain mindsets .
I ’ve tried many , many productivity ideas , yet I keep coming back to the same handful in the end .
These tips work for me .
They keep me from wasting brain cycles on remembering what I need to do and when I need to do it .
They keep me from wasting time bouncing back and forth between projects .
I think most of them will work well for you – at the very least , they ’re worth trying .
1. Avoid multitasking like the plague .
Every time I attempt to multitask , I wind up doing each task with a lower level of quality than I would have if I had focused on just that task .
My concentration is n’t fully sustained on any of the tasks I juggle , so I wind up using only a slice of my brain for each task .
That simply results in lower quality work .
I also wind up investing the same amount of time – or even more – when I multitask .
That ’s because there ’s a brief pause each time I switch my primary concentration between multiple tasks .
If I keep switching back and forth , those lost seconds start to really add up .
In the end , I ’m left with tasks done in a mediocre fashion and , quite often , no time saved at all .
That , to me , is a lose - lose .
Here ’s the way to solve it : focus on only one task at a time .
Let the rest slide .
Work on that one task in bursts – at most an hour in length .
Then stop and catch up on any incoming messages you need to deal with , take a break , and so on .
How I Do It
When I begin a big task , I shut off everything .
I turn off my cell phone and the ringer on our home phone .
I close my email program .
I shut my office door .
I choose music ( or similar audio ) that ’s conducive to concentration .
I set the clock to an hour or so .
Then I bear down .
I do the research .
I write the article .
I let everything else go .
After about five minutes , I usually get into some sort of flow where I fail to even notice what time it is until my clock alerts me that the time is up .
When I stop and step back , I usually realize that I ’ve completed what seems like a lot of work , far more than I would have achieved with interruptions .
2. Keep a notebook / PDA with you and write down your thoughts .
We all have lots of good ideas float through our heads throughout the day : things we need to do , ideas for future directions , facts we need to look up .
In an average day , I usually have twenty or twenty five of these little things bubble up from my subconsciousness .
Many people try to just trap these in their conscious mind until they can do them , but doing that makes it harder to concentrate and really bear down on an important task .
You ’re using part of your mind to keep that idea locked in place .
Thus , you ’re unable to devote your full concentration to the task at hand – the multitasking problem all over again .
Instead of doing this , keep a pocket notebook or a PDA with you at all times to jot down any small things that pop into your head .
Do n’t worry about whether it ’s a good idea or not – just get it down on paper and deal with it later .
That way , you can go immediately back to whatever task you have on hand instead of wasting brain cycles on trapping that idea .
How I Do It
For years , I used a simple Mead pocket notebook to do this .
Quite often now , though , I simply jot the note down using my iPod Touch .
I use Evernote to do this .
Evernote allows me to see my notes , edit them , and add new ones on my iPod Touch even when I ’m offline , but I can access these notes , edit them , and add new ones from any web browser as well .
There ’s also a useful client program for Windows and for Macs , which I leave open all the time in case an idea pops into my head when I ’m working on something – I just switch to Evernote , jot it down , then go back to my main task very , very quickly .
3. Keep an “ inbox ” and process it once or twice a day .
So , what do you do with all of those jotted down notes – and with all of the other things that come your way in a given day , like mail , miscellaneous tasks people send to you by email , and so on ?
It ’s pretty simple – once or twice a day , process all of it .
Take some sort of action on all of those stored - up items – toss them in the trash , file them away , take care of the task , pencil it in on your calendar , or so on .
The goal needs to be eliminating everything in your inbox .
You should strive to get to “ empty ” once a day , with everything in there dealt with in some capacity .
If you let it build up , it will grow out of control .
How I Do It
I usually keep two separate “ inboxes ” – one on the computer and one on the left side of my desk .
I pick through each of these at least once a day , usually at the end of the day .
I make it my goal to deal with everything in some fashion , so I usually spend time adding to my idea file , taking care of little tasks , adding things to tomorrow ’s to - do list ( see # 5 ) , updating my calendar , updating my grocery list , and so on .
The biggest challenge I had to work through with this was not simply making another pile out of things that needed filing and things that need further reading ( like notes for a future post ) .
I ’ve recently solved that problem ( see # 7 ) .
4 . Keep a project list – and focus on it at least an hour a day .
We all have a lot of projects that we ’d like to work on – projects that are n’t really essential to what we ’re doing , but would go a long way towards making life easier once they ’re complete .
Things like reorganizing the pantry , cleaning out the garage , sorting through all of our kids ’ clothes and putting up everything that is n’t at least 3T in size , doing a small marketing project , writing something intriguing but complex , and so on – they vary widely from person to person .
One great method for doing this is Mark Forster ’s Autofocus system , which he ’s discussed in various forms in his books .
It ’s pretty simple , actually : you just keep a project list in a college - lined notebook , one project per line .
When you finish one , cross it off .
When you fill up a page , keep adding projects to the next one .
Then , when you ’re ready to tackle something , start going through the notebook , browsing all the tasks until you find one you want to do .
If you go through a whole page without tackling any projects on it , tear out the page and throw it away since the tasks left on it are ones you are n’t really compelled to do .
Of course , a project list is useless if you do n’t use it .
Set aside one hour each day where your focus is on one of the projects on your list .
Pick one out and make some progress .
How I Do It
I keep a “ to - do ” list that is a maximum of thirty items long for such projects .
I use Remember the Milk to keep this list .
I order it by the day that I add a task to the list , so that the oldest one is always at the top of the list .
If the list has thirty projects on it and I want to add another one , I simply delete the one on top of the list .
When I want to work on something , I start at the top of the list and go down the list until I find one that ’s compelling for me to work on at the moment .
This works amazingly well for me .
If a task reaches the top of the list and I have n’t taken significant action on it , it ’s because on some level I ’ve realized that I ’m not really that interested in the project .
It also keeps my “ project list ” from getting impossibly big , making it feel like a realistic thing to manage .
5. Keep a SHORT to - do list for each day – four items , max .
I used to weight down my to - do list with way too many things to do .
At the end of the day , though , I would not only feel as though I rushed through stuff , I ’d feel like I had n’t really accomplished too much because there was always stuff left on my list .
The solution is pretty simple .
Your to - do list should have at most four items on it .
Naturally , your day routine will have several other tasks that you do as part of a routine ( checking and responding to emails , maintenance tasks , regular meetings , and so on ) – do n’t include these on your to - do list .
Instead , those routine items should be used to fill in the gaps between the big items on your to - do list .
Finish off each day with the routine of ensuring your to - do list for tomorrow is ready , but you can / should be assembling it throughout the day .
Construct those items carefully so that they can be done with about fifty minutes of truly focused work .
This way , you can complete a task on your to - do list with a single block of focused time ( as in tip # 1 , above ) .
If you need to fit in more work than that on your to - do list , add it to the one for the day after tomorrow , or the day after that .
How I Do It
Again , I use Remember the Milk for this .
I just add items throughout the day to my lists , then at the end of the day , I fill up tomorrow ’s list to four items with tasks that always need done – drafting posts , researching a particular angle , and so on .
Each day , I live by this list .
I close out distractions and focus on one item on the list until it ’s done .
Then , I do all of my routine tasks in the gaps between these big jobs .
If things go well , I might steal an item from the next day ’s to - do list if I have time for a fifth thing .
6 . Check email only twice a day .
Email is almost always a major time sink .
It ’s rarely a simple matter of just reading messages .
Many messages demand responses , and some messages demand follow - up tasks .
Leaving that email window open throughout the day ensures only one thing – your concentration will be interrupted constantly by messages that come in that need responses .
My solution is to simply close the program .
Open it only two times a day or so and do an email session , where you deal with everything in your inbox .
Then , close the program completely ( including notifications ) and move onto something else .
If it ’s truly urgent , someone will come directly to you , so do n’t worry about missing out on something vital .
How I Do It
I check my email twice a day .
I often do one email session while eating lunch , then a second session just before finishing up tomorrow ’s to - do list and quitting for the day ( on occasion , I ’ll do a third one in the morning before the kids wake up , but this one is often interrupted ) .
My goal with each session is to clear out my inbox – I deal with every message immediately unless it involves a task that ’s going to take more than five minutes or so .
7 . File things once a day .
This is actually a pretty recent addition to my routine .
I had to add it simply because I had a giant pile of things that did n’t need immediate action , but needed to hang around for future reference : statements , prospectuses , post ideas , receipts , magazine articles , and so on .
My pile of such items eventually came to dominate my desk and it was often impossible to find anything in there .
To take care of this , I started a very simple filing system in a box that I keep next to my desk .
This keeps my desk clear most of the time ( giving me space to work on things at hand ) , plus it enables me to find stuff quickly when I want to find it .
The best part ?
Once the system is in place , it does n’t take much effort to maintain it – maybe a minute a day .
Considering I ’d often burn ten minutes digging through the pile finding things , this is a huge time saver for me .
How I Do It
I just made a filing system that makes sense to me , since these are just documents for my own use .
Six folders ( “ to - read , ” “ 2009 receipts , ” “ post ideas , ” “ prospectuses , ” “ 2009 account statements , ” and “ other ” ) .
Within each folder , everything is dated and ordered chronologically .
It works like a charm for me – I usually have a great idea of when I put things in there , so it ’s quite quick to find them .
Filing a day ’s worth of items takes less than a minute and I ’ve had no trouble finding a single thing .
8 . Start your day with your major creative or thought - intensive task .
When I start my day , I have a choice of the four items on my to - do list .
Which one will I tackle first ?
I ’ve usually had breakfast and a shower and prepared the kids for their day , so I ’m wide awake and my brain is running .
I ’ve found , time and time again , that starting your day with your most thought - intensive task sets the tone for the whole day .
It forces you into prime thinking early on and you can ride that wave throughout most of the day .
If I do a major thought - intensive task after several hours of work , my brain turns to mush for the rest of the day .
Finishing the day with my easiest task leaves me pretty fresh for my evening activities with my family .
How I Do It
Whenever I look at the day ’s to - do list , I always choose the item that seems to be the most thought intensive .
That means I do my heaviest thinking earlier in the day , usually ending with an afternoon task or two that does n’t require nearly as much active thought .
I ’ll do creative work in the mornings and things like interviews in the afternoon , for example .
9 . Take lots of microbreaks ( or at least switch to very different tasks regularly ) .
One of the biggest enemies in a workday is lethargy .
It ’s easy to find yourself in a low - energy period , sitting there having trouble keeping your eyes open or concentrating on anything .
Once you ’re there , it ’s often very hard to pull yourself out of it – you ’re running on low energy for the rest of the day , even if you do rebound a bit .
The best way to combat it is to never let your energy level get that low .
That means not sitting at your desk or your work area for long periods .
Get up and move on a regular basis .
Instead of eating a big , heavy lunch , eat smaller snacks throughout the day .
Stretch .
Drink water .
Do this as often as you can – bookend task sessions with a microbreak where you do these things .
How I Do It
Whenever I finish an isolated block , I take a five minute break .
I get up from my desk , walk downstairs , get a drink of water , use the bathroom , stretch a bit , and maybe grab a very small snack ( like a granola bar or a piece of fruit ) .
Doing this has basically eliminated the mid-afternoon energy lull I used to have – around two , I would basically hit a wall and not be productive for the rest of the day .
Now , I can keep going until … well , read the next tip .
10 .
Do n’t overwork .
Sure , once in a while , you have to put in some extra hours in order to really do your job well .
It ’s also important to note that different people have different energy levels for their day .
Given that , though , the worst mistake you can make is to overwork .
If you ’re nearing the end of the day and you just ca n’t seem to get anything done , do n’t push it .
Time and time again , I ’ve found that pushing myself to get just a little bit more done at the end of the day has long term negative ramifications .
I have a harder time getting going the next morning , for example , and if I do it consistently , my overall productivity slows to a crawl .
A followup to my previous post .
Here ’s how I think about it : you started a business with a bunch of borrowed money , but of course had to put some of your own money in .
Now , actually some of the money you put in was borrowed from your mother , but the original lenders do n’t care about that , since they have prior claim .
Eventually you run into some business difficulties , and your creditworthiness is in doubt — which in turn is making it hard for you to do business .
What you need is evidence of ability to repay the money you already owe .
So does it help if your mother converts her loan into a share of the business ?
Not really , because she wo n’t get repaid anyway unless all your other creditors get paid first .
So the terms of her agreement with you do n’t affect their prospects of payment .
And in this case , the TARP is your mother .
Doctors : Who Should Take Aspirin , and When Doctors put out new guidelines on when to start daily baby aspirin .
March 16 , 2009  --
An aspirin a day keeps the doctor away ...
That 's not the saying , but doctors have agreed , for about a generation , that an aspirin a day is good for you .
It may reduce the risk of heart attacks or strokes by 20 percent or more .
But at what age should you start ?
How much should you take ?
And is it different for men than women ?
The answers -- coming from different studies , interest groups , and insurance companies , were all over the map .
Now , the the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , an independent panel convened by the Department of Health and Human Services , has published guidelines it says should end the confusion .
The key points :
Men should start a daily aspirin at age 45 , mainly to protect against heart attacks .
Women should start at 55 , mainly to protect against stroke .
For both sexes , a baby aspirin -- typically 81 milligrams a day -- will do the job .
There is no evidence that a larger dose makes a difference .
And both sexes should stop by age 80 , unless their doctors say otherwise .
As you get older , there 's a greater risk of bleeding in the brain or the digestive system -- a risk that is small but can be fatal in some cases .
General guidelines do not always generate much response , but these are on a hot topic .
Doctors said they come from an influential group , and they 're being published in a widely - read medical journal , the Annals of Internal Medicine .
Numbers are hard to come by , but few people who would benefit from a daily baby aspirin appear to be taking one .
In one recent study , only 16.6 percent of those eligible were taking aspirin .
If they start , doctors say their risk of heart attack or stroke will drop by about 20 percent .
" People may ask themselves , ' Am I at risk for a heart attack or a stroke , ' " said Dr. Randal Thomas , director of cardiovascular health at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota .
" If you 're above age 45 and male , if you 're above age 55 and female , the answer is most likely yes , and you will most likely benefit from taking a small dose of aspirin a day . "
He pointed out that more people take statin drugs -- cholesterol - blocking drugs , such as Lipitor , Crestor or Zocor -- than take aspirin .
Aspirin costs far less , and may do as much or more to protect one 's health .
" I put people on aspirin at the drop of a hat , " said Dr. Linda Prine , a family physician in New York City .
There are other , more natural ways to protect oneself , said Dr. Dean Ornish , the bestselling author who now heads the Preventive Medicine Research Institute at the University of California , San Francisco .
" Making comprehensive lifestyle changes can reduce the likelihood of blood clots forming where you do n't want them to form without reducing the capacity of blood to clot where you do want it to occur , " he said in an e-mail to ABC News .
" This seems more productive than trying to parse out in which patients the benefits of aspirin may outweigh the risk , because there is still significant risk even in these patients . "
Actually , some doctors said , starting a daily aspirin is not a decision to be taken lightly , because the risk of bleeding is not to be ignored .
Some doctors recommend aspirin to patients at age 40 , or even in their 30s , when the benefit is small .
" If the decision is difficult for the doctor , imagine how difficult it is for the patient to decide , " said Dr. Albert Levy of New York 's Mt. Sinai School of Medicine .
" The patient will , at the end of the day , decide to take or not to take the doctor 's advice .
The doctor should explain the pros and cons and document the discussion as it is a very tricky issue .
Aspirin is great but also dangerous .
" I agree with the new recommendations , " he concluded .
The disappointment is now as searing for Liverpool as the excitement of this wild encounter .
They top the Premier League purely on goal difference and Manchester United , with two games in hand , must hunger for tonight 's match against Portsmouth at Old Trafford .
Liverpool will find the quartet of goals from Andrey Arshavin hard to tolerate , particularly since he had scored just twice for Arsenal since arriving from Zenit St Petersburg in mid-season .
Dejection has taken on a spectacular form for Rafael Benítez and his squad .
Professionalism prevents them from revelling in this exhilarating encounter .
The manager will know only that his side has become brittle at a critical phase .
After all , it was Chelsea 's 3 – 1 win here that , in effect , removed them from the Champions League a fortnight ago .
Arsenal were uncontainable and took the lead , for a third time , in the 90th minute .
They broke from a Liverpool corner and the substitute Theo Walcott set up Arshavin for the simplest of his goals .
The Russian 's execution was flawless throughout and every shot he struck here hit the net .
Liverpool 's endeavour was an unsatisfactory alternative for the command demanded of aspiring champions , but their spirit did deserve to be saluted when Yossi Benayoun , with his second goal , levelled in stoppage time after Javier Mascherano and the substitute Ryan Babel gave him the opening .
The sheer desire of Arsenal to compete was a great credit to Arsène Wenger and his squad .
They have nothing at stake in these late days of their League campaign .
Liverpool , for their part , have assumed an altered identity that does not suit them in the least .
They have scored 13 goals and shipped 11 in their last four outings .
Benítez did not savour this spectacle , but those who were enthralled are indebted to his men and to Arsenal .
Excitement kept rippling around Anfield and the superb Benayoun acted throughout as if he anticipated being the key factor .
Whether overwrought or merely unlucky , Liverpool could not capitalise on initial ebullience and fell behind nine minutes from the interval .
Mascherano delayed after taking a pass from Fabio Aurelio and was challenged by Cesc Fábregas .
The Arsenal captain then collected a return ball from Samir Nasri and sent in a low cross that Arshavin slammed home off the underside of the bar .
This boisterous occasion might have been a kind of rehabiliation for Lukasz Fabianski , the Arsenal goalkeeper who had been at fault in the 2–1 FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea last Saturday .
A clean sheet would have been preferable to the Pole , but there was plenty of valuable work for him to carry out .
Early in the game , he had to make a double block at the feet of Benayoun and then Dirk Kuyt .
It is ironic that there was so much dread at Liverpool over the loss of Steven Gerrard to an adductor muscle injury , because his dynamism has not been missed in the slightest by the team .
They have lost their rigour and embraced gusto instead .
Fabianski had twice to turn away drives by Torres that were smacked from outside the area .
There was also a goal - line clearance from Nasri after Daniel Agger connected with a corner in the 31st minute .
But Liverpool 's control was far from complete and Arsenal 's opener was not the first moment in which the visitors provoked fear .
After Agger headed out a cross in the 29th minute , Nicklas Bendtner failed narrowly to touch Fábregas 's volley into the net .
The warning went unheard by Liverpool as Arshavin , with his opener , started to put their prospects of the league title in jeopardy .
Arsenal , however , failed to make the frustrations mount quickly .
With four minutes of the second half gone an inept clearance by Bacary Sagna invited Kuyt to cross from the right and Torres converted at the near post with a header .
Seven minutes later , Fabianski twice failed to boot the ball far enough away .
The left - back Kieran Gibbs then lost possession to Kuyt .
The Dutchman again sent in a deep cross and Benayoun put Liverpool in front with a header that sent the ball over the line before it was clawed out by Fabianski .
In an elated stadium , Arsenal were equally energised by the atmosphere .
The visitors were level in 67 minutes when Alvaro Arbeloa was lax enough to let Arshavin have possession .
From the fringes of the area , he sent a wonderful drive bending past the left hand of Pepe Reina .
There was nothing composed about Liverpool on this highly - charged night and Arsenal soon re-established a lead as Aurelio 's weak clearance left Arshavin to complete the hat - trick .
Liverpool levelled at 3 –3 , however , as Torres held off Mikael Silvestre before dispatching a low ball from Albert Riera .
For once , however , a team galvanised by the Anfield atmosphere could not land the decisive blow and instead revealed their own glass jaw .
It all starts with a good foundation ....

This graph shows that US electricity generation has been growing fairly steadily since 1970 , unlike petroleum use .
To the extent there was change from the long - term trend , it was between 1981 and 1990 , when production from natural gas was lower due to a change in regulation .
The other dip was in 2008 , when net generation is down about 1 % .
Electricity is something we are coming to depend more and more on as liquid fuels become less certain .
At the same time , big changes are planned for electricity , both in terms of fuel mix and in terms carbon treatment .
In this post , I show a few graphs relating to US Electricity , and offer some comments on how what I see relates to the challenges at hand .
Figure 1 also shows that coal is the largest source of generation , and production as grown over the years .
Natural gas and nuclear have been the big sources of electric growth over the years -- natural gas because of building more plants , and nuclear because of running nuclear plants at closer to full capacity .
Graphs on the EIA website break down electricity growth into the various sectors - residential , commercial , industrial , and a tiny amount of transportation .
( I think of commercial as office buildings and stores . )
Figure 2 - From EIA website
One can see from Figure 2 that Residential and Commercial purchases of electricity has continued to grow , regardless of recessions or change in petroleum supply , since 1975 .
Industrial consumption has been pretty flat , regardless .
In 2008 , total consumption is down , but most of the decrease is in industrial .
Figure 3
Figure 3 shows recent growth in US electricity generation capacity , based on EIA data .
Electricity and nuclear have been absolutely flat in terms of capacity .
Growth in production shown in Figure 1 came from greater use of existing capacity , rather than more capacity .
There has been a huge ramp - up of natural gas capacity in recent years .
When this capacity was built in the early 1990s , natural gas was thought to be cheap ( and it is looking increasingly that way now , again , but cheapness has bad implications for long term supply ) .
While gas prices were high , electricity from natural gas was expensive , so much of the additional capacity is not used very heavily .
Part of the low usage is by design as well - to add temporary higher capacity when needed .
If necessary ( and adequate is available ) , considerably more electricity could be generated using natural gas without building more plants .
Wind capacity can be barely be seen near the top as a thin blue line , next to the top .
It clearly has a long way to go , to replace any substantial amount of the other fuels .
Solar is not shown separately on the graph .
It is part of " Other " .
Figure 4 - From EIA Website
Figure 4 shows that electricity prices ramped up steeply in the 1973 to 1983 period , then were fairly flat until 2003 or 2004 .
After that they started ramping up again , as natural gas prices rose .
If a person compares Figure 4 with Figure 2 , it appears that the price of electricity is almost immaterial to residential and commercial consumers , when it comes to the amount of electricity purchased .
The growth in demand is almost the same when prices were increasing rapidly as when they were flat .
This makes one wonder how much difference carbon tax or cap and trade legislation will have on electricity usage , at least in the short term for residential and commercial consumers .
More likely , a high price will result primarily in a drop in the purchase of other goods -- perhaps restaurant meals , or a drop in new hires at a commercial establishment .
Over the long term there may be a change in behavior because of higher prices , but short - term price - sensitivity seems to be quite low .
The only type of electrical demand which has not been growing is industrial use .
It was growing very little , even when electricity prices were flat .
Thus , it does n't seem to be all that dependent on the price of electricity either .
It may depend on other factors -- cheaper labor overseas , or a general recession .
A cap and trade program or a carbon tax would likely raise the price of electricity , but it is not clear whether the higher price would have much impact on total electrical consumption , except perhaps in the very long run .
Short run demand seems very inelastic .
If the price of electricity rises , consumers are likely to reduce the purchase of something else , rather than the electricity .
Total electrical consumption will likely depend more on how the economy as a whole is doing .
If families move in together , and stores close , consumption will be down .
Thus , it seems like the big impact of a cap and trade program or carbon tax will be on the rest of the economy ( unless they are somehow revenue neutral ) , not on electricity usage per se .
What happens to total electricity demand going forward ?
In 2008 , we are seeing a dip in demand , particularly for industrial use .
If the recession gets worse , we could see this dip in demand continue , as families move in with each other , stores close , and industrial demand worsens .
This scenario may actually be fairly likely , if the economy begins to contract significantly .
On the other hand , what most forecasters are expecting is that electricity use will continue to escalate in the years ahead , especially for residential and commercial users .
In addition , if transportation is increasingly fueled by electricity , this will further add to demand .
Because of this , they believe that total generation will need to continue to increase .
It seems to me that there are likely to be problems , regardless of whether total electricity use contracts or expands .
If demand contracts
If electricity demand contracts , electricity prices are likely to start increasing .
One reason this happens is that a significant share of electricity costs are fixed , and do not decrease , even if the amount of electricity sold decreases .
Also , new electricity generation will overlap with existing capacity , and the cost of renewable generation will be doubly high .
This is the situation is already happening , as described in this article quoted in yesterday 's Drumbeat .
In Arizona , Tucson Electric Power in January raised rates 6 % , or $ 4.29 a month for an average customer , to fund new solar power to meet state quotas .
Solar is pricey , costing more than twice as much as natural - gas - fired electricity .
And since Arizona has surplus natural - gas power , the solar energy is not replacing generators that would be built otherwise , says the utility 's Joe Salkowski .
One issue is that utilities generally finance new capacity .
They will need to pay the cost of this capacity , whether or not something else ( like wind ) replaces its production , so their costs do n't necessarily go down , except by the price of the fuel they no longer need , which is only a small share of total costs .
If demand rises
If , on the other hand , electrical consumption continues to rise , it is hard to see where the necessary capacity will come from , especially if fossil fuels are out of favor .
It will take a huge capital expenditure to provide enough wind capacity to compensate for growth .
If wind or solar is expected to replace coal or natural gas , or nuclear , that will be an additional challenge .
If transportation is to be increasingly powered by electricity , this makes keeping up with demand all the more difficult .
One can see from Figure 1 what a low percentage of electricity generation now comes from wind and solar .
On this site , we have been looking at the peak oil problem .
If one talks to people in the electricity sector , their problems are almost as insurmountable , but for different reasons .
It seems like every rock a person turns over reveals new problems .
I was stuck in traffic with a broken tape deck , barely paying attention to the stupefyingly flat drone of NPR when I heard a story that made me want to carpet bomb the entire US .
Just get it done with .
Let nature start anew .
The segment was done on a small chain of upscale houseware stores in New England , called Bowl & Board .
Like countless other small businesses all around the country , the chain had been operating on the brink of collapse for months .
With fewer and fewer shoppers willing to dish out money for overpriced decorations , one of their chain ’s locations started bleeding money , quickly fell behind on rent and brought the chain ’s other still - profitable locations down with it .
The landlord , a huge company called Capital Properties , Inc. , based in New York City , got skittish about the backrent and sued Bowl & Board to get their money back .
Being the respectable family business that it is , Bowl & Board immediately offered to empty out its bank account to pay the back rent in full .
But with the store losing money , Bowl & Board would go bankrupt if they were forced to keep paying rent .
So they made Capital Properties an offer .
They asked to be let out of the three - and - a - half - year commitment they still had on their lease and , as a gesture of goodwill , offered to pay three months worth of rent on top of what they owed .
Bowl & Board was in a desperate situation .
They made that much clear to landlord .
But instead of taking the money and wishing Bowl & Board the best of luck in these tough times , the Capital Properties ’ pack of lawyers decided to keep the store locked into the contract .
They figured their boss would make more money if they pushed Bowl & Board into bankruptcy .
That way , not only would back rent be recovered , but they ’d also be able to liquidate the store ’s inventory and cover most of the balance on the remaining lease .
It was a vicious , heartless move .
Bowl & Board was n’t Pottery Barn .
The stuff was n’t made in China , either .
It was a family business that had the founder ’s kids managing various stores and his grandkids working the back and making deliveries .
All in all , they employed about 30 people in their stores and did business with 300 vendors right here in the US , many of them local artisans in the Massachusetts area .
When I phoned up Mark Giarrusso , the owner of Bowl & Board , to get his reaction , I expected to catch him brimming with hate , just like me .
What did he think about his money - grubbing landlord trying to push his family out on the street ?
The bastards are deliberately fanning the flames of the recession , I said , muttering something about “ lynch mobs ” and “ vigilante justice . ”
He brushed me off with a nervous chuckle .
“ Well , you know , I do n’t blame the landlord , ” he said , soft - spoken and respectful .
“ I blame the system that lets this happen .
You know , I ’ll never go into business again with someone I can’t shake hands with .
This is primal , caveman stuff .
But it ’s true .
The landlord is sitting in NYC , he does n’t know how closing the store will affect the community .
We have no connection .
To them , it ’s just numbers on a page . ”
But as he explained how this bunk deal went down , it was clear that he was holding his anger in check .
There was no disconnect here .
His landlords knew exactly what they were doing .
It turns out that the story is not as simple as NPR reported .
Bowl & Board was not just behind on the rent and getting sued for it .
Giarrusso knew that the store would soon start lapsing on its payments and contacted Capital Properties to try to sublet the property or renegotiate his lease , lower the rent by 27 % ( which is what it had been until they jacked up the price one and a half years ago ) .
He pleaded with them , but they would n’t have any of it .
His landlord knew that unless something was done , and quickly , Bowl & Board would fall behind on rent .
But that ’s exactly what they wanted .
Snooping around , they discovered that money could be squeezed out Bowl & Board ’s inventory .
So instead of negotiating , the firm stonewalled him while it moved in for the kill .
They got an attorney on the case and sent a court summons to an old , non-existent address .
They wanted Giarusso to miss his court date ; they were planning on it .
His no -show made it much easier to convince the judge to freeze Bowl & Board ’s bank account until they could get their money back .
The whole chain had only $ 50,000 in the vault .
It was chump change ; but for Bowl & Board , it was life or death .
No access meant no salaries for employees or squaring of accounts with vendors .
“ These are difficult times , ” Giarrusso told me .
“ Everyone is bending right now .
I ’m not making a killing as a retailer and those I work with know that .
Some of my vendors are giving free freight .
Everyone knows they need to take it on the chin until things get better . ”
But not Capital Properties .
They ’re actually trying to make money off other people ’s misery .
Predatorial business is what they are all about .
But they are n’t the only ones .
As Bowl & Board found a few weeks later , the filthy rich and their bulldog lawyers are n’t the only ones trying to make a poor man into a bum .
The average American is always eager to help out .
Last week , Bowl & Board held a blow - out sale at their dying store to shore up cash .
Customers swarmed the place to take advantage of the unbelievable deals , snapping up couches , chairs , vases , mirrors and all kinds of quaint home decorations , all for 75 % off .
Bowl & Board was counting on that much .
But they grossly underestimated the voracious appetite of New England shoppers .
The greed shocked the store ’s employees .
“ They ’re like vultures , ” one of the distressed employees told an NPR correspondent , her voice was straining and on the edge of tears .
“ They ’re getting a really good deal .
But at someone else ’s loss . ”
Store workers looked on in horror as their greedy customers morphed from conscientious , polite New England liberals into rabid hyenas feeding at the carcass , snapping at each other , fighting and haggling with the clerks .
Some of shoppers demanded they be allowed to carry off the cheap plastic bins that some of the items were placed in for display .
Others did n’t bother hiding their annoyance when store clerks refused their ridiculous 90 % off counteroffers .
Somebody wanted the store to throw in some display shelves at no extra cost .
Everyone knew the sale was a last ditch effort to keep the business afloat .
But there was no sign of sympathy or good will .
They smelled Bowl & Board ’s desperation and moved in to tear off as big a chunk of meat as they could .
Americans — especially stuffy New Englanders — never bargain at stores , because we ’d be too embarrassed of getting laughed at .
But all that changed at Bowl & Board that day .
When you ’re dealing with the mortally weak , bullying stops being demeaning and uncouth .
“ What can I do ?
I ’m in the same situation .
Everyone is in the same situation .
There ’s going to be more of this , ” said one shopper defensively .
Her house had been foreclosed and now she was out and about shopping to decorate her new apartment .
Her logic was brutally simple : I was screwed by my bank and need money .
So I ’m gonna do what I have to do any way I can , even if it means screwing someone who is as badly off as I am .
As I sat there in standstill traffic , looking around at the people sitting in their cars around me , I realized that this was the real face of American Depression .
Forget all the bullshit sentimental talk of how Americans pull together in bad times
There is no saccharine Steinbeckian redemption forthcoming .
This is real life .
And real life says you wo n’t get any help from your neighbors .
Real life says that hard times bring out the worst of people .
So stick with your clan , because it ’s only going to get worse .

Is it possible that a Hebrew gospel of Matthew once existed ?
Could it actually be true that the first gospel written was composed in the Hebrew language ?
At one time scholars would have laughed at such an idea .
But they are n’t laughing now .
Some recent discoveries have stunned the scholarly world and are radically changing what people believe about the origins of the gospel of Matthew .
Traditionally , the universities of the western world have taught that the Gospel of Matthew was not the first gospel written , that it was written originally in Greek , and that it was composed after 70 A.D.
However , as new discoveries have been made , those assumptions have been shown to be stone cold wrong .
As researchers are looking into the writings of the early church leaders , they are finding that not only was the gospel of Matthew most definitely the first gospel written ( almost certainly before 50 A.D. ) , but that it was also originally written in the Hebrew language !
Just check out some of the following quotes .
The reality is that the unanimous testimony of the early church was that Matthew was the first gospel written and that it was composed in Hebrew …..
Origen ( Eusebius , H.E. 6.25.4 ) : “ As having learnt by tradition concerning the four Gospels , which alone are unquestionable in the Church of God under heaven , that first was written according to Matthew , who was once a tax collector but afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ , who published it for those who from Judaism came to believe , composed as it was in the Hebrew language . ”
Papias ( Eusebius , H.E. 3.39.16 ) : “ Matthew collected the oracles ( ta logia ) in the Hebrew language , and each interpreted them as best he could . ”
Irenaeus , Adv. Haer . 3.1.1 : “ Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church . ”
Eusebius , H.E. 3.24.6 : “ Matthew had first preached to Hebrews , and when he was on the point of going to others he transmitted in writing in his native language the Gospel according to himself , and thus supplied by writing the lack of his own presence to those from whom he was sent . ”
Epiphanius ( ca. 315-403 ) , bishop of Salamis , refers to a gospel used by the Ebionites ( Panarion 30 .
13.1-30.22.4 ) .
He says it is Matthew , called “ According to the Hebrews ” by them , but says it is corrupt and mutilated .
He says Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew letters .
He quotes from this Ebionite Gospel seven times .
These quotations appear to come not from Matthew but from some harmonized account of the canonical Gospels .
And did you know that one of the 12 disciples of Jesus named Bartholomew actually carried a Hebrew copy of the book of Matthew into India ?
Check out this astounding excerpt from an excellent article that we found :
——
http://www.onlinetruth.org/Articles%20Folder/hebrew_gospel_of_matthew.htm
This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew , an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus ’ ministry , was indeed the author of the first Gospel and verifies both the Jewishness and early date of the first Gospel .
Now , we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was written in Hebrew – not Greek or Aramaic , as widely thought – and was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the Far East .
Two of the earliest Church Fathers and historians , Eusebius and Origen , wrote that a second , long - overlooked apostle , Bartholomew , also went to India and took a Gospel text with him , according to Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett .
In his ground - breaking book , “ A History of Christianity in Asia , ” Moffett reveals that Pantaenus , a church historian and missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D. , discovered the copy of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with him .
“ It is reported , ” wrote Eusebius , a fourth century bishop and church historian , “ that among person there who knew Christ , ( Pantaenus ) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew ( which had arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century ) .
For Bartholomew , one of the apostles , had preached to them , and left them ( in India ) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which they had preserved . ”
“ There is a shock hidden in that matter - of - fact statement .
… The surprise , of course , is the mention of Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East , ” Moffett says .
Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever going to India , and some even doubt that Thomas himself went .
Moffett ponders , “ What was Bartholomew … doing in India with a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew ? ”
——
That truly IS a groundbreaking question .
What in the world WAS Bartholomew doing in India with a Hebrew gospel of Matthew ?
This new scholarship is shattering the preconception that the entire New Testament was only written in Greek .

Arnott 's Biscuits has issued a legal ultimatum to doughnut maker Krispy Kreme , alleging that its " Iced Dough - Vo " is too similar to Arnott 's " Iced Vo-Vo " .
Arnott 's lawyers have asked Krispy Kreme to stop using the name Iced Dough - Vo no later than 5:00 pm ( AEST ) today ( 24 April ) .
Arnott 's says that Krispy Kreme 's product visually resembles the Iced Vo-Vo biscuit , and the Iced Dough - Vo tag is phonetically almost identical .
It says this is clearly misleading and deceptive , and violates the trademark on the Iced Vo-Vo name , which it has held since 1906 .
The Arnott 's biscuit is topped with pink fondant , a strip of strawberry jam and sprinkled with coconut , while the Dough - Vo is also covered in pink fondant and coconut .
Arnott's is alleging breaches of the Trade Marks Act and Trade Practices Act , and says it could seek injunctions , damages and an account of profits , and orders for corrective advertising and costs .
But , while it reserves its right to take legal action , Arnott 's says it may not take action if the offending doughnuts are renamed .
Wo n't rename
Krispy Kreme doughnuts says it will not remove its Iced Dough - Vo product from sale , despite the threat of legal action by Arnott 's biscuits for a breach of the Trade Practices Act .
The chief executive of Krispy Kreme , John McGuigan , says the product attempts to pay tribute to an Australian icon .
" We did receive a request from lawyers representing Arnott 's that we withdraw these from the shelves in our stores because we were allegedly in breach of various trademarks , " he said .
" We 've taken advice on that of course , and that advice is , that 's not the case , and that Krispy Kreme customers are pretty smart and they can tell the difference between a doughnut and a biscuit . "

USING a train , tram or a bus should attract the same tax concessions as driving a car , both Connex and the State Government have told a Senate inquiry into federal funding of the nation 's public transport .
" Public transport fares attract no tax concession , " Connex 's head of corporate affairs , Mark Paterson , yesterday told the inquiry , which is conducting hearings throughout Australia .
" Tax concessions to private motorists should either be removed or similar concessions be afforded to public transport users , " Mr Paterson said .
The more kilometres Australian motorists clock up in their company car , the more they are rewarded by the fringe benefits tax system .
Less generous tax concessions apply to public transport use .
The Brumby Government 's Department of Transport also made a presentation to the inquiry , and the department 's head of policy , Michael Hopkins , agreed public transport should attract tax concessions , although he said tax incentives for drivers should stay .
" Fringe benefit tax currently treats motor vehicle use and public transport differently , " Mr Hopkins said .
" We would be seeking more equitable treatment of public transport . "

" It 's amazing that beers this antique can still taste so delicious , " he said .
“ Established wisdom would say beers this old should taste of vinegar , damp rags and Marmite .
Instead , many show flavours of raisins and sultanas , baked apple and honey .
The oldest – the 1869 Ratcliff Ale – is bright and luminous like an ancient Amontillado sherry and has a meaty character like smoked partridge with hints of molasses .
It 's amazing it tastes this good after 137 years . "

' Smear the Queer ' : Gay Students Tell Their Stories Adults ' actions during grade school can sway the fate of gay teens , experts say .
April 17 , 2009  --
From the time Preston
Whitt , now 18 , entered kindergarten , he knew he was different .
He also quickly learned that the teachers did n't know what to do about it .
" In my elementary school during PE , there was a favorite dodge ball game of all the students called ' smear the queer , ' " said Whitt , of Decatur , Ala .
" I still , at that time , did not realize , Oh ' I 'm gay , ' but the whole premise of the game bothered me .
I remember saying to the coach , ' Can we play a different game -- I do n't like that game . "
Instead of changing the game , Whitt said the teacher decided he should be " the queer " for the day .
" The whole premise of the game is that all the students run around and throw balls at the student designated as the queer … very similar to the old idea of stoning , " joked Whitt .
The tone - deaf mentality of his teachers did n't stop there .
Whitt can remember asking a teacher to stop kids making fun of the way he talked , but she just said he needed to talk differently .
In late elementary school , he used to fear going to the bathroom because a bully might be in there .
Finally ,
Whitt stopped asking for help .
But he said he will join in the annual National Day of Silence to draw attention to anti-gay bullying .
Clearly , children 's words -- and the inaction of adults -- can hurt .
Just last week an 11 - year - old boy in Springfield , Mass. , committed suicide , reportedly because he was distressed that his classmates repeatedly called him " gay . "
But school psychologists are increasingly interested in what teachers and parents say -- especially since they are often the first to notice developing tensions over a child 's gender and sexual identity .
Lisa Rivero of Brevard County , Fla. , spotted problems with her child by the third grade .
" He had always been bullied .
Even from elementary school the kids have been calling him ' faggot ' and ' gay ' because he did n't fit the gender norm of what a normal boy should be doing , " Rivero said of her now 17 - year - old son , Josh .
Although no one ever asked her outright , Rivero said she got hints that teachers and school administrators were questioning her son 's sexual orientation .
" I had one teacher tell me during a parent teacher conference , ' Well , I have some concerns about him that during recess he prefers to be with the girls and not with the boys , ' " said Rivero .
" I said , was he struggling academically because of it ?
If no , well then that 's his decision . "
Some families are completely shocked when their children come out the closet .
But Rivero said she was among many other parents who guessed their child 's sexual orientation long before the child even knew what it meant .
" It did n't come to as a surprise to us .
...
We were just waiting for him to come to the realization , " Rivero said .
Rivero said Josh came out the summer before starting high school .
" I 've talked to so many other parents who say the same thing , especially moms , " Rivero said .
" There are so many moms , we can't describe it .
We just know . "
But what many parents do n't know is what to do to help their children cope with emotional distress .
Gay Students Asking for More Protection in Schools
" We 're never going to make school children not pick on other school children , " said Whitt .
But he does think a written school policy about bullying gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender schoolchildren would make a difference .
" Just putting a sign on the wall including sexual orientation and gender identity makes that difference , " he said .
Whitt said he could remember reading the behavioral policy signs about respect on the walls of his elementary school .
" Once I realized what gay actually meant , if I had seen on there ' gay students ' I would have reported it much more , " he said .
" If it 's , ' Oh , guess what ?
You get to be the queer and everyone gets to throw the ball at you , ' that student is much less likely to report it ever again . "
Researchers say it 's essential to start addressing anti-gay actions early .
Caitlyn Ryan , a clinical researcher at San Francisco State University has done extensive research about family attitudes in childhood and the mental , emotional and physical health of young adults who identify as homosexuals .
Ryan said parents like Rivero may be picking up on real signals , and that the first awareness of sexual preferences -- either heterosexual or homosexual -- often develops before puberty .
" The research shows all young people at an average age of 10 begin to have their first crush , " said Ryan .
" It might be a celebrity they put up on the wall , or they give someone a valentine . "
In generations past , Ryan said people came out of the closet at much older ages .
However , with increasing awareness of homosexuality on TV , in high schools , on the Internet and in the news , Ryan said children today are more likely to put two and two together much earlier .
" Many people knew that they were gay at early ages , typically boys -- they knew when they were 5 , or 8 or 10 , " she said .
This early awareness , in combination with immature children , can lead to serious problems in schools without proper intervention .
Last February , an openly gay middle school student named Lawrence King , 15 , of Oxnard , Calif. , was allegedly shot and killed in a classroom by a fellow student , Brandon McInerney .
King 's family is suing the school and a gay rights organization for failing to protect its son from McInerney , who was charged as an adult and has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder and a hate crime , according to The Associated Press .
School and family psychologists have been studying this issue more in recent years , and are just now developing tested recommendations that might help at - risk children while streering clear of debates about religious or moral beliefs .
When the Word ' Gay ' Comes up in Third Grade
" Teachers , even with the best of intentions , do n't know what to do .
They do n't want to talk about religious beliefs or sex , " said Suzanne Greenfield , the senior " Safe Schools " coordinator for Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays , Greenfield explained .
Rivero said she went through a trying time with well - meaning teachers to deal with children who taunted her son .
Rivero remembers her son first asking what ' gay ' mean in the third grade after a bullying incident .
To the best of her ability , she sat down Josh and his younger sister and tried to explain what it meant in children 's terms .
" I spoke with principals over the years and got the typical responses : ' Oh well , he needs to toughen up ' or ' Oh , it 's usually his fault , ' " Rivero said .
By high school the family was dealing with threats of physical violence on MySpace .
Rivero said the school administration told her the only way she could ensure her son did n't have a class with the boy who was threatening him was to get a restraining order .
" It was n't until that kid got off the bus and was handed a restraining order that his parents were ever notified that this was going on , " said Rivero .
School psychologists across the country say it's an unfortunate but not an unheard of tactic to stop bullying .
" In my middle school kids are arrested [ for bullying ] all the time , although I do n't necessarily agree with it , " said Lisa Persinger , a psychologist at the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona and chairwoman of the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender and Questioning Issues Committee of the National Association of School Psychologists .
Persinger said schools need not discuss sensitive issues like homosexuality to combat bad behavior and slurs .
Instead , a better tactic is to pre-emptively discuss what behaviors and words are allowed .
" The schools that do better with this are schools that have schoolwide positive behavior support rather than schools that use only discipline measures when students misbehave , " said Persinger .
Greenfield 's work across the country supports similar stances ; pre-emptively talk about acceptable words and behavior but avoid going too far into the personal lives of children .
" It 's about behavior and what 's acceptable behavior and what is n't , " said Greenfield .
" You are n't talking about gender and sexuality unless you 're talking about it in a health class . "
" This is not actually that difficult of a conversation to have , " she said .
Drug Use , Suicide and Pain in Gay and Lesbian Adults
While Greenfield insists that discussing homosexuality in the classroom is easy , Ryan said the opposite is often true when families are faced with the issue .
Ryan and her research team at the Family Acceptance Project have interviewed more than 200 openly gay young adults and their families , from various ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds in California .
She found lesbian , gay and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection were 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide , 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression , 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs and 3.4 times more likely to engage in unprotected sex compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection .
Preventing Tragedies at Home
" We 've had families where the way that they found out was that the child tried to commit suicide , " said Ryan .
" What they learned was that the child was so afraid that the positive relationship they had with their parents would be lost that they were so afraid that they would take their own lives . "
In a few months , Ryan said her organization will be ready to present studies showing specific behaviors among parents that contribute to better physical and mental health , and those that may unintentionally cause harm .
Ryan said the recommendations from her research could help families regardless of their religious view points or ideas about homosexuality .
" Even parents who are rejecting still spoke with concern about what would happen to their child , " said Ryan about the findings in her study .
" A very important message for parents and caregivers from our research is to provide a support . "
" One of the things that parents can do early on is when a subject comes up in the news , which happens a lot nowadays , to give positive messages or neutral messages , " she said .

Mexican gang activity seeping into Houston Mexican cartels infiltrate Houston
Recent arrests in a mistaken killing point to the perilous presence of gangs
Jose Perez was enjoying a night out with his wife , Norma , in 2006 when hitmen with a Mexican drug cartel mistook him for a rival trafficker and gunned him down .

The order was clear : Kill the guy in the Astros jersey .
But in a case of mistaken identity , Jose Perez ended up dead .
The intended target — the Houston - based head of a Mexican drug cartel cell pumping millions of dollars of cocaine into the city — walked away .
Perez , 27 , was just a working guy , out getting dinner late on a Friday with his wife and young children at Chilos , a seafood restaurant on the Gulf Freeway .
His murder and the assassination gone awry point to the perilous presence of Mexican organized crime and how cartel violence has seeped into the city .
Arrests came in December when police and federal agents got a break in the 2006 shooting as they charted the relationship and rivalries between at least five cartel cells operating in Houston .
A rogue ’s gallery of about 100 names and mug shots taken at Texas jails and morgues offers a blueprint for Mexican organized crime .
Houston has long been a major staging ground for importing illegal drugs from Mexico and shipping them to the rest of the United States , but a recent Department of Justice report notes it is one of 230 cities where cartels maintain distribution networks and supply lines .
At Chilos , the real crime boss was sitting at another table , as were two spotters .
The hitman waited in the parking lot for Perez to leave the restaurant .
“ I just remember that guy coming up to us and he started shooting and shooting and shooting and never stopped , ” said Norma Gonzalez , Perez ’s widow .
He was hit twice .
“ I know they will pay for what they have done , maybe in the next life , ” she said of Perez ’s killers .
“ I do n’t know what is going to happen to them in this life . ”
Problem ‘ far - reaching ’
The gangster — captured on surveillance video — blended in with other customers as they gawked at the aftermath .
A few months later , he was dead too , gunned down two miles from the restaurant .
“ It is here and it has been here , but people do n’t want to listen , ” Rick Moreno , a Houston police homicide investigator working with the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI , said of the cartels ’ presence in Houston .
" It is so far - reaching > "
Washington is taking notice , even if the toll on U.S. streets is nowhere near as pervasive as in Mexico , where cartels are locked in a war against one another and with the government .
“ International drug trafficking organizations pose a sustained , serious threat to the safety and security of our communities , ” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said .
“ We can provide our communities the safety and the security that they deserve only by confronting these dangerous cartels head - on without reservation , ” he said .
When it comes to tearing into the cartels in Houston , an investigation later code - named Operation Three Stars got quietly under way three years ago , as an undercover DEA agent stood in line at a McDonald ’s in north Houston .
He listened to a drug trafficker using a two - way radio to set up delivery of $ 750,000 ; the man was with his wife and kids , ordering Happy Meals while making the deal .
Shifting alliances
Since then , more than 70 people in Houston have been prosecuted as a result of the ongoing operation and more than $ 5 million has been seized , as well as about 3,000 pounds of cocaine , according to court documents and law enforcement officers .
How many people are involved in cartel business is unknown , authorities said .
Alliances shift quickly , as can the need to shut down to evade the law .
Federal agents concede that numbers garnered by the operation pale compared to the cash and drugs pumped through Houston , but contend they ’ve headed off countless crimes .
“ The public never gets the full picture , they do n’t understand these murders , these kidnappings , these violent crimes are directly tied to these organizations , ” said Vio­let Szeleczky , spokeswoman for the DEA regional office in Houston .
“ A lot of these guys are just real dirtbags . ”
Hard to spot connections
In the murky underworld , it takes time and luck to connect dots .
The accused mastermind of the Chilos attack , Jaime Zamora , 38 , is charged with capital murder .
He lived modestly , worked for Houston ’s Parks and Recreation Department and was a Little League volunteer .
State prosecutor Colleen Barnett said in court that such a profile was how he avoided detection .
Paul Looney , Zamora ’s lawyer , contends the government can’t prove his client has ever touched drugs or drug money , or that he is a crime boss .
He added that Zamora had never before been arrested .
“ I do n’t think there is a chance in hell ( the prosecutor ) is right about her theory of the case , ” Looney said .
Court documents indicate Steven Torres , 26 , one of the men charged with helping Zamora with the 2006 killing , confessed “ his part involving arranging the murder . ”
In 2002 , he was sentenced to 10 years probation after being convicted of a murder he committed when he was 16 .
His lawyer could not be reached .
Authorities , saying it ’s tough to spot cartel connections because the gangsters work in several jurisdictions , point to at least seven homicides in the Houston area since 2006 , as well as nine home invasions and five kidnappings tied to cartels .
They believe there are many more .
Among the unsolved local killings is the death of Pedro Cardenas Guillen , 36 , whose last name is considered trafficking royalty .
He was shot in the head and left in a ditch off Madden Road , near Fort Bend County .
His uncle is Osiel Cardenas Guillen , reputed head of the powerful Gulf Cartel .
He was extradited from Mexico and awaits trial in Houston on charges of drug trafficking , money laundering and threatening to kill federal agents .
Third attempt succeeded
Other victims of what authorities believe are cartel - related murders include a husband and wife who were tortured and shot in the head on Easingwold Drive , in northwest Houston .
About 220 pounds of cocaine were later found in their attic .
Some victims were in the drug business and may have owed money ; others could be relatives of criminals or innocent victims , authorities say .
Santiago “ Chago ” Salinas , 28 , the crime boss who escaped death at Chilos , was killed six months later .
High on cocaine as he answered the door of a room at the Baymont Inn on the Gulf Freeway , he was shot three times in the head .
It was the third and final attempt on the life of the man who ’d once been shot in the neck and left for dead in Mexico .
His killing may have been the latest payback between rivals slugging it out .
Chago ’s brother - in - law was killed in Mexico , as was Zamora ’s younger brother , who was known as “ Danny Boy ” and who was a lieutenant in a trafficking organization , according to authorities .
Danny
Boy ’s boss , a major player in the Sinaloa cartel , also was murdered in Mexico .
Survivors remember
Those who survive the wrath of cartel gangsters do n’t forget .
“ I thought I was going to die for sure , ” recalled David DeLeon , a used - car dealer who was kidnapped on Airline Drive and severely beaten while being held for ransom , also in 2006 .
He was rescued by Houston police , but not before he was punched , kicked and thrown across a room so much that his face was unrecognizable .
Authorities say the kidnappers were low - ranking thugs working for a cartel cell .
In another instance , men armed with assault rifles attacked a Houston home .
The resident used a handgun to kill one and wound another before the survivors left .
Norma Gonzalez , whose husband was killed at Chilos , said she believes he used his body to shield his 4 - year - old daughter and infant son .
Leaning over her husband in the parking lot , she whispered , “ Everything is going to be OK . ”
He died minutes later .

Chernobyl is largely human - free but still contaminated with radiation
Two decades after the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , radiation is still causing a reduction in the numbers of insects and spiders .
According to researchers working in the exclusion zone surrounding Chernobyl , there is a " strong signal of decline associated with the contamination " .
The team found that bumblebees , butterflies , grasshoppers , dragonflies and spiders were affected .
They report their findings in the journal Biology Letters .
Professor Timothy Mousseau from the University of South Carolina , US , and Dr Anders Moller from the University of Paris - Sud worked together on the project .
The two researchers previously published findings that low - level radiation in the area has a negative impact on bird populations .
" We wanted to expand the range of our coverage to include insects , mammals and plants , " said Professor Mousseau .
" This study is the next in the series . "
Ghost zone Professor Mousseau has been working for almost a decade in the exclusion zone .
This is the contaminated area surrounding the plant that was evacuated after the explosion , that remains effectively free of modern human habitation .
The team counted insects and spider webs in the ' unique ' exclusion zone
For this study they used what Mousseau described as " standard ecological techniques " - plotting " line transects " through selected areas , and counting the numbers of insects and spiders webs they found along that line .
At the same time , the researchers carried hand - held GPS units and dosimeters to monitor radiation levels .
" We took transects through contaminated areas in Chernobyl , contaminated land in Belarus , and in areas free of contamination .
" What we found was the same basic pattern throughout these areas - the numbers of organisms declined with increasing contamination . "
According to Professor Mousseau , this technique of counting organisms is " particularly sensitive " because it can account for the changing pattern of contamination across the zone .
" We can compare relatively clean areas to the more contaminated ones , " he explained .
Thriving or dying ?
But some researchers have challenged the study , claiming that the lack of human activity in the exclusion zone has been beneficial for wildlife .
Dr Sergii Gashchak , a researcher at the Chornobyl Center in Ukraine , dismissed the findings .
He said that he drew " opposite conclusions " from the same data the team collected on birds .
" Wildlife really thrives in Chernobyl area - due to the low level of [ human ] influence , " Dr Gashchak told BBC News .
" All life appeared and developed under the influence of radiation , so mechanisms of resistance and recovery evolved to survive in those conditions , " he continued .
Chernobyl offers a unique opportunity to explore the potential risks of this contamination
Timothy Mousseau
University of South Carolina
" After the accident , radiation impacts exceeded the capabilities of organisms .
But 10 years after the accident , the dose rates dropped by 100 to 1,000 times . "
Professor Mousseau responded that his aim is to use the site to discover the true ecological effects of radiation contamination .
" The verdict is still out concerning the long - term consequences of mutagenic contaminants in the environment , " he said .
" Long - term studies of the Chernobyl ecosystem offer a unique opportunity to explore these potential risks that should not be missed . "

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 20/4/2009 ( 4180 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
If history prevails , the Manitoba Legislature will go up in smoke at 4:20 p.m. today .
That ’s the day and time , every year , round the world , when druggies and human rights activists join to protest the criminalization of marijuana .
Traditionally , in Winnipeg , the protest has taken place on the grounds of the Legislature .
But this year , there may be a new gathering spot .
Signs on the window of La Mota , a new drug paraphernalia shop , say the shop will be open today from 1 to 8 p.m .
The sign suggests there will be 420 specials .
The " 420 " is graphically depicted in clouds of smoke .
Calls to La Mota —
Spanish for speck and slang for marijuana — were not returned today .
Const .
Jacqueline Chaput , Winnipeg police public information officer , said police expect the same type of peaceful protest at the Legislature they faced for the last couple of years .
The crowd management unit , not dressed in riot gear , will be on hand to ensure all stays peaceful , Chaput said , but they will not be enforcing the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act .
" We know what they ’re here for , " Chaput said .
" If there is nothing of significance , nothing that would jeopardize public safety , " officers will merely observe .
Police are not anticipating a gathering at the La Mota shop .
The shop ’s location , just a block away from St. James Collegiate and George Waters Middle School at 1859 Portage , is a cause of concern for St. James - Assiniboia School Division trustees .
They have asked city council to revamp bylaws to keep drug - related businesses away from schools , in the same way bylaws keep adult - only video shops away from schools .
St. James - Assiniboia school board chairman Peter Carney has said the store was open at least once before last week and attracted a crowd of young people .
Carney said the board regularly suspends students for marijuana possession .
" We ’ve had a large number of students , not just from St. James Collegiate , but all the high schools , caught with marijuana .
It ’s getting worse .
The new shop is called La Mota — which Internet references make clear is slang for marijuana — and sports pictures on its facade of scales and a pipe , as well as a large sign saying it will open April 20 .
That day , commonly known as 4/20 , has become a counterculture holiday on which people gather to smoke marijuana publicly .
This is going to be hard to top .
Japanese website Akiba Blog has run a post saying that Dragon Quest IX went on sale last night .

According to Akiba Blog , over two - thousand people lined up at midnight today for DQIX .
Midnight .
Today .
Today is April 1 , and Dragon Quest IX is slated for release this July .
This is according to the website .
Note : people did not actually line up for it last night !
The website merely has faked the launch .
Still , very cruel for those who woke up today and checked Akiba Blog website and thought they 'd missed the game 's launch — especially considering the number of times Dragon Quest IX has been delayed and how many Japanese gamers are impatiently waiting for it .

Still , do n't be surprised if frazzled individuals are running around Akihabara , frantically looking for DQIX after reading this Akiba Blog post .
If you happen to see any , be sure to let them know the game is sold out and new shipments are expected shortly .
This is just one of many April Fools jokes circulating on the Japanese internet .
Website Canned Dogs has a great round - up of today 's pranks .
Stand outs include a Queen 's Blade live action flick , SNK announcing Star Radish and a retro version iDOLM@STER .

The story out of Dallas where Ryan Moats was harrassed by a cop just keeps getting stranger .
It seems the officer , Robert Powell , has left quite a trail of Internet evidence into his thinking about his job .
Yesterday we tracked down a page ( above ) from his now infamous Xanga site where he made comments in 2006 that are at least disturbing and possibly career ending .
See what Powell says about this photo of himself , here .
Powell , who has since taken down his Internet dribbles , let his true feelings out in the 2006 post .
“ The count downs begins : 18 days of work then the real work starts and I can shoot people . ”
The Moats ’ are now saying “ that Dallas police officer Robert Powell pointed his gun at Tamishia Moats during the recent traffic stop in which Powell prevented Ryan Moats from seeing his dying mother - in - law . ”
This probably is n’t the guy you want carrying around a gun but that is just our opinion .
We ’ll leave a final decision to the experts who obviously do n’t monitor their officers Web sites .
A giant amalgam of black holes sits at the centre of the Virgo galaxy cluster Researchers have seen the best evidence yet for a pair of black holes orbiting each other within the same galaxy .
While such " binary systems " have been postulated before , none has ever been conclusively shown to exist .
The new black hole pair is dancing significantly closer than the prior best binary system candidate .
The work , published in the journal Nature , is in line with the theory of the growth of galaxies , each with a black hole at their centre .
The theory has it that as galaxies near one another , their central black holes should orbit each other until merging together .
But evidence for black holes nearing and orbiting has so far been scant .
Dancing cheek - to - cheek
As matter falls into black holes , it emits light of a characteristic colour that in turn gives information about the direction in which the black hole is moving .
In a binary system , two beams should be emitted , each a slightly different colour .
The black holes emit two beams , each a slightly different colour Todd Boroson and Tod Lauer of the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory analysed some 17,500 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , and have now found just such a pair of emissions coming from a distant quasar .
The researchers estimate that the two light sources come from black holes between 20 million and one billion times more massive than our Sun .
The black holes are separated by an estimated distance of less than a third of a light - year - cheek - to - cheek by black hole standards and significantly closer than the postulated binary system spotted by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2003 .
The pair are estimated to dance around one another every 100 years .
Because they are moving with respect to the Earth as well as to each other , observations of their movement over the next few years should prove beyond question that they are indeed the first partnered pair of black holes .
" Previous work has identified potential examples of black holes on their way to merging , but the case presented by Boroson and Lauer is special because the pairing is tighter and the evidence much stronger , " said Jon Miller , an astronomer at the University of Michigan .

During the moments I take to write this blog entry , Millard Fuller , founder of Habitat for Humanity and an international beacon for the poor and the do - gooding prosperous alike , is finding his final resting place at Koinonia Farm in Georgia .
He died earlier this week at 74 .
Millard Fuller impacted my life profoundly — lastingly — as he did countless others .
[ social_buttons ]
Eleven years ago , as a college student , a young American from the Midwest , I traveled to Honduras on a Habitat for Humanity International building opportunity .
It was my first experience outside of my home country .
It shed light on worldly truths I had never before been able to so accurately imagine .
In 2006 , on a personal pilgrimage of sorts , living in a 1973 Volkswagen bus while driving thousands of miles of the American interior , I happened across Fuller ( and his often - times partner , President Jimmy Carter ) at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains , Ga .
I had stopped driving for a few days to visit the historic intentional community of Koinonia Farm .
Only on arriving there had I learned the role that the Christian - based farm played in the life of Fuller .
When I was told that President Carter and Fuller attend Maranatha Baptist nearby , I went to church for the first time in years .
After the church service ended , I got a chance to shake hands with Fuller ( and have a photo taken with the Carters ) , but he was tied up in conversations .
I did n’t get the chance to thank him for his legacy .
As a past visitor to Koinonia Farms , I receive e-newsletters on a regular basis .
This morning , I ’ve learned just how true - to - the - end Fuller is about his commitment to simplicity , efficiency and goodness .
From Koinonia :
We join with the nation as we mourn the loss of Millard Fuller , a great pillar of our time .
The death was sudden and we ’re still in shock .
He will be buried today here at the farm at 11 a.m. , with the memorial service to follow later in the month .
Millard came to Koinonia in the early 1960s at a crucial time in his life and his marriage .
He immediately became good friends with our founder Clarence Jordan .
He often said that he learned most everything from Clarence while sitting across from him , helping to milk the farm ’s cows .
Together with Clarence and our neighbors , Millard started Partnership Housing , which grew up to be Habitat for Humanity International .
In 2005 , after being ousted from Habitat , Millard founded Fuller Center for Housing to continue his calling to provide adequate housing for the world ’s poor .
Millard wanted to be buried in the same manner as was his spiritual mentor and friend Clarence .
So , like our founder Clarence , Millard will be buried on Picnic Hill in a shipping crate with no significant marker for his grave .
I ’ve now missed my chance to ever stand again in front of Millard Fuller and simply say what I wished I could have that Sunday morning in 2006 .
I guess here and now is as good as I ’ll get : “ Thank you , Millard . ”
One of the most fascinating areas of research is biomimetics , where researchers attempt to replicate nature 's creative accomplishments in the lab .
For pure inspiration , look no further than to bacteria .
Bacteria seem to go everywhere and do pretty much everything .
The natural tendency of those of us with a inclination towards geekiness is to think of micro-robots .
There are a number of natural roles that micro-robots could play , such as cleaning plaques from artery walls or defouling pipelines .
One of the problems with micro-robots has been making them small enough .
One millimeter might seem small to us , but not to a bacteria .
One of the primary constraints on shrinking these devices is the method of locomotion , which , because it requires moving parts , tends to be on the bulky side .
This is about to change as some recent results published in Applied Physics Letters show researchers building their very own artificial bacterial flagella .
In the publication , controlled motion and the simple task of separating cell - sized polystyrene beads were both demonstrated .
The bacteria flagellum is an interesting little piece of nature .
Apart from providing endless amusement and artificial controversy , they also self - assemble — put the right proteins and some fuel in a test tube of water and the result is a bunch of little flagella propelling themselves about at random .
Physicists are interested in them for two reasons : they are one of the few mechanisms for transporting micro-robots that might be replicable using inorganic materials , and , given the size of the micro-robot and the viscosity of relevant mediums ( close to water in the human body ) , flagella are very close to an optimal propulsion system .
Researchers from ETH
Zurich have recently published the results from their successful attempts to replicate flagella at the same size scale as natural flagella .
To make a flagellum , they deposited layers of aluminium gallium arsenide , indium gallium arsenide , gallium arsenide , and chromium on top of a gallium arsenide crystal .
They then use an ion beam to mill away most of the layers , leaving a long , thin rectangle of material .
At one end of this , they deposited a small square of chromium - nickel - gold to provide a magnetic head .
The rectangle of material is separated from the gallium arsenide substrate by dissolving the aluminium gallium arsenide .
The remaining strip of material is stressed because of the layering , so it curls up into a helix .
This process is so well - controlled that the researchers can choose any helix they desire simply by changing the materials and thickness of the different layers .
This tiny scroll was then dropped into a swimming pool sitting under a microscope , where the researchers could observe and control it .
The magnetic head of the scroll responds to any magnetic field — changing the field causes the orientation of the scroll to change and induces swimming motions .
As a result , the flagella swims in controlled curves , allowing researchers to direct it to any location with any orientation .
This was demonstrated by swimming the flagella to a polystyrene sphere , after which they were directed to rotate and push the sphere .
The researchers also showed that two spheres could be separated by drilling a flagella between them .
Videos of the swimmers in action can be found here .
This is , of course , a very cool piece of research , but it probably wo n't be used for any sort of remote activity .
Although external fields are used to power and direct the swimmer , we still require sensors to see where it is .
This probably eliminates any chance of putting these deep inside the human body to scrape plaque from artery walls or doing the equivalent inside mechanical systems .
So there is certainly more research required in that direction .
On the other hand , the rotary motion can certainly be used as a power source for micro-robots , and that does n't require being able to sense where the micro - robot is .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have taken another important step toward using ordinary skin cells that are made to behave like embryonic stem cells to find treatments for conditions like Parkinson ’s disease .
An undated image courtesy of the Whitehead Institute shows “ reprogrammed ” human skin cells from Parkinson ’s disease patients .

Researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts removed a stumbling block in using so - called induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , by taking out potentially cancer - causing genes .
Writing in the journal Cell on Thursday , the scientists said they then turned these iPS cells into brain cells involved in Parkinson ’s disease .
The iPS stem cells could be made from a patient ’s own skin cells , reducing the chances that the body ’s immune system might reject the cells as it sometimes does with organ transplants .
Transplanting healthy cells made from iPS cells to replace cells damaged by disease or injury may be possible in the future .
But a more immediate use for these cells may be in lab dishes testing the effects of new drugs , according to Dirk Hockemeyer , one of the Whitehead Institute researchers .
“ For transplantation applications , we are further away , ” Hockemeyer said in a telephone interview .
Scientists have learned that just a handful of genes can reprogram a cell back to a state in which , like an embryonic stem cell , it can generate any type of cell in the body .
But these genes have the potential to cause cancer , and also may interact with unpredictable results with thousands of other genes in the cell , the researchers said .
The Whitehead Institute team used viruses to transfer three genes into the skin cells of Parkinson ’s patients , then removed them after they had done their job .
The result was a batch of cells that looked like embryonic stem cells from Parkinson ’s patients , without the extra genes .
They then used the resulting iPS cells to create dopamine - producing nerve cells .
They are the brain cells that die in people with Parkinson ’s , causing telltale symptoms such as tremors , slow movement and balance problems .
It is the first time scientists have created human iPS cells that have kept their embryonic stem - cell - like properties after the removal of reprogramming genes .
“ Other labs have reprogrammed mouse cells and removed the reprogramming genes , but it was incredibly inefficient , and they could n’t get it to work in human cells , ” Whitehead Institute scientist Rudolf Jaenisch said in a statement .
“ We have done it much more efficiently , in human cells , and made reprogrammed , gene - free cells , ” Jaenisch added .
The DNA of the iPS cells ended up as nearly identical to the DNA of the original skin cells , the researchers said .

Not surprisingly , she said " No " -- and instead of dropping it , he 's continued to pressure her about it , accusing her of being manipulative and having no regard for his needs , and bringing it up again and again .
Dan 's advice : Dump the motherfucker already .
I totally agree with Dan 's advice , as far as it went .
A rape survivor absolutely has the right to say " No " to acting out a rape scene that they think will traumatize them ... and to drop the partner who wo n't take that " No " for an answer .
But I 'd actually go further than that .
I 'd say that anybody has the right to say " No " to any particular form of sex , for any reason whatsoever .
This is n't just about pressuring a lover to do a heavy - duty edge - play scene , a lover for whom that particular scene is an emotional minefield .
Yes , that raises giant red flags for me .
That definitely makes me agree that his ass should be dumped ; that the letter 's author is entitled not only to keep saying " No " to his request , but to kick him to the curb and never look back .
But if someone had written to Savage Love saying , " My lover is pushing me hard to give him oral sex , I 've been willing and happy to try other stuff with him but I really really do n't want to do this , and he 's pressuring me hard about it and is refusing to drop it and is saying I 'm manipulative with no regard for his needs " ... my reaction would be more or less the same .
Not as extreme , and shaded with several Ifs and Buts and waffly equivocations ... but more or less the same .
My red flags would not be waving quite as high , or as frantically .
But they 'd still be waving .
Now .
Here , as promised , are some of those Ifs and Buts and waffly equivocations .
If the things on your " No " list are n't actually going to cause you trauma -- if they 're just things you 're not that crazy about -- then I do think it would be sporting of you to give them the old college try .
To say the least .
When we 're looking at our sexual likes and dislikes , I think it 's important to sort them into what I call broccoli and tofu : the things that make us want to hurl just thinking about them , and the things that simply are n't our favorites .
And if something simply is n't your favorite -- or you 've never even tried it and you just think you wo n't like it -- then I think it 's more than a little selfish to not even consider it .
I do n't think we have a right to expect our partners to give us anything and everything we want in bed ... but I do think we have a right to expect that they care about our sexual pleasure and want to help us get it .
That 's sort of the point .
I also tend to agree with Dan Savage that there are certain basic sex acts -- oral sex , say , and light bondage -- that are ... well , basic .
Things that most people assume will be on the menu in a sexual / romantic relationship .
If you 're going to say " No " to rape fantasies or diaper play , I do n't think you need to say anything else ... but if you 're going to say a permanent , non-negotiable " No " to giving oral sex , I think you need to be aware that you 're stepping outside the common expectations for a relationship , and should perhaps show some extra flexibility in other areas to make up for it .
And if you have an insanely huge laundry list of things on your " No " list , none of which you 're willing to negotiate or even consider , then that 's definitely a problem .
If you 're saying " No " to oral sex , that 's one thing ... but if you 're saying " No " to oral sex , and manual sex , and tying each other up for sex , and dressing up for sex , and sex outside the bedroom , and so on and so on and so on .... that , in my opinion , is seriously obnoxious .
Any or all of this may make you unreasonable .
It may make you inflexible .
It may make you unsporting .
It may make you not exactly the best lover on Loki 's green earth .
It may make you , in short , a jerk .
It may make sex advice writers everywhere advise your partner to dump your sorry ass and move on .
But you still have a right to it .
Ultimately , you get to be the one who decides what your hard " Absolutely not " list is .
And if there 's just a couple / few things on that " No " list ?
If you 're generally good , giving , and game in bed , if you 're generally interesting in pleasing your partner and open to trying things they like , but there 's just a couple / few things that really just gross you out ?
You know you 're not being rational , but they just do ?
It does n't matter what those things are .
It does n't matter if the thing you do n't want to do is a hard - core no- safeword rape scene or a garden variety blowjob .
You still have the right to say " No " ... and to have that " No " ultimately accepted .
And it does n't make you unsporting , or unreasonable , or selfish .
Yes , we have a right to expect our partners to take our desires seriously .
Yes , we have a right to assume that our partners want to give us pleasure and are willing to be flexible to make that happen .
And if the sex is really not working -- whether it's because our partner is an unreasonable , selfish jerk or the two of us just are n't sexually compatible -- we have the right to end the relationship .
But we do n't have the right to get the exact sex we want , from the person we want it from .
So I ask again :
When do you have the right to absolutely refuse a certain kind of sex to your partner ?
Always .
You always have that right .
Climate change protesters bundle up .

Snow brightens climate protests in D.C .
Most people described it using just one word : Ironic .
On the day that Washington woke up from its biggest snowstorm in three years , Capitol Hill was chock full of events and protests on the subject of ... climate change .
The frigid temperatures and snow accumulation made for difficult messaging for thousands of activists marching outside to bring attention to climate change and other environmental causes .

Sangeeta Giri says she has searched everywhere for her child The streets of the Badli Industrial Area in north Delhi are teeming with children .
This is the kind of place where migrant families settle , after coming to Delhi to look for work .
In a small courtyard on a side street Sangeeta Giri is washing her family 's clothes .
Her husband Harishankar , a driver , is sitting nearby .
It looks like a normal domestic scene , but there 's something wrong .
Their daughter Sunita went missing last June , two weeks after they arrived in the city .
Tears
They registered Sunita 's disappearance with the police on the day she went missing .
She 's recorded as being 3ft 3in ( 1 m ) tall , wearing a pink top and shirt , with bare feet .
She 's five years old .
Children from poorer families are more likely to disappear Harishankar shows me the photo they have given to the police .
But it 's not a picture of Sunita - they do n't have one - it 's her sister at the same age .
The only image of Sunita is the one they carry in their heads .
In the tiny room where the family live Sangeeta rummages for all they have left ... a few of her daughter 's clothes .
Tears run down Sangeeta 's face .
" We 've looked everywhere for her , " she sobs .
" At bus stops , orphanages , hospitals .
We 've gone crazy trying to find her .
" We 've even paid money to the police .
We just do n't know what to do . "
At the local police station , the details of Sunita 's case are hand - written in a book .
" Pending investigation , " it says .
And Sunita is one among too many .
Delhi's children are disappearing every day .
The numbers are shocking .
According to the official website of the Delhi police , nearly 6,000 children have been reported missing in the city in the last two years .
And only about one in 10 have been found .
Shocking case
The sad fact is that most of the missing are from Delhi 's poorer communities .
Bijanti Kaur cannot be consoled by the fact she has other children
That means their parents have no access to power or influence .
And the authorities often treat their complaints with indifference .
It was only a shocking case - the abduction and killing of at least 19 children here two years ago - that caused a national outcry .
Last month two men were sentenced to death for rape and murder , and the Delhi police now say they 'll do a better job in tracking the missing .
" We take each and every complaint very seriously , " says Rajan Bhagat , the police spokesman .
" Delhi is a big city , and we have lots to do .
But the commissioner of police has promised to start a new helpline for missing children . "
For many families it 's probably too late .
Every neighbourhood , it seems , has a tragic tale to tell .
On a bustling street in the district of Sultanpuri , Bijanti Kaur last saw her two - year - old daughter Neha seven years ago .
Her husband has told her to forget about it - she has other children .
But Bijanti says she 'll never stop looking .
" If somebody tells me that they 've seen a girl who looks just like me at a school - I 'll go there and see , " she says .
" People tell me your daughter blew away with the wind - vanished - somebody took her by magic .
But nobody can tell me where she is . "
Prostitution Vast numbers of India 's rural poor are moving into big cities like Delhi - it 's a transient vulnerable population .
Many children are snatched from the streets
The police say many missing children have eloped - a suggestion rubbished by campaigners for children 's welfare .
" The child who is missing is being abused in one way or the other , " says Meenakshi Kohli , from the group Child Rights and You .
" It could be for organ theft ; if it 's a girl child , it 's probably prostitution ; trafficking ; begging ; there are local mafia gangs who abduct children to make money out of them . "
" Do we really have to wait for the situation to get so out of hand before we wake up ? "
At Sunita 's house they 're making tea for visitors .
Here they are still waiting .
So are thousands of others across this city .
If you 're poor , they say , no - one cares .

If it had happened elsewhere , it might have been dismissed as a teenage prank .
A couple of 15 - year - olds last year hung a Tibetan banner on the wall of their classroom next to portraits of Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping .
They drew Xs over the faces of the former Chinese leaders and scrawled “ Long Live the Dalai Lama ” on the wall .
But in China , the incident was taken dead seriously .
Three boys who attend a Tibetan school in Sichuan province were arrested , and one of them , who confessed to being the ringleader , was held and interrogated for a month .
This year , the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama ’s exile to India , the boy is under virtual house arrest -- by his own parents .
“ They want to make sure he does n’t do anything like that again .
They do n’t want him to get arrested again or hurt , ” said a relative , who asked not to be quoted by name .
As the traditional season for protests against Chinese rule begins , many of China ’s more than five million Tibetans are in a similar quandary .
As sure as the melting of the snow on the Tibetan plateau , protests erupt about this time of year as Tibetans mark the anniversary of a failed uprising that began March 10 , 1959 , and led to their spiritual leader ’s exile .
But with the special anniversary this year , the Chinese have taken extraordinary security measures , hoping to prevent a recurrence of last year ’s protests , the most violent in decades .
Exact numbers are difficult to come by in China , but residents of the Tibetan areas say that tens of thousands of paramilitary troops have been deployed .
Telephones are tapped ; cellphones and Internet connections disrupted .
Foreigners are barred from entering not only the Tibetan autonomous region , but heavily Tibetan areas in Qinghai , Sichuan and Gansu provinces .
The mountain roads leading into Tibetan villages are clogged with armored personnel carriers and buses filled with riot police .
The security forces make their presence felt by cruising up and down main streets , or conducting training in as public a way as possible .
“ They made a picture of a man and are using itfor target practice .
They do it to scare us , ” said Tashi , a 20 - year - old student from Ganzi ( known to Tibetans as Kardze ) , in Sichuan province .
Like many Tibetans , Tashi refuses to be identified by anything other than a first name for fear of retaliation for speaking out .
In Lhasa , the Tibetan capital , security cameras are ubiquitous .
“ You feel like you ’re being watched all the time .
It feels very uncomfortable , ” said Tsering , a 38 - year - old Tibetan construction worker from Lhasa , who left late last year .
Tibetans say they would like to do something to commemorate the victims of last year ’s violence , who they say number more than 200 .
( The Chinese counter that 21 died and that most were Chinese . )
“ We would like to do a candlelight demonstration for the people who died , but we are afraid .
So we will keep silent , ” said Tashi .
But to demonstrate or not has become a subject of great debate among young Tibetans .
“ Our teachers have told us not to be stupid and talk about freedom , ” said a 19 - year - old student from Tongren , a monastery town also known as Repkong , in Qinghai province , that has been a hotbed of ethnic unrest .
“ Everybody is afraid .
There are armed police all over our town , ” he said .
The problem for Tibetans is that the Chinese treat any expression of Tibetan identity -- even waving a flag or posting a portrait of the Dalai Lama -- as criminal activity .
Human Rights Watch on Monday issued a detailed report saying that China had arrested thousands of Tibetans on the vaguest of charges , failing to disclose what crimes had been committed or where people were being held .
And today , the Dalai Lama was expected to launch his own harsh criticism of China .
According to an advance copy of his 50th anniversary speech released to wire services by his aides , the spiritual leader says that China has launched a “ brutal crackdown ” in Tibet in the last year and that Tibetan culture and identity are “ nearing extinction . ”
So far only a few Tibetans have dared defy the stifling security that has blanketed the Tibetan areas from Lhasa to Qinghai , Sichuan and Gansu provinces .
Early Monday , a police car and a fire engine were bombed with homemade explosives after a dispute at a lumberyard in the Tibetan enclave of Golog , in Qinghai province .
No injuries were reported .
Last month , a 24 - year - old Tibetan monk in Sichuan set himself on fire to protest Chinese rule .
But most protests have been silent , passive affairs -- for example , many Tibetans refused to celebrate during their own New Year ’s holiday in commemoration of those killed or imprisoned in last year ’s uprising .
Even the ethnic Chinese are cowed by the heavy hand of security , which has all but killed off the tourist trade in places like Lhasa , the Himalayan city so beloved by backpackers and seekers of spiritual solace .
“ It is very intense .
Our telephones and cellphones are under surveillance , ” said the Chinese manager of a small inn , which , like most others in the city , had no customers .
“ Paramilitary are everywhere , at all the major intersections and the little streets too . ”
The Chinese government has defended the measures as justified in light of last year ’s riots , in which hundreds of Chinese - owned businesses in Lhasa were torched .
“ Is it not crucial for the central government to take action to maintain social stability in Tibet , to protect the innocent from harm ? ” said an English - language commentary by the state - run New China News Agency .
“ Any other government in the world would be on alert too , had they been in China ’s shoes . ”
Speaking Monday in Beijing on the sidelines of the National People ’s Congress , the annual legislative gathering , Fu Hongyu , a top official of the Ministry of Public Security , acknowledged the heightened security .
“ We have made due deployment and tightened controls at border ports and key areas and passages along the border in Tibet , ” said Fu .
Champa Phuntsok , the Chinese - installed chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region , appears confident that this year , Tibetans will behave .
“ Riots like those last March wo n’t happen again , ” he predicted at the People ’s Congress .

BUDAPEST , Hungary - Hungarian builders who drank their way to the bottom of a huge barrel of rum while renovating a house got a nasty surprise when a pickled corpse tumbled out of the empty barrel , a police magazine Web site reported .
According to online magazine www.zsaru.hu, workers in Szeged in the south of Hungary tried to move the barrel after they had drained it , only to find it was surprisingly heavy and were shocked when the body of a naked man fell out .
The Web site said that the body of the man had been shipped back from Jamaica 20 years ago by his wife in the barrel of rum in order to avoid the cost and paperwork of an official return .
According to the Web site , workers said the rum in the 300 - liter barrel had a “ special taste ” so they even decanted a few bottles of the liquor to take home .
The wife has since died and the man was buried in a proper grave .
Looks like AT&T 's taking some aggressive steps to manage network traffic now that it 's offering subsidized netbooks -- the carrier updated its data plan terms of service last night to specifically single out and prohibit " downloading movies using P2P file sharing services , customer initiated redirection of television or other video or audio signals via any technology from a fixed location to a mobile device , web broadcasting , and ... any applications that tether the device ... to Personal Computers or other equipment . "
That 's an impressively strict set of rules that seemingly bans a number of apps AT&T customers are already using without complaint -- everything from SlingPlayer to Qik to Skype to Jaikuspot -- so we 'll see if the company is really so tone - deaf as to try and retroactively prohibit their use , or if it'll just ignore what it can't possibly enforce .
We 've pinged AT&T for comment , we 'll let you know what they say .
P.S. -
It 's not just AT&T struggling to keep up with how people actually use its network -- Deutsche Telekom today threatened to cut off German T - Mobile customers who dare to use Skype .
Nice .
Can someone give all these guys some new ideas , please ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Real estate values around the nation have collapsed , and sales of foreclosed and " underwater " homes now dominate many housing markets , according to a report released Tuesday .
The report , from Zillow.com , a real estate Web site , revealed that with foreclosures soaring , nearly 20 % of the nation 's home sales in 2008 were of bank - repossessed properties .
Another 11 % were short sales , in which homeowners owed more in mortgage debt than their homes were worth .
Madera , Calif. , had the highest percentage of these distressed sales : 54.6 % of all transactions there were foreclosed homes , and another 3.4 % were short sales .
In Merced , Calif. , 53.4 % of sales were foreclosures and 4.8 % were short sales .
In nearby Stockton , 51.1 % were foreclosures and 5.4 % were short sales .
" As more markets turn down and markets that were already down go deeper , the pace at which value is being erased from the U.S. housing stock is rapidly increasing , " said Stan Humphries , Zillow 's vice president in charge of data and analytics .
" More value [ was ] wiped out in the fourth quarter of 2008 than was eliminated in all of 2007 , " Humphries said .
About $ 3.3 trillion in home equity was erased in 2008 , with $ 1.4 trillion of that wipeout coming in the fourth quarter alone , according to Humphries .
More than $ 6 trillion in value has been lost since the market peaked in 2005 .
Those equity losses have put many homeowners underwater , where they 're extremely vulnerable to foreclosure .
These owners can't tap home equity for the cash they need to pay bills when they run into rough financial patches , and they often find it impossible to refinance - lenders will not loan more than the property is worth .
In the United States , 17.6 % of all homes are now underwater , according to Zillow , as are 41.2 % of all mortgages for homes bought in the past five years .
The worst - hit cities are in the once - booming Sun Belt .
In Las Vegas , 61.4 % of all homes are underwater .
Because so many homes are worth less than their mortgage balances , an increasing number have to be sold short .
But short sale transactions can take a long time to complete , because lenders have been having trouble keeping up with the flood of requests .
" The speed of short sales is a function of the resources being allocated to them by lenders , and those resources are being stretched to the limit , " Humphries said .
That means lenders may not act on approving short sales for months .
The deals cannot go forward without their approval , because the banks must agree to forgive the difference between what they 're owed and what the sale brings in .
As the time it takes to arrange short sales lengthens , they become harder to complete .
Time and money wasted
One example of how price declines can doom a short sale occurred recently in Phoenix .
Curtis Johnson , a real estate broker there , worked with a health care worker whose hours were being cut and who could no longer afford her mortgage .
She fell behind and decided to sell .
Johnson was able to find a buyer willing to pay $ 183,000 , and got an approval form the lender .
The owner confidently moved out , got a new place and started a new life .
But the lender folded and the mortgage went to a new servicer , who took six weeks to approve the deal .
" Unfortunately , the buyers who were approved were no longer interested because the real estate market had dropped significantly , " Johnson said .
" They wrote a new offer , considerably lower then the first , and it was time to start over . "
Two more offers eventually fell through before a new buyer was found and the owner 's bank approved the price , this time at $ 163,000 .
On the day of that closing , however , the parties discovered that the buyer 's lender had run out of funds and dropped out of the deal .
The home went to foreclosure auction before another sale could be arranged .
The house is now on the market for $ 139,900 .
" [ The house is ] listed for less than what would have been received had the bank been willing to work with us , and still has not yet sold , " Johnson said .
Distressed sales like that depress the market for all homeowners .
Regular sellers in cities dominated by foreclosures have to adjust their prices downward to compete .
The percentage of homes sold for less than what their owners originally paid has leaped up in the past couple of years .
In the United States as a whole , 34.6 % of the sales made in 2008 were done at a loss .
In Merced , 71.6 % of all sales last year were for less than the seller paid .
Stockton , Modesto and Las Vegas all had in excess of 68 % of all homes being sold at a loss .
Foreclosures beget more foreclosures by adding inventory to the market , which depresses prices , which increases foreclosures , according to Humphries .
" The vicious cycle continues , " he said .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
British military investigators interviewed a woman who claimed to have met a man from another planet while she was walking her dog , newly released Ministry of Defence files have revealed .
The woman said she had been approached by a man with a " Scandinavian - type accent " dressed in a flying suit - style outfit while out walking on a sports field near Norwich , eastern England , in 1989 .
She claimed to have been " completely terrified " during the 10 - minute encounter .
Running home , she said she had then seen a large glowing object rising vertically from behind some nearby trees .
The woman called a local military base to report the encounter the following day .
A cover note on the file of the incident describes it as " one of our more unusual UFO reports . "
The incident is just one of around 1,200 sightings recorded by investigators between 1987 and 1993 , according to the files released by the National Archives on Sunday .
On another occasion , military officials took the unusual step of briefing ministers about an unidentified flying object photographed in the sky over Scotland alongside an RAF fighter jet .
Witnesses claimed to have seen the large diamond - shaped object hanging in the air for about 10 minutes before it ascended vertically at high speed .
Fearing intense media interest , investigators also commissioned detailed drawings of the object .
The files also reveal that the Ministry of Defence abandoned plans to build a computer database of sightings out of fears of a public relations disaster should details of its existence ever be revealed .
" I personally doubt that the the MoD would lose much if we filed UFO reports in ' WPD ' ( the waste paper basket ) , " one unnamed official wrote of the project .
Britain tonight moved to deport nine men arrested earlier this month following one of the country 's biggest anti-terror operations since the July 7 attacks in 2005 .
The men have not been charged with any offences nearly two weeks after being arrested in raids across Greater Manchester , Liverpool and Lancashire .
Two other men remain in custody .
The nine men , aged between 22 and 38 , were tonight released by Greater Manchester police into the custody of the UK Borders Agency ( UKBA ) in preparation for deportation to Pakistan .
A Home Office spokesman said : " We are seeking to remove these individuals on grounds of national security .
The government 's highest priority is to protect public safety .
Where a foreign national poses a threat to this country we will seek to exclude or to deport , where this is appropriate . "
The arrests were mired in controversy as the operation had to be rushed forward following an embarrassing security leak by Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick , the then head of Scotland Yard 's specialist operations wing .
Quick was photographed clutching sensitive documents as he arrived in Downing Street .
Clearly visible on top of a large bundle of papers under his arm was a white document marked " secret " that carried an outline for briefing on a current counter - terrorism operation .
Realising the existence of the ­photos of the ­document – which included the names of several senior officers , sensitive locations and details about the nature of the overseas threat – a " D notice " was imposed by the government to restrict the media from revealing the contents of the picture .
Quick resigned days after the arrests and the security blunder .
Counterterrorism officials at the time of the arrests said they believed an alleged al - Qaida terror plot against the UK , designed to cause mass casualties , was to have been carried out within days .
Twelve men were arrested .
Eleven of them were Pakistani nationals , 10 of whom were on student visas .
A twelfth man was transferred to immigration officials earlier this month .
A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman ( GMP ) tonight said that searches are continuing at a property in Galsworthy Avenue , Cheetham Hill , Manchester .
The GMP spokeswoman said : " Protecting the public is the main focus of the police .
These arrests were carried out after a number of UK agencies gathered information that indicated a potential risk to public safety .
" Officers are continuing to review a large amount of information gathered as part of this investigation .
" Investigations of this nature are extremely complex .
We remain grateful to the support and cooperation of the communities affected . "
Officials have not released details about the reported terror plot but the prime minister , Gordon Brown , called it " very big . "
The 12 men were taken at seven locations across north - west England , and at least another eight addresses in the region were searched .
Scores of students witnessed one arrest , carried out at Liverpool John Moores University .
The arrests were carried out in daylight because of the security leak , in direct ­contravention of the usual practice of arresting people while they sleep .
Moves to deport the nine men could lead to friction between Britain and Pakistan .
Earlier this month the head of Pakistan 's interior ministry , Rehman Malik , said Britain should charge and prosecute the suspects if it has enough evidence .

How lizard spit aids diabetes cure Text Size : | A year ago , when 58 - year - old retiree B S Wig , saw the scales tip at 149 kg , he was dismayed .
He was diabetic and also increasingly obese .
His blood sugar hit a dismal 350 mg / dl after meals .
The normal should be under 140 mg / dl .
" I had become weak and refused to socialise .
My life had gone haywire , " says Wig .
Till he was put on to a new drug , which not only reduced his weight to a healthy 118 kg , but his sugar levels to normal .
" I can now be dated , " he says happily .
Wig is lucky .
Most diabetics have difficult lives , with an unending cycle of ill health , weakness and obesity as the pancreas produce little or no insulin , the hormone that converts glucose to energy .
Plus , diabetic drugs usually make the patient obese , which adds to the risk of high BP , heart problems and strokes .
So it 's essential to have drugs which control sugar levels and reduce weight .
And that 's what a new injectable drug , Byetta , does , say experts .
It 's made from the saliva of the Gila monster , a venomous lizard found in Southwest America .
It 's the first in a new range of anti-diabetic medicines and is FDA - approved .
However , it can be used only on Type 2 diabetics .
It came to India exactly a year back and now , experts can quantify its success .
By 2009 , an upgraded version may be available .
Unlike Type 1 diabetes where there 's no insulin secretion , in Type 2 , insulin production from the beta cells of the pancreas is n't sufficient .
And for Byetta to work , viable beta cells are needed , says Dr Ambrish Mithal , senior endocrinologist , Apollo Hospital , Delhi .
It works in three ways :
It signals the pancreas to make the right amount of insulin after a meal ; stops the liver from making too much glucose when the body does not need it , reduces appetite and the amount of food eaten and slows the rate at which glucose leaves the stomach .
Type 2 diabetics form 90 % of the estimated 40 million diabetic cases in India .
Almost 80 % of them are obese , says Mithal .
Adds Dr Pradeep Talwalkar , professor , diabetology , Raheja Hospital , Mumbai .
" It suppresses rise in sugar levels by suppressing glucogon , a hormone which has the opposite effect of insulin . "
" Byetta " says Mithal , " can produce nausea and vomiting in some patients .
It is a niche drug , not for all diabetics , but is a good choice for those who need to lose weight with high post - meal blood sugar rises that remain uncontrolled even on oral medicines . "
" Byetta also carries a lower risk than insulin of causing hypoglycemia , a dangerous condition where the patient can lose consciousness and slip into coma as insulin drops to very low levels , " says Talwalkar .
Wig 's case is an ideal example .
" I was not judicious about my medicines and kept oscillating between oral medicines and insulin .
Meanwhile , my weight and sugar levels went for a toss till I started taking Byetta , " he says .
It 's important for obese diabetics to lose weight , says Chennai - based Dr A Ramachandran , president , India Diabetics Research Foundation , as obesity makes them resistant to diabetic treatment .
" It is , in fact , an analog for hormones which produce insulin called incretin . "
A weight reduction of 5 - 6 kg a year is good , says Mithal .
Byetta is normally given with oral medicines .
But it 's expensive ��� around Rs 7,500 monthly .
Rimi Dasgupta , a 41 - year - old diabetic , who lost 12 kg and with sugar levels which came down to 140 mg / dl from 390 mg / dl , says , " It 's easy to inject , but I do n't know how long I can take it as it's expensive .
I hope to continue it for a year . "
Byetta comes in a prefilled injection pen which uses a small needle .
This pen contains pre-measured doses , so the patient does n't have to adjust the dose .
It 's injected twice daily before morning and evening meals .
Generally , the patient is started off on a dose of 5 micrograms ( mcg ) twice a day for at least 30 days , but this could be increased to 10 mcg based on individual results .
In clinical trials , it was found that on an average , patients lost five pounds in 30 weeks .
However , Byetta cannot be used simply for weight reduction .
Though there are other new medicines which stimulate the pancreas to make insulin without producing hypoglycemia such as Januvia and Glavus , says Ramachandran , these do n't make a patient lose weight .
Byetta could just be that shot that makes a difference .

Cutting costs is crucial for computer manufacturers and the buying public , which explains the flourishing popularity of Netbooks -- mini-sized and budget - priced laptop computers .
But how can manufacturers dice the price even further ?
Hewlett - Packard might have the answer : use Google 's Android OS instead of Microsoft 's Windows .
The combination is perfect for three reasons .
Money
Microsoft slaps hefty licensing fees on the use of its Windows OS , whereas Google charges no such fee for Android .
The Linux - based Android could save HP , and other Netbook manufacturers , loads of money , and thereby allow for price cuts .
Consider HP 's Mini 1000 MIE ( Mobile Internet Experience ) , the Linux - based version of its popular Mini 1000 series .
The Mini 1000 MIE was priced at $ 379 , compared to Windows - based iterations of the same computer that fetched $ 549 .
Exposure
It might take a while for those used to the Windows experience to grow accustomed to Android , and many would be hesitant to make the switch .
However , Google has become a trusted name in the industry .
Those tired of dropping top dollar for Windows may find themselves gravitating to the Android alternative , and as this trend progress , open - source Android would evolve into a richer , more popular experience , giving Google a considerable advantage in a Microsoft - congested OS battleground .
That kind of exposure could bolster Google into a powerful position in the computer biz .
Simplicity
Netbooks are primarily aimed at the casual computing crowd , so what better OS than one originally intended for a device that fits in the palm of your hand ?
Windows can be a complicated , fickle beast -- especially the much - hated Vista -- that 's packed with memory - hogging features that are useless to those who just want to surf the Web and write e-mail .
Android on a Netbook can streamline the computing process with a simple UI and online - based applications , such as Google Docs .
Google was practically born to serve straightforward means .
HP is currently " studying " the Android OS and refuse to speculate on future products that may or may not happen .
But the stars are aligned , and it looks like HP could hit one out of the park -- and crush its competition -- if these speculations became reality .

Conclusion :
They 're tiny women in little fur coats .
GORILLAS are gentle giants , chimpanzees aggressive killers and bonobos sex-crazed vegetarians .
That , at least , is the PR which has been created around the three species of ape most closely related to man .
They are simple stories — and simple stories sell books , TV programmes and even , whisper it softly , newspaper articles .
In nature , of course , things are a little more complicated .
Chimpanzees are undoubtedly successful hunters , but the “ wars ” seen between neighbouring bands seem to have been brought on by human encroachment on their habitat rather than original sin .
Bonobos , too , have been shown in the past year to hunt animals for food , and are losing their promiscuous aura as more data come in .
Only gorillas have retained their reputations intact .
Until now .
Part of the reason for the stories was that apes are hard to watch in the wild , and few people are prepared to put in the time needed to do so .
Early observations were assumed to be representative , but were based on small samples .
One way to extend those observations is to study animals in zoos .
And that is what Steve Ross , a primatologist at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago , has done .
He has looked , in particular , at the interactions between zoo - held apes and local birds and small mammals .
Some of his findings cast further doubt on the stereotypes .
Mr Ross and his colleagues , who have just published their results in the American Journal of Primatology , asked 71 zoos around the United States about interactions between the local wildlife and any bonobos , chimpanzees , gorillas or orangutans in their collections .
The chimps did live up to their reputations .
Four - fifths of the zoos that had them reported that they had killed at least one local animal during the past five years .
Two - fifths of zoos with orangutans had likewise seen those animals hunt successfully over that period — which might surprise the layman , but such hunting has been seen in the wild .
The most aggressive apes of all were the bonobos .
In every zoo that kept them , these allegedly vegetarian creatures had killed visiting wildlife in the past five years .
But it was the gorillas that surprised the researchers most .
In the wild , they seem to eat only plants and insects .
Yet 30 % of the zoos in the survey reported that their gorillas had killed some local wildlife , and in at least one case had eaten a bird .
This seemingly uncharacteristic aggression may be the result of captivity .
Aberrant behaviour , often brought on by boredom , is not unusual in zoo animals .
In fact , bonobo promiscuity seems to be an example of this .
Wild bonobos ( those few that have been watched carefully , at any rate ) do not seem overly promiscuous .
It is also possible , though , that gorillas hunt in the wild , but that no zoologist has yet observed them do so .
If that is the case , then another carefully constructed zoological reputation will bite the dust .
Back in 2009 , in the wake of Shepard Fairey 's debacle with the AP over the rights to the image he used as reference / inspiration for his wildly popular Obama poster , it made me want to share a list of Public Domain Licensed images , in this case , astronomy .
Fairey 's situation should hit home with all pixel junkies out there and remind us that we have to pay close attention to the licenses associated with the images we use in our design work .
I 've compiled a list of beautiful , inspiring astronomy images that all have a Public Domain License .
When it comes to the small specific details , high - resolution images are always in demand .
Every industry needs the high - resolution images to discover and take the in - depth analysis of the emerging trends .
These high - resolution images offer us to draw a comparison , do analysis on minute details and do much more with the different minute details .
These high - resolution images are colorful , offer a high degree of contrast between the similar colors and each small detail can be differentiated easily and clearly .
The textures extracted from these images can be used in different applications of photography .
These pictures hold a huge value in the world of astronomy as they can be used to predict the future of earth and other planets in terms of geographical and ecosystem variations .
They can also be used to present the present situation of the ecosystem and environment .
All of these images have been shot with adequate light , perfect placement , quality resolution and at the most appropriate time of the day .
So , you can consider these images as the masterpiece in all aspects .
Astronomy intrigues me .
I 'm a regular APOD surfer .
I love reading about space , and the images of the universe , I find inspiring .
Here 's a list of “ Public Domain ” astronomy images that I put together , all of which I found on Wikimedia .
If you are n't familiar with Wikimedia , it does n't have a stellar ( pun intended ) selection , but it 's a very good source of Public Domain and GNU licensed images .
So here we go , let 's start off the list with none other than our very own blue marble .
Earth
Full resolution : 3,000 × 3,075 pixels
This image is surreal to me .
Since I 've obviously not been to space , it 's hard to imagine that this is really what our planet looks like !
I love how clear and pristine the visible continents are .
This is one of the most popular images of the outlook view of earth and we will have pretty much more to discover on the other side of the globe .
Full resolution : 2,048 × 2,048 pixels
Full resolution : 2,048 × 2,048 pixels
Full resolution : 3,000 × 3,002 pixels
Full resolution : 1,696 × 2,074 pixels
You never realize how big ( or small ) something is until you see it compared to another thing .
In this high - res picture of Earth and the moon , it 's clear that Earth is huge in comparison .
( Earth weighs 81 times more than the moon , to be exact . )
.
Full resolution : 2,458 × 2,458 pixels
Full resolution : 2,400 × 2,400 pixels
The Moon
Full resolution : 1,280 × 978 pixels
Full resolution : 2,560 × 1,920 pixels
Full resolution : 1,986 × 1,986 pixels
I love how many textures are visible in the picture of the moon .
I 've always pictured the moon to just be a cratered , white , round thing – but this awesome image shows the many textures , colors , and details of the moon .
This image brings in a lot of curiosity to the astronomy professionals and common people because this image has got so much to reveal to the audience .
Mars
Full resolution : 2,000 × 2,000 pixels
Full resolution : 1,552 × 1,552 pixels
Like in the picture above , I 've always pictured Mars to have a true red color .
In the image below , Mars is n't red !
In this picture , there are channels on Mars that run up to 3000 km long and 8 km deep .
Mars ' moon Phobos
Full resolution : 3,374 × 3,300 pixels
I love this distinct shape of Phobos .
It 's large craters and not - so - round overall shape makes it really stand out .
This is a really awesome picture .
The border lines of the globe are clearly visible and every detail on the lateral side of the globe is also clearly defined .
Saturn
With all three of these images of Saturn , I have to say , do n't even look real to me .
That 's what is so mesmerizing about these gorgeous pictures of Saturn .
Some images are so beautiful and captured precisely that they do not even look to be the real ones .
Full resolution : 2,766 × 1,364 pixels
Full resolution : 4,000 × 2,527 pixels
Full resolution : 8,888 × 4,544 pixels
Saturn 's moon Rhea
Full resolution : 4,920 × 4,820 pixels
Venus
Full resolution : 4,096 × 4,096 pixels
I absolutely love the coloring of Venus .
The dark amber spots and different textures really stand out in this high - res photo .
Jupiter
Full resolution : 2,260 × 3,207 pixels
I think this may be one of my favorite pictures in this post .
The many colors of Jupiter in this picture almost look they have a watercolor - like feel to them .
Galaxies
Similar to what I said about the images in this post about Saturn , these pictures of galaxies are so gorgeous , they hardly seem real .
I love looking through each one of these high - resolution galaxy images .
Full resolution : 6,200 × 6,200 pixels
Full resolution : 1,730 × 1,428 pixels
Full resolution : 5,302 × 3,805 pixels

Full resolution : 3,915 × 3,885 pixels
Full resolution : 11,472 × 6,429 pixels
Full resolution : 8,952 × 6,213 pixels
Nebulae
Full resolution : 3,601 × 4,004 pixels
Full resolution : 4,806 × 3,364 pixels
All of the colors in this picture of the Orion Nebula are breathtaking .
This photo was taken in 1976 by the Hubble Space Telescope – how cool is that ?!
Full resolution : 3,182 × 1,282 pixels
Full resolution : 18,000 × 18,000 pixels
These astronomy images can prove to be a useful resource for all the aspiring astronomy students .
These images may seem to blur when magnified but they can offer a huge value when magnified with any telescopic device .
I hope you 've enjoyed browsing through each one of these out - of - this - world public domain astronomy images .
This is a post I could scroll through every day – feel free to do the same !
March 9 , 2010 Update :
This post is over a year old and extremely out of date !
If you want the latest information about syncing your data between desktop and mobile Firefox , check out this post on the official Weave site instead .
The latest version of Weave now syncs your open tabs — and it can sync them between Firefox on the desktop and Fennec on a pocket - sized gadget .
“ Syncing tabs ” , by the way , does n’t mean that we force all your browser instances to have the same set of tabs open .
That ’s not what anybody wants !
Instead , it means that every browser has the ability to access the tabs that are open on other synced browsers , and to locally open copies of those tabs .
Here ’s how it looks on Fennec .
Keep in mind that this UI is a work in progress , and I ’m well aware that it needs work , polish , and testing .
But I ’d like to let you see how it ’s coming along and get your feedback on it .
On the left sidebar of Fennec , where your tabs appear , is a new Weave button .
( This assumes that everyone recognizes “ Rectangular Celtic knot ” to mean “ see my tabs from other computers ” .
Not a good assumption , so consider this a placeholder . )
Clicking the button slides the screen further to the left for a full - screen view of tabs from other computers .
If you have more than two browsers being synced , each remote browser will have its own column here .
Each column is identified with the client name .
Eventually we ’d like to display thumbnails of the tabs , but since we ’re not syncing thumbnail data yet , we make do for now with titles and favicons .
A click on one of the remote tabs opens a local copy of it , which adds it to the tab bar , as you can see here .
Comments ?
( Addendum : Here ’s Madhava ’s proposal for how the tab sync UI ought to work when it ’s finished . )
( Addendum 2 : Here ’s the new and greatly improved version of the UI shown above . )

When Good Architecture Goes Bad
Mark Dalgarno , mark @ software - acumen.com
Software Acumen , www.software-acumen.com
Every developer eventually encounters it at some stage in his or her career � the code that no one understands and that no one wants to touch in case it breaks .
Sound familiar ?
But how did the software get that bad ?
Presumably no one set out to make it like that ?
The answer is that the software is suffering from Software Erosion � the constant decay of the internal structure of a software system that occurs in all phases of software development and maintenance
At the architectural level , Software Erosion is seen in the divergence of the software architecture as - implemented from the software architecture as - intended .
Note that when talking about the architecture as - intended I�m not speaking here about the initial planned architecture of the software system .
Software architectures should evolve over time � this is to be expected as new requirements emerge � so the intended architecture is what your current conception of the architecture is .
With software erosion what we�re talking about are unintended modifications or temporary violations of the software architecture .
The problem with software erosion is that its effects accumulate over time to result in a significant decrease in the ability of a system to meet its stakeholder requirements .
Unless you take steps to actively pinpoint and stop software erosion it will gradually creep up on you and make changing the software further significantly harder and less predictable .
In the worst case it could lead to the cancellation of the project or , for particularly significant projects , the closure of the business .
Types of Software Erosion
To begin to tackle software erosion you need an understanding of how it typically shows itself .
Common types of software erosion include :
Architectural Rule violations e.g. where strict layering between subsystems is bypassed .
e.g. where strict layering between subsystems is bypassed .
Cyclic dependencies � for example A calls B calls C calls D calls A .
This type of dependency can be valid but when it�s unintended can lead to very complex , opaque code that is hard to understand and hard to test in isolation .
� for example calls calls calls calls .
This type of dependency can be valid but when it�s unintended can lead to very complex , opaque code that is hard to understand and hard to test in isolation .
Dead code � code that once supported part of the software , is now no longer used , but is still cluttering the code base .
� code that once supported part of the software , is now no longer used , but is still cluttering the code base .
Code clones � identical or near - identical code fragments scattered across the system .
A bug fix or change in one clone instance is likely to have to be propagated to the other clone instances .
� identical or near - identical code fragments scattered across the system .
A bug fix or change in one clone instance is likely to have to be propagated to the other clone instances .
Metric outliers e.g. very deep class hierarchies , huge packages , very complex code etc .
A well - known example of software erosion was highlighted in a reverse - engineering experiment on two separate versions of ANT some years ago .
ANT V1.4.1 ( 11 October 2001 ) and ANT V1.6.1 ( 12 February 2004 ) were reverse - engineered and the results were compared .
At the time ANT was built in three layers , from the top - down these were taskdefs , ant , utils .
In the earlier version these layers were well separated and the ant layer was monolithic but small .
In the later version the ant layer was still monolithic but had now become very large � making it harder to understand and work with .
More problematically a new upward dependency from the lower - level ant layer to the top - level taskdefslayer had been introduced .
These types of erosion problems lead to code that is hard to understand , hard to modify and hard to test .
But how do you know whether you �re suffering from software erosion ?
Are you suffering from Software Erosion ?
Perhaps the first thing to observe is that most projects will suffer from software erosion at some stage unless there is a conscious effort to pinpoint and stop such erosion .
Even projects that are relatively short - lived can suffer from it .
One example I have heard about involved a software project that had to be scrapped after only 6 months because it had already eroded badly .
There are some common things you can look out for when deciding how badly your software is suffering from software erosion :
The time , effort and risk in implementing new functionality increase � productivity and quality decrease and complexity increases .
These are very common side effects when software erosion is present .
No one has responsibility for the architecture and knowledge of the architecture is held by a decreasing number of people .
No one on the team can tell you ( or agree on ) what the intended or implemented architectures are .
If you don�t have an understanding of either of these then it�s very likely that software erosion has occurred and will continue to occur .
or architectures are .
If you don�t have an understanding of either of these then it�s very likely that software erosion has occurred and will continue to occur .
The team hasn�t had a stable core membership throughout the software�s life .
If someone leaves the team then that person�s knowledge of the architecture and software leaves with him or her .
New people take time to get up to speed on the project , so mistakes are made and the software erodes further .
If new people are unlucky enough to be introduced into a team where no one knows what the architecture is or should be , then the software will erode even faster as they make changes to it .
Little or no refactoring is sanctioned .
Refactoring is the way to rollback software erosion once it has been pinpointed .
Refactorings that remove architecture violations , eliminate code cycles , prune dead code , consolidate code clones and do away with metric outliers are particularly beneficial , because , by fighting software erosion , they clear the way for other refactorings , for bug fixes and for new features in the software .
There�s pressure to rewrite the software .
When software has eroded badly it becomes really hard for developers to work with that software .
Every change and bug fix takes significantly longer in practice than it should in theory .
The code becomes brittle and so even the simplest change can have unexpected knock - on effects which lead to costly rework .
I�ll say more on rewriting later .
At a detailed level , software erosion results in problems such as code living in the wrong place , layering violations ( as seen above in the ANT example ) , complex cycles insufficient decomposition , big packages etc .
Costs of Software Erosion
It can be hard to measure the cost of software erosion and convey this cost to non-technical people who often have to sanction work to stop software erosion .
Even though software erosion causes reduced productivity , reduced quality and increased time - to - market , no one specific point of erosion causes these effects in isolation , rather it is the effect of multiple points of erosion that combine and reinforce each other to cause them .
However , a study by the US Air Force Software Technology Support Centre ( STSC ) attempted to put some rough measure on the costs of software erosion .
The researchers took two versions of a mature software system ( 50 k LOC ) and asked two different teams to perform the same maintenance task ( adding approx . 3 k of code ) on their respective version .
Version 1 was an existing system suffering software erosion .
Version 2 was the same system but with the architecture restructured to remove erosion .
The results were staggeringly different .
Team 1 , working on Version 1 , needed over twice as long as team 2 to complete this relatively short task .
Furthermore , Team 1�s results contained more than eight times the number of errors than the work submitted by team 2 , working on version2 .
Erosion in a small system such as this still had the potential to lead to significant problems when the software was maintained .
Causes of Erosion
By now you should have some clues as to how software erosion comes about .
It does not arise purely spontaneously .
Software Erosion comes about through change .
Pressure for change comes from a variety of sources .
The need to add new features to a product to help persuade people to buy it , changes to the environment within which the software is deployed e.g. to support different networking or GUI standards and technical changes , such as the desire to adopt new coding standards all have an impact on the software .
Where the initial vision for the software doesn�t allow for change , such erosion effects will be seen very quickly .
Software Erosion is also known as software decay or code rot and by similar terms .
However , these don�t adequately capture the notion that it is forces external to the software that are ultimately the cause of problems within the software .
Erosion is not something that just happens to the code without someone actively making such changes .
This is why I feel that notion of software erosion more adequately describes this gradual wearing down of the ability to work effectively with the software .
The needs of the business can also contribute to software erosion .
Even though deliberately eroding your software causes bigger problems down the line it may be in the best interest of the business to do this for some short - term gain .
The problems build up quickly however if the business does this repeatedly without spending time to refactor the eroded code .
Every developer is familiar with the �quick - fix� that becomes a permanent feature .
Real - World Examples of Software Erosion
How bad is this problem in practice ?
In 2007 - 08 I decided to investigate this question by running a number of workshops at different software events in the UK and by engaging in some discussions with some software practitioners further afield .
At every workshop I ran participants spoke about many different examples of systems suffering software erosion :
Software with a large number of cyclic dependencies that ended up as brittle spaghetti code .
Systems where business logic ( with associated SQL ) was captured in the software�s presentation layer � making it hard to replace this layer .
A software system where the threading architecture eroded so badly over time that the system became unmaintainable and had to be scrapped .
A single class used as a dumping ground for everything that didn�t have a better home .
A �cancerous wart� of a software system with ever increasing coupling between modules , packages etc .
Lots of code clones ( copies and near - identical copies ) .
Uncontrolled code use � programmers grabbing code , classes and even variables from other parts of the software without any control on what could and couldn�t be used � once again led to significant erosion .
Several examples of drive - by programming � team - membership constantly changing , programmers not understanding the architecture and so making mistakes when they coded and then moving onto their next project .
One example of drive - by - architecting with similar consequences .
Problems with obsolete software and hardware technology ; a lack of skills in these obsolete technologies leading to further decay .
Sales - driven evolution � where there was no clear roadmap or scope for the software system and so the implemented software architecture inevitably diverged rapidly from the intended architecture .
Merged companies with different cultures and different principles having to collaborate on a software system leading to decay .
In every workshop all but a few people either were working on projects that had eroded quite badly or had worked on such projects in the past .
Case Study - Outsourcing of a 1MLOC C/C++ system
I outline below a real - world case study in order to get you thinking further about software erosion .
My recommendation is to spend 10 - 15 minutes ( either on your own or with a colleague who is also reading this article ) thinking about the questions before proceeding to the discussion .
Case Study Project History
A company developed a software system over a number of years .
Six years ago the software was transferred to a company - owned outsourcing centre in India where it has been developed since that time .
At the time of the transfer the organisation believed that the architecture of the system as intended was well documented and matched what was implemented .
The software is critical and cannot be thrown away easily .
Over time more staff were added to the project to maintain a steady flow of new features .
The company has a similar product that is maintained and evolved by 5 developers whereas the Indian department now has 50 developers .
The company recently compared the amount of work done by these two teams and assessed that they delivered roughly the same amount of work .
Present Situation
Acting on this difference in productivity the company compared the architecture from 6 years ago ( as the outsourcing took place ) against the architecture of the current code and found that many parts of the system have dependencies that are not intended .
The intended architecture was documented , so in theory all involved personnel could have compared actual to as - intended architecture .
The initial architecture was probably appropriate for the current system ( so it 's a good architecture that has gone bad ) .
The company now intends to bring part of the software back under control in Germany while leaving part under control in India .
Questions
Think about whether it is credible that software erosion led to this significant decrease in productivity ?
What do you think of the company 's proposed solution ?
Discussion
The software has been developed over a number of years ; the team and their development processes ; tools and technologies may have changed during this time .
Given we can probably reason that the software has probably been modified a lot before it was handed over and so conclude that it�s likely that the architecture at the time of handover may have eroded .
There was a major personnel change 6 years ago when the project was handed over .
The two different organisations will have different cultures , knowledge & skills .
It is not clear that these differences will be lessened just because both organisations are part of the same multi-national .
This could lead to further erosion .
We also have to consider the reasons for the switch and the way the switch took place .
Did the organisation cut costs on the project when the software was handed over ?
Was there a backlog of work on the project that it was felt the new team could tackle sooner or better ?
How was the handover done ?
Did they redeploy the existing team elsewhere or did they fire them ?
Were people from the old team made available to help people from the new team get up to speed ?
How much time was the new team given to learn about the software before having to start modifying it ?
If there was no effective handover and insufficient time allowed for the new team to learn the architecture and the code base then erosion is more likely to have occurred .
We�re told that the � Software is critical and cannot be thrown away� .
We �re also told that there�s been a steady flow of new features
Both of these indicate that changes have and will take place implying that erosion could be present .
This is confirmed by the assessment that there are a lot of unintended dependencies in the architecture as - implemented .
My belief is that it is credible that architectural decay contributed to the team�s problems but that it cannot be untangled from other issues .
There have been lots of changes over the years .
At the time of handover it wasn�t clear how closely the architecture as is matched the architecture as intended .
There were lots of staff changes � how well was the handover managed ?
� this was initially a comprehension task that needed management and technical support .
Stopping Software Erosion
Stopping software erosion requires management commitment .
If managers are only interested in the short - term viability of their software projects then it is hard for developers to get the time and make the effort to tackle the problem .
This does not excuse developers from doing what they can to fight erosion but will inevitably make their struggle less effective .
If management commitment is present then the following outline pattern can be used to stop software erosion .
How you implement the pattern depends on what tools you have available , what domain your project lies in , how mature the erosion problem is etc .
Stopping Software Erosion � a Pattern
Start out with a sustainable architecture . �
All successful software systems evolve ; make sure you have built in flexibility for future known changes .
Assess your architecture using the most likely change scenarios � where is it flexible , where will it need to evolve ?
There are always tradeoffs here in the amount of time you can spend in architecture assessment and also in the �finished � architecture .
When implementation starts regularly visualize the architecture as the software changes .
Get a feel for how close your implemented architecture is to your architectural vision � maybe you need to change the latter .
Compare the architecture as - implemented to your architecture as - intended to see how they differ .
With automated support this can be done as part of the software build .
This step does rely on you at least having some vision of what your intended architecture is .
If you don�t have this then you can gradually reverse engineer it from your architecture as - implemented .
There are now many tools from very basic free ones through to very advanced commercial tools that can help with architecture visualization and checking .
Use cycle detection , clone detection , metrics analysis and dead code detection to pinpoint software erosion .
Again there are several free and commercial tools that tackle some or these tasks .
Refactor the software to remove eroded code .
Stopping Software Erosion � Cultural Factors
As noted above , if top management doesn�t support the fight against software erosion then developers have their work cut out to stop erosion .
With management support you can create a culture where stopping erosion is valued .
This culture is likely to have characteristics such as � an emphasis on regular refactoring , clear assignment of responsibilities , sharing of architectural knowledge and work , frequent communication between the whole group .
In Designing Maintainability in Software Engineering : a Quantified Approach Tom Gilb describes one team�s � Green Week � � one week set aside each month to focus on improving their software�s maintainability .
This proved more successful for the team than their earlier one day a week approach and had the added benefit of making the development team feel empowered .
A few words on rewriting
Before I wrap up I�d like to say a few words about software rewrites .
As I noted earlier , pressure from development teams to rewrite software commonly manifests itself when that software has eroded .
In the worst case the development team uses the excuse of a possible future rewrite to delay refactoring work to the software .
When this occurs , the software continues to erode until it reaches a state where working with it becomes very difficult .
Even if a rewrite may once have been avoidable if action had been taken the result is that a rewrite becomes inevitable due to the negligence of the team .
As a developer , when faced with a decision about rewriting some software you should always ask yourself whether you are planning to rewrite it for the right reasons .
Is it because you cannot make the software maintainable or is it to get rid of code you haven�t tried hard enough to refactor or code that someone other than you has written ?
Worst still , is it just to get some hot new technology onto your CV ?
As a manager ask yourself whether you can afford a rewrite ?
Do you have the right people with the right skills available for the right length of time ?
Do you understand the risks of new tools and technologies ?
Do you understand what you have to build ?
Are you rewriting the software or building something brand new ?
Worst still , how long will it be before your competitors catch up ?
In the Doomsday scenario , can your organisation handle the total failure of the rewriting project ?
If you �re about to risk an expensive and lengthy rewrite of your software , are you really sure that you�ve exhausted every approach to fighting software erosion in your current code base ?
Summary
Any successful software system is likely to evolve .
Unless preventative work is undertaken the software will erode .
As the software erodes the cost and risk of further development rises .
It �s rarely too early to start fighting software erosion .
The costs of software erosion start to bite very quickly once it sets in .
There are lots of different things that can be done to stop software erosion � you ( just ) need to work out what the best value approach is for your particular project .
If you are a manager then create a culture where fighting software erosion is encouraged and supported .
If you do n't do this then no one will care about erosion .
If you are an architect or developer then educate yourself about the different causes of erosion and the different approaches for fighting it .
If you �re interested in finding out more , or sharing your ideas on stopping software erosion , then please get in touch .

20 Common Misconceptions Theists Have About Atheism
By Doubting Thomas
Here are presented 20 common misconceptions that theists tend to have about atheists and atheism .
While this article tends to be targeted toward Christians , it also is good reading for people of all religions who do n't fully understand atheism and may have some of these erroneous beliefs about what atheism is or is not .
1. Atheism is a religion .
Atheism is simply being without belief in a god or gods .
Atheism is not a religion any more than not playing golf is a sport .
There are no atheist churches or services to attend .
2. Atheists worship science & logic .
Atheists use science & logic to make determinations about the world & universe around them , but they do not " worship " science .
The scientific process is simply a way to determine what 's most likely true and what 's not .
3 . Atheists worship themselves / atheists see themselves as gods .
Atheists do not think of themselves as gods .
Atheists do tend to put a higher priority on quality of life than theists do , since atheists view this life as the only one they get .
So they tend to enjoy the pursuit of happiness .
However , they do not believe that they are gods themselves or worship themselves .
There are many meek and non-egoist atheists .
4. Atheists worship material possessions instead of God .
While there may be many atheists who are materialists , this is not a requirement of being an atheist .
There are many secular humanist charities .
If this were a valid argument , one could easily make the case that since there are so many rich preachers like Pat Robertson , Orel Roberts , Jimmy Swaggart & the like , that all Christians worship money .
The idea that atheists have to worship something is a misconception of theists who can't seem to understand that it is possible to get through life without doing so .
The idea that atheists have simply replaced something else for God is silly , but it continually persists .
5 . Atheists are unhappy people .
Not true .
Atheists are just as happy as theists , and some atheists who used to be religious are far happier as atheists .
If an atheist is unhappy , it 's usually because a theist is trying to force their religious views upon them .
6 . Atheists just want to remove God from society .
While there are a number of hard core atheists who believe we would be far better without religion than with it , most atheists simply want to live their lives without being persecuted or denigrated because of not having religious beliefs .
Atheists will fight for the right to be free from religion whenever theists try to instill religion into government .
Unfortunately in the US , most Christians see this as an attack on Christianity .
7. Atheists never tried to find God .
If atheists only read & studied the bible , they'd be Christians .
Not so .
Many atheists have read & studied the bible , but what they see is a book of superstition which is filled with factual errors and contradictions .
In fact , many atheists used to be religious at one time , but after seriously taking a look at their religious beliefs and studying the bible , they decided that religion was made up by man .
In fact , there are many atheists who are more familiar with the bible than many Christians .
It seems that many fervent Christians have never actually read through the bible .
8 . If we did n't have religion , there would be no morality .
People would just run around killing & stealing .
Atheists are decent people just like theists are .
They want the same things out of life ( except for an afterlife ) and understand that to make life better they have to live by the same set of moral rules and laws of the land that theists do .
A basic tenet of Secular Humanism is to treat your fellow man well , the way you want to be treated .
Atheists gain nothing by lying , cheating , stealing , or murdering .
Religion does not have a monopoly on moral values , and in fact the vast majority of people in prison in the US believe in and practice some form of religion or another .
Only about 1 % or less of the prison population is agnostic or atheist , compared to about 10 - 15 % in the general population .
9 . Atheists are just angry at or rebelling against God .
Atheists do not believe in any gods , so there 's nothing there for them to be angry at .
This tends to be a Christian misconception that everyone really does believe in god , but some people called atheists pretend not to .
But this is like saying that anyone who does not believe in Bigfoot is angry at Bigfoot .
10 .
It 's better to believe in God just in case he is real rather than risk going to Hell .
This is known as Pascal 's Wager , and is a false argument .
If this were a valid argument , then you 'd have to follow every different religion that ever existed and worship every different god that was ever worshipped , just to make sure you 're worshipping the right one .
Since many religions have conflicting beliefs , this is impossible .
One would have had to commit suicide with the Jim Jones cult , the Branch Davidians , and the Heaven 's Gate cult to make sure they were the right religion to follow .
Furthermore , if God is all - knowing , he would know when someone was believing in him just to be on the safe side , and probably would be angrier at that person than if they were honest and said they did n't believe .
Believing just in case is kind of like believing in aliens from other planets in case they are coming to take all the good people back to their planet to live in paradise forever .
It 's silly and absurd .
And believing just in case does not make God any more real .
11 . Atheists are trying to use science to disprove God 's existence .
Science is a series of questions and answers to investigate the world & universe around us .
Scientists are simply trying to learn about our world , and the fact that scientific discoveries reveal facts that contradict what 's written in the bible are incidental .
It 's a silly notion that scientists are conducting experiments to try to disprove God exists .
It 's just that in all our scientific discovery , no trace of any gods has been found .
12 . Atheists claim that God does n't exist , but they can't prove it .
First of all , not all atheists make the outright claim that God does n't exist .
Some , known as agnostic atheists , claim not to know whether or not a god exists , but do n't believe in any .
Most atheists look at the lack of evidence for his existence and the evidence that stories about God were made by man , they simply do n't find reason to believe in him .
There are a vocal few who do make the claim that there are no gods , and it is correct that they cannot prove it .
However , it 's not their place to disprove the existence of any gods , it 's up to the believers in the gods to prove that they do exist before requiring others to believe in them .
13 . Atheists always turn to God on their deathbed .
This is false because there have been many atheists who have died who did not suddenly ask to be baptized & become Christian because they were scared of death .
14 .
There are no atheists in foxholes .
This claim states that when someone is faced with immediate or possible termination of their life , they will become religious to avoid dying .
There have been many atheist soldiers who have gone through wars without becoming Christians .
The underlying theme of this argument , however , is that the best use of religion is as a crutch to get through rough times , which people do tend to do .
This is why prison ministries are so successful , because they take someone who is at a low point in their life and preach to them .
15 . Atheists can't be patriotic Americans .
America is a Christian nation .
America was never founded as a Christian nation .
Some of the founding fathers were Deists , that is , they believed in a higher power such as a god but did n't believe that this god meddled in human affairs .
The US Constitution , the document which gives us our freedoms and our national identity , does not make any mention of God or Jesus .
Regarding religion , the First Amendment states that " Congress shall pass no law ... respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
This means that there will not be any established religion , including Christianity , nor can the government prohibit anyone from practicing any particular religion .
If the United States were set up as a Christian nation , this passage would not be in the First Amendment .
The United States is not a theocracy , and was never designed to be .
The only statement in any founding US document possibly referencing a god is in the Declaration of Independence , which makes reference to a " creator , " not calling God by name and certainly not making reference to Jesus .
American atheists are just as patriotic as American theists .
Many atheists have served honorably in the armed forces .
To say that they are second - class citizens is to go against all the freedoms that this country was founded upon .
As an aside , the phrase " under God " was added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954 after a campaign by the Knights of Columbus , not by the founding fathers .
And the motto " In God We Trust " did not become an official national motto until 1956 .
16 . Without religion , atheists must think that life has no meaning .
Atheists may think that there is no cosmic meaning to life , as in a purpose for humankind 's existence on Earth .
However , to say that life has no meaning without religion is just absurd , since atheists give their own lives meaning .
They are not sitting around waiting for a god-man to return from a mystical place called heaven , nor are they structuring their lives in order to spend all eternity with this god-man .
Atheists tend to believe that meaning in life is what you make out of it .
But most do n't believe there is any divine purpose or meaning to our existence , but rather we are either an accident of nature or a result of natural evolutionary forces .
17 . Atheists worship the devil .
Atheists no more believe in a devil figure any more than they believe in a god .
If atheists do n't believe in an invisible sky fairy , why would they believe in an invisible boogeyman ?
18 . Atheism is based on faith that God does n't exist .
Not really .
This is a theist argument which tries to turn the burden of proof around and put it upon the atheist .
Atheism is based on any lack of evidence that a god exists , so one does n't have to have faith , just an ability to think for themselves .
If any solid , factual evidence for God 's existence was found , then they would not be atheists any longer .
However , no evidence has ever been found .
This is why religions are based on faith , because they believe even though there 's no proof that God exists .
But an atheist does n't have to prove that God does n't exist , he just has to see that there is no evidence which shows otherwise .
It tends to be a Christian belief that everyone has to have faith in something , just like they tend to believe that everyone worships something .
However this is not true , and is evident that Christians who tend to think this way have not yet understood how to see things from others ' points of view .
19 .
Atheists pretend to not believe in God because they 're afraid of going to Hell .
Atheists tend to not believe in any afterlife , neither Heaven nor Hell , so this argument is false .
There may be some Christians who fit this description , but if they 're afraid of Hell they are not really atheists .
Most atheists believe that the moment a person dies , that is the end of their conscious existence .
No afterlife is waiting for them , neither good nor bad .
20 . Atheists are communists .
This is a silly holdover from the cold war when people erroneously thought that all communist Russians were atheists , so everyone in the US who is atheist must also be communist .
Atheists hold a wide variety of political beliefs , from conservative to liberal .
Painting everyone who does n't believe in a god with the brush of communism shows a lack of understanding .
Man goes on Walmart smashing spree
Posted Friday , April 24 , 2009 7:51 am
Do n't miss the big stories .
Like us on Facebook .
After the incident , which several employees called " terrifying , " the man expressed anti-government sentiments and complained about being unemployed .
According to police , Nicholas Adornetto , 26 , of East Street , walked into the Hubbard Avenue Walmart shortly after 1 p.m. and headed for the sporting goods area .
There , he picked up an aluminum baseball bat and made his way to the electronics department , where he began taking rips at three rows of flat - screen TVs  Vizios , Sonys and Sumsungs .
$ 13,000 in damage
He connected on 17 swings .
Estimated damage : $ 13,000 .
Adornetto was heard saying , " I 'm not going to hurt anyone .
I 'm mad at the government .
I 'm sick of it all .
I want to go to jail . "
Pittsfield Police Detective Sgt. Marc E. Strout said several employees were able to " talk him down " and take the bat away .
Police were called .
Adornetto was arrested and charged with 17 counts of willful and malicious destruction of property .
He was being held on $ 3,000 cash bond at the Pittsfield Police Department overnight and is scheduled to be arraigned in Central Berkshire District Court this morning .

Incident still under investigation
" We appreciate the quick response of the police department , " she said .
Hardie declined to speak further on the issue , as it still remains under investigation .
Meanwhile , questions remain concerning Adornetto's motive .
The 2001 Pittsfield High graduate received a history degree from Skidmore College in Saratoga , N.Y. , in December 2004 .

He was accepted into the international honor society Phi Alpha Theta and graduated summa cum laude  the highest college honors reserved for the top 1 percent of students .
His father , Gerald Adornetto , died a suspicious death in January 2005 .
His body was found inside a van parked on Circular Avenue .
The 45 - year - old owner of Gerald Adornetto & Son Plumbing Co. suffered stab wounds , but an autopsy determined that it was a heart attack due to cocaine ingestion that led to his death .
District Attorney David Capeless dropped charges against 23 - year - old Anthony Carnute , who admitted to selling drugs to Adornetto and stabbing him during an altercation .
When Strout arrested Adornetto on Thursday at Walmart , he said the man was " peaceful , calm and cooperative .
" He was just having a bad day . "

I adopted El Bob from Ceyey , Puerto Rico .
I drove down there from San Juan to have some lechón ( suckling pig ) at local restaurants , or lechoneras .
It only cost $ 3 to adopt this piggy from being eaten .
Do n’t worry , I did’t eat in front of him .
Unfortunately Bob did n’t get into any other photo opportunities other than Old San Juan .
I ’ll post the other photos of my Puerto Rico trip next .
I dropped Bob near the water fountain when I was trying to take a picture , and his ear broke off .
While doing some window shopping I spotted a butterfly store selling ugly yarn dolls .
I met store owner Cirene , a gorgeous woman , who explained all the stories behind each yarn doll .
I found her intimate knowledge of about 100 of these dolls extremely attractive , as I am attached to all of my ugly dolls back home .
When she heard about Bob ’s accident , she was heart broken and immediately offered to help me reattach his ear on the spot .
As her gratitude for making her day more interesting , she offered to let me take a picture of Bob with the butterflies , since her store has a “ no photography ” policy .
I can easily say my experience with her was the best 20 minutes of my entire trip .
All photos were taken with my point and shoot , Sony DSC - W170 .
The trick is to use a tabletop tripod , set your ISO at the lowest possible , and use a timer to take longer exposure shots for the best quality .
Of course in daylight , you can just snap away handheld .
I also have grid display on my LCD so I can easily apply the rule of thirds .
One of the very few advantages this Sony has over my Canon Elph is the wider lens .

The police conducted a series of raids
All of 12 men arrested over a suspected bomb plot in the UK have now been released without charge by police .
Eleven of the men have been transferred to the custody of the UK Borders Agency and now face possible deportation .
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to press charges or hold them any longer .
The Muslim Council of Britain said the government behaved " very dishonourably " over the treatment of the men should admit it had made a mistake .
Of the 12 men arrested in the raids , 11 were Pakistani nationals , 10 held student visas and one was from Britain .

The lawyer , Mohammed Ayub , said in a statement : " After 13 days in custody , during which no evidence of any wrongdoing was disclosed , they [ his three clients ] have now been released without charge .
" Our clients have no criminal history , they were here lawfully on student visas and all were pursuing their studies and working part - time .
Our clients are neither extremists nor terrorists . "
Inayat Bunglawala , of the Muslim Council of Britain , said the government had been " dishonourable " over the way it had dealt with the men .
Mr Bunglawala told the BBC that when the arrests " took place in very dramatic circumstances of students being arrested at university and thrown to the floor " the public had been assured the men posed a serious threat .
He said it was unacceptable for the government to make these sorts of prejudicial remarks from the outset , find insufficient evidence to bring charges , and then deport the men anyway .
' Premature remarks '
" Politics should not be interfering with what is primarily a legal process , " he said .
" What we do n't want is people becoming cynical as a result of politician 's premature remarks and thinking : ' well , that 's what they said last time ' . "
BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said : " Counter - terrorism officers have told me they still think it was the right thing to do to move to arrest them . "
But , he added : " I think there will be a sense of a need to learn some lessons from this is in terms of public presentation . "
The raids had to be brought forward following a blunder by the UK 's most senior counter - terrorism officer .
Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick quit his post a day after the operation - after he had accidentally revealed operational details to photographers from a document he was carrying .
However , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith told MPs on Monday the error had not damaged the operation and the only impact had been that the raids had been brought forward " by a matter of hours " .

The Rapid Equipping Force ( REF ) of the United States Army has purchased wearable sniper detector systems from QinetiQ Systems for soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Deployment of the SWATS Soldier - Wearable Acoustic Targeting Systems will begin immediately and should be complete later in 2009 .
QinetiQ will also provide training and field support for these new systems .
The SWATS systems are part of a larger Ears Gunshot Localization product family and are designed to operate either as wearable systems attached to a soldier ’s shoulder or in fixed locations ( including inside moving vehicles ) .
The core SWATS system is 3 inches by 3 inches by 0.75 inches and weighs a mere 6.4 ounces , a negligible addition to the equipment already carried by field soldiers .
It uses less than one watt of power and still weighs less than a pound when directly attached to a power system .
Units specifically designed for vehicle mounting come in a larger hemisphere that ’s six inches in diameter but still only use one watt of power and weigh less than five pounds .
The system identifies the distance and direction of any shots fired within a tenth of a second .
It is able to ignore ambient noise and detects targets at 360 degrees .
It can even manage all of this in when mounted on vehicles moving up to 50 miles per hour .
Once a bullet is detected , the unit audibly alerts its operator and specifies the direction and distance of the shooter .
Visual and digital alerts are also available out of the box .
If selected , digital alerts use a standard XML format compatible with many other military systems .
Prior to this new purchase , QinetiQ worked closely with the army to field test SWATS both in stateside demonstrations and in actual theater of battle .
These tests resulted in several adjustments and additions to the original system design including more ruggedization and better sensors .
The requested improvements have been incorporated into the newly purchased SWATS systems .
There is speculation that some urban police forces are also considering purchase and deployment of Ears wearable anti-sniper systems .
Several large urban police forces have already begun deploying larger and heavier anti-sniper systems with some success ; the Qinetic systems may be an even better choice for them than their current equipment .
Lighter and smaller systems would increase mobility and make for more effective patrolmen .
What to do if your karaoke bar , filled with screamers who think they ’re Grammy - winning singers when they belt out lyrics to 90s college tracks , is mistaken for a gay nightspot ?
Put this sign up , apparently .
That ’s what Greg Quast did when his bar , The Elbo Room in Peoria , Illinois , got overrun with folks like us .
Except there was no mistaking the bar ’s clientele .
Quast and his staff should ’ve been used to it : Originally known as the Quench Room , the venue has always been known as a gay bar , even when ownership changed .
“ Although gay patrons continued to frequent the spot , tensions between them and the bar owner have boiled over recently concerning public displays of affection , according to the gay customers , ” reports the Chicago Tribune .
And after this sign went up ?
Protest .
In a flurry of forwarded Facebook , MySpace and text messages , a coalition quickly mobilized and dozens of gay rights supporters lined up last weekend outside The Elbo Room to express their outrage .
The sign , they said , might as well have read , “ Gays are not welcome here . ”
“ The sign was basically a sign of intolerance , and we ’re not going to stand for it anymore , ” said Stephanie Worlow , 27 , one of the organizers of the protest that drew nearly 40 people .
“ It ’s time that we as a community stand up for ourselves .
We ’re not going to stand for intolerance anymore . ”
The group held three protests last weekend , one of which drew the attention of paintballers , who fired on the crowd .
Police had no suspects in that attack .
[ …] The bar owner , Greg Quast , could not be reached for comment .
But he issued a statement apologizing for the sign , saying he ’s taken action to ensure it does not happen again .
Van Auken warned that it better not ; the city has already notified him the sign violated state law .
A short exchange in the Commons yesterday suggests that thought crime is now officially on the government ’s agenda .
Labour MP George Howarth had something of a triumph at the committee stage of the Coroners and Justice Bill , when he famously observed , of a drawing scrawled on a piece of paper : " If somebody is in the process of arousing themselves sexually by that process , it must be part of something .
In a lot of cases , it will be part of something that will lead on to something else . "
Yesterday , he was on his feet during questions to Bridget Prentice MP , Parliamentary Under - Secretary at the Ministry of Justice .
He asked : “ Does she agree that not only are images based on real children unacceptable , but so too are images that people use for these purposes that they have generated either from their own imagination or electronically ?
" Will she give the House an assurance that her Department will not be going down the route of believing that those sorts of images are a matter for the individual concerned and their own conscience ? "
Bridget Prentice replied : " I can absolutely give my right honourable Friend that assurance .
He will have been as surprised as I was when in the Coroners and Justice Public Bill Committee the Opposition spokesman , the hon .
and learned Member for Harborough ( Mr Garnier ) , said that he felt that our clause was , perhaps , over - egging the pudding .
" I do not for one minute think that taking action against these people in this way is over - egging the pudding .
We need to protect our children . "
In plain English , Edward Garnier ’s amendment sought to criminalise the use of images where real harm took place , or where images were used for grooming .
Mr Howarth 's slightly back - to - front comment would effectively criminalise imagination .
He believes that what an individual imagines is not just a matter for their own conscience – but for the state as well .
Scariest of all , a government Minister appears to agree with him . ®
Note : Superceded by the paper Push - pull functional reactive programming , 2009 Haskell Symposium .
Functional reactive programming ( FRP ) has simple and powerful semantics , but has resisted efficient implementation .
In particular , most past implementations have used demand - driven sampling , which accommodates FRP 's continuous time semantics and fits well with the nature of functional programming .
Consequently , values are wastefully recomputed even when inputs do n't change , and reaction latency can be as high as the sampling period .
This paper presents a way to implement FRP that combines data - and demand - driven evaluation , in which values are recomputed only when necessary , and reactions are nearly instantaneous .
The implementation is rooted in a new simple formulation of FRP and its semantics and so is easy to understand and reason about .
On the road to efficiency and simplicity , we 'll meet some old friends ( monoids , functors , applicative functors , monads , morphisms , and improving values ) and make some new friends ( functional future values , reactive normal form , and concurrent " unambiguous choice " ) .

For anyone who would care enough to know ( and be completely disgusted with ) just how big of a mess we 're actually in , go read Matt Taibbi 's latest article for Rolling Stone : " The Big Takeover :
The global economic crisis is n't about money - it 's about power .
How Wall Street insiders are using the bailout to stage a revolution " .
Maddow :
There would be no outrage about AIG 's bonuses if AIG had n't needed bailing out , right ?
I mean sure people get mad at fat cats with high salaries when everyone else is broke .
But it 's the fact that this company was using our money , taxpayers money to pay those bonuses that caused the entire country to grind our teeth down their nub ends to rage at these guys .
So there would be no outrage about AIG turning taxpayer bailout dollars into executive bonuses if there had n't been a bailout .
AIG would n't have needed bailing out if it were n't too big to fail , too integral to all these other parts of the financial industries .
AIG would n't have become too big to fail if they had n't become a big hybrid complicated uber - financial everything company that made all sorts of arcane financially engineered moves that got them squirreled into every kind of financial related business that you can think of .
AIG would n't have become a big hybrid complicated uber - financial everything company if there had n't been , and this is key , deregulation of Wall Street that allowed firms to get like that .
And massive deregulation of Wall Street would n't have happened without the rise of a political movement that preached that regulation was inherntly evil and deregulation was inherently wise and virtuous and would make everyone rich and it would be free well behaved puppies for every family .
Do you want an example of how this deregulation thing worked ?
You can totally use this at the high school dance or a bar or whatever to try to impress someone .
Somebody starts complaining about the bailout .
Complaining about AIG .
You tell them actually the real villain here is Gramm - Leach - Bliley .
Just say it with total confidence .
Watch .
You will get dates .
Here 's how to explain it .
The Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 was introduced by three Republicans , Gramm , Leach and Bliley .
It repealed the wall that had been put up in the Great Depression .
A wall that kept investment banks separate from commercial banks , separate from insurance firms and so on .
When that wall got torn down we ended up with big hybrid complicated uber - financial everything companies that we could n't have had before .
That 's how Citibank ended up eating Travelers Group Insurance to change from Citibank into Citigroup which just happened to be completely impossible to regulate .
All of the sudden these new uber - giant complicated hybrid firms the Wall Street cops , the regulators , they were essentially still on horse back while the robbers , the guys trying to get away with anything to make a buck , they were in space ships .
So we had robbers in space ships and cops on horse back .
Alright so if talking about Gramm - Leach - Bliley does n't get you a date or at least admiring glances from your peers , drop one of these on them .
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 .
That one said that certain things that financial companies do to spread their risk around , to keep their balance sheets looking good even when they 're making hugely risky deals .
These are things like credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations .
You 've heard these terms right ?
This legislation decided that those things , those risk hiding things would be completely exempt from regulation .
Completely exempt .
They would not be regulated .
So from a cops and robbers perspective that 's like saying okay now it 's legal to wear a ski mask and carry a gun inside a bank .
Oh and driving a get - away car is legal now too .
How'd you like to be a cop in that town ?
Deregulation laws like Gramm - Leach - Bliley and The Commodities Futures Modernization
Act , these were pushed as great ideas to get the horrible burden of government regulation off of Wall Street .
The horrible burden of regulation was lifted off of Wall Street and then Wall Street proceeded to self destruct .
Now it 's time to start over .
And maybe this time avoid the same mistakes .
A prominent law professor says the U.S. Defense Department is issuing questionable data on the number of Guantánamo detainees who have been released " and then returned to the battlefield " because the government " is now in a position where they have to find some bad guys  even if they have to invent them by naming people who were never there . "
Their ultimate aim , Professor Mark Denbeaux of the Seton Hall University law school , told IPS , " is to foment fear among American voters and limit the freedom of the [ Barack ] Obama administration to release any of the detainees still imprisoned . "
Denbeaux heads the law school ’s Center for Policy and Research .
The center has issued a report which it says " rebuts and debunks " the most recent claim by the Department of Defense ( DOD ) that 61 " former Guantánamo detainees are confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight . "
The report is one of a series produced by the center ’s faculty and law students .
Professor Denbeaux says the center has determined that " DOD has issued ‘ recidivism ’ numbers 43 times , and each time they have been wrong  this last time the most egregiously so . "
He told IPS , " Once again , they ’ve failed to identify names , numbers , dates , times , places , or acts upon which their report relies .
Every time they have been required to identify the parties , the DOD has been forced to retract their false IDs and their numbers .
They have included people who have never even set foot in Guantánamo  much less were they released from there . "
He added , " They have counted people as ‘ returning to the fight ’ for their having written an Op - ed piece in the New York Times and for their having appeared in a documentary exhibited at the Cannes Film Festival . "
Denbeaux said that the government ’s numbers are also " seriously undercut by the DOD statement that ‘ they do not track ’ former detainees . "
The Seton Hall report attempts to correct what it characterizes as errors in the latest DOD report , which was issued in mid-January .
That report alleged that 61 detainees have returned to the battlefield .
The Seton Hall report notes that in each of its 43 attempts to provide the numbers of the recidivist detainees , the Department of Defense has given different sets of numbers that are contradictory and internally inconsistent with the Department ’s own data .
Previous DOD reports have said the numbers of recidivist detainees have been " one , several , some , a couple , a few , five , seven , 10 , 12 , 15 , 12 - 24 , 25 , 29 , and 30 , " the Seton Hall group contends .
But it adds that 82 percent of DOD ’s publicly made claims " contain qualifying language , " including terms such as : " at least " ; " somewhere on the order of " ; " approximately " ; " around " ; " just short of " ; " we believe " ; " estimated " ; " roughly " ; " more than " ; " a couple " ; " a few " ; " some " ; " several " ; and " about . "
Department of Defense statements about the number of recidivist detainees which do not identify the detainee , the act of recidivism , the place , or the time , are especially unreliable , Seton Hall ’s report declares .
It claims that in the two instances in which DOD provided written support  Jul. 12 , 2007 and May 20 , 2008  their previous oral assertions were repudiated .
For instance , the report says , in DOD ’s Jul. 12 , 2007 press release , " the 30 recidivists reported by DOD in April 2007 is reduced to five . "
DOD ’s report of July 2007 identified seven prisoners by name , but the Seton Hall group says that " as many as two of those seven named were never in Guantánamo , and two of the remaining five were never killed or captured anywhere .
Of the three remaining , one was killed in his apartment in Russia by Russian authorities .
None of them is alleged to have left their homeland or attacked Americans on a battlefield or otherwise . "
Meanwhile , Newsweek magazine is reporting that the Pentagon " is preparing to declassify portions of a secret report on Guantánamo detainees that could further complicate President Obama ’s plans to shut down the detention facility . "
The publication says that the report " will provide fresh details about 62 detainees who have been released from Guantánamo and are believed by U.S. intelligence officials to have returned to terrorist activities . "
One such example , involving a Saudi detainee named Said Ali al - Shihri , who was released in 2007 , has already received widespread media attention when Pentagon officials publicly asserted that he has recently reemerged as a deputy commander of al - Qaeda in Yemen , Newsweek reports .
Previously known publicly as Guantánamo detainee No. 372 , al - Shihri is alleged to have been involved in an unsuccessful attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen last September .
Newsweek says , " The decision to release additional case studies from the report is in effect a warning shot to the new president from officials at the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies who are skeptical about some of his plans . "
The magazine adds , " The last thing Obama wants is for one of these guys [ at Guantánamo ] to get released and return to killing Americans . "
According to Newsweek , some counter - terrorism experts have raised questions about the significance of the Pentagon ’s figures , noting that the number of so - called " recidivist " detainees represents only a small portion , about 12 percent , of the approximately 520 detainees who have been released from Guantánamo since the detention facility was opened in January 2002 .
This compares with recidivism rates of as high as 67 percent in state prisons in the United States , according to Justice Department figures .
" There have also been concerns that Bush administration holdovers were deliberately playing up the cases in recent weeks in an effort to undercut Obama .
One former senior U.S. counter - terrorism official noted to Newsweek that the Pentagon waited until the day after Obama signed his executive order mandating the closure of Guantánamo to confirm al - Shihri ’s renewed al - Qaeda ties , " Newsweek reports .
Approximately 240 detainees remain at Guantánamo .
Human rights groups and defense lawyers contend there is little or no evidence of terrorist involvement against scores of them .
This is also the opinion of some federal judges who in recent weeks have ordered the Pentagon to release some of them .
The Obama administration has given itself a year to shut down the facility , and is hoping that European countries including Portugal , Spain and Germany will agree to take some of these detainees .
The Bush administration was able to identify only two countries willing to take released detainees  Albania and Sweden .
Watch Glenn
Beck much and you 're going to get whiplash .
Like his show yesterday on Fox News : Shortly after appealing to the public not to get all hysterical and overwrought about the AIG Bonus Scandal , Glenn Beck got all hysterical and overwrought with Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association about Obama 's evil plot to take away our guns .
Of course , this back - and - forth tone shift comes on the heels of Beck 's overtly populist appeals to torches and pitchforks that have largely characterized his first couple of months working the audiences at Fox -- alongside the apocalyptic shrieking , weeping , and teeth - gnashing .
But the gun-grabbing segment yesterday was also a big about - face for Beck : Beck and LaPierre worked themselves into a fine frenzy over President Obama 's eeeeevil plans for taking away Americans ' guns -- no doubt just the first steps that will eventually lead to eradicating the Second Amendment , rounding up gun owners and placing them in FEMA camps , and installing a blue - helmeted United Nations dictatorship in America .
What 's inspiring the recent gun moves ?
Drug -gang violence on the Mexican border .
Yet for much of the past month , Glenn Beck has been bugging his eyes out and flecking his camera lenses with spittle , warning Americans about the doom about to descend on them because of the violence on that border .
So when the government pays attention to the problem and tries to find practical solutions , Beck attacks that .
A Fox News piece outlines the issue , as the wingnuts see it :
" As President Obama indicated during the campaign , there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make , and among them would be to re-institute the ban on the sale of assault weapons , " Holder said .
" I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico , at a minimum . "
Holder said reinstating the ban would decrease the flow of guns from the U.S. into Mexico .
He declined to offer a timeframe for any re-implementation ; Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller also declined comment on Tuesday .
But Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the National Rifle Association , told FOXNews.com that Holder 's " argument in general is bizarre . "
" It 's a delusion to say that diminishing the Second Amendment in America is somehow going to stop these ruthless drug cartels in Mexico . "
LaPierre called on Holder and Justice Department officials to uphold existing laws and focus on increasing enforcement along the 2,000 - mile U.S. - Mexico border , rather than consider additional legislation .
" The answer is to enforce the law on both sides of the border , " LaPierre said .
" I reject the notion that the reenactment of that ban would have any impact on the Mexican drug cartels . "
Yet , in fact , what has the NRA up in arms is that the government in fact is trying to enforce the existing law -- which means cracking down on American gun dealers and gun shows :
U.S. gun stores and gun shows are the source of more than 90 percent of the weapons being used by Mexico 's ruthless drug cartels , according to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials .
" It 's a war going on in Mexico , and these types of firearms are the weapons of war for them , " said Bill Newell , the special agent in charge of the Phoenix field division of the ATF , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , which has primary law enforcement jurisdiction for investigating gun trafficking to Mexico .
" It 's virtually impossible to buy a firearm in Mexico as a private citizen , so this country is where they come , " said Newell .
LaPierre was adamant on Beck 's show that the talk about Americans providing guns for the drug cartels was " a lie " .
But he offered no evidence at all to support this claim .
Meanwhile , the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming :
Guns recovered in some of the largest recent weapons seizures in Mexico are being traced deep into the United States — miles from the volatile border — revealing an expanding trafficking network that feeds Mexico 's violent drug cartels , according to government documents and U.S. investigators .
Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives records show 90 % of the weapons recovered and traced originate from a growing number of sources spanning from the Northwest to New England .
The trafficking routes have created what Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , described earlier this week as an " iron river of guns " flowing to the warring cartels , contributing to about 7,000 deaths in the past 14 months .
Some of the strongest recent evidence of the cartels ' expanding gun pipeline : • Four months after the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history , U.S. investigators have traced 383 of the more than 400 weapons seized from a stash house in Reynosa , Mexico , to 11 states including Ohio , South Carolina , Virginia , Florida , Michigan and Connecticut , according to ATF records .
•
Nearly a year after a gunbattle left 13 dead in Tijuana , the seizure of 60 guns has prompted probes in Seattle , San Francisco , Philadelphia and Denver . •
The guns , many of them high - powered assault rifles , are streaming across the border at such a pace that some are being recovered in Mexico within days after their purchase in the U.S , according to ATF records .
A student paper in Buffalo manages to ask the pertinent question here :
It 's all well and good to talk about the sanctity of constitutional rights , but when our constitutional right to possess AK - 47s ends up arming a bloodthirsty criminal organization in a neighboring country thanks to the strength of the American business ethic , does n't that make us the bad guys ?
But do n't ask Glenn Beck that .
He 's likely to spin around and hysterically call for the torch - bearing mob to come get you .

Overview
ZS3 provides an interface to two separate , but related , Amazon services : S3 and CloudFront
Using Amazon S3 involves working with two kinds of resources : buckets and objects .
Buckets are containers , and are used to organize and manage objects .
Buckets are identified by their name , which must be unique across all of S3 .
A user may have up to 100 buckets in S3 .
Objects are stored within buckets .
Objects consist of arbitrary binary data , from 1 byte to 5 gigabytes .
They are identified by a key , which must be unique within a bucket .
Objects can also have associated S3 - specific metadata and HTTP metadata .
For full documentation of the Amazon S3 system , see the Amazon S3 Documentation .
ZS3 uses the REST interface for all its operations .
Using Amazon CloudFront involves working with distributions .
Distributions are objects that associate an S3 bucket with primary cloudfront .
net hostname and zero or more arbitrary CNAMEs .
S3 objects requested through a CloudFront distribution are distributed to and cached in multiple locations throughout the world , reducing latency and improving throughput , compared to direct S3 requests .
For full documentation of the Amazon CloudFront system , see the Amazon CloudFront Documentation .
For help with using ZS3 , please see the zs3 - devel mailing list .

Limitations
ZS3 supports many of the features of Amazon 's S3 REST interface .
Some features are unsupported or incompletely supported :
No direct support for Amazon DevPay
No support for checking the 100 - Continue response to avoid unnecessary large requests ; this will hopefully be fixed with a future Drakma release
If a character in a key is encoded with multiple bytes in UTF - 8 , a bad interaction between PURI and Amazon 's web servers will trigger a validation error .
The ZS3 Dictionary
The following sections document the symbols that are exported from ZS3 .
Credentials
[ Special variable ] * credentials * * CREDENTIALS * is the source of the Amazon Access Key and Secret Key for authenticated requests .
Any object that has methods for the ACCESS - KEY and SECRET - KEY generic functions may be used .
If * CREDENTIALS * is a cons , it is treated as a list , and the first element of the list is taken as the access key and the second element of the list is taken as the secret key .
The default value of * CREDENTIALS * is NIL , which will signal an error .
You must set * CREDENTIALS * to something that follows the credentials generic function protocol to use ZS3 .
All ZS3 functions that involve authenticated requests take an optional :CREDENTIALS keyword parameter .
This parameter is bound to * CREDENTIALS * for the duration of the function call .
The following illustrates how to implement a credentials object that gets the access and secret key from external environment variables .
( defclass environment - credentials ( ) ( ) ) ( defmethod access - key ( ( credentials environment - credentials ) ) ( declare ( ignore credentials ) ) ( getenv " AWS_ACCESS_KEY " ) ) ( defmethod secret - key ( ( credentials environment - credentials ) ) ( declare ( ignore credentials ) ) ( getenv " AWS_SECRET_KEY " ) ) ( setf * credentials * ( make - instance ' environment - credentials ) )
[ Generic function ] access - key credentials => access - key - string Returns the access key for credentials .
[ Function ] security - token credentials => security - token - string Returns the security token string for credentials , or NIL if there is no associated security token .
[ Generic function ] secret - key credentials => secret - key - string Returns the secret key for credentials .
[ Function ] file - credentials pathname => credentials Loads credentials on demand from pathname .
The file named by pathname should be a text file with the access key on the first line and the secret key on the second line .
It can be used like so : ( setf * credentials * ( file - credentials " /etc/s3.conf " ) )
Responses
Some operations return a response as an additional value .
All response objects can be interrogated to obtain the HTTP code , headers and phrase .
The outcome of some requests — a very small proportion — will be an error internal to the AWS server .
In these circumstances an exponential backoff policy operates ; if this encounters too many failures then ZS3 signals an internal - error which can be interrogated to obtain the response object , and through that the HTTP response code and headers :
* e #<ZS3:INTERNAL-ERROR @ #x1000296bc92 > * ( setf r ( zs3 : request - error - response e ) ) #< ZS3 ::AMAZON -ERROR " InternalError " > * ( zs3: http - code r) 500 * ( zs3: http - headers r ) ( (:X-AMZ-REQUEST -ID .
" 3E20E3BAC24AB9AA " ) ( :X - AMZ -ID - 2 .
" 80sxu4PDKtx1BWLOcSrUVWD90mMMVaMx6y9c+sz5VBGa2eAES2YlNaefn5kqRsfvrbaF+7QGNXA= " ) ( : CONTENT - TYPE . " application /xml " ) ( : TRANSFER-ENCODING . " chunked " ) ( : DATE . " Fri , 30 Sep 2016 10:10:11 GMT " ) ( : CONNECTION . " close " ) ( : SERVER . " AmazonS3 " ) ) * ( zs3: http - phrase r) " Internal Server Error " *
[ Special variable ] * backoff *
Used as the default value of : backoff when submitting a request .
The value should be a cons of two numbers : how many times to try before giving up , and how long to wait ( in ms ) before trying for the second time .
Each subsequent attempt will double that time .
The default value is ( 3 . 100 ) .
If a requst fails more times than permitted by * backoff * , an error will be signalled .
It is the application 's responsibility to handle this error .
[ Function ] request - error - response request - error => response Returns the response object associated with a request - error .
[ Function ] http - code response => code Returns the HTTP code associated with a response object .
[ Function ] http - headers response => headers Returns the HTTP headers associated with a response object .
[ Function ] http - phrase response => phrase Returns the HTTP phrase associated with a response object .
Operations on Buckets
With ZS3 , you can put , get , copy , and delete buckets .
You can also get information about the bucket .
[ Function ] all - buckets &key credentials backoff => bucket - vector Returns a vector of all bucket objects .
Bucket object attributes are accessible via NAME and CREATION - DATE .
creation - date bucket - object => creation - universal - time Returns the creation date of bucket - object , which must be a bucket object , as a universal time .
[ Function ] name object => name - string Returns the string name of object , which must be a key object or bucket object .
[ Function ] all - keys bucket &key prefix credentials backoff => key - vector Returns a vector of all key objects in bucket with names that start with the string prefix .
If no prefix is specified , returns all keys .
Keys in the vector are in alphabetical order by name .
Key object attributes are accessible via NAME , SIZE , ETAG , LAST - MODIFIED , OWNER , and STORAGE - CLASS .
This function is built on QUERY - BUCKET and may involve multiple requests if a bucket has more than 1000 keys .
[ Function ] bucket - exists - p bucket &key credentials backoff => boolean Returns true if bucket exists .
[ Function ] create - bucket name &key access - policy public location credentials backoff => response Creates a bucket named name .
If provided , access - policy should be one of the following : : PRIVATE - bucket owner is granted : FULL - CONTROL ; this is the default behavior if no access policy is provided
- bucket owner is granted ; this is the default behavior if no access policy is provided : PUBLIC - READ - all users , regardless of authentication , can query the bucket 's contents
- all users , regardless of authentication , can query the bucket 's contents : PUBLIC -READ-WRITE - all users , regardless of authentication , can query the bucket 's contents and create new objects in the bucket
- all users , regardless of authentication , can query the bucket 's contents and create new objects in the bucket :AUTHENTICATED-READ - authenticated Amazon AWS users can query the bucket For more information about access policies , see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
If public is true , it has the same effect as providing an access- policy of : PUBLIC -READ .
An error is signaled if both public and access - policy are provided .
If location is specified , the bucket will be created in a region matching the given location constraint .
If no location is specified , the bucket is created in the US .
Valid locations change over time , but currently include " EU " , " us - west - 1 " , " us - west - 2 " , " eu - west - 1 " , " eu- central - 1 " , " ap - southeast - 1 " , " ap - southeast - 2 " , " ap - northeast - 1 " , and " sa- east - 1 " .
See Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon S3 developer documentation for the current information about location constraints .
[ Function ] delete - bucket bucket &key credentials backoff => response Deletes bucket .
Signals a BUCKET - NOT -EMPTY error if the bucket is not empty , or a NO - SUCH - BUCKET error if there is no bucket with the given name .
[ Function ] bucket - location bucket &key credentials backoff => location Returns the location specified when creating a bucket , or NIL if no location was specified .
[ Function ] bucket - lifecycle bucket => rules - list Returns a list of lifecycle rules for bucket .
Signals a NO - SUCH-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION
error if the bucket has no lifecycle rules configured .
Bucket lifecycle rules are used to control the automatic deletion of objects in a bucket .
For more information about bucket lifecycle configuration , see Object Expiration in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
[ Function ] ( setf bucket - lifecycle ) rules bucket => rules , response
Sets the lifecycle configuration of bucket to the designator for a list of bucket lifecycle rules rules .
To create a bucket lifecycle rule , use LIFECYCLE - RULE .
For example , to automatically delete objects with keys matching a " logs / " prefix after 30 days : ( setf ( bucket - lifecycle " my- bucket " ) ( lifecycle - rule : prefix " logs / " : days 30 ) )
To delete a bucket 's lifecycle configuration , use an empty list of rules , e.g. ( setf ( bucket - lifecycle " my- bucket " ) nil )
[ Function ] lifecycle - rule &key action prefix days date => rule Creates a rule object suitable for passing to ( SETF BUCKET-LIFECYCLE ) .
action should be either : expire ( the default ) or : transition .
For : expire , matching objects are deleted .
For : transition , matching objects are transitioned to the GLACIER storage class .
For more information about S3 - to - Glacier object transition , see Object Archival ( Transition Objects to the Glacier Storage Class ) in the Amazon S3 Developer 's Guide .
prefix is a string ; all objects in a bucket with keys matching the prefix will be affected by the rule .
days is the number of days after which an object will be affected .
date is the date after which objects will be affected .
Only one of days or date may be provided .
[ Function ] restore - object bucket key &body days credentials backoff => response Initiates a restoration operation on the object identified by bucket and key .
A restoration operation can take several hours to complete .
The restored object is temporarily stored with the reduced redundancy storage class .
The status of the operation may monitored via OBJECT - RESTORATION - STATUS .
days is the number of days for which the restored object should be avilable for normal retrieval before transitioning back to archival storage .
Object restoration operation is only applicable to objects that have been transitioned to Glacier storage by the containing bucket 's lifecycle configuration .
For more information , see POST Object restore in the S3 documentation .
[ Function ] object - restoration - status bucket key &key credentials backoff => status - string Returns a string describing the status of restoring the object identified by bucket and key .
If no restoration is in progress , or the operation is not applicable , returns NIL .
Querying Buckets
S3 has a flexible interface for querying a bucket for information about its contents .
ZS3 supports this interface via QUERY - BUCKET , CONTINUE - BUCKET -QUERY , and related functions .
[ Function ] query - bucket bucket &key prefix marker max - keys delimiter credentials backoff => response Query bucket for key information .
Returns a response object that has the result of the query .
Response attributes are accessible via BUCKET - NAME , PREFIX , MARKER , DELIMITER , TRUNCATEDP , KEYS , and COMMON - PREFIXES .
Amazon might return fewer key objects than actually match the query parameters , based on max - keys or the result limit of 1000 key objects .
In that case , TRUNCATEDP for response is true , and CONTINUE - BUCKET - QUERY can be used with response be used to get successive responses for the query parameters .
When prefix is supplied , only key objects with names that start with prefix will be returned in response .
When marker is supplied , only key objects with names occurring lexically after marker will be returned in response .
When max - keys is supplied , it places an inclusive upper limit on the number of key objects returned in response .
Note that Amazon currently limits responses to at most 1000 key objects even if max - keys is greater than 1000 .
When delimiter is supplied , key objects that have the delimiter string after prefix in their names are not returned in the KEYS attribute of the response , but are instead accumulated into the COMMON - PREFIXES attribute of the response .
For example : * ( all - keys " zs3 - demo " ) => #(#<KEY " a " 4 > #< KEY " b/1 " 4 > #< KEY " b/2 " 4 > #< KEY " b/3 " 4 > #< KEY " c/10 " 4 > #< KEY " c/20 " 4 > #< KEY " c/30 " 4 > ) * ( setf * response * ( query - bucket " zs3 - demo " : delimiter " / " ) ) =>
#< BUCKET-LISTING " zs3 - demo " > * ( values ( keys * response * ) ( common - prefixes * response * ) ) => #(#<KEY " a " 4 > ) , # ( " b / " " c / " ) * ( setf * response * ( query - bucket " zs3 - demo " : delimiter " / " : prefix " b / " ) ) =>
#< BUCKET-LISTING " zs3 - demo " > * ( values ( keys * response * ) ( common - prefixes * response * ) ) => #(#<KEY " b/1 " 4 > #< KEY " b/ 2 " 4 > #< KEY " b/3 " 4 > ) , #()
For more information about bucket queries , see GET Bucket in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
[ Function ] continue - bucket - query response => response
If response is a truncated response from a previous call to QUERY - BUCKET , continue - bucket - query returns the result of resuming the query at the truncation point .
When there are no more results , continue - bucket - query returns NIL .
[ Function ] bucket - name response => name Returns the name of the bucket used in the call to QUERY - BUCKET that produced response .
[ Function ] keys response => keys - vector Returns the vector of key objects in response .
Key object attributes are accessible via NAME , SIZE , ETAG , LAST - MODIFIED , and OWNER .
[ Function ] common - prefixes response => prefix- vector Returns a vector of common prefix strings , based on the delimiter argument of the QUERY - BUCKET call that produced response .
[ Function ] prefix response => prefix - string Returns the prefix given to the QUERY - BUCKET call that produced response .
If present , all keys in response have prefix - string as a prefix .
[ Function ] marker response => marker Returns the marker given to the QUERY - BUCKET call that produced response .
If present , it lexically precedes all key names in the response .
[ Function ] delimiter response => delimiter Returns the delimiter used in the QUERY - BUCKET call that produced response .
[ Function ] truncatedp response => boolean Returns true if response is truncated ; that is , if there is more data to retrieve for a given QUERY - BUCKET query .
CONTINUE -BUCKET -QUERY
may be used to fetch more data .
[ Function ] last - modified key - object => universal - time Returns a universal time representing the last modified time of key - object .
[ Function ] etag key - object => etag - string Returns the etag for key - object .
[ Function ] size key - object => size Returns the size , in octets , of key - object .
[ Function ] owner key - object => owner Returns the owner of key - object , or NIL if no owner information is available .
[ Function ] storage - class key - object => storage - class Returns the storage class of key - object .
Operations on Objects
Objects are the stored binary data in S3 .
Every object is uniquely identified by a bucket / key pair .
ZS3 has several functions for storing and fetching objects , and querying object attributes .
[ Function ] get - object bucket key &key output
start end
when - modified - since unless - modified - since
when - etag - matches unless - etag - matches
if - exists string - external - format credentials backoff => object
Fetch the object referenced by bucket and key .
The secondary value of all successful requests is an alist of Drakma - style response HTTP headers .
If output is :VECTOR ( the default ) , the object 's octets are returned in a vector .
If output is :STRING , the object 's octets are converted to a string using the encoding specified by string - external - format , which defaults to : UTF - 8 .
See External formats in the FLEXI - STREAMS documentation for supported values for the string external format .
Note that , even when output is : STRING , the start and end arguments operate on the object 's underlying octets , not the string representation in a particular encoding .
It 's possible to produce a subsequence of the object 's octets that are not valid in the desired encoding .
If output is a string or pathname , the object 's octets are saved to a file identified by the string or pathname .
The if - exists argument is passed to WITH - OPEN - FILE to control the behavior when the output file already exists .
It defaults to : SUPERSEDE .
If output is :STREAM , a stream is returned from which the object 's contents may be read .
start marks the first index fetched from the object 's data .
end specifies the index after the last octet fetched .
If start is NIL , it defaults to 0 .
If end is nil , it defaults to the total length of the object .
If both start and end are provided , start must be less than or equal to end .
when - modified - since and unless - modified - since are optional .
If when - modified - since is provided , the result will be the normal object value if the object has been modified since the provided universal time , NIL otherwise .
The logic is reversed for unless - modified - since .
when - etag - matches and unless - etag - matches are optional .
If when - etag - matches is provided , the result will be the normal object value if the object 's etag matches the provided string , NIL otherwise .
The logic is reversed for unless - etag - matches .
[ Function ] get - vector bucket key &key start end when - modified - since unless - modified - since when - etag - matches unless - etag - matches credentials backoff => vector get-vector is a convenience interface to GET - OBJECT .
It is equivalent to calling : ( get - object bucket key :output :vector ... )
[ Function ] get - string bucket key &key external - format start end when - modified - since unless - modified - since when - etag - matches unless - etag - matches credentials backoff => string get - string is a convenience interface to GET - OBJECT .
It is equivalent to calling : ( get - object bucket key :output : string : string - external - format external - format ... )
[ Function ] get - file bucket key file &key start end when - modified - since unless - modified - since when - etag - matches unless - etag - matches credentials backoff => pathname get - file is a convenience interface to GET - OBJECT .
It is equivalent to calling : ( get - object bucket key : output file ... )
[ Function ] put - object object bucket key &key access - policy public metadata string - external - format cache - control content - encoding content - disposition content - type expires storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response Stores the octets of object in the location identified by bucket and key .
If object is an octet vector , it is stored directly .
If object is a string , it is converted to an octet vector using string - external - format , which defaults to : UTF - 8 , then stored .
See External formats in the FLEXI - STREAMS documentation for supported values for the string external format .
If object is a pathname , its contents are loaded in memory as an octet vector and stored .
If provided , access - policy should be one of the following : : PRIVATE - object owner is granted : FULL - CONTROL ; this is the default behavior if no access policy is provided
- object owner is granted ; this is the default behavior if no access policy is provided : PUBLIC - READ - all users , regardless of authentication , can read the object
- all users , regardless of authentication , can read the object :AUTHENTICATED-READ - authenticated Amazon AWS users can read the object
For more information about access policies , see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
If public is true , it has the same effect as providing an access- policy of : PUBLIC -READ .
An error is signaled if both public and access - policy are provided .
If provided , metadata should be an alist of Amazon metadata to set on the object .
When the object is fetched again , the metadata will be returned in HTTP headers prefixed with " x- amz - meta - " .
The cache - control , content - encoding , content - disposition , content - type , and expires values are all used to set HTTP properties of the object that are returned with subsequent GET or HEAD requests .
If content - type is not set , it defaults to " binary / octet - stream " .
The others default to NIL .
If expires is provided , it should be a universal time .
If provided , storage - class should refer to one of the standard storage classes available for S3 ; currently the accepted values are the strings " STANDARD " and " REDUCED_REDUNDANCY " .
Using other values may trigger an API error from S3 .
For more information about reduced redundancy storage , see reduced Redundancy Storage in the Developer Guide .
If provided , tagging specifies the set of tags to be associated with the object .
The set is given as an alist .
For more information , see Object Tagging in the Developer Guide .
[ Function ] put - vector vector bucket key &key start end access - policy public metadata content - disposition content - encoding content - type expires storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response put-vector is a convenience interface to PUT - OBJECT .
It is similar to calling : ( put - object vector bucket key ...)
If one of start or end is provided , they are used as bounding index designators on the string , and only a subsequence is used .
[ Function ] put - string string bucket key &key start end external - format access - policy public metadata content - disposition content - encoding content - type expires storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response put - string is a convenience interface to PUT - OBJECT .
It is similar to calling : ( put - object string bucket key : string - external - format external - format ...)
If one of start or end is supplied , they are used as bounding index designators on the string , and only a substring is used .
[ Function ] put - file file bucket key &key start end access - policy public metadata content - disposition content - encoding content - type expires storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response put - file is a convenience interface to PUT - OBJECT .
It is almost equivalent to calling : ( put - object ( pathname file ) bucket key ...)
If key is T , the FILE - NAMESTRING of the file is used as the key instead of key .
If one of start or end is supplied , only a subset of the file is used .
If start is not NIL , start octets starting from the beginning of the file are skipped .
If end is not NIL , octets in the file at and after end are ignored .
An error of type CL: END - OF - FILE is signaled if end is provided and the file size is less than end .
[ Function ] put - stream file bucket key &key start end access - policy public metadata content - disposition content - encoding content - type expires storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response put - stream is similar to to PUT - OBJECT .
It has the same effect as collecting octets from stream into a vector and using : ( put - object vector bucket key ... )
If start is not NIL , start octets starting from the current position in the stream are skipped before collecting .
If end is NIL , octets are collected until the end of the stream is reached .
If end is not NIL , collecting octets stops just before reaching end in the stream .
An error of type CL:END - OF - FILE is signaled if the stream ends prematurely .
[ Function ] copy - object &key from - bucket from - key to - bucket to - key
access - policy public
when - etag - matches unless - etag - matches
when - modified - since unless - modified - since
metadata public precondition - errors storage - class tagging credentials backoff => response Copies the object identified by from - bucket and from - key to a new location identified by to - bucket and to - key .
If to - bucket is NIL , from - bucket is used as the target .
If to - key is nil , from - key is used as the target .
An error is signaled if both to - bucket and to - key are NIL .
access - policy and public have the same effect on the target object as in PUT - OBJECT .
The precondition arguments when - etag - matches , unless - etag - matches , when - modified - since , and unless - modified - since work the same way they do in GET - OBJECT , but with one difference : if precondition - errors is true , an PRECONDITION - FAILED error is signaled when a precondition does not hold , instead of returning NIL .
If metadata is explicitly provided , it follows the same behavior as with PUT - OBJECT .
Passing NIL means that the new object has no metadata .
Otherwise , the metadata is copied from the original object .
If tagging is explicitly provided , it follows the same behavior as with PUT - OBJECT .
Passing NIL means that the new object has no tags .
Otherwise , tagging is copied from the original object .
If storage - class is provided , it should refer to one of the standard storage classes available for S3 ; currently the accepted values are the strings " STANDARD " and " REDUCED_REDUNDANCY " .
Using other values may trigger an API error from S3 .
For more information about reduced redundancy storage , see Reduced Redundancy Storage in the Developer Guide .
[ Function ] delete - object bucket key &key credentials backoff => response Deletes the object identified by bucket and key .
If bucket is a valid bucket for which you have delete access granted , S3 will always return a success response , even if key does not reference an existing object .
[ Function ] delete - objects bucket keys &key credentials backoff => deleted - count , errors Deletes keys , which should be a sequence of keys , from bucket .
The primary value is the number of objects deleted .
The secondary value is a list of error plists ; if there are no errors deleting any of the keys , the secondary value is NIL .
[ Function ] delete - all - objects bucket &key credentials backoff => count Deletes all objects in bucket and returns the count of objects deleted .
[ Function ] object - metadata bucket key &key credentials backoff => metadata - alist Returns the metadata for the object identified by bucket and key , or NIL if there is no metadata .
For example : * ( put - string " Hadjaha ! " " zs3 - demo " " hadjaha.txt " : metadata ( parameters - alist : language " Swedish " ) ) =>
#< RESPONSE 200 " OK " { 1003BD2841} > * ( object - metadata " zs3 - demo " " hadjaha.txt " ) => ((: LANGUAGE . " Swedish " ) )
[ Function ] set - storage - class bucket key storage - class &key credentials backoff => response
Sets the storage class of the object identified by bucket and key to storage - class .
This is a convenience function that uses COPY - OBJECT to make storage class changes .
The storage class of an object can be determined by querying the bucket with ALL - KEYS or QUERY - BUCKET and using STORAGE - CLASS on one of the resulting key objects .
Access Control
Each S3 resource has an associated access control list that is created automatically when the resource is created .
The access control list specifies the resource owner and a list of permission grants .
Grants consist of a permission and a grantee .
The permission must be one of : READ , : WRITE , :READ-ACL , :WRITE -ACL , or :FULL -CONTROL .
The grantee should be a person object , an acl - group object , or an acl - email object .
ZS3 has several functions that assist in reading , modifying , and storing access control lists .
[ Function ] get - acl &key bucket key credentials backoff => owner , grants Returns the owner and grant list for a resource as multiple values .
[ Function ] put - acl owner grants &key bucket key credentials backoff => response
Sets the owner and grant list of a resource .
[ Function ] grant permission &key to => grant Returns a grant object that represents a permission ( one of : READ , : WRITE , :READ-ACL , :WRITE - ACL , or : FULL -CONTROL ) for the grantee to .
For example : * ( grant :full - control : to ( acl-email " bob@example.com " ) ) =>
#< GRANT :FULL-CONTROL to " bob@example.com " >
* ( grant :read : to * all-users * ) =>
#< GRANT :READ to " AllUsers " >
It can be used to create or modify a grant list for use with PUT - ACL .
[ Function ] acl - eqv a b => boolean Returns true if a and b are equivalent ACL - related objects ( person , group , email , or grant ) .
[ Special variable ] * all - users *
This acl - group includes all users , including unauthenticated clients .
[ Special variable ] * aws- users *
This acl - group object includes only users that have an Amazon Web Services account .
[ Special variable ] * log- delivery *
This acl - group object includes the S3 system user that creates logfile objects .
See also ENABLE - LOGGING - TO .
[ Function ] acl - email email - address => acl - email Returns an acl - email object , which can be used as a grantee for GRANT .
[ Function ] acl - person id &optional display - name => acl - person Returns an acl - person object for use as a resource owner ( for PUT - ACL ) or as a grantee ( for GRANT ) .
id must be a string representing the person 's Amazon AWS canonical ID ; for information about getting the canonical ID , see the Managing Access with ACLS in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
If display - name is provided , it is used only for printing the object in Lisp ; it is ignored when passed to S3 .
[ Function ] me &key credentials backoff => acl - person Returns the acl - person object associated with the current credentials .
This data requires a S3 request , but the result is always the same per credentials and is cached .
[ Function ] make - public &key bucket key credentials backoff => response Makes a resource publicly accessible , i.e. readable by the * ALL - USERS * group .
[ Function ] make - private &key bucket key credentials backoff => response Removes public access to a resource , i.e. removes all access grants for the * ALL - USERS * group .
Access Logging
S3 offers support for logging information about client requests .
Logfile objects are delivered by a system user in the * LOG - DELIVERY * group to a bucket of your choosing .
For more information about S3 access logging and the logfile format , see the Server Access Logging in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
[ Function ] enable - logging - to bucket &key credentials backoff => response
Adds the necessary permission grants to bucket to allow S3 to write logfile objects into it .
[ Function ] disable - logging - to bucket &key credentials backoff => response Changes the access control list of bucket to remove all grants for the * LOG - DELIVERY * group .
[ Function ] enable - logging bucket target - bucket target - prefix &key target - grants credentials backoff => response Enables logging of all requests involving bucket .
Logfile objects are created in target - bucket and each logfile 's key starts with target - prefix .
When a new logfile is created , its list of access control grants is extended with target - grants , if any .
If target - bucket does not have the necessary grants to allow logging , the grants are implicitly added by calling ENABLE - LOGGING - TO .
[ Function ] disable - logging bucket &key credentials backoff => response Disables logging for bucket .
[ Function ] logging - setup bucket &key credentials backoff => target - bucket , target - prefix , target - grants
If logging is enabled for bucket , returns the target bucket , target prefix , and target grants as multiple values .
Object Tagging
In S3 , a set of tags can be associated with each key and bucket .
Tagging offers a way to categorize objects that is orthogonal to key prefixes .
They resemble object metadata but , unlike metadata , tagging be used in access control , lifecycle rules , and metrics .
For more information , please refer to the Object Tagging section on the S3 Developer Guide .
[ Function ] get - tagging &key bucket key credentials backoff => tag - set Returns the object 's current tag set as an alist .
[ Function ] put - tagging tag - set &key bucket key credentials backoff => response
Sets the object 's tagging resource to the given set of tags .
The tags are given as an alist .
[ Function ] delete - tagging &key bucket key credentials backoff => response Deletes the tagging resource associated with the object .
Miscellaneous Operations
[ Special variable ] * use - ssl *
When true , requests to S3 are sent via HTTPS .
The default is NIL .
[ Special variable ] * use - keep - alive *
When true , HTTP keep - alives are used to reuse a single network connection for multiple requests .
[ Macro ] with - keep - alive &body body => | Evaluate body in a context where * USE - KEEP - ALIVE * is true .
[ Function ] make - post - policy &key expires conditions credentials => policy , signature Returns an encoded HTML POST form policy and its signature as multiple values .
The policy can be used to conditionally allow any user to put objects into S3 .
expires must be a universal time after which the policy is no longer accepted .
conditions must be a list of conditions that the posted form fields must satisfy .
Each condition is a list of a condition keyword , a form field name , and the form field value .
For example , the following are all valid conditions : ( : starts - with " key " " uploads / " )
( :eq " bucket " " user-uploads " )
( :eq " acl " " public - read " )
( : range " content- length - range " 1 10000 )
These conditions are converted into a post policy description , base64 - encoded , and returned as policy .
The signature is returned as signature .
These values can then be embedded in an HTML form and used to allow direct browser uploads .
For example , if policy is " YSBwYXRlbnRseSBmYWtlIHBvbGljeQ== " and the policy signature is " ZmFrZSBzaWduYXR1 cmU= " , you could construct a form like this : < form action = " http://user-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/ " method= " post " enctype=" multipart/form-data " >
< input type = " input " name= " key " value= " uploads/fun.jpg " >
< input type=hidden name = " acl " value= " public - read " >
< input type=hidden name = " AWSAccessKeyId " value = " 8675309JGT9876430310 " >
< input type=hidden name = " Policy " value= " YSBwYXRlbnRseSBmYWtlIHBvbGljeQ== " >
< input type=hidden name= ' Signature ' value= " ZmFrZSBzaWduYXR1cmU= " >
< input name= ' file ' type= ' file ' >
< input type=submit value= ' Submit '>
</ form >
For full , detailed documentation of browser - based POST uploads and policy documents , see Browser - Based Uploads Using POST in the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
[ Function ] head &key bucket key parameters credentials backoff => headers - alist , status - code , phrase Submits a HTTP HEAD request for the resource identified by bucket and optionally key .
Returns the Drakma headers , HTTP status code , and HTTP phrase as multiple values .
When parameters is supplied , it should be an alist of keys and values to pass as GET request parameters .
For example : * ( head : bucket " zs3 - demo " : parameters ( parameters - alist : max - keys 0 ) ) => ((:X- AMZ -ID - 2 . " ... " )
( :X-AMZ-REQUEST-ID . " ... " )
( : DATE .
" Sat , 27 Sep 2008 19:00:35 GMT " ) ( : CONTENT -TYPE . " application /xml " ) ( : TRANSFER-ENCODING . " chunked " ) ( : SERVER . " AmazonS3 " ) ( : CONNECTION . " close " ) ) , 200 , " OK "
[ Function ] authorized - url &key bucket key vhost expires ssl sub- resource credentials => url Creates an URL that allows temporary access to a resource regardless of its ACL .
If neither bucket nor key is specified , the top - level bucket listing is accessible .
If key is not specified , listing the keys of bucket is accessible .
If both bucket and key are specified , the object specified by bucket and key is accessible .
expires is required , and should be the integer universal time after which the URL is no longer valid .
vhost controls the construction of the url .
If vhost is nil , the constructed URL refers to the bucket , if present , as part of the path .
If vhost is :AMAZON , the bucket name is used as a prefix to the Amazon hostname .
If vhost is :FULL , the bucket name becomes the full hostname of the url .
For example : * ( authorized - url : bucket " foo " : key " bar " : vhost nil ) => " http://s3.amazonaws.com/foo/bar?... " * ( authorized - url : bucket " foo " : key " bar " : vhost : amazon ) => " http://foo.s3.amazonaws.com/bar?... " * ( authorized -url : bucket " foo.example.com " : key " bar " : vhost : full ) => " http://foo.example.com/bar?... "
If ssl is true , the URL has " https " as the scheme , otherwise it has " http " .
If sub - resource is specified , it is used as part of the query string to access a specific sub-resource .
Example Amazon sub - resources include " acl " for access to the ACL , " location " for location information , and " logging " for logging information .
For more information about the various sub-resources , see the Amazon S3 developer documentation .
[ Function ] resource - url &key bucket key vhost ssl sub- resource => url Returns an URL that can be used to reference a resource .
See AUTHORIZED - URL for more info .
Utility Functions
[ Function ] octet - vector &rest octets => octet - vector Returns a vector of type ( simple - array ( unsigned - byte 8 ) ( * ) ) initialized with octets .
[ Function ] now + delta => universal - time Returns a universal time that represents the current time incremented by delta seconds .
It 's useful for passing as the :EXPIRES parameter to functions like PUT - OBJECT and AUTHORIZED - URL .
[ Function ] now - delta => universal - time Like NOW + , but decrements the current time instead of incrementing it .
[ Function ] file - etag pathname => etag Returns the etag of pathname .
This can be useful for the conditional arguments : WHEN - ETAG -MATCHES and :UNLESS-ETAG -MATCHES in GET -OBJECT and COPY - OBJECT .
[ Function ] parameters - alist &rest parameters &key &allow - other - keys => alist Returns an alist based on all keyword arguments passed to the function .
Keywords are converted to their lowercase symbol name and values are converted to strings .
For example : * ( parameters - alist : name " Bob " : age 21 ) => ( ( " name " . " Bob " ) ( " age " . " 21 " ) )
This can be used to construct Amazon metadata alists for PUT - OBJECT and COPY - OBJECT , or request parameters in HEAD .
[ Function ] clear - redirects => | Clear ZS3 's internal cache of redirections .
Most ZS3 requests are submitted against the Amazon S3 endpoint " s3.amazonaws.com " .
Some requests , however , are permanently redirected by S3 to new endpoints .
ZS3 maintains an internal cache of permanent redirects , but it 's possible for that cache to get out of sync if external processes alter the bucket structure
For example , if the bucket " eu.zs3 " is created with a EU location constraint , S3 will respond to requests to that bucket with a permanent redirect to " eu.zs3.s3.amazonaws.com " , and ZS3 will cache that redirect information .
But if the bucket is deleted and recreated by a third party , the redirect might no longer be necessary .
CloudFront
CloudFront functions allow the creation and manipulation of distributions .
In ZS3 , distributions are represented by objects that reflect the state of a distributon at some point in time .
It 's possible for the distribution to change behind the scenes without notice , e.g. when a distribution 's status is updated from " InProgress " to " Deployed " .
The functions ENABLE , DISABLE , ENSURE - CNAME , REMOVE -CNAME , and SET - COMMENT are designed so that regardless of the state of the distribution provided , after the function completes , the new state of the distribution will reflect the desired update .
The functions STATUS , CNAMES , and ENABLEDP do not automatically refresh the object and therefore might reflect outdated information .
To ensure the object has the most recent information , use REFRESH .
For example , to fetch the current , live status , use ( status ( refresh distribution ) ) .
[ Function ] all - distributions => | Returns a list of all distributions .
[ Function ] create - distribution bucket - name &key cnames enabled comment => distribution Creates and returns a new distribution object that will cache objects from the bucket named by bucket - name .
If cnames is provided , it is taken as a designator for a list of additional domain names that can be used to access the distribution .
If enabled is NIL , the distribution is initially created in a disabled state .
The default value is is T .
If comment is provided , it becomes part of the newly created distribution .
[ Function ] delete - distribution distribution => | Deletes distribution .
Distributions must be disabled before deletion ; see DISABLE .
[ Function ] refresh distribution => distribution Queries Amazon for the latest information regarding distribution and destructively modifies the instance with the new information .
Returns its argument .
[ Function ] enable distribution => | Enables distribution .
[ Function ] disable distribution => | Disables distribution .
[ Function ] ensure - cname distribution cname => |
Adds cname to the CNAMEs of distribution , if necessary .
[ Function ] remove - cname distribution cname => |
Removes cname from the CNAMEs of distribution .
set - comment distribution comment => |
Sets the comment of distribution to comment .
[ Function ] distributions - for - bucket bucket - name => |
Returns a list of distributions that have bucket - name as the origin bucket .
[ Condition ] distribution - error All errors signaled as a result of a CloudFront request error are subtypes of distribution - error .
[ Condition ] distribution - not - disabled Distributions must be fully disabled before they are deleted .
If they have not been disabled , or the status of the distribution is still " InProgress " , distribution - not - disabled is signaled .
[ Condition ] cname - already - exists A CNAME may only appear on one distribution .
If you attempt to add a CNAME to a distribution that is already present on some other distribution , cname - already - exists is signaled .
[ Condition ] too - many - distributions

Performance of Russia 's drones was criticised during the Georgia conflict
Russia has signed a deal to buy Israeli unmanned spy planes to help the country improve its own drones , reports say .
The news comes after reports that Moscow was unhappy with the performance of similar Russian aircraft during the conflict last year with Georgia .
An industry source in Israel said Russian generals had been impressed with the Israeli drones used by Georgia in the conflict .
Reports say the Israeli planes will cost a total of $ 50 m ( £ 35 m ) .
Russia 's deputy defence minister , Vladimir Popovkin , was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the military had signed a contract to buy an unspecified number of pilotless drones .
" I was in Israel and even operated one , " RIA - Novosti quoted him as saying .
He added that Russia wanted to study the technology of the drones in an effort to improve its own pilotless planes , which came under criticism during the Georgia conflict .
Mr Popovkin said Russia had used a Tipchak drone during the fighting with Georgia , but that it had " very many problems " , RIA - Novosti reported .
" You could hear it flying from 100 km away , " RIA - Novosti quoted him as saying .
" It returned all shot up . "
The chief of staff of Russia 's armed forces said in December that Moscow was negotiating with Israel to buy a batch of spy drones .
( CNN ) -- Congolese soldiers looted villages , reportedly raping women and ransacking homes , late Monday and early Tuesday , U.N. officials said , as the prospect of a sustained ceasefire between government troops and rebel soldiers continued to fade .
The looting came before a nearly hour - long , nighttime gun battle north of the provincial capital of Goma that represented some of the most intense fighting since Rebel leader Gen.
Laurent Nkunda declared a unilateral ceasefire on October 29 .
Since then , both sides have accused the other of violating the ceasefire in smaller skirmishes that both the U.N. and Democratic Republic of Congo officials say have killed hundreds of people , including civilians .
U.N. spokesman Col. Jean - Paul Dietrich , speaking from Kinshasa , told CNN that Congolese troops began looting the village of Kanyabayonga , about 60 miles ( 100 km ) north of Goma , late Monday .
" They were shooting in the air ; they were shooting in houses , " Dietrich said .
He said U.N. officials received radio reports from local authorities saying the soldiers were also raping women in the village .
He said several hundred soldiers continued looting in villages further north .
Fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between government forces and rebels led by Nkunda .
The fighting is spurred by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda .
Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo .
The fighting has worsened an already difficult humanitarian situation .
More than 250,000 people have been displaced by the conflict -- adding to roughly 800,000 already driven from their homes by past violence , the U.N. says .
The gun battle late Tuesday was in Kibati , about six miles ( 10 km ) north of Goma .
Dietrich said the cause of the fight was unknown , but was touched off in an area where rebel and government fighters had been camped close to each other .
" We were putting some pressure on them over the last few days that they should withdraw , " he said .
" There are high tensions -- one small incident can trigger major fighting between the forces . "
The U.N. Children 's Fund said 29 tons of emergency aid arrived in Goma on Sunday .
" These supplies will contain the spread of cholera and diarrhea , both extremely contagious diseases on the rise in nearly all internally displaced person settlements in North Kivu , " said Pierrette Vu Thi , the agency 's representative in Congo .
The United Nations also is shipping food , medicine , fresh water and other supplies into camps throughout Congo daily .
There are about 17,000 U.N. troops in Congo .
On Tuesday , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon called for an immediate ceasefire , saying as many as 100,000 refugees north of Goma have been cut off from relief workers .
Ban said he has requested the U.N. Security Council to authorize an additional 3,000 troops to help control the fighting .

To understand how brain states and behaviors are generated by neural circuits , it would be useful to be able to perturb precisely the activity of specific cell types and pathways in the nonhuman primate nervous system .
We used lentivirus to target the light - activated cation channel channelrhodopsin - 2 ( ChR2 ) specifically to excitatory neurons of the macaque frontal cortex .
Using a laser - coupled optical fiber in conjunction with a recording microelectrode , we showed that activation of excitatory neurons resulted in well - timed excitatory and suppressive influences on neocortical neural networks .
ChR2 was safely expressed , and could mediate optical neuromodulation , in primate neocortex over many months .
These findings highlight a methodology for investigating the causal role of specific cell types in nonhuman primate neural computation , cognition , and behavior , and open up the possibility of a new generation of ultraprecise neurological and psychiatric therapeutics via cell - type - specific optical neural control prosthetics .
The rhesus macaque is an important model species for understanding neural computation , cognition , and behavior , as well as for probing the circuit - level basis of human neurological and psychiatric disorders .
To resolve how complex functions emerge from the activity of diverse cell types , ideally one would be able to perturb the activity of genetically specified cell types and neural pathways in the primate brain , in a temporally precise fashion .
In one recent study , adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) was used to deliver the Drosophila allatostatin receptor to neurons in the primate thalamus ( ) , enabling neural silencing via intracranial delivery of the small molecule allatostatin .
In general , however , the adaptation of neural control tools to the primate brain has been slow in comparison to the rapid adaptation of such tools for characterizing circuit functions in worms , flies , and mice ( reviewed in ) .
Indeed , although molecular techniques have been used to deliver genetic payloads to the primate brain ( e.g. , ) , as well as to make transgenic primates ( ) , no attempts have been made to target genes to genetically specified neuron types .
Here we used channelrhodopsin - 2 ( ChR2 ) , a genetically encoded molecular sensitizer that enables activation of neurons in response to pulses of blue light ( ) , to assess the impact of selective activation of cortical excitatory neurons on primate cortical dynamics .
We used optical fibers in conjunction with microelectrodes to perform simultaneous in vivo optical stimulation and electrical recording in the awake primate .
Selectively activating ChR2 - positive excitatory neurons resulted in well - timed excitatory and suppressive influences on neural activity , reflecting neural dynamics downstream of excitatory neuron activation .
ChR2 was safely expressed and could mediate temporally precise optical neural stimulation of significant volumes of cortical tissue for months after viral injection , opening up the possibility for such technologies to support precise , cell - specific optical control prosthetics for patients with severe neurological and psychiatric disorders .

( D ) Assessment of monkey serum reaction to ChR2 - GFP , for monkey N ( Di ) and monkey A ( Dii ) , via western blotting , comparing preinjection ( left ) to postinjection ( right ) .
Membrane fractions of HEK cells transfected with ChR2 - GFP ( left lane ) , membrane fractions of untransfected HEK cells ( middle lane ) , and monkey serum samples ( right lane ) were incubated with monkey serum ( 1:50 dilution ) , followed by rabbit - anti - monkey secondary antibody for visualization .
Given the extended duration of nonhuman primate experiments , and the prospect of using cell - specific optical neuroprosthetics for therapy , we assessed the safety of ChR2 - GFP expression in primate brain .
After months of ChR2 - GFP expression , during which time we repeatedly illuminated neurons with blue light and successfully made recordings , we saw widespread expression of ChR2 - GFP in healthy - looking neurons , with no histological abnormalities in neurons or glia , and no immune reaction at the cellular or antibody level ( Figure 2 ; see detailed text in Supplemental Data ) .
These multiple lines of evidence together support the safety of ChR2 - GFP expression in the brain of the nonhuman primate , and if supported by further and longer - term analyses , may provide the basis for cell - specific neuromodulation therapy in humans .

To assess the effect of optical activation of ChR2 - expressing excitatory neurons on frontal cortical neural circuits in awake monkey , we developed a system appropriate for in vivo monkey use , coupling a fiber to a blue 473 nm laser ( ) and assembling multiple electrodes into independently controlled drives ( Figures 3 Ai and 3A ii ) , which were then inserted into a single hole within the 3D printed grid ( Figure 1 C ) .
This setup allowed us to record from neurons while exposing local cortex to pulses of blue light .
In regions of cortex that were not virus labeled , we never observed light modulation of neural activity ( n = 32 such sites ) .
In regions that were virus labeled , many neurons increased their firing rate during cortical exposure to blue light ( Figures 3 B and 3C ) .
We called these neurons “ excited ” units .
In addition to these excited units , many neurons decreased their firing rate during cortical exposure to blue light ( Figures 3 D and 3E ) .
We called these neurons “ suppressed ” units , because they did not increase firing rate during blue light exposure , but instead decreased firing rate during light delivery , even after brief illumination ( i.e. , a single light pulse ) .
We hypothesized that since suppressed units decreased their firing rates without having undergone prior increases in spiking , the observed suppression was due to neural network activity , i.e. , recruitment of inhibitory neurons downstream of the driven excitatory neurons .
For both the excited and suppressed units , action potential waveforms elicited during light exposure were not different from waveforms observed in the dark ( p > 0.1 for each of n = 15 excited single units ; Kolmogorov - Smirnov test comparing waveform shapes in light versus dark ; exemplars in Figures 3 F and 3G ) .
In regions where excited or suppressed units were found , few light - nonmodulated units were observed ( Figure S5 ) .
These excited and suppressed units were also observed in the cortex of mice , when excitatory neurons expressing ChR2 - GFP were activated by light ( Figure S3 ) .
Light did , however , result in a low - frequency electrical artifact on our tungsten electrodes in the brain , presumably due to the photoelectric effect ; this artifact was removed from our data by high - pass filtering ( see Figure S1 ) .
Light ( 80 mW / mmradiant flux out the tip of the fiber ) modulated neurons at distances over 1.2 mm away from the fiber ( Figure S2 ) .
In the monkey cortex , we recorded 50 excited and 20 suppressed units during illumination with 200 ms blue light pulses .
Out of these 70 units , 31 were single units ( 15 excited , 16 suppressed ) and 39 were multiunits ( 35 excited , 4 suppressed ) .
We pooled multiunits and single units for analysis unless otherwise indicated .
Excited and suppressed units had similar baseline firing rates ( p > 0.2 , t test ; only single units compared ) and similar waveform shapes ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) .
For excited units , firing rates increased rapidly at light onset , and then settled to a lower steady - state firing level ( Figure 3 H ) .
For suppressed units , firing rates fell sharply after a short delay , and remained low for the duration of the light pulse ( Figure 3 J ) .
For both excited and suppressed units , after light cessation the firing rates often dipped below baseline levels for ∼ 100 ms .
We quantified the magnitude of these changes in firing rate during three distinct periods : the first 20 ms of light exposure ( “ beginning of light ” ) , the period between 20 ms after light onset and 20 ms after light cessation ( “ steady state ” ) , and during the 20 ms period starting 20 ms after light cessation ( “ after light ” ) .
Excited units fired at 750 % , 370 % , and 46 % of baseline firing rate during these three periods , respectively , in each case significantly different from baseline ( p < 0.0001 for each , paired t test ; Figure 3 I ) .
For single units , which yield absolute values of firing rate , excited neurons fired at 37 ± 7 Hz , 16 ± 4 Hz , and 1.3 ± 1
Hz during these three periods ( mean ± standard error [ SE ] ; n = 15 single units ) ; baseline their firing rates was 6.5 ± 1.3 Hz .
In contrast to the excited units , suppressed units did not change their firing rates relative to baseline during the beginning of light period ( p > 0.5 , paired t test ; Figure 3 K ) , but reduced their firing rates by 76 % and 75 % , respectively , during the steady state and after light periods ( significantly lower than that during baseline [ p < 0.0001 , paired t test ] , but not different from each other ; p > 0.8 ) .
Suppressed single units fired at 7.4 ± 1.7 Hz , 3.1 ± 1.0 Hz , and 2.5 ± 1.2
Hz during these three periods , respectively ( mean ± SE ; n = 16 single units ) ; baseline firing rate was 9.9 ± 2.0 Hz .

Deisseroth K. Millisecond - timescale , genetically targeted optical control of neural activity .
We compared the latencies to changes in firing rate between excited versus suppressed units , and found two different , but overlapping , distributions .
Excited units rapidly responded to light with latencies of 8.8 ± 0.8 ms ( mean ± SE ; Figure 3 L ) .
This short latency was not different from the first - spike latency of ChR2 - positive cultured pyramidal neurons responding to pulses of blue light ( p > 0.6 , unpaired t test ; compared to published data in ) , consistent with the idea , but not proving , that excited units were ChR2 - positive pyramidal cells .
In contrast to the short latencies of excited units , suppressed units began decreasing their firing rates 30.8 ± 8.0 ms after light onset ( mean ± SE ) , a latency significantly longer than the latency for the increases in firing rates of excited units ( p < 0.0001 , unpaired t test ) .
This difference is consistent with our hypothesis that suppressed units decreased their firing rates through neural network mechanisms involving inhibitory neuron recruitment , whereas excited units were directly activated by light .
After light cessation ( after light period ) , the majority of excited and suppressed units exhibited firing rates below baseline levels ( 28 out of 50 excited units ; 16 out of 20 suppressed units ) .
The time for this reduced firing rate to recover to baseline was similar for excited and suppressed units ( Figure 3 M , p > 0.1 , unpaired t test ) , consistent with the idea that suppressive influences downstream of excitatory neuron activation are mediated by a neural - network - scale phenomenon such as inhibitory neuron recruitment .
More applicants are flocking to job fairs .
Yet fewer companies participating .
In Arizona , pretty much like everywhere else , employers adopt a wait - see attitude .
The Arizona Department of Commerce reported Thursday that the rate is up from 7 percent in January and on pace to reach 8 percent in two to three months .
It remains below the national rate of 8.1 percent .
But the official unemployment rate tells just part of the story .
Experts are increasingly pointing out that such rates undercount the number of people who really want a job .
Discouraged workers who are n't looking for a job and part - time employees who can't find full - time work typically are n't counted in the official unemployment rate .
When these discouraged workers are counted , federal estimates show that Arizona 's jobless rate could be closer to 13 or 14 percent , said Dennis Doby , research administrator at the Commerce Department .
" Companies are of a mind - set to just not spend money .
Even though they need to hire and want to hire , they are waiting to see what is happening with the economy , " said Robin Bumgarner , senior regional vice president at Ajilon Professional Staffing in Phoenix .
Arizona and the Phoenix area continue to be among the leading areas for job losses in the nation .
Among the nation 's 372 metropolitan regions , only Los Angeles , New York City and Detroit lost more jobs than the Phoenix area in January , the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday .
The job market has become so tight that employers can choose from the cream of the crop .
Bumgarner and several other employment specialists said they have encountered a new twist on hiring : group interviews .
A large insurance company had several staffing companies bring in candidates , who were all interviewed together in a conference room , she said .
" What they found is that by doing that , they got an overall higher - quality candidate because it 's so different when you interview in a group in front of people , " she said .

River is definitely human , but the damage that ’s been done to her brain leaves her struggling to hold on to the remaining fragments of her identity and to her sense of herself as a person at all .
And the details of River ’s attempt to hold on to herself make her a much more complete and engaging character than the saner members of the crew .
In one of the funniest scenes of the series , an onboard minister called Shepherd Book finds River marking up his Bible and rearranging the pages in an attempt to make literal sense of the stories in it .
“ So we ’ll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God ’s creation of Eden , ” River says , dead serious .
“ We ’ll have to call it ‘ early quantum state phenomenon . ’
Only way to fit 5,000 species of mammals on the same boat . ”
The episode makes River seem crazy , but it also establishes her genius through an exploration of religion and science that resonates in our own world .
Whedon also shows viewers that despite her intelligence and her insanity , River is a plausible girl , whether she ’s making - believe with her brother in flashbacks , or playing jacks and giggling over gossip with another young woman .
Without those details , River might merely be a damaged freak .
But when she cries to her brother , “ I function like I ’m a girl .
I hate it because I know it ’ll go away ! ” we care , because we ’ve seen the humor and idiosyncrasy that slip away when she descends into madness .
Unlike her predecessors Dawn and River , who fight against the loss of their selves , Dollhouse ’s Echo has voluntarily given up her identity , though the pilot implies that she did so under to escape an even more terrible fate .
That setup raises important questions about consent , but because repeated memory wipes have left her with no sense of original self , Echo ca n’t remember that she consented , much less consider how she felt about signing herself over .
“ I ’m a bad guy ? ” she asks an accomplice during an assignment when her programming malfunctions , leaving her without a personality .
“ You are a talking cucumber , ” he corrects her .
Despite the fantastical circumstances his women find themselves in , Whedon has been unusually successful in bringing them to life by grounding them in the common experience of women , and portraying that experience with a sympathy and verisimilitude extremely rare in male directors .
“ There is an amazing amount of unbelievable shit happening to women all over the world every single day , ” Whedon said in an email from Canada , where he is shooting the horror movie The Cabin in the Woods .
“ A lot to cull from — and to fight against . ”
But thus far , though it ’s early in the show , Dollhouse has not managed to channel the common experience of women .
Echo is quite literally a doll : beautiful , malleable , and detached .
She communicates with the scientist who wipes her memory in call - and - response dialogues .
“ Did I fall asleep ? ” she asks every time he finishes erasing her brain .
“ For a little while , ” he responds in a tone that ’s laced with sickly sweetness .
The only fragments that Agent Ballard has of her prior identity are a photograph and a college video yearbook .
In last week ’s column , I mentioned the episode of Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder trying , at the end of 2002 , to restrain George W. Bush from invading Iraq .
Their effort failed not only because the neoconservatives in Washington were determined to launch their war at any cost , but also because the French president and the German Chancellor were lacking a long - term strategy .
The story is told by two French journalists , Henri Vernet and Thomas Cantaloube , who , in 2004 , published a detailed account of what really happened between Washington and Paris between September 2002 and March 2003 : Chirac contre Bush : l’autre guerre ( Editions JC Lattès ) .
[ Chirac Against Bush : The Other War ] .
Sounds good to me .
However , upon reading this account , one is struck by the waffling of Paris and Berlin .
For instance , in their eagerness to prevent the launching of an American - led assault on Iraq , the two European leaders had elaborated a detailed alternative plan .
They suggested putting more UN inspectors in Iraq and they were ready to provide them with still more sophisticated technology and to have them protected by European troops with a clear UN mandate .
Chirac and Schröder were certainly right to think that the absence of material proofs about Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction was the Bush administration ’s real weakness and that underlining that through the spectacular announcement of an alternative agenda would be the only efficient way of preventing the war .
But they were n’t ready with the ultimate version of their peace plan when the annual Security Conference took place in Munich on February 8 - 9 , 2003 .
Adding to this mishap , their plan was leaked by the German magazine Der Spiegel , in the middle of the conference , depriving them of the advantage of surprise .
Donald Rumsfeld got so angry about the news that he left the conference .
The Franco - German conspirators suddenly got cold feet at the prospect of American retaliation , whether political , economic , or both .
We can speculate that the Euro - rebels never took it far enough to have a real confrontation with Washington .
Anyway , the rebelled that never jelled was a huge missed opportunity , and the peoples of Europe could only conclude from this incident that Chirac and Schröder had not been serious when — seizing the opportunity of the 40th anniversary of the Treaty between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer — they solemnly renewed Franco - German cooperation on January 23 , 2003 .
The de Gaulle - Adenauer pact , the so - called " Treaty of L’Elysée , ” had so angered President John F. Kennedy that his administration put intense pressure on the German parliament , which voted to add a reference to NATO in the treaty preamble .
Let us look now at the second missed opportunity in a decade .
Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have just missed a new opportunity for letting Europe contribute to the reshaping of the world order .
Two weeks before the G20 summit in London , the Chinese government brought into the debate the only essential topic that should have been discussed in London on April 2 : the question of the international currency system .
There would have been no American unilateralism during the last decades without the dollar standard and the apparently unlimited financing of American deficits by the rest of the world .
China itself has been buying American Treasury bonds for years and the government in Beijing is getting very nervous at the prospect of the dollar collapsing .
This is the reason why the Chinese wanted a real discussion of the currency question in London .
They were supported by Moscow in this — but not by Paris and Berlin .
France and Germany could have played , together , the key role in London , had they sided with China and Russia on the currency matter .
The euro is the second reserve currency of the world .
Neither the Japanese nor the Russians nor the Chinese can impose a new international currency system without support from the Euro zone .
And France and Germany are still the leading countries inside the European Union .
Yet they never dared to tell the American administration that the old international dollar - based financial system has failed .
Instead of contributing to the launching of a debate on the roots of the current crisis , they preferred addressing the symptoms of it , suggesting more financial regulation .
But there would be no need for more regulation of financial transactions if capitalism was resting on a sound currency system .
( I belong to the supporters of a reintroduction of the Gold standard — or better the Gold and Silver standard that existed before 1820 , the only system that makes the self - regulation of the economy advocated by Adam Smith possible ; see my book with Norman Palma , La capitalisme malade de sa monnaie , F. - X de Guibert , Paris , 2009 ) .
There would be no tax evasion if our economies were not based on fiat currencies .
The lack of confidence one is currently observing is only the result of fraudulent currency management since 1971 , the year that Richard Nixon cut the last link between dollar and gold — a decision supported by Britain , France , Germany and Japan at the time .
For years the United States has been defying the laws of economic reality because the world community bought dollars or , better , American T - bonds .
But now this system is on the verge of a total collapse because nobody believes it can be sustained any longer .
Russia and China experienced in the 20th century the total destruction of their respective currencies — and of their economic system — through Communism .
And they seem to be the only countries to which the terrible 20th century — with its World Wars and its Cold War financed by fiat currencies — is a lesson .
Yet France — and Germany , too — are no strangers to the tragedy of monetary disorder .
Germany experienced a terrible inflation at the beginning of the 1920’s , which destroyed the middle class and left the Weimar Republic defenseless against Hitler .
France was the second financial power in the world on the eve of World War I , second to Britain , and an important part of French foreign investments was in Russia — which disappeared with the Bolshevik revolution .
French economic recovery after World War II was more robust even than West Germany ’s ( the latter had inherited an important part of the plundering of continental Europe through Nazi Germany during the war ) and the reconstitution of the Banque de France ’s gold reserves reflected this reality .
However , after the destruction of the Gold Exchange Standard , in 1971 , France saw its currency — and then its economy — profoundly weakened .
When millions of people , in Europe and elsewhere , were demonstrating against an American attack on Iraq at the beginning of 2003 , they only forgot to denounce the key element of American unilateralism : the dollar standard .
End the privileging of the American dollar as the reserve currency of the world and the United States government will have to abide by the rules of economics .
They will not be able to draw 75 % of the world ’s savings to them anymore , a reality that enabled them to build up the greatest military power in history without reducing their deficits .
Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder never denounced this phenomenon — or perhaps they never saw the link between the dollar standard and American military power .
But now , in the middle of an economic crisis which has been caused by the dollar standard and the apparently unlimited credit it allowed , France and Germany should be able to tell the world : " The Russians and the Chinese are right .
Let us imagine a new international currency stability that will guarantee the future of global economy . "
And of peace , they could have added .
Is it not striking that Barack Obama ’s next destination after London was Strasbourg , where he has been chairing the NATO - summit , trying to convince his allies they should send more troops to Afghanistan ?
The dollar standard had not been challenged in London and President Obama was able to reassert his role as military leader of the Western world a few hours later .
The European leaders who had not dared to question the " exorbitant privilege " ( as Charles de Gaulle described the dollar standard on 2.4.1965 ) confirmed Washington ’s claim to hegemony in the city which happens to host the European parliament every month !
What a sad symbol !
Sal sez , " Three years after Cory 's novel Someone Comes to Town , Someone Leaves Town , ' somebody actually made a router that does what the fictional mesh - network routers from the book could do .
The Fonera 2.0 made by FON , ( the Spanish WiFi sharing people ) is released today ( barring the occasional retail glitch ) for 45 euros .
It comes complete with OLPC 's mesh - networking system .
You can plug it into Ethernet or a 3G dongle .
Share your bandwidth with any other router in range that implements OLPC 's mesh - networking standard .
The Open WRT software is designed to run on just about any hardware so you do not actually have to buy a Fonera to join the fun .
The software is based on Open WRT , which in turn is based on the Linksys WRTG54G firmware which the community forced Cisco to open - source ( since it made use of Busybox + Linux Kernel ) .
As a result of this we now have a router far more featured than the most expensive access point you can get in the shops , costing a fraction of the price and based on entirely free firmware .
With a few of these we could all build community networks like the one from Cory 's book . "
Fonera 2.0

I Receive The " Second Endowment " 05/24/2016 - by Anonymously Anointed
When I was a young and devout Mormon boy of 19 ( many , many years ago ) I was thrilled to be called on a mission .
In those days missionaries were trained at the training center in Salt Lake City .
One of the first activities of the new missionaries at the missionary training center was to go through a ritual called the “ endowment . ”
All adult Mormons ( if they are deemed worthy enough to get this great blessing ) go through this secret ritual in a Mormon temple , and it is also part of the missionary initiation .
Each adult Mormon goes through this ritual the first time on behalf of himself .
But Mormons are encouraged to repeat the ritual , with each subsequent endowment as a proxy for some person who died as a non-Mormon , and who thus will be allowed into heaven because some devout Mormon today has done " the temple work " on his behalf , thus qualifying that dead person to share in heaven 's blessings .
Devout Mormons are encouraged to go through the endowment as proxy regularly , once a month or even once a week .
A relatively unknown temple ritual - unknown even to many faithful Mormons - is the so - called " Second Endowment " ( also called " Second Anointing " ) , given only by invitation to the very top Mormon leaders and their wives , each couple privately in the " Holy of Holies " room of the temple .
During that ritual , the recipients are ordained " priests and kings " and " priestesses and queens , " and assure that their " calling and election " has been made " sure , " meaning that they are now guaranteed first - class admission to the Celestial Kingdom , regardless of their sins .
Part of the ritual is performed by the couple in the privacy of their home , with the wife washing her husband 's feet and giving him a blessing .
After training , each missionary left Salt Lake City to the mission assigned .
My mission was in a large city near the east coast of the United States .
I was assigned by the mission president to a " senior companion , " who was supposed to get me started and teach me the day - to - day ropes of missionary work .
He and I shared a small apartment in one of the seedier parts of town .
The work was tedious and frustrating , and we did not have great success in gaining converts .
But the months went by , and my senior companion was transferred to another part of the mission , and I was given a " junior companion , " who was to learn the ropes from me .
His name was Ned Bronson , from Sanpete , Utah .
( By the way , all names in these pages are fictitious , even the names of fictitious people . )
He was tall and lanky , and spoke with that southern Utah drawl that is unmistakable .
He was easy - going and good natured , and quite ignorant of anything other than what he had learned in Sunday School and after - school Primary ..
There were other missionaries , of course , and we got to know some of them casually , other than at meetings of the mission staff .
There were a few " sister " missionaries , a few years older than most of us elders .
Sister Rogers was very good - looking - I was surprised that no former missionary ( a " returned missionary " or RM ) had not snatched her up back home .
Even in her very conservative dresses she was a stunning figure .
She came from the Los Angeles area , and some of the sophistication of that area had penetrated into her in spite of the Mormon shell around her .
Her companion was Sister Evans , from Mesa , Arizona , a very Mormon town with its own temple ( at that time there were less than a dozen temples on the entire planet .
Sister Evans was very petite , with reddish - brown hair and green eyes , and slightly droopy eyelids that gave her a sultry look .
But she had a strong personality .
They had an apartment just a few blocks from where Elder Bronson and I lived , so we saw them often .
One day we got a phone call from Sister Rogers , inviting me and my companion for dinner .
Since missionaries generally survive on macaroni and cheese or tunafish sandwiches , a dinner invitation is always welcome .
We gladly accepted , and agreed to come to their apartment on the evening of our one day a week off .
When they greeted us at the door , it was obvious that they had gone to a lot of trouble to make it a nice evening .
Although the table was nicely set , with candles and paper napkins , the dinner was not going to be a feast , unless compared to our usual fare .
Canned ham , rice , canned peas , and some chopped lettuce with mayonnaise for a salad .
Dessert would be vanilla yogurt with Oreo cookies .
Sister Rogers asked me to say the blessing on the food .
But before we started to eat , there came a surprise .
Sister Evans produced a bottle of chianti wine , with four wine glasses .
Elder Bronson objected .
" Hey , what 's this ?
Is that wine ?
We should n't be drinking that ! "
Sister Rogers assured him , " We are following the example of the Savior , whose first miracle , at Cana , was providing wine to the wedding guests for their pleasure .
Before we drink it , Sister Evans will bless and sanctify it to our use .
Sister Evans ? "
" Wait ! " hollered Bronson .
" What would the mission president say ? "
" President Hales ? " said Evans .
" He does n't know anything about this .
How would he ? "
" We 're going to have to confess to him if we break the Word of Wisdom ! "
" Then do n't tell him !
Is that so difficult ?
One important lesson you still have not learned , Elder Bronson , is that there are some things so sacred and so intimate that they are not to be discussed or even revealed to others , to those who would not accept and understand .
Did n't you learn that in the temple ? "
" Well , yes , but ... "
Sister Rogers interrupted him : " This is one of many sacred moments that deserve that respect .
And silence !
Sister Evans , go ahead now and bless the wine . "
Sister Evans picked up her glass of wine , bowed her head , and said , " O God , the Eternal Father , we ask Thee to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls and bodies of those who partake of it , that they may do so in remembrance of the work of Thy Son , who through the power given to him gave joy and pleasure to many .
Amen . "
That sounded very much like the standard prayer that is offered over the water that substitutes for wine in Mormon church services ( that other religions call " the Lord 's Supper " or the " eucharist " ) .
But the part that spoke of the " blood of Thy Son , which was shed for them " was omitted .
She then took a big swallow , and said , " Do not spurn what God has offered you ! "
" Elder Bronson , Elder Preston ?
You may now drink the wine .
It has been blessed for your use . "
Bronson lifted his glass slowly and finally took a sip , and made a face .
The sisters and I also drank .
I liked what the sisters had said , and did not feel any guilt about it .
It felt good , going down .
So that 's what wine tastes like !
I thought .
Sister Evans said , " We are now joined together in the fellowship of the grape !
Now let us eat ! "
I noticed that as we ate , Bronson finished his wine , and Sister Evans refilled his glass .
After we had finished eating and the sisters had cleared the dishes away , they invited Bronson and me to sit on the sofa .
Rather than sitting down in the other chairs , they stood in front of us as though they were going to make a speech .
And they did .
Sister Rogers spoke , very slowly and very solemnly : " Brethren , we have been authorized to offer you a special blessing because of your worthiness and devotion .
You may have heard of that most holy of all sacred ordinances , the Second Endowment or Second Anointing .
Very few are invited to receive it .
Sister Evans and I have received it , and we are authorized to offer it to you .
This will be the only opportunity you may have to receive it .
It will not be offered to you a second time .
If you choose to receive it , you will be required to make certain binding covenants , the nature of which cannot be revealed to you beforehand .
You will also be placed under the strictest obligation of secrecy , never to reveal even the slightest detail of the ordinance to any other person .
You will also be forbidden to ask questions during the performance of the ordinance , or even to speak unless commanded to do so .
Do you wish to receive your Second Endowment now ?
Each of you answer yes or no . "
Bronson and I sat there stunned , and looked at each other for a moment .
I said , " Can we ask a couple of questions first ? "
" You may ask , since we have not yet begun , but I cannot assure you that your questions will be answered . "
" I thought that the Second Endowment was performed only in the Holy of Holies in the temple ? "
Sister Rogers said , " That is true , although parts of it are performed privately in the home .
As for the Holy of Holies , this room has been dedicated and set apart as a temporary Holy of Holies for the purposes of administering the ordinance .
The ordinance has also been modified in form from the one performed in temples .
Any other questions ? "
Bronson had another question : " How can you sisters administer an ordinance when you do n't even hold the priesthood ?
Sister Evans replied , " You will recall that in the previous endowment , sister temple workers did indeed perform sacred ordinances , because they were authorized to do so .
And besides , Sister Rogers and I do indeed hold the priesthood , but it is not the same as the male priesthood .
It is given only to women , and has been handed down directly from Heavenly Mother , through generations of time . "
Bronson said , " I was told that the purpose of the Second Endowment was to make sure one 's calling and election .
Is that right ? "
Sister Evans replied , " Yes , your calling and erection will be made sure . "
" Well ? " said Sister Rogers .
" Are you ready and willing to accept your Second Endowment ? "
Sister Evans added , " If one of you accepts and the other does not , the one who does not accept will be required to leave at once . "
There was a long silence , during which Bronson and I kept looking at each other .
Finally , I said , " Yes , I accept .
I would like to receive the ordinance . "
Bronson got a frightened look on his face and stared at me .
" But I am never supposed to be away from my companion !
I can't leave without you , Elder Preston ! "
" Then say you accept , Bronson ! " I said .
" Okay , I guess I accept . "
It was obvious that he was not happy about the situation .
" I guess I have to . "
" Good ! " said Sister Evans .
" You have made a good decision .
You will not regret it , I promise you . "
Sister Rogers took over : " You will see that this version of the Second Endowment is similar in many ways to the endowment you have already received , but that it also differs in many ways , making it closer to resembling the joys and glories of the Celestial Kingdom .
As the first step in the ordinance you are required to receive the Law of the Second Endowment and to take a solemn covenant to strictly observe it .
Are you now prepared to do so ? "
" I guess so , " said Bronson .
" Then both of you rise and you will have the Law explained to you . "
Bronson and I stood up .
" This is the Law of the Second Endowment :
That while receiving the Endowment you are to remain solemn and silent , speaking only when commanded .
You are not to make any facial expressions , not to smile , or smirk , or laugh , but at all times show only respect and silent devotion , under penalty of being immediately expelled from the room and committed to eternal misery and regret .
You are to obey every instruction given you without demur or hesitation , but with only good will , joy , and gratitude in your heart for the blessings you are receiving .
Do you understand what this Law requires of you ? "
We both nodded .
Sister Rogers then said : " Bring your right arm to the square ! "
We did so .
" Do you , and each of you , solemnly promise and covenant to observe and keep the Law of the Second Anointing , as it has been explained to you ?
Each of you bow your head and say ' Yes ' . "
We bowed our heads and said " Yes . "
" Very well , " said Sister Evans .
" You will now kneel at this sofa , which for the present is a sacred altar .
You will bow your heads in prayer , asking God to keep you worthy of the blessings you are about to receive .
Sister Rogers and I are leaving you for a few moments and will return shortly .
Until then , continue to pray until you are instructed to stop . "
Bronson and I did as instructed , after giving each other quizzical glances .
I do n't think I had ever prayed more fervently and sincerely .
This was obviously going to be a great moment in my life .
In a few minutes we heard the sisters coming back into the room .
One of them said , " Do not move until you are told to do so ! "
We obeyed , staying in position on our knees at the sofa .
Rather , at the " altar . "
In a moment we heard Sister Rogers say , " You may now rise and turn around , remembering your covenant to remain silent . "
We got up from our knees and turned around .
I gasped .
The sisters were standing in front of us , about three feet away , solemnly looking us in the eye .
They had used make - up on their faces - their lips were a cherry red , the cheeks a gentle pink .
Their eyelids had been darkened a little , as had their eyebrows .
They were wearing some kind of perfume that I had not noticed before , that had a kind of musky and enticing fragrance .
And that was all that they were wearing , except for their white temple garments with the sacred markings .
The material of the garments was not entirely opaque , so that the faint color of skin shone through in places , as well as the brown circle of nipples behind the sacred breast markings of the " square " and " compass . "
Sister Rogers had the kind of body I had guessed from seeing her fully clothed : full body , everything nicely round , fairly large breasts , hips high and not too broad , and a slightly protruding belly .
Sister Evans was smaller , with smaller breasts but larger aureoles around the nipples .
She was obviously in good physical shape , with muscular arms and legs , and a very tiny waist and flat abdomen .
Bronson muttered , " Holy shit ! "
Sister Evans immediately said " Silence !
You have now already brokenyour covenant of silence ! "
She turned to Sister Rogers .
" Should he be expelled as a covenant - breaker , or merely punished ? "
" If he will accept punishment , he may remain .
Elder , will you accept the punishment you deserve for breaking your oath of silence ? "
He stood there , goggle - eyed , with his mouth open .
" Say yes , for heaven 's sake , " I whispered to him .
So he finally said , " OK , uh , yes , I guess . "
" Drop your pants and kneel at the altar ! " ordered Sister Rogers .
He hesitated a moment .
" Do it ! " I whispered .
So he did as he had been told , but very slowly .
When he was in position , with his pants around his ankles , and only his thin garment covering his behind ( and not likely to be much of the protection Bronson had been promised when he received it in the temple ) , Sister Evans reached into a large basket that they had apparently brought into the room , filled with various things like towels , bottles and other items we could n't see .
She pulled out a large paddle , like a ping - pong paddle , only larger .
" How many ? " she asked .
Sister Rogers said , " One on each side , but hard !
And Elder , do not make any sound during your punishment , or it will be doubled ! "
Sister Evans did as she had been told , and gave Bronson a mightly whack on each buttock .
He could not avoid making a kind of gasping sound as each blow struck , but it did not trigger more of the same treatment .
" Now pull your clothes as they were and face us ! " commanded Sister Rogers .
When he had done so , and we stood facing the semi- naked women , she continued :
" We have been instructed to reveal to you our true identities .
We are messengers from Father and Mother .
We have been ordained and anointed queens and priestesses of the Most High Gods .
I am Mary . "
" I am Martha , " said Sister Evans .
" What you see before you is the embodiment of the scripture which says that the body is a temple .
Here are two holy temples , covered with the veil of the temple with its sacred markings .
You are about to receive the most sacred and joyous ordinance which our Parents have devised for the edification , instruction , joy and exaltation of their children .
You are to receive the sacred signs and tokens of the higher priesthoods , which shall be required of you when you are to enter the Celestial Kingdom of Exaltation .
Before you receive them , you must first be washed and anointed .
Remove all your clothing and place it behind the altar and present yourselves in the innocence and nakedness in which you entered the world from your mother 's womb . "
" Even our garments ? " gasped Bronson .
The sisters ( or rather , " Mary " and " Martha " ) exchanged shocked looks .
" No questions ! " said Martha firmly .
" Another punishment ? " and looked at Mary .
" Not for now .
We 'll see how well they obey .
The other brother is doing as told . "
I was indeed taking off my clothes , and piled them behind the sofa .
Bronson was slowly doing the same .
I realized that I was getting an erection , but noticed that Bronson was not .
I think he was shaking slightly .
When we were both in our birthday suits , Mary said , " Now come and stand in front of the altar .
We will wash and anoint you separately .
Which of you will be first ? "
Bronson said , " Not me ! "
So I said , " I 'll be first . "
Mary said to Bronson , " Stand silently to one side .
You shall be the witness to this brother 's washing and anointing , and then he shall act as witness for yours . "
To Martha : " Prepare to wash and anoint this brother preparatory to his receiving the Second Endowment . "
Martha pulled a large pan out of the basket and placed it on the floor in front of me .
" You are to stand in this vessel to receive your washing . "
I obeyed , and stepped into the pan .
Mary and Martha brought a basin of water from the kitchen area and got some cloths out of the basket .
Martha poured a little fragrance into the water from a bottle in the basket , and they dipped their cloths into it and proceeded to rub the cloths all over me , beginning with my head and neck , then my arms and hands , then all over my torso , down my belly , over my buttocks and into my crotch .
They took a long time on my now very hard erection .
As they went over each part of my body , Martha was saying appropriate pronouncements : " We wash your eyes that they may see beauty and truth , your ears that they may hear words that give joy , your breast that it may feel love and tenderness , your back that it may be strong , your arms that they may clasp to you what you hold dear , your hands and fingers that they may always give pleasure in their touch , your loins that they may always perform the duties required of them , and your entire body , that it might be the temple of joy and happiness which God intended it to be . "
When they had moistened my entire body , they towelled me off , rubbing vigorously everywhere .
Mary then said , " We will now anoint you . "
Martha got a small vial of some kind of fragrant oil from the basket , and poured a little into Mary 's hands .
Mary then started rubbing me all over with the oil , repeating a similar blessing to the washing blessing .
I had to hold my breath and grit my teeth as she anointed my erection , slowing rubbing her fist back and forth a few times on it .
They then took a towel and rubbed off the excess oil .
Then Martha got a small packet out of the basket , and Mary said , " We now place upon you the Condom of the Holy Priesthood . "
And it was in fact a condom .
Being a good Mormon boy I had never actually seen one , but I had heard about them .
As Martha proceeded to unroll it slowly it on my very firm erection , Mary continued : " Inasmuch as you are faithful and obedient , this condom will protect you from evil and all untoward eventualities , so long as you wear it in gentle love and unselfishness . "
When the condom was on , she continued , " With this condom we give you a new name , which you must never reveal except at a certain place later in the Endowment .
The new name is ' Stud ' .
You will now act as witness to the other brother 's washing and anointing . "
I stepped aside , and Bronson , trembling a little , I think , stepped into the pan , where the entire process was repeated , with Mary and Martha playing the reverse roles they had played with me .
By this time , Bronson was in a sufficiently tumescent state that Mary had no problem in getting the condom onto him .
There we stood , Bronson and I , both stark naked , wearing only a condom on a huge erection .
Mary then instructed us : " You are about to receive the tokens , signs , and names of the Holy Priesthoods .
Unlike those of the First Endowment , these have no penalties associated with them , although you are obligated to keep them secret from a curious world .
Please be seated on the altar and watch with full attention .
While watching , you are to follow the commandment in the Book of Mormon to ' hold to the rod , ' in order that no part of you should grow weak in the faith .
However , keep your hands perfectly still , since masturbation is a violation of the rules under which missionaries are bound , and you do not want to cause a premature end to the ceremony . "
Mary said : " We will now demonstrate to you the First Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
The token is given and received with each person extending the tongue so that the tips are touching , then rotating the tips around each other to the right at least three times , or as many times as the Spirit may instruct you .
We shall now demonstrate . "
Martha faced Mary , and they opened their mouths and touched their tongues together as Mary had described , moving them around several times .
Mary then said , " That is the First Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
We desire all to receive it .
Please rise , and continue to hold to the Rod . "
Bronson and I stood up .
Mary came over to me with her tongue out , and I opened my mouth and put out my tongue .
I could smell her perfume and I inhaled her breath .
I looked directly into her eyes , and she rubbed her tongue over mine several times .
Martha was doing the same to Bronson .
Mary then said , " You may be seated . "
We sat back down on the altar .
She continued , " The sign of the First Token of the Aarotic Priesthood is made by extending the tongue between the lips without opening the mouth more than necessary , and moving the tip of the tongue up and down three times .
I will now demonstrate the sign . "
And she did , first in Bronson 's direction , and then toward me .
" The giving of the sign is a request to exchange the Token . "
Martha said , " The name of the token is ' The Tongue . '
We will now demonstrate to you the Second Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
The token is given and received by each person opening the lips slightly and pressing them against the other 's lips , pressing at least three times without breaking contact . "
Mary turned to face Martha , and they kissed as described .
Martha then said , " That is the Second Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
We desire all to receive it .
Please rise , but continue to hold to the Rod . "
Bronson and I stood , still grasping our erections .
Martha came over to me with her lips leading the way , and I held my lips ready for her .
She pressed her mouth against mine , all the time looking me straight in the eyes .
At the same time , Mary was kissing Bronson ( or rather , she was giving him the Second Token ) .
Martha stepped back , and said , " You may be seated .
The sign of the Second Token of the Aarotic Priesthood is made by placing the fingers of the right hand over the mouth , then moving the hand forward until the arm is extended with the palm upward while pursing the lips slightly .
I will demonstrate the sign . "
She did so , blowing one kiss toward Bronson and then another toward me .
" The name of the token is ' The Kiss ' .
We will now demonstrate to you the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
It is a combination of the First and Second tokens , given and received with the hands on the cheeks or the shoulders of the other person . "
Martha put her hands on Mary 's cheeks , and Mary drew her closer with hands on Martha 's shoulders , and they kissed each other for what seemed like a long time , moving their faces against each other and making soft moaning sounds .
Finally they parted , and Martha said , " That is the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
We desire all to receive it .
Please rise , and free your hands from the Rod . "
We stood up , and Mary came over to me , took my face in her hands , and thrust her tongue into my mouth , breathing deeply with her eyes closed .
Her mouth tasted wonderfully of mint , and I could feel her shoulders shaking slightly .
She seemed to be sucking on my tongue when I extended it into her mouth , so I also sucked gently on hers in turn .
When she broke away , she gasped a moment and looked at me .
Martha still had Bronson 's head in her hands , sucking on his mouth .
He had let go of her shoulders .
but I could see that his eyes were rolling .
Martha paused a moment after letting go of Bronson , and took several deep breaths .
Then she continued the instruction .
" You may be seated .
The sign of the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood is made by making the sign of the First Token , followed immediately by the sign of the Second Token .
The name of the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood is ' The Tongue Kiss . ' "
Mary then said , " We will now demonstrate to you the First Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood .
This token is given by taking the other person by the hips , using both hands , and drawing close so that the lower parts of the torso are touching , and then pressing them together firmly at least three times , all while looking directly into the other 's eyes . "
She and Martha then did as described , rubbing their bodies together several times while looking directly at each other .
" That is the First Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood .
We desire all to receive it .
Please rise and release the Rod . "
Bronson and I stood up .
I was wondering what I was going to do with the Rod while receiving this token .
Martha came over to me , took me by the hips , and raised her leg slightly so that she was able to hold the Rod between her thighs , straddling it .
I was getting a little giddy .
She pressed against me several times , smiling .
" Do n't even think of it ! " she whispered .
Mary had positioned Bronson 's erection between them , so that it got the pressure from her bumping against him .
She was probably fearful of getting him past the point of no return , because she only held him against her for a few seconds .
" The name of the First Token is ' The Belly . '
The sign is made by cupping the right hand and placing it over the crotch , and placing the left hand on the left buttock , and moving the lower torso back and forth three times . "
Mary demonstrated the sign .
Martha continued : " We shall now demonstrate to you the Second Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood , ' The Iron Rod ' or ' The Matriarchial Grip ' .
This token is given to a brother by taking a firm grasp of his penis with the right hand and squeezing or rubbing it three times .
It is received by the brother raising his hands and placing them on the sacred marks of the square and compass which are on the temple veil before him .
When given to a sister , it is given by cupping the right hand , placing it under her loins , and raising the middle finger three times so as to press against the most sensitive spot there .
All this is to be done while looking directly into the other 's eyes . "
Mary then faced Martha , who said , " I shall give , and you shall receive the token . "
Mary then cupped her hand and pressed it between Martha 's legs , hard enough that Martha winced slightly .
Martha raised up her hands and cupped Mary 's full breasts in them .
After holding that position for a moment , Mary said , " That is the Second Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood .
We desire all to receive it .
Please rise and release the Rod . "
Bronson and I stood up .
Mary turned to me and said , " I shall give , and you shall receive the token . "
She then reached down and took my Rod firmly in her hand and slowly started to move her hand back and forth , looking me straight in the eye , with a mischeivous smile on her lips .
" You must do your part ! " she whispered .
I reached up and put my hands around those breasts .
" Do not give in to temptation now ! " she whispered , without the smile .
I wondered what Bronson was thinking , but only for a moment .
When the priestesses had released us , Mary said , " You may be seated .
The sign of the Second Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood is made by bringing the right hand forward , palm down , the fingers curled to form a loose fist .
The left hand is also brought forward , palm down , fingers and thumb extended .
The left thumb is then slowly inserted and withdrawn into the right - hand fist three times , while saying aloud , " O God , O God , O God . "
She then demonstrated the sign .
" As with the other signs , the making of this sign signifies an invitation to exchange the token .
The name of the token will be given to you later . "
Martha then spoke : " Brethren , you have now been given all the signs and tokens pertaining to the Second Endowment .
You have received the names of all except one , which you will receive presently .
You are now each to present yourself at the veil of the temple , to be examined as to your knowledge of the secret tokens and your worthiness , before being granted entrance .
To do this , you will approach the temple and gently press on the call button three times .
You will find it if you part the veil slightly .
It is in the Sacred Grove which grows around the door to the temple .
I will demonstrate . "
She stepped over to Mary , slipped her hand between Mary 's legs , and pressed three times .
Mary said , " What is wanted ? "
Martha said to us , " You will answer : ' Adam having been true and faithful desires to converse with the Goddess of the temple ' . '
Mary replied , " Let him present himself at the veil , and his request shall be granted . "
Martha then told us to simply follow the instructions that we were given .
She looked at Bronson and he stepped over to her , very slowly .
I went over to Mary .
I paid no more attention to him , since I was concentrating on my own performance .
I reached out and put my hand between her legs , found the sacred button , and pressed three times , very slowly .
" What is wanted ? " she asked .
I said , " Adam having been true and faithful desires to converse with the Goddess of the temple . "
Mary replied according to the script , and then said , " Have you been given a new name ? "
" I have , " I replied .
" Will you give it to me ? "
" I will , " I said , " the name is ' Stud ' . "
She then extended her tongue toward me .
I stepped closer and touched my tongue to hers .
She slowly rotated her tongue around mine several times .
" What is that ? " she asked .
" The First Token of the Aarotic Priesthood , " I replied .
She asked for its name , and I gave it : " The Tongue . "
Then she pursed her lips and leaned closer to me .
I responded by placing my lips on hers .
She moved her lips slightly so as to pull part of my lip between her lips .
It was a very nice kiss .
" What is that ? " she asked .
I answered , identifying it as the Second Token , and giving its name correctly .
Mary then took hold of my head and gave me the Third Token .
She took a long time to do it , which was fine with me , although I was worried about how I was beginning to feel in my groin .
Finally she released me , and asked me to identify the token and give its name .
I was beginning to wonder how much more of this examination I could endure without exploding .
We exchanged the First Token of the FMKAD Priesthood as before , I gave the correct answers , and moved on to the Second Token .
She took hold of my ready - to - burst Rod , I quickly put my hands on her breasts , and she asked , " What is that ? "
" The Second Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood , the Iron Rod , or the Matriarchal Grip . "
" Has it a name ? "
I remembered from my previous endowment how the dialogue was supposed to go , and so I followed that script .
" It has . "
" Will you give it to me ? "
" I cannot , for I have not received it .
For this purpose I have come to converse with the Goddess at the temple . "
" You shall receive it upon the altar , on the Five Points of Fellowship .
Follow me to the altar . "
She led me over to the altar / sofa , pulling me behind her , her hand still gripping my Rod .
She sat down close to the edge and looked up at me .
She then described the Five Points as she positioned herself in them : " The Five Points of Fellowship are : inside of left thigh to outside of right thigh , inside of right thigh to outside of left thigh , breast to breast , hand to back , cheek to cheek . "
She was still gripping my Rod , which was pointing at her navel .
With her mouth close to my ear , she whispered slowly : " This is the name of the Token : ' Fuggaminaw . '
What is that ? "
I could barely speak : " The Second Token of the Fe - male - kiss - a - dick Priesthood , the Iron Rod , or the Matriarchal Grip . "
" Has it a name ? "
" It has . "
" Will you give it to me ? "
" I will .
' Fuggaminaw ' " I said .
She said , without moving , " That is correct .
You have proven yourself worthy .
Your request will be granted .
Part the veil at the door of the temple and enter into your exaltation in the Holy Temple . "
She moved herself slightly , opened the flap in her garment , and took my Rod slowly into her very moist belly .
" Now you are in the Celestial Room .
Do not make quick movements , but lie still and enjoy the full peace and pleasure there .
You may stay as long as you like .
You have now received the Second Endowment as well as the previous Endowment , and you may now consider yourself " well endowed . "
The ceremony itself is now ended , but the blessings are just beginning .
Make them last , and remember that it is more blessed to give than to receive .
You no longer must remain silent . "
I wanted to speak , but I did n't know what to say .
It was the most blissful moment I had ever experienced .
I felt tears of joy and gratitude welling up in my eyes .
" Thank you , thank you , " was all I could say .
" It 's okay to cry , as long as they are tears of joy .
Now let 's explore a little . "
She began to move her hips slowly in a circular motion , and I could see that she had closed her eyes and was digging her nails into my back .
She was making little whimpering noises and biting her lip .
I was struggling to hold back and make it last , until she said , " Let it go , honey , let go ! " and the dam in me burst and I uttered the words of the Second Token without thinking : " O God O God O God ! "
At the same moment something made her lie perfectly still , holding her breath and gritting her teeth , rigid as a board , and I could feel her groin muscles tighten around me .
It lasted for several seconds , and then she relaxed and leaned back .
She looked at me , smiling , grabbed my head and pulled my mouth to hers in the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood .
We kept kissing for a beautifully long time .
She was still holding me inside her , her legs gripping me .
" Stay awhile , " she said .
" You feel good inside me ! " and kept moving her hips in tiny motions , side to side and back and forth .
In the back of my mind I was wondering where Bronson was , and whether he had panicked at some point .
Neither he nor Sister Evans was in the room .
" Where 's Martha ?
And my companion ? "
" They 're probably in the bedroom .
We consecrated the beds as altars as well .
I 'm sure they 're doing fine .
Do n't worry . "
I could tell that my Rod was slowly shrinking and no longer quite as fulfilling to her as it had been .
She said , " Go into the bathroom and rinse out the condom .
Get it dry and sprinkle it with some bath talc you will find on the tub .
Then roll it up again and come back .
And wash your lance well with soap and water . "
I did as I was told , and when I came back , she was lying full - length on the sofa , with absolutely nothing on .
The garment ( the " veil of the temple " ) was on the floor .
" You have already passed through the veil , so there is no need to have it cover the temple , " she explained .
I stood there , savoring the sight , taking in every inch of her skin , her face , her hair .
She was gently pressing on her call button in the Sacred Grove .
" Let me look closer at your Rod.
Come over here . "
I stepped closer and the hand that was not tending the Grove took hold of me in the Matriarchal Grip .
It was semi-limp , but beginning to respond to the attention .
She sat up a little , leaning on the elbow whose hand had been ringing her temple doorbell .
" I 'll show you now why our priesthood is called the Fe - Male - Kiss - A - Dick , " and put her lips around my Rod , very gently rubbing its underside with her tongue .
She sat up , and put both hands on my backside to keep me from backing away , which , of course , I was certainly not going to do .
She was able to pull me so close that her nose was touching my abdomen , and every inch of my rod was in her mouth .
But I was ready to pass out .
My knees were about to buckle .
She stopped swallowing me , and stood up .
" You had better sit down , " she suggested .
So I did .
She spread my knees and knelt between them , once again tending to my now really iron rod , with both mouth and hand .
It was wonderful , but excruciating and frustrating .
I was worried that I might pop while she had me in her mouth , and that did n't seem a proper thing to do , even under these unusual circumstances .
Fortunately she stopped , stood up , and said , " Where is that condom ? "
I had forgotten that I still had it in my hand .
I opened my hand , showing it to her , and she took it and unrolled it over the rod .
Then she positioned herself over me , her knees on either side of my hips , and lowered herself onto it , very slowly , taking deep breaths as she took it in .
Her hands on my shoulders , she looked me in the eye , smiled with her cherry - red lips , and said , " Massage my breasts !
Pinch my nipples and make them hard ! "
Meanwhile she was riding me like she would a horse , posting at a steady gait , breathing faster and sucking in deep breaths .
I could see small beads of sweat forming on her face and upper chest .
I was doing the same , muscles tensing all over my body and the persperation forming on my belly , which was rubbing against hers , and my chest .
Finally the rockets went bursting in air , and we collapsed in each other 's arms .
She was giggling softly , and gave me the Third Token of the Aarotic Priesthood , several times , for long times .
She rolled off of me into a sitting - slouching position on the altar , holding my hand .
" Tell me now , Elder Preston .
Have you ever experienced anything like this before ? "
" Never ! " I said .
" Your Rod has never entered any female temple before this , either with priesthood authority or not ? "
" Never ! "
" So your Rod has only received the Patriarchal Grip , and never the Matriarchal Grip ? "
" I'm afraid so , Sister Rogers . "
" I think now you may call me by my first name , which is Linda .
And I will call you Robert .
But only when we are engaged in temple work .
OK ? "
" So there might be repeats of this ? " I hoped .
" Of course !
Are n't we always encouraged to return to the temple often , to perform the sacred endowment rituals ?
And it does not have to be the same temple - you might benefit from hearing from your companion about his experience in the other temple here , and next time attend there , instead of here . "
I was surprised at her suggestion .
" But ... this was just wonderful , with you .
I can't imagine it with anyone but you , Linda . "
It seemed very intimate , using her first name , and not " Sister . "
" Do n't be silly .
It will always be wonderful , with everyone , as long as you do it with kindness and consideration .
Next time you will experience the same joy , but with Martha . "
Just at that moment , Martha and Bronson came into the room , holding each other by the hand , with not a stitch of clothing on either .
Martha was smiling .
Bronson had a canary - eating look on his face , and looked a little bit ashamed .
" All right , Elders .
You may get dressed now , and go home .
Remember that you are under a covenant of the strictest secrecy regarding the events at the temple this day . "
So Bronson and I dressed .
We were offered another glass of the chianti , which we accepted and drank .
Before Linda opened the door , she gave Bronson the Second Token of the Aarotic Priesthood , while Martha gave me the Third .
It made me think more favorably of Linda 's suggestion for the next time .
" Good night , Elders ! " said Sister Evans .
" Come back soon and often .
And if you prove yourselves worthy , you might be offered the Third Endowment ! "
We left and staggered out into the night , toward our place .
I said to Bronson , " If you ever mention any breath of this to anyone , I swear I will kill you ! "
Bronson said , " I did think that I should confess to President Hales what happened , what I did , but then I decided that it might be better all around if I did n't . "
" A very wise and mature decision , " I said .
" You have just saved your own life . "
" I wonder , " mused Bronson , " what the Third Endowment is like ? "
Being a Mormon temple ordinance worker lead me toward resigning my membership
09/17/2015 - by Tom Padley at Recovery from Mormonism
Several years ago I served as an ordinance worker at the Jordan River Temple .
I thought to myself , finally I 'll get some answers to questions I 've always wanted to ask .
What better place to get answers than the temple , and as an ordinance worker I would surely become privy to the mysteries of heaven .
Not so !
I was told to stop asking questions and just do the work .
Well , nobody tells me to stop asking questions .
That 's when I turned to the Internet .
And boy oh boy did I find answers .
My journey toward enlightenment is still going on even though I resigned last year .
My biggest problem was Joseph Smith .
After my initial period of study I came across the CES letter .
This guy 's 80 page letter nearly duplicated my conclusions .
Anyhow , long story short , the Mormon church did a huge disservice to me and I 'm sure it 's destroying many with a lifetime of faithful service because of its policy of withholding truth .
According to what I am continually learning , they are losing members in droves .
The truth will prevail and the leaders can no longer hide those truths .
Gilbert Arizona Temple Tour : " The whole thing is a doubletree lobby with white carpet " 11/05/2014 - by sb at Recovery from Mormonism
So I had dinner with a catholic coworker last night that is from New York City but was visiting family in Gilbert , AZ .
They decided to attend the temple open house , because their momo neighbor invited them to tour " one of the most beautiful buildings in the world . "
This is her report :
" Mormons seems to have two modes when you ask them about their church : NEVER talk about it or sales mode . "
" As my grandmother 's living room kept going on and on , we asked where the chapel or basilica was , we expected a cathedral , with stained glass windows , it turns out this giant doubletree lobby with white carpet WAS the temple "
" My mom blurted out : this is like the nicest conference room ever "
" as went went up the stairs your eyes meet the most homoerotic picture of Jesus I have ever imagined , he has a man kneeling down in front of him and his eyes are closed and he is leaning back slightly , it was the most sacrilegious thing I have ever seen "
" We looked at all the art and there was not one woman depicted , no wonder people feel mormon women are underrepresented , I mean not even a woman in the crowd ?
are they so clueless as so ignore 50 % of their membership ? "
" They could tell that we were not mormons , they greeted us very seriously and they treated the Xanax - blonde mormon women with huge smiles . "
" They asked us if we had questions , I asked if / why women were not allowed to be in the artwork , I got the coldest stare I have ever seen and they ignored my question "
" They mentioned the temple clothes and that there was a video we could watch , I went home and watched it and laughed : how can they be so sacred and secret and NOW , SUDDENLY they are like - oh yeah lets make a youtube about it , it reeked of an inferiority complex "
" They can't seriously think that educated people will join them ?!
I had a lower opinion of them after , they now there with scientologists and Jehovah Witnesses "
_____________________________________________________________
A friend of mine went to the Nauvoo temple open house .
( Her family on both her parent 's sides lived in the Carthage / Nauvoo area years before the mormons ever arrived .
We like to joke that her ancestors drove my ancestors out of the state . )
When she went through the open house she was told that the Celestial room is what mormons think heaven is like .
So as soon as she got home from the tour she called to ask me if mormons really believe heaven is full of Ethan Allen knockoff furniture .

What About the Temple Penalties Angers You the Most ?
11/05/2014 - by azsteve at Recovery from Mormonism
Here is what angers me the most about the pre-1990 temple ceremony " penalties " , starting with the worst things at the top .
1 . They tricked me in to giving up something I would n't have given them if they had asked honestly .
2 . Whether they meant it or not , they threatened my life and my happiness .
3 . The oath of secracy included in that threat against me was yet another form of abuse .
Without someone to talk to about it , the damage to my psyche festered and grew worse over time .
Everyone knows ahead of time that there will be secrets .
But no one knows that the secrets will include a threat to have your throat cut open from ear to ear .
4 . The penalty threats are inconsistant with what I was taught about the church up until that time .
5 . The church got people who I trusted to hide this from me until it could be sprung on me , intervention style .
My only dysfunction up until that time was to have mistaken a cult for a valid religion , and wanting to be a better person .
6 . The church has found good reason to discontinue this practice but has not yet seen the need to apologize for violating my trust and for making me feel threatened and unrightously controlled .
And some day when they get around to making that apology , it better not be one of those " ... I 'm sorry you felt that way " apologies .
That would just add yet another insult to the injury .
They know what they 've done wrong .
_____________________________________________________________
I thought it meant suicide .
- Think2much
_____________________________________________________________
I went through the temple when they had the blood oaths .
They tell people that they can leave , at one point , and only at that point .
Well , they ask BEFORE you have any clue of what is going to be required of you .
During the suicide oaths , I was angry that had I agreed to stay , without any real information .
During all three blood oaths , I had my fingers crossed behind my back , and as I said the words , I would interject : " God , I do n't mean it !
I do n't mean it ! "
It was traumatic .
The Mormons in the temple must know it is weird and manipulative and false .
I know this , because they had a rule -- and perhaps still do -- that no one is go to through the temple for the first time without a companion , of the same gender , to sit next to you and to keep an eye on you !
If a family member or close friend can't be with you , then you are assigned a temple worker to sit right next to you .
A friend of mine wanted to go alone to get her first endowments , and was in a different country .
They would not allow her in , unless she agreed to have a stranger temple worker shadow her at all times .
I wanted to jump out of my seat and run -- several times -- but I was surrounded on one side by my mother and aunt , and on the other side by my SIL and her mother -- and , oh , the humiliation .
I was literally held hostage .
I did n't really want to marry the hulking thug in the baker 's hat , either , as he had begun to repulse me three days before the wedding .
It was one of the worst days of my life , except for the physically painful days that followed .
You go in blindly and innocently , seeking God and more Truth , and you come out beaten down , having made promises you know you 'd never keep , and disillusioned by the church you trusted .
I felt absolutely alone and hopeless -- for many years afterwards .

My Grandfather 's Second Annointing - Calling & Election )
10/29/2014 - by templenamegabriel at Recovery from Mormonism
About 15 years ago my dad sat all of us kids ( 6 ) down to tell us about something important and amazing that happened to Grandpa .
My mom was visibly uncomfortable and voiced a quiet plea for my dad to not continue with what he was going to say .
After all , it was her father , not his that was the subject of the story .
He resisted her pleas to stop and she submissively ended her protest .
He then told us how our grandfather , a Stake President , was taken to the temple recently and that an apostle had washed his feet .
He said we were n't supposed to talk about it ( hah ) and that grandpa had his " calling and election made sure " .
I knew what that meant and was happy that Grandpa was guaranteed the highest degree of the celestial kingdom .
After a few minutes though I began to feel sad and confused .
This grandpa , my maternal grandpa , was very quiet and did n't really talk to us kids .
We were never allowed to touch anything other than toys in his house as my mom would recount how grandpa used to scold them as kids if they ever put their hands on the walls .
I liked him , but he was very distant and unfriendly ( and wealthy ) .
I do n't recall having any fun with him ever .
My paternal grandfather , however was my hero and friend did all the stereotypical grandpa / grandkid stuff .
He was warm and funny and gave us all his attention .
He was a convert and had become less active and drank tea , in short , he was n't in nearly the same standing in the Mormon God 's eyes as my maternal grandfather .
And that 's what bothered me .
The cold , gruff , unfriendly grandpa was going to heaven and the warm , fun , giving grandpa 's eternal salvation was at stake because he did n't often go to church and drank tea .
Another related incident about the second anointing occurred while I was dating my wife .
My dad seemed to think I was better than her because her family was n't Mormon ( she was a convert ) and that this obvious misfortune needed to be pointed out to her .
She had come to my parents house with one of her girlfriends to visit me .
Something she did or said must have made him upset so he decided to have her and her friend sit down to tell us something important .
I had no idea what was coming , but this is what he said to the best of my memory : " Girls , sit down .
I want to tell you about something so sacred that you can't repeat it . "
He looked at my future - wife and said , " you need to know the stock ( old cowboy word for ' ancestry ' ) my son comes from .
A couple years ago his grandpa was taken into the temple and had his feet washed by an Apostle !
Just like Jesus and the apostles of old .
He had his calling and election made sure .
That 's the type of stock he comes from . "
He left it at that .
I do n't recall anyone saying anything and slowly we all got up and resumed doing whatever we were doing before , but it makes me so mad looking back that he tried to use that experience to help her understand her ' place ' in the world .
My dad had no problem with status as he was , surprisingly , also a racist .
But that 's a story for another time .
Why a colonoscopy is better than an endowment session
09/02/2014 - by Brother Of Jerry and others at Recovery from Mormonism
1 . It only takes one day to become sufficiently clean and pure .
2 . They give you drugs that cause a veil of forgetfulness .
3 . It does n't require 10 % of your income for life .
4 . No creepy old men with bad breath .
5 . Only one piece of ridiculous clothing .
6 . No weird hand shakes .
7 . Full disclosure beforehand .
8 . You get a nifty video .
9 . Do n't normally have to do it before age 50 .
10 .
Once ever ten years is usually often enough .
11 . A colonoscopy may actually save your life .
12 . You 're allowed to talk about it afterwards .
13 .
They take pictures inside that you can have as a souvenir and to remember the good times with , not to mention sharing with your friends .
14 .
That prep is hell , but at least crap goes out .
In the endowment crap gets shoved in your head .
15 .
The colonoscopy folks tell you to fart when it 's over !
Come to think of it , a resounding farewell fart at the end of the endowment might be a terrific celebratory touch .
Add just the right note , you know ?
16 , You are allowed to talk about it afterword .
17 . You KNOW what the doctor will do !
I did n't know what the creepy veil worker would do or any of the other creepy things , i.e. touchy feely , circle chants , covenant my life to TSCC ( The So Called Church .
18 . The end justifies the means .
And vice versa .
19 .
And all truth about your colon is circumscribed into one great hole .
20 . Colonoscopy has for its purpose the prevention and removal of cancerous growth ( polyps ) .
Endowment 's purpose is to implant the cancer of deceptive mormon ideas .
This will grow and eventually eliminate the life force of the participant .
21 . Either way you get a good reaming .
22 . Either way , you have to bend over to get screwed from behind .
23 .
The endowment is painful to endure .
Colonoscopy , not so much .
Re : All the praise for the Gilbert Arizona LDS Temple 02/18/2014 - by azcrazy
Had a TBM ( True Believing Mormon ) relative go through the special dignitary tour with various non member AZ State and city leaders a few week ago .
When they all got to the sealing room the tour guide pointed to the alter and said " this is where the marriage is consummated . "
It was n't until they got out to the hall that my relative caught up to him and whispered in his ear " did n't you mean to say " consecrated ? ? "
It was too late , many in the group had already wandered off ahead and did not hear the correction .
So you can only image what the non LDS are thinking now !
LMFAO !
To the temple again .
This time they let me keep my underwear !
05/02/2010 - by Nightingale from Recovery from Mormonism
Last week I took myself and my tight jeans , pink panties and polka dot socks to Open House at the newest Mormon temple in Langley , B.C. , Canada .
I was n't sure if I really wanted to go back to the temple so I waited til the last weekend and then the looming deadline of eternal closure to the great unwashed lured me in .
Thirty - three million dollars buys you a nice building on a big plot of land in an expensive spot on the planet .
Five million more gets you a new meeting house , an outbuilding or two and an attractive ( yet relatively modest ) pad for the Misson President .
The gardens ai n't shabby either .
Smiling Mormon women in navy blue jackets , white blouses and long skirts and Mormon men ( not so smiley ) in the trademark white shirts conducted tours of about 30 people a time .
First we were led into the chapel where smiling sister missionaries thanked us for " coming to celebrate the temple with us " .
Uh no .
I was n't there to celebrate the temple .
I was just having a nose - around while the doors were open .
I noticed there were no male missionaries , at least none involved in conducting tours .
Maybe they 're too frisky and risky to trust with non-members . :)
Whenever you enter a Mormon building as a non-mo , the video machine is sure to be primed and sure enough we were a captive audience for a 12 - minute presentation giving a rundown on the purpose of the temple , local history relating to Mormons in B.C. , BKP ( I think ) explaining that Mormonism is " not a re-invention but a re-storation " , JRH blubbing about heaven not being heaven unless his wife and kids are there with him , and maybe TSM saying what , I can't remember .
( It 's scary to me that I still know those guys ' middle initials ! )
The video showed the temple rooms while it outlined the Plan of Salvation , the Pre-Existence and baptisms for the dead which the narrator referred to as " acts of love " .
In the video there was a preponderance of Asian and Spanish members making comments in their own languages with a translator 's voice overlaid .
I noticed that no caption stated that we were listening to a translation ( but I could hear the original voices faintly underneath the translator 's words ) .
I assumed they made the video for the local area to include some of the predominant ethnic groups here and also the B.C. - related history " to show the strength and history of the B.C. Church " .
The first Mormons arrived in January 1897 .
This I did not know .
The narrator said that in March 1902 B.C. " became part of the Mormon northwest area " .
There were 52 people at the first meeting ( not far off the average attendance at your typical SM here - just kidding ! )
A couple sitting behind me said " oh please " a couple of times during the video .
It made me laugh to think they might be exmos but I lost track of them and did n't ask ( it may have been a bit rude anyway ) .
After the video we were led along a garden path ( hehe ) to a couple of women volunteers who had pulled the most important duty , that of putting paper booties on our feet over our footwear .
They bent right down and served us by slipping on the booties , not what I had expected .
I quipped , " Oooh , good thing I put on clean socks " .
They laughed heartily .
I was trying to keep a low profile , not engage with anyone , not mention I am a former member , not be memorable , not break anything .
As soon as I saw the booties I blurted out " Oh , this is a much better idea than ripping out all the carpets and laying all new ones ! "
Then our guide asked me , " Are you a member ? " I just shook my head .
At the temple we had a guide and a couple of followers , sheep - herding us through the tour , keeping us together , always a Mormon behind us and to either side , in addition to the tour guide .
I guess they do need to be security conscious and avoid accidents and incidences .
Our tour guide as we filed into the temple foyer told us , " Look up " ( she points up ) , " Look down " ( she points down ) and " Look around " ( she gestures around ) .
On the way out I heard the next guide saying , " Look up " ...
It made me laugh .
The guide spoke of " Restored Christianity " , a term I have n't heard them use before ( as with my post a few weeks back in which I mentioned a new term for dead baptisms - " ancestral baptism " - or at least I 'd never heard that term before ) .
I thought it is " Restored Gospel " but for the temple tour at least it was " Restored Christianity " .
That 'll get the Christians in the group onside all right !
Our guide mentioned many times at the desk in the temple foyer that " we must be worthy " to enter the temple .
They have NO CLUE how very strange indeed that sounds to outsiders and to Christians even more so - Mormons have to prove their worthiness , in an ongoing way , while Christians just plain believe " we 're not worthy " - Jesus is the worthy one .
She even said , on the third mention of worthiness , that " We have to prove to our local leaders that we are worthy " .
Again , a strange idea no matter which non-mo is hearing it .
The tour guide also mentioned " the Spirit " many , many times .
She did n't actually explain what that was and in her whispery sing - song voice and staring manner ( I guess prolonged eye contact with tour members ) it started to sound quite strange .
Christians usually refer to " the Holy Spirit " and maybe shorten it at times to " the Spirit " but she never said " Holy Spirit " or " Holy Spirit of God " , just " the Spirit " over and over , saying " We hope you feel the Spirit that we have here with us in the temple " .
" Listen and feel the Spirit " .
( I irreverently wondered how you could listen to feel something ) .
She also said that a lot in the temple is symbolic , but she did n't explain that either .
Even just one example would have been more helpful in understanding what she meant .
She said that the temple is " a place of kindness , love and light " where you feel " the serenity of heaven as you visit " .
I noted that the first picture you see as you enter the temple is Jesus Christ in " fisher of men " mode , a very familiar image to Christians .
The guide pointed to the picture and said " Jesus is our leader , our guide " .
If you 're trying to say " We 're Christian too " you miss it - again - with that type of comment .
Christians would say " He is our Saviour " , and then maybe guide , leader , etc after that , amongst all the other attributes .
I have read some comments here that the McTemple and its rooms look like a Marriott Hotel or other similar types of structures .
I have to say I thought it looked of far better quality than any hotel room I 've ever seen .
The leaded glass windows all around the building , the plush white carpet , the beautiful wood curving staircase , the chandeliers , the different styles of chairs with varying fabrics , designs and colours , the roomy and well - furnished change rooms , the original murals of B.C. nature scenes , the obvious best - of - everything all combined to make it a striking building , exterior and interior .
While it is a small size , you do n't notice that from the inside where it seems roomy , functional and attractive .
I read a quote recently that I can't quite remember or source about all the impressive and beautiful stone buildings erected for religion while people want and starve .
I agree with that sentiment .
The Langley Temple is an attractive building .
( Of course , eye - beholder ) .
But $ 38 M is a big bunch of moolah .
We saw the oxen ( yes , there are 12 ) and walked through the " instruction rooms " .
I finally figured out what they mean by that term that I had heard in their advertising and in the video but did n't realize it referred to the rooms where you watch the video about Adam and Eve and go through all the dressing in temple clothes , undressing , redressing , pray at the altar , etc .
They did n't mention the temple clothes , the women 's veils or the veil of the temple .
There was a high gold ruffled curtain on the front wall of the last instruction room which I guess was the veil or the veil was under that .
Only 38 people can go through a session at one time ( why not round it up to 40 says my OCD self ) .
The baptismal font is also very small , only meant for one at a time it looks like .
This is much different from the large pool at the Seattle temple , which is the only place I 've done dead dunks , if I 'm remembering it correctly .
We wandered through a sealing room ( a lot of white ! ) and the guide said that after this the couple is " ready for their beautiful day " .
No mention of temple clothes , W&A , endowments , etc .
Lots of chairs for friends and family .
No mention that only those deemed " worthy " would be there .
Then we were ushered into the Celestial Room and were told we should stay there a while so we could " feel the Spirit that is here " .
Despite their best efforts , the Mormon families with all their infants and toddlers lost control of their kids at this point and it was very noisy in there !
This degenerate apostate laughed again .
First , this was the LONGEST time I had ever been permitted to stay in a CR ( over 10 minutes ) and the noisiest I had experienced .
Finally the guides came and whisked some of the young un 's out into the hallway but the Spirit was n't happy as it did n't show up ( unless apostates just can't feel it ? )
One woman in the CR was teary - eyed ( maybe it was her kids making so much noise ? ! )
The rest were not feeling it and the tear ducts remained off .
I saw one picture of Joseph Smith there - the new and improved version where he looks modern , young and attractive .
The other pictures I saw were of Jesus and local nature scenes ( actual paintings - I touched them to see if they were prints ) .
There were some I did n't see - we did n't go everywhere and there was n't much time for hanging about eyeballing every corner .
I must say that even having gone through the temple quite a few times as a member , and quite a few different temples ( Seattle , SLC , Jordan River , Alberta / Canada , Arizona ) it did n't seem all that familiar to me .
Maybe I 'm really , really OUT !
After we 'd completed the temple tour we were led back to the ward building to the cultural hall / overflow area / gym for water and big cookies .
There was a wall display of all the talking points , almost word for word what the tour guide had spieled off .
I guess she had just memorized the plaques .
I also noted that they used American spelling .
Ha .
So much for trying to blend in .
In this room were the old familiar pictures of Joseph Smith , with his long nose and chubby cheeks .
I would have been a total brat to ask innocently why the discrepancy .
I ducked out to wander the hallways of the most attractive ward building * I* have seen , roomy , modern , new , all mod cons laid on .
I peeked into the Volunteer Room and saw in plain view on the board the instructions for the tour guides :
Be Flexible
Be Calm
Smile
Bear Testimony
Actually , we did n't get frank testimony .
Lots of smiling but no " I know " stuff .
I found the guides friendly and helpful .
My mom was with me .
She has a bad leg and they started from the time we drove in to run and help her navigate and offer wheelchair , elevator and other assistance .
Mom met the missionaries back in the day when I was " investigating " and she really liked them .
She was very disappointed to trip over their clay feet when I got involved in helping a sister missionary whose companion was abusive .
Between this and other experiences , Mom went from being impressed with these " great young people " to concluding " they 're just like everyone else " , a bit of a downer for her .
But I digress .
The water was refreshing .
The cookies were flavourful .
The buildings and grounds were attractive .
The people were helpful , friendly , and obviously enjoying their volunteer duty , showing the non-members around their beautiful place .
I predict there will be an uptick in tithing and obedience and hence member temple attendance .
I 'm sure having a temple in their own back yard will motivate the locals .
It must be more excitement than they 've had since GBH rode into town back in the '90s .
It was interesting to me to go into a Mormon temple again , this time as an observer .
I was so happy , though , as I drove off that I had n't attended for ritual purposes , getting all sweaty from the annoying clothes - changing , left , right , left , right , not to mention the heavy veil covering head and face , during the endowment sessions , and all the up / down , up / down , left / right , shake / sit , file out , etc ( oh my aching head ) .
I was feeling clear - headed this time , not full of confusion and questions as on my previous temple trips .
That was also a relief .
I spied a lone protester in the parking lot , carrying a cardboard cross with the words " Boast only in the Lord " on it ( translation : I think BACs push that scripture as they feel that Mormons boast about their temples , which is obviously " not Christian " in light of the " boast only " scripture , according to the BAC interpretation ) .
Then there was another protester a little further on , holding up a sign that said merely " MRM.com " ( I think - I was driving at the time ) .
I have n't had a chance to check that out - I have no clue what it means .
So , I was glad I went .
I would have been too curious if I 'd missed the chance .
I was surprised it was so close ( on the same block ) as the ward building I used to attend .
It 's altogether in a different place than I was expecting .
Well , I attended that ward building a couple of times as an investigator , with my True Believing Mormon friends .
It was the site of my appallingly upsetting Mormon baptism , after which they told me I could n't go to church there any more as I was in the " wrong " ward .
That was the first time I had heard of the ward boundaries rule .
It led to me not going to the new ward after I was baptized and the mishies had to come around and do the whole conversion effort again .
Yeah .
I went for it - twice !
I was also vastly relieved to be driving off still wearing my own little pink panties .
That did n't happen the first time I went to a Mormon temple !
Mother - in - law's Spirit in the Los Angeles Temple 04/20/2010 - by Job's Daughter
My sister - in - law married my husband 's brother a couple of years before my husband and I got married .
We all got married in the LA temple .
She said that the spirit of my husband 's dead mother was so strong , everyone could feel her presence there .
His mother had died a couple of years earlier while her husband was on his mission and of course he was n't allowed to come home for the illness or funeral .
When I married my husband I expected to feel something similar , right ?
Afterall , same temple , a couple of years later , and I 'm totally TBM ( True Believing Mormon ) .
However , it was a terrible experience .
I hated the temple .
The naked washing and anointing , cutting the throat and bowels , and all the masonic symbolism .
I had been in Job 's Daughters and could n't understand why so much of the ceremony was the same .
( Before internet and Jospeh Smith / Masons link ) .
This put a big chink in my testimony and within a few years I was out of the LDS Church for good .
The missing point of fellowship
03/02/2010 - by Beavis Christ and others from Recovery from Mormonism
One of the things taken out in the 1990 changes to the temple was the five points of fellowship , one of the clearly copied aspects of the Masonic ceremony .
Does anyone here recall after 1990 ever running into anyone who missed having them after they were taken out ?
Seems to me some of the old farts who go to the temple a lot would have complained about it because they were used to it .
I have to wonder that the perpetually changing nature of the ceremonies has caused some Mormons to leave the church just as taking out the nude touching during the " initiatory work " probably has kept some in .
FIVE points of fellowship listed - Baura
From the endowment ceremony here ( with numbers added ) is the Mormon description :
1. Inside of right foot by the side of right foot ,
2 . Knee to knee ,
3 . Breast to breast ,
4 . Hand to back , and
5 . Mouth to ear .
Here is the Masonic meaning of the five points :
1 . We are instructed to go by foot to answer the needs of others , but more especially that of a Brother Freemason .
2 . We find the power of prayer , especially prayer directed for the benefit of a fallen Brother .
3 . We are reminded of the responsibility of trust .
Holding in our heart the secrets of our Brother Freemason is a sacred responsibility .
4 . We are charged to support the character of our Brother , either before his face or behind his back .
5 . We are encouraged to give wise counsel to our Brother Freemason and to support him in his time of need .
" Thus the Five Pointed Star reminds us to extend love and affection to our Brother Freemasons , doing for each of them as we would wish done for each of us .
Each point carries an important lesson and responsibility found within the teachings of the Third Degree .
Never forget that five - pointed ritual and the bonds that unite us into a sacred band of friend and brothers who strive to emulate the love of the Supreme Grand Architect of the Universe . "
those goofy five points of fellowship through the veil - SuzieQ # 1
I as a female I did n't miss those goofy five points of fellowship through the veil , when we had to do that contortionist routine with a stranger with a sheet between us .
I was glad to see it go !
Yes , some of the execution and dialog of the temple ceremony rituals have changed many times over the years .
To the believer , it 's just part of " Modern Day Revelation " as a core element of the LDS teachings to the Plan of Salvation .
Much of Mormonism falls in the category of : ours is not to wonder why , ours is to do or die ! :-)
From " The Charge of the Light Brigade " By Alfred Tennyson
The point is that they follow orders or get killed when they do n't .
What happens when they die ?
- Beavis Christ
What happens to the True Believing Mormons ( True Believing Mormons ) who were told this was the true way to do things when they got their endowments before 1990 ?
Does that mean that when they die , they have to do the 5 points but if someone who went through 1st time after 1990 does not ?
Yet another area where Mormonism simply makes no sense !
I discovered one of those missing points of fellowship - flattopSF
I learned that there can be some truly soul - searching moments regarding personal motivation while standing at the veil , when a 900 - year - old pervert 's putrescent claw clutches at your 19 - year - old pulchritude and drags you forward into the Sixth Point of Fellowship Grip / Grope .
You KNOW what that Sixth Point is as he slathers and wheezes and exudes breath that would have curdled the blood of the Medusa .
Gah !
Wait a minute - MŒrv FrŒndsen
You mean I was taught the absolutely necessary five points to get through the veil into the glory of the Celestial Kingdom , and then they * went away * ???!!
Did anyone remember to tell the celestial angels guarding God from the unworthy ??
Well what about the other signs and tokens ?
Will they just go away too ?
Next thing you 'll be telling me they did n't mean that cross - my - heart - and - hope - to - die - before - I - tell throat slitting and disembowling stuff .
c
No wonder people are posting stuff on the Internet if all the threats of grisly death are gone .
What kind of an operation is this ?
You got a sixth point of fellowship - NormaRae
Well , if you 're trying to get the insides of your foot together while making sure you 're feeling each other 's knees and you can't figure out what you 're doing wrong because you feel something poking your thigh , and then realize it probably WASN'T the Lard 's other knee .
Well , I guess that makes you x -tra speshul cause you got a sixth point of fellowship .
Last year someone at work asked me about the Big Love episode where Barb is going through the veil .
She said it was the most bizarre thing she 'd ever seen and wanted me to tell her it was all fictional and we did n't really do that thinking it had something to do with God .
I told her that not only was it absolutely truthful , and not only did I do that , but told her the rest of the story -- about the " points . "
She just looked at me and said , " I think it 's a cult . "
I was like , " Ya think ? ? "
The " proverbial straw " for me - Travis
After 35 years of being BIC from pioneer stock , attending four years of seminary , serving a forgein mission , & serving in virtually every calling in the ward including the Bishopric ... the changing of the temple ceremony was the " proverbial straw " for me .
Everlasting , never - changing gospel like Hell !
After suffering through countless hours of discussions with " non-members " about the racist no blacks in the priesthood doctrine on my mission .. ol '
Spencer changed that too !
I left in 1991 ... never to go back .
I do n't miss grazing at all with the LDS sheep that sleep !
Speaking of actors , I burst out laughing during the temple movie 12/07/2009 by forestpal
When I spotted some of my BYU ski buddies , playing angels , in the background of the Celestial Kingdom shot .
They were from California , blonde , blue - eyed , good looking , and tan .
As Mormons IRL ( one was not ) , they were not very reverent , and would ski with a flask , and on Sundays , and would often take the Lord 's name in vain -- but as celestial beings , they had that glow !
Brother Whitaker asked to be in a BYU movie , and I asked how much they would pay me .
He said they never pay their actors .
I did get cornered into a BYU promotional movie , with some of the class officers , for a visual to accompany voice - overs .
We were all dressed up , after a special luncheon in the student center , and we were directed to smile , and act very friendly to some ( nicely - dressed ) newcomers .
I said , " Would n't it be more realistic if Ann and I sneered at the girls and stood between them and our guys ? "
Notice , it is the fad now for these people to be " ethnic " , in order to give the cult a more world - wide appearance .
Did you notice the cast of the televised New Year 's Eve youth extravaganza in the great and spacious building in SLC ?
The entire audience was white and delightsome , and the only dark - skinned kids were the performers .
And the one black kid in the audience that the camera kept panning to .
All this hype ( strategic emotional advertising that stimulates response ) is so over - the - top sappy , that my children would groan out loud .
I do n't think people fall for this as much as they used to .
Remember those old phone company ads , and the Hallmark ads ?
Very old - fashioned and hackneyed !

Marijuana Temple Trip
10/26/2009 - by stillgettingbetter
I have a family member who is a temple worker and she has health problems which cause a lot of pain .
She has tried lots of medicines without much luck .
That particular side of the family is very pro-legalization of drugs , libertarian and almost bordering on anarchist .
( yes I know - weird huh ? )
Anyway , we were chatting one day about how pot might help her and she said " Yeah it might even make the temple sessions more interesting "
I swear I 'm not making this up .
lol

Waste of orange carpet
10/26/2009 - by Gullible 's Travels
The washington DC was my favorite old style temple and Houston was the only McTemple I actually like , though not to set foot in it ever again .
The part that bugs me the most is how many living people could have been fed , clothed , cured , etc. for the cost of just on e those " cadaver clubs " where ( by their own theology ) those ' serviced ' may or may not actually accept the ordinance !
What a waste of human energy , orange carpet , movie theatre seating , and white fabric !
Did n't we look pretty in our temple robes ?
10/26/2009 - by picture perfect exmo
Last week , we were in a family resort that had a swimming pool .
At the reception , you could get a bathrobe to wear on the premises .
They were plain white .
One time , the four of us were standing in an elevator , all wearing our ugly , long bathrobes and I happened to look in the mirror .
I said to DH : " Look , we 're looking every bit as handsome as we used to look in the temple . "
He pulled out a green bottle of shampoo , held it in front of his crotch and said : " Now the illusion is complete ! "
This is what True Believing Mormon 's ( True Believing Mormons ) think is a super spiritual experience
10/25/2009 - by Gorspel Dacktrin
When I finally concluded that the LDS church was most definitely not a healthy belief system , I stopped going to church meetings and temple sessions , etc .
Needless to say , my devout Mormon relatives thought there was something wrong with me that needed to be fixed .
Looking back now I have gained some helpful perspective by realizing that when I left , most of my True Believing Mormon relatives considered the following activity to be the highlight of each month and perhaps even of their entire lifetime , if their hyperbolic effusions concerning their temple experiences are to be believed :
On a monthly or more frequent basis they would slip into some long underwear that their Church sold to them , drive an hour to a building that they called the " temple " ( and which reminded the locals of the big building in the Wizard of Oz ) and then go into the temple and get dressed up in white polyester jumpsuits .
( First they had to show the " temple " receptionist a card that was proof that some guy who called himself a " bishop " ( when he was actually a medical supply salesman ) was satisfied that they had behaved themselves well enough that they deserved to have access to the temple fun . )
The climax of the event was to then go into a room where , for the several hundredth time , they practiced giving each other odd handshakes , while chanting in unison about what the handshakes were called , after which they then made pantomime throat - slitting and disembowelment motions while chanting in unison that this is how they would be slaughtered if they told anybody else what the names of the handshakes were .
Then they would go up to a big gauzy polyester sheet hanging from the ceiling , stick their hands through holes in the sheet and embrace some mystery guy on the other side .
They made a point of also making firm knee - to - knee contact with the mystery guy behind the sheet .
They even had a special name for this embrace .
They called it the " five points of fellowship . "
After this , they would pass through the sheet and the mystery guy to go into a room that looked like a funky hotel lobby , where they would meditate for about 3 - 5 minutes about what they had just done on the other side of the sheet .
Later , they would tell other people that what they had done in the temple was too special and sacred to talk about .
And my Mormon relatives think I 'm the one whose abnormal and nuts because I rejected all that fun .
Women manage to avoid one of the vilest things in all of Mormonism : the urinals in the temples .
03/31/2009 - by Mujun and others
I have traveled to twenty - one countries on four continents .
I have used the john in a lot of places where living standards and cultural attitudes about hygiene and cleanliness differ greatly from those of my home .
I have never experienced anything more disgusting in any restroom than the urinals in the Mormon temples .
All the men here who have been to the temple know exactly what I mean .
You ’re on your way out of the dressing room for yet another hour and forty - five minutes of ritual drudgery .
You ’re wearing ill - fitting white polyester pants , tight , thin , ribbed white socks and white , terry - cloth slippers .
You figure you should take a leak one last time while you still have a chance .
You step into the restroom , but you ’re still several feet from the urinals when you realize something is very , very wrong .
Pee is everywhere .
It ’s all around the periphery of the urinal .
It ’s on the walls .
It ’s in puddles on the floor .
What little of it made it into the urinal has n’t been flushed .
You wonder how close you can stand before those terry - cloth slippers start sopping it up .
It ’s not just the abundance of urine far beyond its intended receptacle ; it ’s also the color thereof .
Those really old guys who ca n’t see or aim worth a damn also have n’t peed clear pale yellow in decades .
There ’s a reason why you notice the pee from several feet away .
It ’s almost orange .
Nothing makes you feel like you ’re in a sacred place quite like having to step around puddles of orange piss .
I no longer have a personal stake in whether Mormon temples have disgusting men ’s rooms .
If any active , temple - attending Mormons are reading this , however , I suggest that the solution might be found in this nursing home joke I heard about ten years ago .
“ Have you heard that nursing homes are using Viagra these days ?
They give the old guys a half a Viagra tablet in the morning , and a whole Viagra tablet at night .
The half tablet in the morning is to keep them from peeing on their shoes .
The whole tablet at night is to keep them from rolling out of bed . ”
Thus spake Mujun .
Peeing in temple clothes - Kim
I can well imagine that some old geezer might have to go pretty bad after a long temple session .
Once in the bathroom , there are so many layers of robes , sashes , apron , pants , garments , etc. to get through , that he may not make it and end up peeing his pants .
Maybe they should install urinals in the Celestial Room ... either that or God may find piss on his shoes while he 's doing the hokey - pokey with some old guy thru the veil .
Yeah , I 've seen gas station restrooms that were cleaner than the ones in temples .
- Helamonster
I do n't recall ever believing that an Arco station was the House of the Lord , though .
Yeah , Verily The Cabbie Doth Prophesy - SL Cabbie
That when copies of ex-Elder Mujan 's accurate reporting filter up through the geriatic cubicles at # 50 and # 47 East there will be a gnashing of dentures and word will be handed down that such vile scenes described must be rendered white and delightsome once again .
Praise the Lard and pass the Pine - sol .
Urinal Physics - beeblequix
A normal person has the ability to pull up , open , unroll , aim and fire .
A significant demographic of Temple attendees are n't exactly " in shape " ( I know : round IS a shape but I equivocate ... ) .
That extra 200 lbs hanging out around the midsection of the average Temple attendee simply changes the probabilities of urine - in - the - urinal success .
What was once a stop , drop & go ends up being a convoluted menagerie of guesswork , farting , near misses , complete misses and absolute avoidance of washing their hands .
Add cataracts and a male appendage the size of one of those tiny , burned , overcooked french fries into the mix and it just can't end well ...
Huge yellow stain - Ilona
The only thing I vividly remember from my temple wedding was the HUGE yellow stain on the guys pants who was performing the sacred temple wedding ceremony .
Had a really hard time concentrating on anything else and had to keep averting my eyes to keep from busting out laughing .
That old geezer needed more than training in how to use a urinal ... he needed to learn to do his laundry !
Low on hydraulic power - síóg
Just yesterday I was reading an unrelated article that discusses the physics of urinals .
Or , perhaps , pissing matches .
Michael Osinski writes in New York Magazine ( “ My Manhattan Project : How I helped build the bomb that blew up Wall Street , ” Mar 29 , 2009 ) :
“ Now that I was spending more time on the [ investment house trading ] floor , I wondered why the men ’s room always stank .
Then one afternoon at three , when I was in there taking a leak , I discovered the hideous truth .
Traders had a contest .
Coming in at eight , they never left their desks all day , eating and drinking while working .
Then , at three o’clock , they marched into the men ’s room and stood at the wall opposite the urinals .
Dropping their pants , they bet $ 100 on who could train his stream the longest on the urinals across the lavatory .
As their hydraulic pressure waned , the three traders waddled , pants at their ankles , across the floor , desperately trying to keep their pee on target .
This is what $ 2 million of bonus can do to grown men . ”
Maybe the temple goers are just low on hydraulic power .
" Big Love " temple episode PROVES the Book of Mormon ! - 03/10/2009 - by Richard Packham
The showing of secret temple ceremonies and secret clothing is a fulfillment of the Book of Mormon prophecy at 2 Nephi 30:17 , which says that in the last days " there is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed ... "
( See also Luke 12:2 . )
Mormons should be thrilled at this confirmation of their sacred scriptures .
And Jesus must be packing his bags right now for the return trip to earth !
C'mon ... The Mormons are just embarassed ... - 03/10/2009 - by gemini
at the silly costumes and handshakes that will be shown on HBO .
No matter how much the True Believing Mormon 's ( True Believing Mormons ) talk about " sacred rituals " they secretly know how stupid it is going to look to their co-workers and neighbors .
Take away the secrecy of it all and the temples will lose their mystery .
I was embarrassed on my wedding day ... by westcoaster
wearing that hideous outfit while those we invited to the temple were in street clothes .
It just emphasized how awful that costume covering my beautiful wedding dress was .
The worst part was trying to stifle a giggle every time I looked at my very good - looking almost - husband in that Pillsbury Doughboy hat .
I had laughed aloud the first time I saw him in it a week before when I did the endowment gig .
I felt bad for laughing at how he looked but it so startled me that the laugh escaped before I could stop it .
He said he had laughed the first time he saw his dad in temple garb , so I was off the hook .
The piece de resistance was the very deep , red mark the baker 's hat left on his forehead that is forever preserved in our wedding pictures taken after the ceremony .
The good news is I do n't ever look at those pictures since I divorced him .
The point of this story is that I have no doubt the endowed will be embarrassed by the outing of the outfit because I was mortified to be seen in it even when it was by people who had been dressed more than once in the very same outfit .
I 'm not sure how it is now or if every experience is different depending on the old temple - helper - broad ( referred to as OTHB for the rest of this post ) " assisting " the bride , but this was my experience .
I chose to wear my wedding dress , but I 'm told some women just wear the shapeless white " dress " that all women wear for endowment sessions .
Next , the OTHB assessed the modesty of my dress .
It was a very modest cut , although extremely form - fitting .
It was long - sleeved and no plunging neckline , but it did have a v-shaped plunge in the back that covered the garment top and was NOT immodest by anyone 's standards but the OTHB .
She hauled out white cloth squares ( picture hankies , but not that nice ) of various sizes and proceeded to shove one down the back of my dress and then pinned it to the my shoulders to ensure the naughty , naughty patch of skin on my back was covered .
She had razor sharp fingernails and left a scrape mark on my back that was still showing hours later .
My dress was long - sleeved , but the OTHB decided as a precaution that she needed to stuff a smaller white square up each sleeve .
I guess she was worried the sleeves of my dress might fall off or the men in the room would be so tantalized by my wrists that they would be having dirty thoughts during that thing they call a ceremony .
My mom was not allowed in the room with me because it was the OTHB 's job to assist me .
What should have been a peaceful , happy time for me was filled with the OTHB disgustedly ranting about how immodest other brides ' dresses were and how it was usually so much more work for HER to " make them modest " with the cloth squares .
She added a tsk - tsk about the back of my dress .
Next was the pleated robe that kept slipping on the satin part of my dress and snagging on the beaded part .
All the slipping meant the bow on the robe kept loosening .
If a bride had a poofy dress , the robe would have made her look like a marshmallow .
My dress had a straight skirt , so it still looked ugly , but it did n't make me look huge .
Next was the green ( not blue ) fig - leaf apron that added more slipping .
Under all of this were the garments and white hosiery and the fugly white slippers .
I was not allowed to wear the veil that went with my wedding dress but had to wear the temple veil with the big loopy bow tied under the chin that is beyond ugly .
My wedding dress could n't even be seen under all the layers , but it was my wedding day and I was damn well going to wear my wedding dress .
That was another reason I thought the cloth squares were absurd .
No one could have seen any skin that might be showing , but it 's the Morg way to focus on things that do n't matter .
To get an idea of the finished result , just look at the image above from " Big Love " in the temple garb .
Just picture the apron being bright green .
The men wear the same thing they wear for the endowment ceremony .
White shirt and white tie .
White pants and if they wear a belt , it must be white .
White socks and white slippers .
They also wear a white robe ( I think theirs is also pleated , but I do n't have a clear memory of it ) .
They also wear the bright green apron .
The ugliest part of the men's temple outfit is that gawdawful baker 's hat .
If I left something out or remembered incorrectly , I 'm sure someone will correct me .
BTW , because of the edict that no one is allowed to speak of the temple outside the temple , I has not been warned that I would be wearing that temple get - up OVER my dress or that my husband - to - be would be wearing the same outfit that had made me laugh aloud the week before .
Edit for clarification : I only found out when I removed my wedding dress from the bag and the OTHB tried to persuade me to wear a rented , white , polyester dress .
Color me clueless .
I kept wondering when the beautiful , special part of the temple wedding that all Mormon girls are promised was going to start .
I walked out of the temple with my new husband thinking , " THAT was it ? "
I vacillated between feeling duped and wondering if it did n't feel special because I was somehow unworthy .
I was so embarrassed by JennyAus
when we came outside after the wedding and my SIL asked my hubby , " Were you wearing a hat ? " the mark was still on his forehead .
I hated the temple clothing .
I was so embarrassed wearing garments at work when I first got married .
I wore short sleeved cardigans over my uniform so that no one would even see the outline on my back .
When I went to visit non mormon friends I never wore them .
I did n't want them to see the markings on my legs .
What about the big huge temple dress that made you look like you were pregnant .
Makes me shudder .
Embarrassed , and horrified .
The Mormon church OWES us a decent wedding ! - by Cali in Utah
I 've told non-Mormons about the temple , and they have n't believed me , until they saw for themselves on the Internet .
Even reading other posters ' experiences in the temple -- I know they 're telling the truth -- but it is more bizarre than anyone can even imagine .
" She had razor sharp fingernails and left a scrape mark on my back that was still showing hours later . "
And a scar your entire life .
I hope every temple couple renews their vows , in a lovely , meaningful FAMILY ceremony , out in nature somewhere .
That might help undo the damage .
Everything I know about Mormon temples - by 3X
( except the unappealing architecture ) has been learned at Recovery from Mormonism or on Richard Packham 's site .
Every time I see a picture of folks dressed up in The Garb , I 'm taken aback - and I wonder at the mechanisms that can convince a person that the silly is sacred , the ridiculous is holy , and that their " Creator " is somehow ' honored ' by nonsense .
Jeanne Tripplehorn in the TV Guide photo looks like she just walked off of a Star Wars set .
The OP is dead on : it 's fear of embarrassment that underlies the Mormon reaction to the Big Love temple episode - hell , I 'm embarrassed for them .
Los Angeles Temple and the Jewish Deli by crathes
1. I remember close to the Los Angeles temple was a Jewish Deli .
I was there one evening after work ( not after the temple ) when one of the old waitresses yelled , " Session 's out - here they come ! "
I did not immediately catch what she was saying , but then men in cheap suits and women in ugly dresses started walking in .
And , yes , the men still had the ugly red mark across the forehead .
Was this the mark of the beast ??
2 . When I got married , my wife bought a cheap , plain dress for the temple ( a regular temple dress ) , and then a nice wedding dress for photos and the reception .
Short sleeves , lower neck and back line , but still reasonably garment friendly .
Problem solved !
I am such an idiot ! - by rk
I was such a weirdo - I was actually excited and mostly enjoyed the temple at first .

Horrible .
Dancing in the Temple - From An Intimate Chronicle : The Journals of William Clayton - 04/09/2009 - by ken
Pages 248-249 ( re : dancing and partying in the temple after an endowment ceremony and temple wedding )
After the dancing , the following was put forward by President BY who invited " all those who were willing to covenant that they would keep themselves from mingling with the wicked to rise upon their feet , whereupon all rose up .
. . . .
" At about half past 2 o clock that it was time to quit and seek repose the whole company assented without a murmur , although many would have been glad to have continued the exercise longer .
" The sisters retired to the side rooms , and the brethren stretched themselves on the floor , or on the sofas and were all soon in the embraces of ' tired nature 's sweet restorer , balmy sleep , ' with the exception of the Bridegroom and Bride , and a few of their friends who , being unable to close their eyes in sleep , from the abundance of their joy , passed the short hours of the morning , in agreeable conversation in the office . . .

Washing and Anointing Ceremony in the Mormon Temple as I experienced it - 03/09/2009 - by anon
The following is how the Washing and Anointing Ceremony was carried out during the times I attended the temple from 1962 to 1990 when it was changed .
I have written extensively about these rituals prior to the change , ( as have many others ) and am happy to know that our fellow Mormon human beings will no longer be subjected to this ritual .
Now , I am told , as of about a year or so ago , the tunic is sewed up at the sides , and the naked body is no longer touched and anointed with water and oil .
Hopefully , we all had a hand in seeing this ritual discontinued in our efforts to " give back " to humanity , especially our Mormon friends and loved ones .
These are some of my memories of the Washing and Anointing Ceremony in the Temple .
( All of these rituals are easily accessed on the Internet , also ) I have attended nine temples from 1962 to 1995 , eight of them in the US and one in Switzerland , doing hundreds of " sessions " as they are called .
You enter a small stall , and sit on a cold marble type slab .
The female temple worker doing the washing and anointing stands behind and to the side of you and starts with the top of the head , the forehead , the eyes , nose , mouth , breast , bowels , legs..etc .
She has a little spigot she gets water from that drips slowly .
The oil is done in the same fashion .
There are promises given , with each part of the body that is washed - dabbed with water and anointed - dabbed with oil .
These have to do with promising the female that she will be a priestess to her husband in the Celestial Kingdom if she is faithful to her covenants .
Nothing untoward , or of a sexual nature is done , but it is just very , very ethically and culturally out of order .
How anyone can equate that to something spiritual still amazes me .
I can still see the rows of tiny , narrow lockers where we completely undressed and donned the sheet - tunic , carrying our long garments into the little cubical where the old lady awaited me .
One of the oddest things about the temple is that the lockers have keys , so in the whispered ambiance of the temple , one of the only sounds heard is the soft jingling of the keys attacked with a safety pin to your clothing ..
Now back to the tunic .
This is a true tunic - open at the sides and no seams .
To walk in and out of the washing and anointing room , most people hold the sheets together .
I can still see , hear and feel and smell those old women .
The were like a grandma dressed in a white uniform , false teeth clacking , chewing a breath mint .
I could feel her breath and smell the aroma of the mints as she whispered in my ear reaching under the sheet with those warm , sweaty , damp hands sliding over here and over there , anointing me first with dabs of water from head to toe , then going the same thing with oil .
I can still hear the water trickling from the tiny spigot that she put her hands into to begin the anointing .
I can still hear the sing - song monotone of her memorized washing and anointing dialogue .
This ritual is not just a tiny tap on an imaginary dot of the skin .
Your body is stroked in a 2 " to 3 " area in a downward motion over specific areas of your body from your head on down to your legs and onto to your toes .
You do not know exactly where they will touch you .
You only know the general area .
It is very uncomfortable as these women are usually older - retirement age of 65 to 75 and their head is outside the sheet .
They can not see where they hands are unless they look under the tunic where the sides are open .
They open the sheet on the sides to begin .
Imagine a woman's hand under the sheet ( for women - man for men ) each time they say a body part , makin
In the last decade , there ’s been a major trend of individuals crossing America ’s northern border into Canada to get their medical prescriptions fulfilled for less than they would have in the United States .
Canada ’s health care system negotiates directly with prescription drug companies to get their citizens more affordable medications and many Americans have taken advantage of that , legally or otherwise .
Fortunately , there are now plenty of ways to get affordable prescription drugs in the United States because of increased market competition and lower costs because of online fulfillment .
A number of different retailers ( and their online counterparts ) are offering generic drugs for practically nothing .
Both Wal - Mart and Target ’s electronic storefronts will allow you to fulfill a 30 day supply of selected generic drugs for $ 4.00 or get a 90 day supply for just $ 10.00 .
Kmart is offering a 3 month supply of generic drugs for $ 15.00 .
One online pharmacist , called Publix , is even offering 14 day supplies of certain antibiotics for completely free .
There ’s another website called Rxaminer that will allow you to enter all of your prescriptions for a $ 10.00 fee and then let you know of alternative generic brands of the same medicine that would be available for a lot less money .
Sometimes you will need to call the doctor back to get the prescription changed , but if you are on a medication for an extended period of time , the $ 10.00 fee will be well worth it .
There are two new discount programs for low - income seniors to save money on prescription drugs as well .
Eli Lilly offers a “ LillyAnswers ” discount card which will provide low - income senior adults with 30 day supplies of some of their retail drugs , such as Prozac and Vista for just $ 12.00 a month .
The discount card is offered at most major pharmacies , but a married couple must make under $ 24,000 per year to qualify .
GlaxoSmithKline is also offering what they call the “ Orange Card ” which is available for couples earning less than $ 35,000 per year .
This program is still in development , so you ’ll want to check with their website as they roll it out .
Both Wisconsin and Minnesota allow their citizens to import prescription drugs from Canada .
Each state has a list of approved Canadian pharmacies that their citizens can legally and safely order prescription drugs from .
The prices their citizens pay are extremely competitive because of Canada ’s negotiating power with prescription drug companies .
Finally , remember to ask your doctor if there ’s a generic equivalent that might be more affordable .
Doctors typically do not know the cost of fulfilling any given prescription , so if the price comes back much higher than you can afford , call up your doctor , and see if there are any alternatives that might be less expensive .
Investigations are still underway into Friday 's deadly police shooting in downtown Vancouver , B.C .
Someone called 911 to report a vehicle theft in progress .
Two suspects left the scene shortly after .
An unidentified man in his 50s was later stopped by police investigating the theft as a possible suspect and was then shot following a confrontation .
Tasers were not an option as the two female officers involved were not carrying the stun guns .
" I saw the police approach him and I saw him approach them , and they backed up a little bit and he approached them a little bit , and then they shot him -- that was it , " said witness Devon Cunliffe .
Meanwhile , witness Adam Smolcic claims he made a video of the incident that was later erased .
" I heard , I believe , three or four shots and the gentleman fell to the ground , " said Smolcic .
He said as he filmed the incident on his cell phone another officer approached him .
" He asked me if I was filming .
I said ' yeah . ' he asked to see my phone ... he had my phone for about four or five minutes , [ and ] when he returned my phone he told me to get lost , " said Smolcic .
" I walked back up Homer Street there and I checked in my phone and there was no video . "
Police , for their part , have identified 50 witnesses .
What people saw at the shooting scene will play a key role in the investigation .
" We know that the suspect advanced on the officers with the extended blade of an exacto knife and did not comply with orders to drop the knife , " Vancouver Police Department spokesperson Jana McGuinness .
" I can't comment on what has occurred so far in the investigation , but I can say if anyone has evidence , that 's important evidence it's our job to secure it protect it and bring it in to the investigation , " said VPD police chief Jim Chu .
" It would be not proper to destroy any evidence and if this happened then we would look into it , obviously . "
Smolcic says he plans on enlisting a data retrieval service to try and restore the deleted video .
As for the investigation , autopsy results are expected Monday .
Police said an outside force would be called in to investigate , and the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner will provide civilian oversight .
Police say they wo n't release the man 's name until his family has been notified .
With a report by CTV British Columbia 's Maria Weisgarber and files by The Canadian Press .
This is a video of shootout that happened a few days ago ( the same day the international bridge into America was blocked in Reynosa ) , that Yasha Levine sent along , asking me to decipher what the hell is going on .
Well , let me tell you that this is some great stuff .
I had n’t seen this particular video myself until he sent it along , but I definitely did hear about the gun battle it captured so beautifully .
How could I not ?
Up to 10 people were killed in shootout that lasted something like three hours .
In the video , it ’s funny how the news correspondent says that this is an armed battle between federal forces and , hesitating for a second , he goes on to say “ organized crime . ”
Ha ha !
Come on !
Everybody knew the cops were battling it out with the zetas as soon as they heard about the shootout , even before we found out it took place in Reynosa .
No one will dare talk shit about the zetas .
That ’s how shit scared the media is in Tamaulipas .
This particular fight was the result of a mixed operation by the Army and Federales against a cell of zetas that was intercepted along with its leader .
The whole thing quickly turned into a running gun fight like you see in crappy Hollywood action movies .
Zetas grunts stole cars at gun point from civilians and then used them as roadblocks all over the city to cover the escape of their boss .
This is n’t heroics .
This is a common tactic .
Arturo Beltran , a lieutenant of the Sinaloa cartel , escaped the same way on the highway between Acapulco and Cuernavaca .
The zetas are freaking badass .
Even other cartels call them the “ Los Locos . ”
None of that holding your gun sideways bullshit gangster moves , these guys are trained professionals .
I bet they ’d hold their own with the Chechens , maybe even kick their asses .
See , unlike those Chechens , they never stopped fighting , never stopped honing their skills .
Anyway , I think this time the government was going after El Caris , a zeta lieutenant working the border of Texas / Tamaulipas .
He had taken control of the plaza when El Hummer was captured .
Now , there ’s no official confirmation of this , but there are rumors that he was possibly killed during the fight .
In the video , a reporter talks about the superior firepower of the armed forces , but a month ago the news were saying that the narcos were better armed .
Fact is , the narcos have shiny new weapons from Arizona , while the army has their home - produced very - potent G3 variant ( the G3A4 or K , I think , if your a gun nut ) and the police …
Well , who cares about the police , right ?
Fuck ’em .
As for the armed forces , superior firepower or not , they ’ll still get their amateur asses kicked by the zetas .
This is guerrilla warfare to the max and if the world ’s learned one thing from Iraq is that weapons do n’t mean shit .
I hope you enjoyed the video .
If you close your eyes , you can almost hear Baghdad .
Haha !
And remember to stay tuned for more gory news like this because it ’s gonna get pretty more badass from here on .
2009 is local elections year and the Goverment is shit scared about the infiltration of narcomoney into the campaigns to finance their own men , which would n’t be the first time it ’s happened .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Support grew on Friday for insurance industry demands that all Americans be required to obtain coverage as part of a planned healthcare system overhaul , with a senior Senate Democrat and a coalition of business and consumer groups promoting the idea .
A patient has their blood pressure checked in this undated file photo .
REUTERS / Files
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Democrat who is helping write healthcare legislation , said an insurance requirement , or mandate , would help the market function better and reduce premium costs for everyone .
Baucus argued that the cost of medical care for people with no insurance is being shifted to those with insurance , forcing costs higher .
“ An individual obligation to get health coverage is essential , ” Baucus said in a speech to the Center for American Progress think tank .
Meanwhile , an influential coalition of hospital , nurses , doctors , business , consumer and insurance groups said on Friday its members had agreed on a set of reform ideas including a mandate that all Americans obtain health insurance .
The coalition , called the Health Reform Dialogue , also backed the idea of federal subsidies to help people pay for medical coverage .
The coalition includes groups such at the AARP , which represents older Americans , the American Hospital Association , America ’s Health Insurance Plans industry group , the healthcare advocacy group Families USA , the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
MANY AMERICANS GO UNINSURED
There currently is no requirement that Americans have health insurance , and many do not .
The government says about 46 million people went without any public or private coverage in 2007 , the last year for which figures were available .
President Barack Obama has called a healthcare system overhaul one of his leading priorities for this year .
The support of this coalition and Baucus make it more likely that any healthcare legislation will embrace an insurance mandate despite concern in both parties about imposing it on people who may be unable to afford it .
Baucus did not spell out how his idea for a mandate would work , but it could be imposed on individuals , or employers could be required to provide coverage to workers , or a combination of both .
Insurance industry representatives told a Senate hearing this week that they needed a mandate to keep premiums affordable if they were going to end the current practice of charging higher premiums for the sick and excluding pre-existing medical conditions from coverage .
Obama also may be softening his stance against a mandate , telling a White House question - and - answer session on Thursday that the issue will be “ part of the debate . ”
During his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year , Obama argued against a mandate , while his rival for the nomination , Hillary Clinton , who is now his secretary of state , backed it .
Obama said on Thursday he was still “ skeptical ” about a mandate because people who lack health insurance do so because they cannot afford it , not because they do not want it .

Abandoned babies become the responsibility of hospital staff Fifty - year - old Mahbuba has four sons , but she always wanted to have a daughter .
Faced with a complex adoption procedure , she decided to take the easier option - to buy a baby .
" The moment I heard that a woman in a maternity hospital was selling her newborn daughter , I rushed there , " Mahbuba said .
" The woman told me she already had five children and she could not afford having another baby .
I paid her $ 100 [ £ 67 ] . "
Her purchase was made 10 years ago .
But buying and selling babies is still common in Tajikistan - and it all begins in maternity hospitals .
Some mothers abandon their babies just days after giving birth , leaving the fate of the children in the hands of medical staff .
Unwitting ' sales '
A young Tajik nurse described how she witnessed doctors helping a woman whose child died at birth to obtain a newborn from a different hospital .
If only I knew ...
They did give me money but I did n't ask for it
Accused midwife
She was not sure whether money was involved in this swap .
" They just wanted to help , " said the nurse .
But in Tajikistan , such goodwill could be punished with up to eight years in prison .
In 2008 , there were 13 such cases but the number of those involved in trafficking is believed to be much higher .
Some 60 km ( 37 miles ) west of Dushanbe in Tursunzoda district , I met two midwives accused of selling a baby boy for $ 200 .
They are currently on a suspended two - year sentence .
Both in their late 40s , they have been working in a maternity hospital for over 20 years .
" If only I knew , " said one of them , wiping tears from her eyes .
" I fed that child and was looking after him for one month .
They did give me money but I did n't ask for it .
They slipped the money to my pocket , " she said .
Risky business " Trafficking in minors is a problem and it still exists , " said Azimjon Ibragimov , who heads the Interior Ministry 's department on human trafficking .
Trafficking chief Ibragimov says few are aware of legal implications " Those who buy are usually childless couples .
And since the legal procedure of adopting a child is complicated people find it much easier to buy a baby , " he said .
" But most of them do n't know what the legal implications of this crime are , " he added .
Even those aware of the risks often feel they have no choice but to get rid of unwanted children .
Many such cases involve young mothers of illegitimate children .
In conservative Tajikistan , having a child out of wedlock can bring shame on a family .
But increasingly older women with existing families are also selling their children .
Fatherless families
In the poorest nation in Central Asia , fathers often work abroad , and the burden of child - care rests with the women .
Some simply cannot afford to feed any extra mouths .
" The main problem which makes our women suffer is that their husbands are gone for work , " said Muhabbat Pirnazarova , who heads the centre for civil society .
" They leave their families behind .
Some men do send money back home but there are also those who abandon their families altogether , " she said .
Cash for babies is a fact of life in Tajikistan .
This is a society where the economic conditions leave some mothers with little choice .
Others who have illegitimate children face social pressure to give them up .
And where the adoption procedure is complicated and lengthy , childless couples will do what they can to obtain a baby .

Raids to foil an alleged al - Qa'ida bomb plot , hurriedly brought forward after a blunder by a senior police officer , are yet to uncover any explosives or firearms , according to senior security sources .
But further pressure was growing on the government last night after after it emerged that the suspects being questioned today may have exploited lax student visa regulations to enter the UK from Pakistan .

Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick , the Metropolitan Police 's counter - terrorism chief , resigned yesterday amid the furore which followed his being photographed carrying secret documents about the anti-terrorist mission to a Downing Street briefing .
Although the details on the document were not published in the British media following a prohibitive Ministry of Defence D-Notice , they appeared on an American website .
It forced the police to carry out arrests of 12 suspects and searches of 14 addresses in north - west England in broad daylight , hours before they planned to do so .
Police have taken away computers , literature , maps and clothing from the premises they raided , as well as a car , but they have not , so far , found the bomb - making material needed to carry out the supposedly " imminent " multiple attacks by the suspects .
Greater Manchester Police said yesterday that they were continuing to gather evidence .
Chief Constable Peter
Fahy acknowledged that it was not ideal that the operation had to be moved forward but added that officers were used to dealing with " fast - moving situations " .
According to security sources , some of the suspects had been trailed to pubs and nightclubs as well as shopping centres .
However , Mr Fahy said : " There is no particular threat against any particular location ...
I would like to say I would have no hesitation , or any of my family , in using any of those locations that have been mentioned . "
Senior officers are , however , aware that being forced to move prematurely could have damaging consequences for subsequent prosecutions .
Ten of the 12 arrests on Wednesday were carried out between 5 pm and 6 pm .
Two more men were held from just after 10 pm .
Eleven of the men hold Pakistani nationality and the twelfth is British of Pakistani extraction .
At least seven of the men are said to have entered the UK on student visas and four are believed to have links with the city of Karachi .
According to the confidential briefing document , 10 of those arrested were " student visas Pakistan - born nationals " : ie Pakistani citizens studying in Britain .
Gordon Brown yesterday called on Pakistan to do more to tackle the " increasing " terrorism links the country has with Britain .
The Prime Minister said : " One of the lessons we have learned from the past few years is that Pakistan has to do more to root out terrorist elements in its country as well . "
He added : " We know that there are links between terrorists in Britain and terrorists in Pakistan .
That is an important issue for us to follow through and that 's why I will be talking to President Zardari about what Pakistan can do to help us in the future . "
Mr Brown defended the police operation , saying : " We are dealing with a very big terrorist plot .
We must not forget that the police have been successful in carrying out their arrests ...
We had to act pre-emptively to ensure the safety of the public . "

Bob Quick 's resignation came after a meeting with Sir Paul Stephenson and the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , yesterday morning , when it was agreed the officer would stand down .
Sources said it was decided that Scotland Yard would make the announcement , but before they could do so , the London mayor Boris Johnson broke the news on Radio 4 's Today programme after being told himself at 7.30 am .
Home Office sources saccused Mr Johnson of trying to make political capital out of the situation .
Later , Mr Quick said in a statement : " I have today offered my resignation in the knowledge that my action could have compromised a major counter - terrorism operation . "
Sir Paul Stephenson , the Scotland Yard commissioner , paid tribute to Mr Quick and said John Yates , formerly the assistant commissioner of the serious crime directorate , has replaced him .
The Quick document : Decoded
The operation
Operation Pathway was , as Mr Quick 's note makes clear , secret .
It had been in the planning for two months and suspects had been under surveillance .
As the note details , it was in relation to " suspected AQ attack planning within the UK " .
AQ refers to al - Qa'ida and the attacks were said to relate to targets in the North - west .
Obvious places such as the Arndale shopping centre and Old Trafford football ground have been mentioned , but not confirmed .
The suspects
The briefing sheet refers to 11 subjects , 10 Pakistanis and one British national .
In actual fact the raids revealed a further , unexpected , Pakistan - born national who was also arrested on suspicion of terror offences .
The men were aged between their mid-teens and 41 years old .
The addresses
The plan , as detailed on Mr Quick 's document , was to make arrests at seven addresses ; three by Greater Manchester Police , three by officers from Merseyside and one in Lancashire .
After the pictures of Mr Quick were taken the operation was brought forward and only six arrests went ahead as planned : two at a house on Galsworthy Avenue , Cheetham Hill , Manchester , three at Cedar Grove , Toxteth and one at a flat on Earle Road , Merseyside .
The others were arrested ; one at Liverpool John Moores University , two at a Homebase store in Clitheroe , two at a cyber café in Cheetham Hill Road and one in a white van on the M602 motorway .
The plan
The sheet refers to dynamic entry by firearms teams .
This simply means that armed officers planned to raid the homes by breaking the doors down .
The raids should have taken place sometime between 2 am and 6 am yesterday morning as opposed to during Wednesday evening .
The reason for this is that suspects are at their most vulnerable when tired and unlikely to fight back .
It is also likely they would have been asleep at this time and therefore undressed and unlikely to be carrying weapons .
The command structures
The note reveals the names of all of the senior officers in charge of the investigation – names that The Independent had chosen not to report – including the SIO – Senior Investigating Officer and the three Gold commanders – officers who would be in charge of overseeing the operation in each region .
The media strategy
Also mentioned is confirmation that a plan of what details were to be released to the media , and when , was in place .
Like the rest of the details , it too was brought forward when a member of the media – photographer Steve Back – pictured Mr Quick with the supposedly private document .
How Boris took ' Today ' by surprise
Transcript from the Today programme
Jim Naughtie : " Bob Quick 's future seems to be in the balance this morning – what do you make of it ? "
David Winnick MP : " It 's obviously very disturbing ...( but ) I do n't believe it 's a matter for him to resign or be dismissed . "
JN : I 'm going to interrupt you there because we 've got Boris Johnson , Mayor of London , on the line now .
Good morning Mr Johnson .
What , as far as you know , is happening at Scotland Yard ?
Boris Johnson : " I have this morning with great reluctance and sadness as Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority accepted Bob Quick 's resignation as head of counter - terrorism ... "
JN : " David Winnick , you said you did n't think that this was a resigning matter .
Mr Quick has obviously taken the view that he could n't carry on .
What do you make of it ? "
DW : " It comes as no surprise .
Undoubtedly Mr Quick has done very good work in combating terrorism .
We should n't forget for one moment , whatever may be the controversy over Mr Quick , that Britain does face an ongoing terrorist danger . "
Downfall of a man with Tory enemies
Out : Bob Quick
Like his surname , Bob Quick 's tenure as Scotland Yard 's head of counter - terrorism was brief .
Appointed in March 2008 , he resigned yesterday after just over a year in the role .
In that year he was dogged by controversy , and was forced to deal with no fewer than three separate scandals in the final six months of his career .
It was in stark contrast to the rapid rise he enjoyed since joining the Metropolitan Police in 1978 .
He moved quickly through the ranks , working as a uniformed officer and a detective before being appointed as head of the Yard 's anti-corruption unit – a role reserved for officers with unblemished reputations .
A 49 - year - old with five children , his profile on the Metropolitan Police website , from which he will soon be removed , lists his interests as skiing , motorcycling and walking .
It also reveals that he has a masters degree in business administration from Exeter University and diploma in criminology from Cambridge University .
In 2003 he left the Met to join Surrey Police as chief constable , before returning to the capital as Assistant Commissioner in charge of specialist operations last year .
He took over from Andy Hayman , who took early retirement in 2007 amid accusations of lavish expenses and questions over his relationship with a female civil servant – accusations that were later proved unfounded .
Mr Quick 's problems started in November when he was named as the officer who authorised the controversial arrest of the Conservative MP Damian Green and the raid on his House of Commons office .
He was backed by Sir Paul Stephenson , then Acting Commissioner , but a review raised concerns over the way police conducted the investigation .
The incident blotted his copy book enough to ensure that , when he applied for the Yard 's top job late last year , he did not even make the shortlist .
After this a Sunday newspaper revealed that Mr Quick 's wife ran a car - hire business from their Surrey home .
Critics said that the company website , which showed cars parked outside his house , compromised his security .
His reaction compounded the scandal when he accused the Conservative Party of running a media smear campaign against him .
He later retracted his comments , saying : " I apologise unreservedly for any offence or embarrassment that I have caused . "
That aberration appeared to have been forgotten , although police sources say that Mr Quick has rarely been at work since his outburst .
But yesterday Mr Quick made a final error .
Stepping out of a car in Downing Street he inadvertently revealed the details of a sensitive terror investigation .
He resigned " in the knowledge that my action could have compromised a major counter - terrorism operation " , adding that he deeply regretted the disruption he had caused .
A Scotland Yard source said : " I am not surprised he has gone .
If a constable or a sergeant had made the same error they would be looking at serious sanctions , perhaps dismissal .
It 's an incredibly basic error .
For someone in his position to do it is unforgivable .
You do not have to be an expert in counter - terrorism to know that you should keep sensitive documents hidden . "
Rise of the officer who took on Blair
In : John Yates
As one of the most respected police officers at Scotland Yard , John Yates has a track record so impressive it is easy to see why he was the man the Commissioner turned to in yesterday 's hour of need .
In 28 years at the Metropolitan Police , Mr Yates has taken on a number of high - profile investigations , with a good deal of success .
Since joining the Met in 1981 , after being educated at Marlborough College and King 's College London , he quickly progressed through the ranks , as a uniformed officer and a detective , and has led investigations into more than 20 murders .
Between 1999 and 2000 he worked as staff officer to the then commissioner Sir Paul – now Lord – Condon during the Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence .
Other high profile cases he has worked on include the Jeffrey Archer perjury investigation , the Who Wants to be a Millionaire ?
fraud and an internal corruption inquiry which saw six Met detectives jailed for a total of 46 years .
His only setback of note was in 2005 when , as the officer in charge of the cash - for - honours investigation , he failed to bring a single charge despite interviewing 130 people at a cost of £ 773,177 to the taxpayer .
The one - year case centred on allegations that House of Lords peerages were offered by Labour and Conservative politicians in exchange for donations to their parties .
Despite his confidence that he had built a case that would result in a trial , the Crown Prosecution Service did not bring charges .
Mr Yates said his officers received " less than full co-operation " .
Despite this , he is still seen as a safe pair of hands by the Met .
He was the officer chosen to co-ordinate the British response to the Asian tsunami , for which he was awarded the Queen 's Police Medal .
And he was the man who travelled to Brazil to apologise to the family of Jean Charles de Menezes , following the Stockwell Tube operation which saw the innocent Brazilian shot dead .
He also stood on the steps of the Old Bailey to publicly apologise for mistakes in the Rachel Nickell investigation which saw Colin Stagg wrongly charged and allowed a murder investigation to go unsolved for 18 years .
A favourite of both the rank - and - file officers and the Met hierarchy , Mr Yates , 50 , a keen cyclist who is married with children , was many officers ' choice to become Sir Paul Stephenson 's deputy when he took the top job earlier this year .
But , unlike his fellow Northerner , Mr Yates preferred to stay involved in day - to - day policing .
Yesterday he became the third man in as many years , after Andy Hayman and Bob Quick , to fill the role of Assistant Commissioner in charge of specialist operations .
The role gives him national responsibility for counter - terrorism .
A police source said it was easy to see why Mr Yates had been chosen for the job .
He said : " He is a top man .
Anybody who has worked with him will tell you he is as sharp as a tack .
You will rarely come across a more professional officer than John Yates .
" Just sitting in a meeting with him is enough to make you realise that he is much sharper than any of the other officers at his level .
His intelligence and ability to grasp things is second to none and he will be great for the counter - terrorism unit .
That said , if I was a detective working under him on the serious crime directorate I would be sad to see him go . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has achieved a great victory .
It is not his miracle plan for MPs ' expenses , issued via YouTube last week , nor is it increased confidence that his bailout plans will work .
But he is top of the Number 10 e-petition list .
The petition , posted by Reg reader Kalvis after a long battle , calls for Brown 's immediate resignation and has just grabbed the top spot .
Currently 28,454 people have signed his going - away letter .
Brown knocks a petition calling for the RNLI to be exempt from paying license fees for its maritime radio frequencies into number two from the top spot with just 28,334 votes .
We 're making a rash prediction that he will soon extend this lead over the RNLI .

The word most often associated with West Papua is remote .
An area of thick jungle and mountains , roughly the size of Spain , Papua is the eastern - most outpost of the Indonesian archipelago , some 3,200 km ( 2,000 miles ) from the government in Jakarta .
Culturally it feels even further .
Papua became part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial and very limited vote .
Ever since there have been calls from some Papuans for independence and for decades a low - level armed resistance has been rumbling on , largely unnoticed by the outside .
International journalists are severely restricted from working in the province .
A special permit is required .
But the BBC's Newsnight programme was recently offered rare footage of rebel fighters in their jungle hide - out .
The pictures were filmed by a British man keen to document the independence movement .
He travelled undercover , aided by local activists , and asked that he remain anonymous to protect those who helped him .
It took him nine hours in a car and 16 hours on foot , trekking through the jungle , to reach the mountain stronghold of the Free Papua Movement Rebels .
Cultural erosion
They are , in truth , a pretty fragmented , poorly armed band of warriors .
Some dress in Western - style shorts and T - shirts , with wellington boots the footwear of choice .
This is my land - our ancestors gave us this land .
Indonesia has stolen it from us
Rebel commander Goliath Tabuni
Others proudly sport more traditional attire - a few feathers and beads , unkempt beards , wild hair and penis gourds .
The size and curlicue of the latter denoting status .
They are armed with a few assault rifles stolen from the Indonesian security forces , and homemade bows and arrows .
The power of the rebels lies as much in the symbolism of their existence as it does in their ability to wage war .
Many Papuans feel their culture and identity are slowly being eroded .
Papuans do n't look like other Indonesians .
They are Melanesian , closer to Aboriginals than Asians .
But migrants from other Indonesian islands now make up about half the local population .
Some of these incomers consider the traditional Papuan way of life backward and uncivilised .
Layers of grievance have built up over the decades .
" We 've had enough , " said Anton , a tribal leader .
" Indonesia has committed crimes , killing people and other human rights abuses .
We want freedom , justice and democracy . "
Investigation promised A rebel commander , Goliath Tabuni , sits at Anton 's right hand .
Compared to the chief 's traditional body decorations , the commander looks a bit dishevelled in his floppy camouflage hat .
There is no sign yet that Papuan independence is any closer
But in terms of their passion for the cause , they are equals .
" This is my land , " said Goliath .
" Our ancestors gave us this land .
Indonesia has stolen it from us . "
Over the years there have been serious abuses committed by the Indonesian security forces .
Accusations of torture and rape persist .
But under the democratically elected government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , the military and police are being reformed .
In a statement responding to the Newsnight programme , the Indonesian Embassy in London said : " No-one in Indonesia will ever condone human rights violations .
Therefore , it is a sad fact if one still judges Indonesia by the old yardsticks .
" We can confirm that all human rights abuses will be duly investigated in Indonesia and , if proven guilty by the court , all abusers of human rights will be punished .
No -one is immune . "
But the legacy of past behaviour will take time to erase .
Elusive dream
As long as the independence fighters exist , the soldiers and police will stay in Papua in large numbers .
Their mission is not just to root out the rebels , but also to protect vital business interests .
Papua is rich in natural resources .
Raising the Papuan flag , the Morning Star , is illegal in Indonesia
It is home to the world 's largest gold and copper mine and there are big investments in gas , timber and palm oil .
A blessing for some .
A curse for others .
" We believe it 's about morality , " said Anton , the tribal leader .
" Because the world is interested in our resources , they wo n't talk about us .
That 's why the world just ignores us and our struggle . "
On 1 December , independence supporters gathered in a clearing in the jungle to mark Papua 's self - declared Independence Day .
With great ceremony and formality they raised the Papuan flag .
It was a very deliberate act of defiance : raising the Morning Star flag is illegal in Indonesia .
In the jungle no one could see .
But when , in 2004 , the flag was raised in the provincial capital , Jayapura , the police were looking on .
Yusak Package , who spoke at the rally , was arrested and charged with treason .
He is currently serving a 10 - year jail sentence and is considered by Amnesty International to be a prisoner of conscience .
In terms of raising the international profile of the Papuan cause , Yusak 's case , and others like it , are probably more effective than the armed rebellion .
But there is no sign yet that independence is any closer .
And in their remote mountain hide - out , that is still the dream the rebel fighters are striving for .

Economist Craig Newmark suggests that the discipline of economics recommends itself over other social sciences on the basis of its better “ track record ” .
But let ’s take a closer look .
What we find is that much of the best economics has been work done by economists attempting to overcome the massively influential fallacies of other economists : Adam Smith taking on merchantilist economists ; Keynes taking on the “ Treasury ” economists & A.C. Pigou ; Friedman taking on the Keynesian economists ; Bohm - Bawerk taking on the Marxist economists .
You get the idea .
The best economists are constantly savings us from .. the economists .
And things are no different with the economics of Hayek .
Much of Hayek ’s best work was exactly the same sort of thing .
Hayek taking on socialist economists — leading to his great papers on the division of knowledge and the price signaling function of relative prices .
Hayek taking on the “ perfectly competitive market ” economists and the formal equilibrium economists — leading to his great papers on competition as a discovery process .
Hayek taking on the Federal Reserve economists , Fisher , Foster & Catchings , Keynes , and the rest on price stability , monetary and business cycle theory — leading to his many books and papers on the microeconomics of production and consumption coordination across time — as well as those on the very foundations of economic science .
This is the stuff for which Hayek won the Nobel Prize .
And at the end of his career Hayek saw a profession that still “ did n’t get it ” — and which was still making terrible mess of things ( Hayek ’s words ) .
Newswise —
The ability to create tiny patterns is essential to the fabrication of computer chips and many other current and potential applications of nanotechnology .
Yet , creating ever smaller features , through a widely - used process called photolithography , has required the use of ultraviolet light , which is difficult and expensive to work with .
John Fourkas , Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry in the University of Maryland College of Chemical and Life Sciences , and his research group have developed a new , table - top technique called RAPID ( Resolution Augmentation through Photo - Induced Deactivation ) lithography that makes it possible to create small features without the use of ultraviolet light .
This research is to be published in Science magazine and released on Science Express on April 9 , 2009 .
Photolithography uses light to deposit or remove material and create patterns on a surface .
There is usually a direct relationship between the wavelength of light used and the feature size created .
Therefore , nanofabrication has depended on short wavelength ultraviolet light to generate ever smaller features .
" The RAPID lithography technique we have developed enables us to create patterns twenty times smaller than the wavelength of light employed , " explains Dr. Fourkas , " which means that it streamlines the nanofabrication process .
We expect RAPID to find many applications in areas such as electronics , optics , and biomedical devices . "
" If you have gotten a filling at the dentist in recent years , " says Fourkas , " you have seen that a viscous liquid is squirted into the cavity and a blue light is then used to harden it .
A similar process of hardening using light is the first element of RAPID .
Now imagine that your dentist could use a second light source to sculpt the filling by preventing it from hardening in certain places .
We have developed a way of using a second light source to perform this sculpting , and it allows us to create features that are 2500 times smaller than the width of a human hair . "
Both of the laser light sources used by Fourkas and his team were of the same color , the only difference being that the laser used to harden the material produced short bursts of light while the laser used to prevent hardening was on constantly .
The second laser beam also passed through a special optic that allowed for sculpting of the hardened features in the desired shape .
" The fact that one laser is on constantly in RAPID makes this technique particularly easy to implement , " says Fourkas , " because there is no need to control the timing between two different pulsed lasers . "
Fourkas and his team are currently working on improvements to RAPID lithography that they believe will make it possible to create features that are half of the size of the ones they have demonstrated to date .
Achieving lambda / 20 Resolution by One - Color Initiation and Deactivation of Polymerization was written by Linjie Li , Rafael R. Gattass , Erez Gershgorem , Hana Hwang and John T. Fourkas .

I decided to brush dust off this old chestnut that I 've seen trotted around recently :
When people stop believing in God , they do n't believe in nothing — they believe in anything .
~ G. K. Chesterton
People seem to be using this rationale as a warning .
" Now listen , if you stop believing in god , bad things could happen . "
And apparently the same people insist that it 's true .
Supposedly new age medicine is on the rise , people join various cults , the world seems to be acting more gullible on the whole .
Perhaps .
But let 's go back to Chesterton .
Let 's see what he 's saying there .
And this is not just my reading of it , this is how I perceive people are interpreting his statement to make a point :
When people stop believing in god they start searching for something else to believe .
And they end up believing the most ridiculous things , they turn to superstition .
On the face of it , that seems like an insightful observation .
But when you think about it for a minute .. what could be more ridiculous than god ?
I mean if you believe that story , how much more gullible could you get ?
Superstition ?
You mean like supernatural beings ?
You know how people say " do n't do drugs , they 'll mess you up " ?
I would n't know , because I 've never taken any .
But it seems to me people are messed up already without the drugs .
The only difference between religion and your run -of - the - mill superstition is that religion is institutionalized .
It is the accepted ( or if you will , tolerated ) superstition .
It 's the emperor 's new clothes .
It 's Santa Claus .
It 's " sssh do n't say it out loud , those people over there still believe it " .
Chesterton was half right .
People will believe anything .
They do this not after rejecting god , but from the very beginning .
And god is very much a part of of this " anything " .
We see this again and again , how easy it is to trick people into doing things that are not in their best interest .
How advertising makes us desire things we do n't really want .
How phishing attacks get people to give up their password by telling them lies .
It 's absolutely true .
This is our weakness , and everyone is vulnerable .
I do it myself .
I somehow got this idea that I have an impact on the results of my team .
The situation is like this .
I 'm not watching the game , and I do n't even know there is a game underway .
So I just randomly check the scores to see if anything is happening and I notice my team is playing .
If I then start following the scores until the end it often seems like a positive starting point turns into a bad result .
What started out as a lead results in a draw or loss .
I seem to have a bad impact .
So what do I do about it ?
I do n't follow it .
I try to put it out of my mind and just check the score when it 's all over .
( Inevitably , of course , I forget .
And I check before the game is over , by which time it might be a draw , so that just fuels the superstition . )
So what is that ?
It 's superstition , plain and simple .
Of course , I know that I do n't have any effect on the result .
And I would never try to suggest to someone that it 's better not to check the scores underway lest you impact the result .
It 's totally irrational .
But I still kind of believe this , my behavior proves that I do .
Superstition is a common thing , a lot of people have one thing or another that they kind of secretely believe despite knowing better .
It 's who we are .
But to say that one man 's superstition is gullibility , while another 's is virtue ?
Let 's cut the crap .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
More than 12 envelopes containing an unknown white and powdery substance have been sent to senior executives at The Wall Street Journal , and two floors of the newspaper 's New York headquarters were evacuated , Dow Jones employees said Wednesday .
New York City police and hazardous - materials investigators are looking into the situation , a spokesman for the newspaper said earlier .
Three of the envelopes were opened , forcing officials to evacuate the 9th and 11th floors of the paper 's headquarters and to temporarily quarantine five employees who came in contact with the substance .
The employees are " apparently in good spirits and health , " according to an internal Dow Jones memo .
Some of the evacuated staffers were moved to other floors in the building , while others were relocated to Dow Jones offices in Jersey City and South Brunswick , N.J .
The company 's expectation is that employees will be able to return to the Manhattan headquarters on Thursday , the memo said .
Some of the envelopes are being isolated in the mailroom of the Journal 's offices in Lower Manhattan , while others already have been distributed to other parts of the building , the spokesman added .
The business - size envelopes are marked with a Tennessee return address , according to the spokesman .
No further details were available .
The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp. NWS NWS , - 3.57 % ( NWS ) , which also owns other Dow Jones properties including Barron's , Dow Jones Newswires and MarketWatch , the publisher of this report .
Last October , an envelope containing a suspicious substance was received at the New York Times ' headquarters in midtown Manhattan .
After the lobby was closed for four hours , police concluded that the substance was not harmful .
A similar incident temporarily shut down the newsroom at Reuters ' offices in New York that same month .
In the Reuters case too , no hazard was discovered .
Since the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , there have been a number of mailed threats that sparked fears of bioterrorism .
In October of that year , an NBC News employee tested positive for anthrax after handling two envelopes containing a white powder and a sandlike material addressed to then - " NBC Nightly News " anchor Tom Brokaw .
The envelopes also included letters threatening Brokaw .
One of the world 's top climate scientists has written a personal new year appeal to Barack and Michelle Obama , warning of the " profound disconnect " between public policy on climate change and the magnitude of the problem .
With less than three weeks to go until Obama 's inauguration , Professor James Hansen , who heads Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , asked the recently appointed White House science adviser Professor John Holdren to pass the missive directly to the president - elect .
In it , he praises Obama 's campaign rhetoric about " a planet in peril " , but says that how the new president acts in office will be crucial .
Hansen lambasts the current international approach of setting targets through " cap and trade " schemes as not up to the task .
" This approach is ineffectual and not commensurate with the climate threat .
It could waste another decade , locking in disastrous consequences for our planet and humanity , " the letter from Hansen and his wife , Anniek , reads .
The letter will make uncomfortable reading for officials in 10 US states whose cap and trade mechanism - the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - got under way yesterday .
The scheme is the first mandatory , market - based greenhouse gas reduction programme in the US .
Hansen advocates a three - pronged attack on the climate problem .
First , he wants a phasing out of coal - fired power stations - which he calls " factories of death " - that do not incorporate carbon capture .
" Nobody realistically expects that the large readily available pools of oil and gas will be left in the ground .
Caps will not cause that to happen - caps only slow the rate at which the oil and gas are used .
The only solution is to cut off the coal source , " the Hansens wrote .
Second , he proposes a " carbon tax and 100 % dividend " .
This is a mechanism for putting a price on carbon without raising money for government coffers .
The idea is to tax carbon at source , then redistribute the revenue equally among taxpayers , so that high carbon users are penalised while low carbon users are rewarded .
Finally , he urges a renewed research effort into so - called fourth generation nuclear plants , which can use nuclear waste as fuel .
Hansen argues that the current emphasis on reduction targets combined with carbon trading schemes make it too easy for countries to wriggle out of their commitments .
He cites the example of Japan 's increasing coal use , which it has offset by buying credits from China through the clean development mechanism - an instrument set up by the Kyoto protocol - yet China 's emissions have continued to increase rapidly .
China has overtaken the US as the biggest polluter in the world .
Hansen has been one of the most prominent advocates of action to tackle climate change since he first spoke on the issue in the 1980s .
His testimony to the Senate featured in Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth and he has received numerous honours for his work on the issue , including the WWF 's top conservation award .
Professor 's wish list
• Moratorium on and phasing out of coal power stations without carbon capture , what Hansen calls the " sine qua non for solving the climate problem " .
Coal CO2 emissions are the same as those of other fossil fuels combined .
• Raising the price of emissions via a " carbon tax and 100 % dividend " .
This is a tax mechanism to " decarbonise " the economy without a net take from taxpayers .
Low carbon users are rewarded while high users are punished .
• Urgent research on " fourth generation " nuclear power with international co-operation .
This offers one of the best options for nearly carbon - free power , according to Hansen .
It would also help to solve the nuclear waste problem by using that material as fuel .
We ’ve been back and forth on this issue for the last couple days : can we manage the risks involved in letting some of the big banks and other financial institutions go into some sort of managed reorganization ?
This afternoon on MSNBC NJ Gov. Jon Corzine — who , remember , used to be CEO of Goldman Sachs — says yes , we can and we should .
We know much more about the condition of the banks and the implications of their ( controlled ) failure than we did in the crisis moments last September .
Two men who held up a jewellery store in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , were themselves robbed as they made their getaway , US police say .
A second pair of robbers pounced on their haul of cash and gems in the street outside , sparking a fight followed by a car chase .
Police pulled over both vehicles and arrested four men , all from Illinois .
But no loot was discovered and police are now searching for more suspects , the Associated Press reports .
Police Lt Thomas
Welch said the original robbers were aged 40 and 31 and the two who robbed them in turn were 22 and 27 .
No estimate was given of the value of the stolen items .
A £ 7,000 deposit will get you on the list for one of the first production versions being made by Terrafugia of Boston in Woburn , Massachusetts .
The full estimated price is around £ 140,000 .
Etliche große norwegische Websites warnen die Besucher , wenn sie alte Internet Explorer verwenden .
Er war einst der fortschrittlichste Browser seiner Zeit , doch nach siebeneinhalb Jahren hat sich der Internet Explorer 6 längst zur Plage für jeden Webdesigner entwickelt .
Obwohl der Nachfolger mittlerweile auch schon zweieinhalb Jahre auf dem Buckel hat und Alternativen wie Firefox und Opera bei jedem
Test besser abschneiden , verwenden noch an die zwanzig Prozent aller Internetnutzer diesen Uralt - Browser – ganz zu schweigen von der kleinen Minderheit , die mit lebenden Fossilien wie IE 5.5 im Web unterwegs ist .
Sogar knapp zehn Prozent der Heise - online - Besucher ( beziehungsweise deren Systemadministratoren ) lassen sich nicht von der veralteten Engine und den offenen Sicherheitslücken abschrecken .
In Norwegen rufen nun die Webmaster zum Widerstand auf .
Finn.no , einer der populärsten Websites des Landes , begrüßt IE6 - Anwender nun mit dem unübersehbaren Hinweis , dass er die Seite mit einer " eldre versjon " des " nettleseren " Internet Explorer betrachte , und verweist auf den IE7 .
Zugleich riefen die Macher von finn .
no ihre Kollegen dazu auf , es ihnen gleichzutun , und stellten einen Codeschnipsel bereit .
Mit Erfolg , denn zahlreiche norwegische Nachrichtensites taten es ihnen gleich .
Unabhängig davon ruft man anderswo zum IE Death March auf : Zum März 2009 haben etliche Webmaster angekündigt , den Support für IE6 einzustellen .
Es bleibt abzuwarten , ob auch andere Webmaster sich dem anschließen , anstatt sich weiter mit Workarounds herumzuschlagen .

パーティションを利用する
今回は少し凝ったテーブルを定義をしてみましょう。
郵便番号データは毎月更新されるので、テーブル指定時にバージョンも指定できるようにします。このような場合、Hiveではパーティションを使います。
以下に郵便番号を保存するテーブル「zip」を定義しますが、日付型DATEのパーティションverを設定するようにします。
hive >
CREATE TABLE zip ( zip STRING , pref INT , city STRING , town STRING ) > PARTITIONED BY ( ver DATE ) > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ', ' > LINES TERMINATED BY '
'; OK Time taken : 0.128 seconds テーブル 「 zip」の定義と作 成
ここで、テーブルzipに2008年11月28日版の郵便番号データzip20081128.csvと2008年12月26日版のzip20091226.csvを読み込みます。
hive >
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hiveuser/localfiles/zip20081128.csv ' >
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE zip PARTITION ( ver = ' 2008-11-28 ' ) ;
Copying data from file :/ home / hiveuser/ localfiles / zip20081128.csv
Loading data to table zip partition {ver=2008 - 11-28} OK

OVERWRITE INTO TABLE zip PARTITION ( ver = ' 2008-12-26 ' ) ;
Copying data from file :/ home / hiveuser/ localfiles / zip20081226.csv
Loading data to table zip partition {ver=2008 - 12-26} OK
Time taken : 1.788 seconds 2つのcsvデータの読み込み
データが本当に読み込まれたかどうか確認しましょう。次に説明するSELECT文でもいいですが、ここでは直接HadoopのHDFSシステムのうえで、どのようにデータが保存されているか確認します。
HadoopのコマンドでHDFSシステムのディレクトリ「/user/hive/warehouse」以下を表示させます。Hiveのデータはこのディレクトリに保存されます。
hiveuser >
$ HADOOP_HOME / bin/hadoop dfs - lsr /user / hive / warehouse drwxr - xr-x - hiveuser supergroup 0 2009-01-01 12:22 /user/hive/warehouse/pref -rw-r--r-- 3 hiveuser supergroup 611 2009-01-01 12:21 /user/hive/warehouse/pref/pref.csv drwxr-xr-x - hiveuser supergroup 0 2009-01-01 12:24 /user/hive/warehouse/zip drwxr-xr-x - hiveuser supergroup 0 2009-01-01 12:24 /user/hive/warehouse/zip/ver=2008-11-28 -rw-r--r-- 3 hiveuser supergroup 4541673 2009-01-01 12:24 /user/hive/warehouse/zip/ver=2008-11-28/zip20081128.csv drwxr-xr-x - hiveuser supergroup 0 2009-01-01 12:24 /user/hive/warehouse/zip/ver=2008-12-26 -rw-r--r-- 3 hiveuser supergroup 4541979 2009-01-01 12:24 /user/hive/warehouse/zip/ver=2008-12-26/zip20081226.csv
/user/hive/warehouse以下の内容を出力
テーブル名と同じ名前のディレクトリが作成され、それ以下に読み込まれたファイルが存在していることが分かります。パーティションが設定されたテーブルには、サブディレクトリが作成されていることも分かります。
ここでは省略しますが 、WebブラウザでHDFSの状態を表示させることもできます。
Webブラウザで「 localhost:50070」にアクセスし 、 「 Live Datanodes 」 の「 Node = localhost 」をクリックすると、HDFSのルートディレクトリが表示されます。
コラム◆MapReduce操作について HiveはHadoopの機能であるMapReduce操作もできます。そもそもHive自体がMapReduceで実行されるわけですが、ここではHiveからMapReduceスクリプトを実行する方法を説明します。MapReduceの構文は、下記URLで紹介されています。
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/LanguageManual/Transform ここではテーブルprefについて、prefカラムの「青森県」や「岩手県」から「県」という文字を削除して、新しいテーブルpref_newに挿入するMap操作を行います。 はじめにテーブルpref_newを定義します。 hive >
CREATE TABLE pref_new ( id int , pref STRING ) > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ', ' > LINES TERMINATED BY '
' ; テーブルpref_newの定義 次 にMap操作を行います。まずは簡略版で実行してみましょう。 hive >
FROM ( > FROM pref > SELECT TRANSFORM ( pref.id , pref.pref ) AS ( oid , opref ) > USING '/ bin/sed s/県//' > CLUSTER BY oid > ) tmap > INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE pref_new SELECT tmap.oid , tmap.opref ; sedを利用し たMap操作 Mapスクリプトを書き込むUSING句には、UNIXのコマンドであるsedが書き込まれているだけです。この操作を行うと、テーブルが1行ずつsedコマンドに渡され、「県」という文字列を削除してINSERT文に渡されます。
sedコマンドは1行ごとにすべてのカラムに対して変換を行うので、目的とするカラム以外のデータも変換してしまい、汎用的ではありません。そこで、きちんと目的のカラムだけに変換を施すperlスクリプトを使って同様の作用を起こしてみましょう。
#!/usr /bin/perl while ( <>) { chop ; my ( @w ) = split ( '\t ' , $ _ ) ; $ w [ 1 ] =~ s/県$// ; printf ( " % d\t%s
" , $ w [ 0 ] , $ w [ 1 ] ) ; } /home / hiveuser / test.pl hiveuser > chmod +x /home/hiveuser/test.pl /home/hiveuser/test.plに実行属性を付与する 区切り文字が 「\t」であることに注意してください。HDFSの通常の区切り文字は「
^A」ですが、Hiveが生成したテーブルにデータを書き込む場合は、ファイルの区切りが「\t」となるようです。
あとは、同様に実行するだけです。 hive >
FROM ( > FROM pref > SELECT TRANSFORM ( pref.id , pref.pref ) AS ( oid , opref ) > USING '/home/hiveuser/test.pl ' > CLUSTER BY oid > ) tmap > INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE pref_new SELECT tmap.oid , tmap.opref ; perlスクリプトによ るMap操作 編集部注 ：

This Bill Moyers interview is going viral so fast , I can't even keep up with it .
And for a very good reason - former S&L regulator Bill Black explains exactly why the current banking bailout is a mistake .
There 's so much information , you simply have to read or watch the entire thing :
BILL MOYERS : Yeah .
Are you saying that Timothy Geithner , the Secretary of the Treasury , and others in the administration , with the banks , are engaged in a cover - up to keep us from knowing what went wrong ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK : Absolutely .
BILL MOYERS : You are .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Absolutely , because they are scared to death .
All right ?
They 're scared to death of a collapse .
They 're afraid that if they admit the truth , that many of the large banks are insolvent .
They think Americans are a bunch of cowards , and that we 'll run screaming to the exits .
And we wo n't rely on deposit insurance .
And , by the way , you can rely on deposit insurance .
And it 's foolishness .
All right ?
Now , it may be worse than that .
You can impute more cynical motives .
But I think they are sincerely just panicked about , " We just ca n't let the big banks fail . "
That 's wrong .
BILL MOYERS : But what might happen , at this point , if in fact they keep from us the true health of the banks ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , then the banks will , as they did in Japan , either stay enormously weak , or Treasury will be forced to increasingly absurd giveaways of taxpayer money .
We 've seen how horrific AIG -- and remember , they kept secrets from everyone .
BILL MOYERS : A.I.G. did ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : What we 're doing with -- no , Treasury and both administrations .
The Bush administration and now the Obama administration kept secret from us what was being done with AIG .
AIG was being used secretly to bail out favored banks like UBS and like Goldman Sachs .
Secretary Paulson 's firm , that he had come from being CEO .
It got the largest amount of money .
$ 12.9 billion .
And they did n't want us to know that .
And it was only Congressional pressure , and not Congressional pressure , by the way , on Geithner , but Congressional pressure on AIG .
Where Congress said , " We will not give you a single penny more unless we know who received the money . "
And , you know , when he was Treasury Secretary , Paulson created a recommendation group to tell Treasury what they ought to do with AIG .
And he put Goldman Sachs on it .
BILL MOYERS : Even though Goldman Sachs had a big vested stake .
WILLIAM K. BLACK : Massive stake .
And even though he had just been CEO of Goldman Sachs before becoming Treasury Secretary .
Now , in most stages in American history , that would be a scandal of such proportions that he would n't be allowed in civilized society .
BILL MOYERS : Yeah , like a conflict of interest , it seems .
WILLIAM K. BLACK : Massive conflict of interests .
BILL MOYERS : So , how did he get away with it ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK : I do n't know whether we 've lost our capability of outrage .
Or whether the cover up has been so successful that people just do n't have the facts to react to it .
BILL MOYERS : Who 's going to get the facts ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : We need some chairmen or chairwomen --
BILL MOYERS : In Congress .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : -- in Congress , to hold the necessary hearings .
And we can blast this out .
But if you leave the failed CEOs in place , it is n't just that they 're terrible business people , though they are .
It is n't just that they lack integrity , though they do .
Because they were engaged in these frauds .
But they 're not going to disclose the truth about the assets .
BILL MOYERS : And we have to know that , in order to know what ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : To know everything .
To know who committed the frauds .
Whose bonuses we should recover .
How much the assets are worth .
How much they should be sold for .
Is the bank insolvent , such that we should resolve it in this way ?
It 's the predicate , right ?
You need to know the facts to make intelligent decisions .
And they 're deliberately leaving in place the people that caused the problem , because they do n't want the facts .
And this is not new .
The Reagan Administration 's central priority , at all times , during the Savings and Loan crisis , was covering up the losses .
BILL MOYERS : So , you 're saying that people in power , political power , and financial power , act in concert when their own behinds are in the wringer , right ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : That 's right .
And it 's particularly a crisis that brings this out , because then the class of the banker says , " You 've got to keep the information away from the public or everything will collapse .
If they understand how bad it is , they 'll run for the exits . "
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russia 's finance minister made a rare admission of responsibility Monday for the country 's severe economic crisis .
Russia 's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin says his country 's economy has been set back by five years .
The Russian government overspent its vast oil revenues in recent years , fueling inflation , and did not do enough to reduce the economy 's reliance on oil , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said in an exclusive CNN interview .
" Of course , I too bear the responsibility for not managing to diversify the economy as much as we wanted , " Kudrin said .
" We were spending more money than we could afford , which is why we had a rapid strengthening of the national currency [ and ] a high inflation rate .
" I think the government should have been more conservative in its financial policy and save more money that it received from the high global oil prices , " he said .
Kremlin officials usually blame the West , and specifically the United States , for the global economic crisis .
Kudrin , who is also a deputy prime minister , said the financial crisis had set back Russian shares -- but added that the United States had fared even worse .
" If we are talking about the Russian stock market , it had been growing quickly over the past few years and then dropped rapidly .
But we only retreated back five years , as far as I know , U.S. stock markets have fallen back 10 years . "

The Dow Jones index of leading shares hit lows not seen since 1997 on Monday .
Kudrin confirmed Russia would have a budget deficit of 8 percent in 2009 -- its first for a decade -- and will spend more than it takes in for the next two years as well .
He predicted a deficit of 5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2011 .
Russian government budget forecasts assumed oil would cost $ 95 a barrel -- more than twice as much as it costs at the moment .
The lower price hurt Russia , one of the world 's largest oil exporters .
But Kudrin said Moscow would not cut spending , though it would change its priorities .
" In general , the volume of spending will remain the same , and even slightly increase , which is why the deficit will go up to 8 percent , " he said .
" We need to optimize our spending and cut certain programs , " he added .
" First of all , we halted all brand new programs and all new projects .
In some cases we 've also cut government institutions and government employees ' payroll .
Besides , we 've decreased funding for less important projects by 50 percent and more .
But by and large social spending and important infrastructure projects remain untouched . "
Russia 's stock markets plummeted by nearly 70 percent in 2008 , and the country spent one - third of its gold and foreign currency reserves -- or $ 216 billion -- defending its currency , the ruble .
The Kremlin has also committed vast sums to bail out big business in Russia , which is heavily in debt to foreign banks .
Kudrin -- who is attending a global investment forum in Moscow -- said there were signs the Russian economy was stabilizing .
He confirmed that investors pulled $ 40 billion out of Russia in January , but said that enormous outflows of cash had stopped .
The flight of capital was related to the much - anticipated fall in the value of the currency , he said .
" People have been expecting a devaluation of the Russian ruble , there were a lot of expectations of new devaluation to take place .
That 's why , before the end of January , before the devaluation was actually completed , there was a very strong incentive to take capital out of Russia .
However , in February , such capital outflow practically ended . "

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich speaks at the American Enterprise Institute .
| Jay Premack Forget change : GOP eyes retro strategy
Republicans are hatching a political comeback by dusting off a strategic playbook written nearly two decades ago .
Its themes : Unite against Democrats ’ economic policy , block and counter health care reform and tar them with spending scandals .

Those represent the political trifecta that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich bet on in 1994 to produce a historic Republican takeover of Congress .
Now , some Republicans believe President Barack Obama ’s one - two push on the economy and health care reform is setting the stage for a new round of significant gains , if not a total takeover .
“ There are two models that Republicans are looking at , ” said Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform .
“ One is 1990 , [ President George H.W. ]
Bush gets together with the Democrats at Andrews Air Force Base , raises taxes and loses the next election , ” he explained .
“ The other is 1993 , Democrats have a series of proposals to spend and tax .
Republicans vote no and regain the House and Senate . ”
With passage of the $ 787 billion economic stimulus behind him , the new president is now turning to health care , expected to be a primary topic at Monday ’s Fiscal Responsibility Summit at the White House .
Republican leaders , including House Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio , plan to attend .
But as the stimulus debate earlier this month showed , a dialogue today does n’t rule out an onslaught of diatribes later on the House and Senate floors .
That recent history is likely to put the Obama team on guard , but the road ahead for Republicans is tricky , as well .
It ’s not 1994 anymore
For one thing , Obama is n’t Clinton .
President Bill Clinton never won a popular majority in his two elections .
Obama did .
His vote margin exceeded 9 million votes , the largest ever for a nonincumbent presidential contender — including Ronald Reagan ’s 1980 win over President Jimmy Carter .
And another thing : Republicans are n’t in the ascendancy as they were in 1994 .
After two victorious election cycles , the Democrats have puréed the Republicans into their purest conservative caucus .
In a way , that made it easier for Republicans to vote against Obama ’s stimulus plan .
But a repeat performance on health care could be more complicated .
Health care is a personal issue for many voters .
Reforming the current system ranks as the public ’s third top priority , according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll .
And many of those advocates are n’t traditional Democratic constituents .
“ We are in a different game , and they are playing by the old rules , ” said Stan Greenberg , a Democratic political strategist and former Clinton adviser .
Ordinary families and businesses , big and small , are struggling with health care ’s rising costs .
Insurance companies and drug makers that stood by Republicans in the last debate are now cozying up to the Obama team , hoping to influence a final reform bill .
“ He ’s got a lot more running room , ” said Billy Tauzin , the former Republican congressman from Louisiana who heads PhRMA , the drug company ’s trade group in Washington .
“ There is a lot more urgency on the issue , and there is a lot more common ground , ” he added .
“ There are extraordinary coalitions of people who would not sit down at a table with each other in 1992 that are now working on the issue today . ”
Lots of lessons were learned
Finally , Republicans are n’t the only ones with a pocketful of lessons learned from the epic battles in 1993 - 94 .
Unlike the Clinton plan , Obama ’s reform effort builds on employer - based health insurance rather than replacing it , undercutting Republican efforts to label it as a big - government program .
The Obama team is also approaching the legislative process much differently .
In 1993 , the Clinton plan was crafted inside the White House .
Today , Senate Democrats are writing the package .
Obama is also scattering portions of his reform agenda into several legislative vehicles , which means some could prevail while others might falter .
The president already can claim one key victory : nearly $ 20 billion set aside in the stimulus bill to help doctors and hospitals convert paper medical records to electronic ones .
The transition is critical to achieving Obama ’s goal of decreasing medical costs , since electronic records could reduce duplication of medical tests and other treatments .
The Obama team will also salt significant reforms into its first budget proposal , scheduled to be released on Thursday .
Among them are a series of carrots and sticks intended to drive down the number of repeat hospital admissions of Medicare patients .
Another proposal would eliminate the current fee - for - service formula and give hospitals a single payment that would cover a variety of treatments .
The goal : reducing unnecessary tests or services , according to a source familiar with the White House deliberations .
Such changes are sure to set off intense lobbying efforts by those who win or lose in the pay formula .
But by moving them into the budget bill , Obama robs Republicans of the chance to filibuster them .
He just needs a simple majority in the Senate — something Clinton could n’t count on .
But the more things change ...
The Republicans ’ best hope for a political recovery may actually have little to do with what they do .
Rather , it may hinge more on whether the Democrats just keep being Democrats .
“ They will start with a very left wing bill because they ca n’t help themselves , ” predicted Gingrich .
And he has reasons to hope .
The primary Democratic reform authors — Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) — already are drafting a reform proposal that goes beyond what Obama promised on the campaign trail .
The two senators are expected to press for a mandate that every adult obtain health insurance .
Obama expressly campaigned against such a mandate — and took a lot of heat for that from Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries .
His campaign called for mandatory coverage of children .
Adults would be herded toward insurance through a series of financial incentives .
In addition , congressional Democrats are conducting their negotiations in stark contrast to the way Obama promised he ’d conduct them .
They ’re meeting secretly on Capitol Hill with industry representatives , and Republicans are n’t in the room ; Obama promised open and bipartisan debate with television cameras in the room .
The Senate is only the start of the process .
Republicans are banking on the more liberal House to push the health care legislation even further from the center , making it unpalatable to moderate Democrats as well as Republicans .
As he did years ago , Gingrich is urging his old colleagues to “ come up with a positive solution that is inclusive of everybody and that is capable of being implemented and to try to do it in a bipartisan way . ”
In the House , Boehner recently appointed a GOP health care task force to begin crafting a response to the Obama plan .
Republicans are also relying on another set of Democrats to be themselves and , in the process , grease the way to a political comeback for the GOP : big -city mayors .
Several conservative groups plan to track the stimulus cash as it makes its way to the streets and playgrounds and sewer projects that are supposed to generate jobs .
“ What the Democrats have done is set up a minefield that they are n’t in charge of , ” Norquist said .
“ For two years , they will have to wander in it and wonder if they are going to step on some boondoggle , some corrupt contract . ”
Obama seemed mindful of that risk in a White House meeting Friday , when he lectured mayors about watching their spending .
“ What I need from all of you is unprecedented responsibility and accountability on all of our parts , ” the president said .
“ The American people are watching . ”
So are their political rivals , he might have added .

The current housing crisis has left us with an opportunity to examine the driving issue behind a high homeownership rate .
Is it really worth it to push for an economic policy that champions a high homeownership rate ?
The problem with blanket statements is they usually play into herd mentality and feed into group think .
One of the statements we have lived with for the past decade is “ everyone should own their own home . ”
Such statements mask a three decade long housing bubble and also do n’t research the basis for economic sustainability .
The problem with pushing a pro-housing agenda is it covers up a lot of other sins .
For example , owning a home with a conventional mortgage that you can afford is in most cases a good thing .
But is it worth it to purchase a home where most of your money is going to pay for the mortgage , which is a financially dangerous option ARM like many now have ?
When you start cutting deeper into the analysis , you realize that homeownership for all is simply a populist rallying cry .
From 1900 to 1930 the homeownership rate remained flat around 43 percent .
Rates shot up during the 1940s and 1950s during the baby boom :
If we look at data for over 100 years of U.S. homeownership rates we see 3 major cycles .
First , from 1900 to 1930 we see a generally stagnant growth rate .
Mortgages also had stricter terms :
“ As the U.S. economy contracted , loan delinquencies and foreclosures soared , fueled by falling household incomes and property values .
Many home loans had terms of five years or less and often involved no , or only partial , payment of principal before a balloon payment was due when the loan matured or was refinanced .
Refinancing was common and easily accomplished in the 1920s , an environment of rising incomes and property values , but next to impossible during the Depression .
Falling incomes made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to make loan payments or to refinance outstanding loans as they came due .
The failure of thousands of banks and other lenders contributed to the difficulty of refinancing , as customer relationships were severed and the costs of credit intermediation rose . ”
- Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis , David Wheelock
We should first acknowledge what was similar during the Great Depression and our current crisis .
First the similarities :
( a) Refinancing was good so long as the economy was rising .
( b) Once incomes fell and the depression hit , refinancing was nearly impossible .
So housing was on a much quicker revolving timeline with 5 year mortgages .
More people also paid off mortgages quicker .
Let us now highlight some clear differences :
( a) Homeownership stayed around 43 before and after the Great Depression .
Our peak homeownership rate hit in 2004 and was at 69.2 percent .
( b) Mortgages have longer terms .
Those are some stark differences .
The Great Depression did put some pressure on home values but you ’ll notice that the lull during this time was not that significant .
Rates remained above 40 percent even during the worst times of the depression .
The next phase is the baby boom phase .
This was the largest increase in the homeownership rate that the country has ever seen and spanned two decades .
First , when families formed and then , when the baby boomers went out and started their own families .
You had a two wave here .
In addition , during the Great Depression Fannie Mae was established which provided more generous and accommodating mortgages .
This may be the only time that we have seen a major spike that had a legitimate case in demographics .
The final cycle which was our current housing bubble which has seen $ 50 trillion in global evaporate , was driven in large part by a credit bubble and a mania in virtually every asset class but in particular , real estate .
You ’ll notice on the chart above that this pushed the homeownership rate from approximately 64 percent to 69.2 percent .
Most of those gains have now disappeared because much of the new homeownership gains were based on sub - prime , Alt - A , and other toxic mortgage products that were only workable so long as housing prices continued to go up .
Homeownership is n’t good or bad .
It is a necessity we all have .
In some areas of the country it is more important to focus on affordable housing and by definition the housing bubble with prices reaching the stratosphere went contrary to this nationwide aspiration .
We do have a crisis not with housing shortages but with affordable housing .
Putting people into dangerous mortgages during hard economic times simply does not make sense .
Take a look at the foreclosure rates during the Great Depression :
What you ’ll notice is that foreclosures peaked during the banking crisis years .
Keep in mind that the market crashed in 1929 and foreclosures did n’t peak until 1933 , almost 4 years later .
Our markets tanked in 2008 so if a similar pattern plays out , we can expect a peak in foreclosures in 2011 or 2012 .
Foreclosures are still on a path upwards and most analyst expect 2009 to be the worst year on record .
We can expect continued market volatility as many retailers trim down and many people find themselves out of work and unable to service their mortgages , many of which will have higher payments .
So we go back to the idea that everyone should be a homeowner .
I would argue that this should n’t be a national economic policy goal .
What we should concern ourselves with is having a sustainable economy first .
Only then , will people choose to pursue homeownership if they wish to do so .
And why should we punish people that do n’t choose to own ?
Currently , renters subsidize a portion of the homeowner mortgage tax deduction since renters receive no benefit from their shelter in terms of taxes .
So by this action alone , we as a society are placing too high of a value on homeownership .
We got carried away this decade and unscrupulous lenders and Wall Street created the environment for a once in a lifetime bubble that has hurt many families .
The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury would like Americans to go back to their spending ways of this decade yet that is simply not feasible .
After all , we all acknowledge that it was a bubble so going back to the heyday would simply be admitting that we want to re-inflate the asset bubble .
What we need is a sustainable nationwide housing mentality and this means that the homeownership rate will continue to decline .
For those who want to be homeowners , they will still be able to do so with more modest terms , a bigger down payment , and actually having to wait maybe one or two years before taking the keys from the bank .
Is that too much to ask ?

Australia 's Minister of Broadband , Communications , and the Digital Economy ( BCDE ) , Stephen Conroy , appears to have recognized that his country 's plan to install mandatory content filters at the ISP level is causing a public backlash .
Conroy has set up several FAQs that describe the program in detail , and has even started defending the program on the departmental blog .
But neither the backlash nor an apparent lack of preparation will stop him from putting the system in operation , as live tests on Internet traffic are set to begin any day now — even though the ISPs that want to participate are n't sure what 's happening .
First , the practicalities .
Initial lab tests of web filtering equipment suggested that the current generation of hardware had appreciable rates of false positives ( filtering legal content ) and false negatives ( allowing illegal content through ) , and several models caused severe degradation of the network 's performance .
This is n't much of a surprise ; as we described in detail , filtering content is a difficult challenge .
The Australian government 's own FAQ also recognizes that anyone with sufficient technical expertise can also evade the filters .
The government 's response to these issues , however , is to plow ahead with live testing of the filtering equipment , using actual customers from any Australian ISPs that choose to participate in the program .
The unusual reasoning behind the decision , published on a different FAQ hosted at the BCDE blog , is as follows : the preliminary lab tests did n't include a simpler form of filtering against a small , static blacklist of sites , which would presumably put less strain in the filtering equipment .
So , since they had n't tested it , it apparently makes sense to Conroy et. al. to simply roll it out to the Internet - using Australian population .
Senator the
Honorable
Stephen Conroy
That FAQ has revealed some other insights into the working logic behind the decision to roll out Internet filters .
Although the previous tests and all public statements on the matter focused on web traffic , the actual live tests are expected to include the use of filters that target P2P applications like BitTorrent .
The blacklist , comprised of somewhat over a thousand sites , will be provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority .
But , in a bit of a catch - 22 , nobody 's allowed to know what sites are on the blacklist — after all , publishing the list would let pervs know where to find the child porn .
The FAQ also tackles the issue of personal responsibility .
Apparently , the government had previously engaged in a multimillion Australian dollar advertising campaign to get people to start using filters on their PCs .
Only about two percent of the households with children present chose to deploy them .
Conroy has apparently concluded that this is an indication that most of the Australian populace is technologically incompetent and needs big brother to step in at the ISP level .
Of course , Conroy would also disagree with the comparison to big brother , because the list nobody 's allowed to see is guaranteed only to contain child porn sites .
Given the fact that the planned tests will be using different techniques than the BCDE 's lab tests , it 's not a surprise that two of Australia 's largest ISPs have decided not to participate in the tests ; an executive at Testra referred to filtering generally as the equivalent of trying to " boil the ocean . "
But news.com.au is reporting that , despite the fact that the government 's FAQ says that the live testing should start in 2008 and will wrap up in the first half of 2009 , the ISPs that are actually interested in taking part in the tests still have n't been notified if and when they will .
So , in summary , it appears that the government is trying to make up for the failure of an earlier PC - based filtering program by rolling out an alternative , ISP - level filtering program that they know wo n't fully prevent access to illegal material .
They promise not to state what sites are being blocked , even as they promise only illegal content will be .
To prepare for the roll out , they 're doing live testing of equipment and protocols they have n't used in the lab , and not telling the ISPs when the program will be ready .
It sounds like all of the worst clichés about government incarnated in a single program .

According to a recent report by the Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCFS ) more than 3,500 pupils are suspended each year due to sexual bullying .
Equating to 19 suspensions each school day , the situation is becoming uncontrollable .
This week Panorama broadcast a programme called Kids Behaving Badly ( which can be viewed on BBC iPlayer ) highlighting the prevalence and severity of sexual misconduct in schools across the UK .
The title , however , was somewhat misleading .
While it suggests boys and girls are equally accountable for this behaviour , what this documentary exposed was the extent to which girls are victims of sexual harassment and physical assault from an increasingly younger age – beginning at nursery school level .
Whereas for boys bullying predominantly takes the form of name - calling , with aspersions cast on their sexuality and sexual premise , girls not only have to contend with this , but also with lewd comments and threatening physical molestation .
“ Gay , ” “ lesbian , ” “ frigid , ” and “ slut ” are used as part of an offence verbal currency ( considered representative of sexual “ abnormality ” ) that boys and girls spend frivolously .
The documentary also found that schoolboys are vulnerable to sexual attack not by schoolgirls , but by their male classmates .
This is a growing problem .
Panorama , in conjunction with the charity Young Voice , conducted a survey of 273 children and youths and found that one in ten 11 - 19 year olds had been sexually bullied , a form of intimidation ranging from rumour - spreading about sexual activity to rape .
Schoolchildren , specifically boys , are using sex as a form of power and control , but why ?
Why are they so sexually aware ?
The programme was disturbing .
One reason given for the growth in incidents was prevailing “ gang culture ” in parts of the country .
Very often boys are encouraged to carry out sex acts for gang membership , and girls are given protection in return for their “ favours . ”
While some girls consent to this , probably believing it ’s easier to concede without fuss , others are forced against their will .
Speaking anonymously , a number of parents relayed their daughter ’s experiences .
One 15 - year - old girl from London was lured into a classroom by a group of boys and physically forced to perform a sex act .
The girl was seriously affected afterwards and was too scared to go to school .
When her parents sought a tutor from the local education authority they were informed that this service was only made available to pupils who had been excluded – more specifically , the girl ’s abusers could have the privilege of a tutor but she could not ( the provision was “ not for victims ” ) .
As a result she transferred schools and feels insecure and scared in busy places ( especially in the presence of groups of boys ) .
A 13 - year - old girl from the south - east spoke of how crass comments made by one of her male peers quickly turned sinister .
He sat next to her in assembly and lessons , stroking her chest and legs .
She tried to ignore it until one day , while queuing for a class , he slid his fingers up her skirt and under her knickers .
Her mother contacted the school and was told that the boy would be spoken to and his parents informed .
It was n’t considered a serious incident .
Furthermore , having reported the episode , the girl was harassed by female classmates .
One “ friend ” told her that everyone would now hate her , since the boy in question “ does it to everyone ” – apparently it was NOT a big deal .
In the west country , the mother of a five - year - old girl considered herself a failure after her daughter was molested by a male classmate .
The police could n’t get involved because of the boy ’s age ( and one does have to wonder why a five - year - old would act this way – what ’s happening at home ? ) .
The little girl was scared and so conceded to his request to go to an empty room with him because she did n’t know what to do .
He said he wanted to touch her and so she let him .
A five - year - old little boy who has yet to go through puberty surely did n’t have these sexual inclinations ?
While I have previously read articles claiming that infants and children do masturbate , presumably this is owing to an innate sexual need and curiosity rather than an act with an overt sexual subtext resulting from sexual attraction to another person ?
That this boy saw his classmate as a sexual object was , then , the result of nurture , not nature .
However , it is she who has had to move schools .
It is she who was mentally scarred and has terrible nightmares .
Children now consider themselves sexual beings from a young age ( well before they are physically mature ) , and as such want to explore their sexualities in a way they feel they are supposed to .
Boys are growing up seeing women as nothing more than toys promising sexual gratification , and the prevailing attitude that this is “ just boys being boys , ” even though it is to the detriment of girls , is investing generations of young women with the belief that this is how they are supposed to be treated and something that has to be accepted .
It is normalising the mistreatment of women .
That schools tend to ignore this behaviour is unacceptable .
While the guilty boys are free to enjoy school with little or no disruption , their female victims are not only mentally and emotionally distressed but have to change their lives and circumstances to be protected from harassment .
They have to bare the onus of responsibility .
It is their education that potentially suffers .
The implicit suggestion is that it is the girls who are at fault since they are the ones who suffer and are punished by often having to move schools , but for what ?
For nothing more than their sex .
For having the audacity to have been born female .
Ridiculous , is n’t it ?
A girl is groped or grabbed between the legs and is penalised for not keeping quiet .
Grown women who are attacked are said to have asked for it – to be deserving – by wearing short skirts .
It is the ease with which girls are positioned as the problem that silences women as they mature , which explains why so many of us are reluctant to speak out when we are sexually harassed in the work place and are raped .
The current school situation suggests that this is only going to get worse .
Paula Telford , spokesperson for the NSPCC , believes that instead of such instances being dismissed as innocent childhood games , effective handling by schools could help to significantly reduce this trend .
While not always the case , she said that this needs to be “ nipped in the bud ” from an early age since a percentage of boys who are overbearingly sexual do mature into aggressive and dangerous sex offenders .
Not all , but enough to suggest that for the greater social good it should not be ignored .
But , where did this problem originate ?
And why is it getting worse ?
That sex can be used as a tool of dominance and control is nothing new .
That popular culture encourages young girls to aspire to sexual maturity and young men to lust after women in order to assert their masculinity has exacerbated the problem in the school yard .
Women are positioned as sexual commodities .
Little ladies can now go to beauty parlours and have treatments and make - overs coveted by women more than three times their age .
Before baby girls can walk mothers are bombarded with advertisements for tiny high - heels , designed to look cute , suggesting a maturity well beyond their years .
Little girls can replicate the sexy styles of twenty - something women , wearing baby mini-skirts and halter - neck tops , knee - high boots and sparkly lip - gloss .
Infants and young children are encouraged to look like smaller versions of grown women , shown - off like designer shoes while everyone speculates about their age .
Since popular culture has promoted the idea that little girls are little dolls , it ’s not surprising that said little girls believe that ’s their worth .
It ’s not surprising that little boys view said little girls as public property , expecting each one to react in an amenable and accommodating way .
Similarly , computer games endorse violence against women .
Female avatars are commonly presented as caricatures of the female form – big - breasted , tiny waisted beauties who must be killed as violently as possible .
Young , impressionable boys are being conditioned to view women as sexual fodder that must obey their every command .
Boys are told they have to be sexually candid and have sex with lots of women to be considered men .
That does n’t make it excusable , but what it does do is explain why these attitudes have filtered through to the playground and , like girls , boys can also be seen as victims of our over - sexed society .
That girls are being denied the right to an education without being sexually harassed does indicate that this has gone too far , but what can be done ?
Innocence , once lost , can never be returned .
While schools can try their best to implement strategies to educate boys and girls about the ways to behave socially , this is a band - aid rather than a long - term solution .
Girls can be encouraged to step forward and share their experiences in a non-judgemental environment ( this should go without saying , anyway ) , but that sexual misconduct is flourishing in the playground suggests that maybe it ’s too late for a reprieve ?
In early April of last year , at a conference in Jerusalem of American evangelicals organized by Pastor John Hagee , Benjamin Netanyahu told the audience that Israel had no better friends than America 's Christian Zionists .
" This is a friendship of the heart , a friendship of common roots , and a friendship of common civilization , " Netanyahu said .
Now , nearly a year later , with Netanyahu cobbling together a ruling coalition in Israel , three men of the US Christian Right , Pastor John Hagee , Michael D. Evans , and Joel C. Rosenberg -- all of whom have had long - term associations with the prime minister - to - be - - may feel like they 're about to be handed the keys to the Promised Land .
All three have had bestselling books related to the Middle East and apocalyptic theology , have raised significant amounts of money for Israeli charities ( although how much of that money reaches the poor and needy has been questioned ) , lobbied heavily in support of policies advanced by Israel 's right wing , and opposed The Road Map to Peace .
To one degree or another , they are all leaders in the broad movement known as Christian Zionism , now estimated to be about 40 million strong .
The End of the World as We Know It
Pastor John Hagee , the San Antonio - based preacher who presides over a multimillion dollar ministry , has been cooling his heels since taking a drubbing from the mainstream press last year after saying Jews had caused the Holocaust .
" The end of the world as we know it is rapidly approaching , " Hagee wrote in his 2006 book , Jerusalem Countdown : A Warning to the World .
" Just before us is a nuclear countdown with Iran , " he wrote , " followed by Ezekiel 's war [ as described in Ezekiel , chapters 38 and 39 ] , and then the final battle -- the battle of Armageddon . "
The same year , Hagee founded Christians United for Israel , one of the largest Christian grassroots movements in America .
It hosts a yearly July Washington - Israel Summit in Washington DC , and a biannual solidarity summit in Israel .
During an interview last year , Glenn Beck asked Hagee : " You had several meetings with fairly prominent individuals .
You 've met with Benjamin Netanyahu .
Have you had enough conversations with these people to tell them that you believe that we 're living in the end times , and what is their reaction ? "
Hagee replied that Netanyahu had come to visit him in his " office " and that they " have talked about the geopolitical circumstances of the Middle East . "
Hagee went on :
Benjamin Netanyahu sat just across my desk and told me that when he was prime minister , he had to give photographic proof to the United States intelligence agencies to convince them that Russia was in Iran helping them produce long - range missiles .
Now , those long - range missiles would have the ability to hit London , New York , and Jerusalem , and right now Israel .
Iran is trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons and if they can put nuclear warheads on these missiles , can you imagine , Glenn , a world where London , New York , and Jerusalem have been hit by a nuclear missile on the same day .
That 's the nightmare scenario that Ahmadinejad is trying to put together and he 's dangerously close to doing it .
Because Benjamin and I are So Close
The subject line of a recent Mike Evans newsletter read " Send your congratulations to Benjamin Netanyahu . "
It asked supporters to " Sign the letter of congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu , " and Evans , founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Team , pledged that he would " personally present it to him . "
In a Washington Times op - ed piece dated February 22 , Evans talked about meeting a " quiet , almost shy " Netanyahu in 1982 , and he writes that he " was so impressed " with him " that the following day I asked Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his senior adviser Reuben Hecht to offer ...
Netanyahu a position in government .
I said , ' Someday this young man will be the prime minister of Israel . '
Mr. Begin smiled and asked the identity of this competing prime minister .
I did not relate this to Benjamin Netanyahu until he asked me about the meeting some 20 years later . "
These days , Evans is vigorously urging his supporters to traipse over to Amazon.com to buy his latest book Jimmy Carter : The Liberal Left and World Chaos : A Carter / Obama Plan That Will Not Work ( Time Worthy Books ) .
The book mocks and belittles former President Carter 's efforts working for peace in the Middle East .
Although the book resided at # 4713 in " Books " in early March , a couple of recent appearances on the Fox News Channel provided a book - buying surge , driving it to # 1 in the " Leadership " category , and # 2 in " Middle East . "
In an early March e-mail , Evans reported on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's trip to the Middle East .
Clinton " called for urgent action by Arabs , Israelis , and the international community to break the cycle of Mideast violence and to move toward a comprehensive peace in the region , " Evans noted .
What this really means , according to Evans , is " that Israel would be forced to give up East Jerusalem , and the holy sites beloved by Christians worldwide , as well as most of Judea and Samaria . "
Evans also pointed out that Netanyahu would soon be traveling to Washington to meet with President Obama and that he " want[s ] to present him with one million signers of the letter asking him not to allow Jerusalem to be bartered , " wrote Evans .
" Because Benjamin and I are so close , I am in a position to personally place your letter in his hands .
I would like him to be able to tell the president how many people have contacted him about this subject . "
The Joshua Fund
" The big question for Netanyahu , however , may not be how best to form his government , but how his government -- whatever form it takes -- will interact with President Barack Obama , given the deep fissures between the two men over how to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear - armed power , " Joel C. Rosenberg recently wrote on his blog .
Rosenberg , who used to work for Netanyahu and runs a charity called The Joshua Fund , also said :
Based on my conversations with Israel 's next Prime Minister , I believe Netanyahu fundamentally understands the apocalyptic , genocidal Islamic eschatology driving Iran 's current leaders .
By contrast , I am convinced that President Obama or Secretary of State Clinton do not understand at all the End Times beliefs of the current leaders of Iran , and are thus making wrong policy choices based on their lack of understanding .
Let us pray , therefore , that as Mr. Netanyahu forms his government and then meets with President Obama and top US leaders that he is able to help American officials understand who they are dealing with in Tehran , and find a way to work together to stop Iran before it is too late .
Rosenberg , the author of Epicenter : Why The Current Rumblings in the Middle East Will Change Your Future , recently announced that he will host the 2009 Epicenter Conference .
The confab will " examine several rising global geopolitical and economic crises in light of Bible prophecy . "
Scheduled speakers include Rosenberg , the controversial Lt. - General ( retired ) Jerry Boykin , former commander of the Army 's elite Delta Force and former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence , and Pastor Chuck Smith , Bible teacher , author , radio host , and prophecy expert .
" With wars and rumors of wars dominating the Middle East , the eyes of the world are riveted on Israel , Iran and their neighbors , the epicenter of the dramatic events that are shaping our world and shaking our future , " said Rosenberg :
Americans are reading apocalyptic headlines out of the Middle East .
They are looking for answers to questions like ,
Is there any chance of peace in the Middle East in the near future , or are we headed toward even more catastrophic wars ?
Why are Iran 's leaders saying the end of the world is near , and the way to hasten the coming of the Islamic Messiah is to annihilate the U.S. and Israel ?
What happens if Iran gets nuclear weapons ?
Why is Russia helping Iran go nuclear ?
How will coming events in the Middle East affect us as Americans , economically and geopolitically ?
Were the global crises we see unfolding today foretold thousands of years ago by the Hebrew prophets ?
And given the urgency of such crises , is there any hope in the world today ?
Over the years , Hagee , Evans , and Rosenberg have all cultivated and maintained relationships with Netanyahu .
How the new prime minister will relate to his longtime Christian Right supporters now that he will be steering the ship of state remains to be seen .
For now , however , it appears that their cups runneth over with possibilities .

Um , shall we say Melanie Collins is having a good year ?
She graduates from Penn State in 2008 , reveals bikini modeling photos to the world , lands job at NBA TV and now in early 2009 Busted Coverage discovers that she is dating up - and - coming Philadelphia Flyers ’ Scottie Upshall .
That is pretty much the WAG trifecta .
Not only is she making a name for herself via an actual career , there is also jet setting involved with a highly compensated professional athlete .
We can only assume there is jewelry , clothes and lavish resort spas involved .
Please adjust your WAG rankings accordingly .
Our researchers got a tip last night that Upshall and Collins have been involved and he ’s even been calling her his girlfriend in media interviews .
There are even Internet message boards lighting up at the news .
Upshall seems to be the Golden Boy for Flyers ’ fan .
Female hockey groupies are destroyed by this news .
You know the type .
They are about 40 - 50 pounds overweight , wear their jerseys to every game , have those 80 ’s bangs and hang out near the players exit hoping some lonely Canadian rookie will make eye contact .
These are the same women who know every single bar the players frequent .
Just a few of the comments coming from Philly Rink Rats :
his girl looks like a drag queen
More …
the only guys commenting how good looking she is are old fat men with no lives sitting behind their computer screens down in their mommys basement .
my guy friends think she looks like a man and they are very goodlooking men .
More ….
all I know is Melanie relaly ( SIC ) looks like she does steroids , way to much testosterone she ’s not signed with an agency .
she ’s a wannabe .
i mean anybody can do that temple 12 thing , as long as you are n’t 200 pounds .
Hmm , this WAG development seems to have struck a nerve with those who are likely out of work and live in Norristown .
We happen to like this situation .
Upshall , to refresh your memory , is the same guy who once did n’t deny his days of having three - somes while on a Philly radio show .
This could be the top American WAG relationship of the year .
We ’ll be along for the ride .

In What is automatic differentiation , and why does it work ? , I gave a semantic model that explains what automatic differentiation ( AD ) accomplishes .
Correct implementations then flowed from that model , by applying the principle of type class morphisms .
( An instance ’s interpretation is the interpretation ’s instance ) .
I ’ve had a nagging discomfort about the role of the chain rule in AD , with an intuition that the chain rule can carry a more central role the the specification and implementation .
This post gives a variation on the previous AD post that carries the chain rule further into the reasining and implementation , leading to simpler correctness proofs and a nearly unaltered implementation .
Finally , as a bonus , I ’ll show how GHC rewrite rules enable an even simpler and more modular implementation .
I ’ve included some optional content , including exercises .
You can see my answers to the exercises by examining the HTML .
As before , I ’ll start with a limited form of differentiation that works for functions of a scalar ( 1D ) domain , where one can identify derivative values with regular values :
deriv :: Num a => ( a -> a ) -> ( a -> a ) -- simplification
The development below extends to higher - order derivatives and higher - dimensional domains .
The chain rule
At the heart of AD is the chain rule :
deriv ( g . f ) x == deriv g ( f x ) * deriv f x
Equivalently ,
deriv ( g . f ) == ( deriv g . f ) * deriv f
where this ( * ) is on functions : ( *) = lift A2 ( * ) == h k x -> h x * k x .
The traditional forward AD formulation is based on the chain rule but is not as symmetric as the chain rule .
In the function compositions g .
f considered , g is always simple , while f may be arbitrarily complex .
( I think the reverse true for reverse - mode AD . )
What might we find if we delay introducing this asymmetry ?
A direct implementation of the chain rule
The chain rule applies to functions and their derivatives , so let ’s formulate a direct implementation .
Start with a type for holding two functions :
data FD a = FD ( a -> a ) ( a -> a )
FD is used to hold functions and their derivatives :
toFD :: ( a -> a ) ->
FD a toFD f = FD f ( deriv f )
We do not have an implementation of deriv , so to FD here is part of the specification only , not the implementation .
Now we can specify a composition operator on FD :
( ~.~ ) :: FD a -> FD a -> FD a
We ’ll want ( ~.~ ) to represent composition of functions , where we have access to the derivatives as well .
That is , ( ~.~ ) must satisfy :
toFD ( g . f ) == to FD g ~.~ toFD f
The implementation and its correctness follow from the chain rule :
FD g g' ~.~ FD f f ' = FD ( g . f ) ( ( g ' . f ) * f ' )
Exercise : Fill in the proof that ( ~.~ ) satisfies its specification .
toFD ( g . f ) == {- def of toFD -} FD ( g . f ) ( deriv ( g . f ) ) == {- chain rule -} FD ( g . f ) ( ( deriv g . f ) * deriv f ) == {- def of ( ~.~ ) -} FD g ( deriv g ) ~.~ FD f ( deriv f ) == {- def of toFD -} toFD g ~.~ toFD f
( Exercise solutions are in the post ’s HTML . )
From function to values
The FD type and its composition operator implement the chain rule quite directly .
However , they are not suitable for AD , which operates on the values ( range ) of a function and of its derivative .
Let ’s start over with the usual AD value representation :
data D a = D a a
Previously , I defined this ideal construction function :
toD :: ( a -> a ) -> a ->
D a toD f x = D ( f x ) ( deriv f x ) -- or toD == lift A2 D f ( deriv f )
Instead , let ’s now define toD in terms of toFD .
First , how do the FD and D representations relate ?
fdAt :: FD a -> ( a -> D a ) fdAt ( FD f f ' ) = lift A2 D f f '
Then we can define toD :
toD = fdAt .
toFD
Exercise : Show that these definitions of toD are equivalent .
Expanding , toD f == fdAt ( toFD f ) == fdAt ( FD f ( deriv f ) ) == lift A2 D f ( deriv f ) == x -> D ( f x ) ( deriv f x )
Again , toD is n’t executable with this definition , because toFD is n’t ( because deriv is n’t ) .
As before , toD must be eliminated in our journey from specification to implementation .
Optional :
We can also define an odd sort of inverse for toD : fromD :: D a -> a -> ( a -> a ) fromD must satisfy , for all x , toD ( fromD d x ) x == d It ’s more convenient to relate flipped version of toD and fromD : toD ' :: a -> ( a -> a ) -> D a fromD ' :: a -> D a -> ( a -> a ) toD ' = flip toD fromD ' = flip fromD
Then fromD must satisfy , for all x , toD ' x .
fromD ' x == id Exercise : Give a simple definition for fromD and show that it ’s correct ( satisfies its specification ) .
Define fromD ( D a a ’ ) x = t -> a + a’ * ( t – x )
Then toD ( fromD ( D a a ’ ) x ) x == D ( fromD ( D a a ’ ) x ) ( deriv ( fromD ( D a a ’ ) ) x ) == D (( t -> a + a’ * ( t – x ) ) x ) ( deriv ( t -> a + a’ * ( t – x ) ) x ) == D a ( deriv ( t -> a + a’ * ( t – x ) ) x ) == D a ( ( t -> a ’ ) x ) == D a a ’
A general , value - friendly chain rule
In What is AD …? , I defined correctness of the numeric class instances D by saying that toD must be a type class morphism for each of the numeric classes it implements .
For example , let ’s take the sin method .
The other unary methods will work just like it .
The morphism property :
toD ( sin u ) == sin ( toD u )
Because of numeric overloading on functions , this property is equivalent to a more explicit one :
toD ( sin . u ) == sin .
toD u
The sin on the left is on numbers , and the sin on the right is on D a .
Let ’s suppose we have a function adiff ( for automatic differentiation ) such that for all g and f ,
toD ( g . f ) == adiff g .
toD f -- specification of adiff adiff :: Num => ( a -> a ) -> ( D a -> D a )
Then our goal would become
adiff sin .
toD u == sin .
toD u
and a correct definition of sin would be immediate , as would be the other definitions :
sin = adiff sin sqrt = adiff sqrt ...
Note that the adiff specification above implies that for all g ,
toD g == adiff g .
toD id
Exercise :
Show that a necessary and sufficient definition for adiff satisfying its specification is adiff g ( D a a ' ) = D ( g a ) ( deriv g a * a ' )
Derive this definition of adiff from its specification .
Proof details : First , sufficient .
LHS : toD ( g . f ) == {- toD def -} lift A2 D ( g . f ) ( deriv ( g . f ) ) == {- chain rule -} lift A2 D ( g . f ) ( ( deriv g . f ) * deriv f ) == {- lift A2 on functions -} x -> D ( g ( f x ) ) ( deriv g ( f x ) * deriv f x ) RHS : adiff g .
toD f == {- toD def -} adiff g . x -> D ( f x ) ( deriv f x ) == {- (. ) def -} x -> adiff g ( D ( f x ) ( deriv f x ) )
The definition then falls out mechanically ( with [ second order pattern matching ] [ ] ) .
Next , necessary .
adiff g dd@( D a a ’ ) == {- toD / fromD -} adiff g ( toD ( fromD dd x ) x ) == {- adiff spec -} toD ( g . fromD dd x ) x == {- toD def -} D ( g ( fromD dd x x ) ) ( deriv ( g . fromD dd x ) x ) == {- chain rule -} D ( g ( fromD dd x x ) ) ( deriv g ( fromD dd x x ) * deriv ( fromD dd x ) x ) == {- fromD spec -} D ( g a ) ( deriv g a * a ’ )
The adiff function satisfies a more symmetric property as well .
It distributes over composition :
adiff ( h . g ) == adiff h .
adiff g
Exercise : Prove it this property from the specification .
Here ’s a proof from the definition .
Start from the right - hand side : ( adiff h . adiff g ) ( D a a ’ ) == {- (. ) def -} adiff h ( adiff g ( D a a ’ ) ) == {- adiff def -} adiff h ( D ( g a ) ( deriv g a * a ’ ) ) == {- adiff def -} D ( h ( g a ) ) ( deriv h ( g a ) * ( deriv g a * a ’ ) ) == {- associativity of ( * ) -} D ( h ( g a ) ) ( ( deriv h ( g a ) * deriv g a ) * a ’ ) == {- chain rule -} D ( h ( g a ) ) ( deriv ( h . g ) a * a ’ ) == {- (. ) def -} D ( (h . g ) a ) ( deriv ( h . g ) a * a ’ ) == {- adiff def -} adiff ( h . g ) ( D a a ’)
Alternatively , prove from the specification alone :
For all `h` , `g` , `f` , adiff ( h . g ) .
toD f == {- adiff spec -} toD ( (h . g ) . f ) == {- (. ) associativity -} toD ( h . ( g . f ) ) == {- adiff spec -} adiff h .
toD ( g . f ) == {- adiff spec -} adiff h .
( adiff g . toD f ) == {- (. ) associativity -} ( adiff h . adiff g ) .
toD f So `adiff ( h . g ) ` and `( adiff h . adiff g ) ` agree on `t oD f x` for all `f` and `x` .
Given an arbitrary ` D` value `dd` , choose an arbitrary `x` .
Then adiff ( h . g ) dd == adiff ( h . g ) ( toD ( fromD dd x ) x ) == ( adiff h . adiff g ) ( toD ( fromD dd x ) x ) == ( adiff h . adiff g ) dd
Moreover , adiff maps the identity to the identity : adiff id = id .
Exercise :
Show that for any definition of adiff , if for all g , toD g == adiff g .
toD id and if for all h and g adiff ( h . g ) == adiff h .
adiff g then our adiff specification holds , i.e. , for g and f , adiff g .
toD f == toD ( g . f )
toD ( g . f ) == {- first assumption -} adiff ( g . f ) .
toD id == {- second assumption -} ( adiff g . adiff f ) .
toD id == {- associativity of (. ) -} adiff g .
( adiff f . toD id ) == {- first assumption -} adiff g .
toD f
Back to an implementation
We ’re still not quite done , since adiff depends on deriv , which does n’t have an implementation .
Let ’s separate out the problematic deriv by refactoring adiff :
adiff g = g >-< deriv g
where
infix 0 >-< (>-<) :: Num a => ( a -> a ) -> ( a -> a ) -> ( D a -> D a ) ( g >-< g ')
( D a a ' ) = D ( g a ) ( g ' a * a ' )
After inlining this definition of adiff , the method definitions are
sin = sin >-< deriv sin sqrt = sqrt >-< deriv sqrt ...
Every remaining use of deriv is applied to a function whose derivative is known , so we can replace each use .
sin = sin >-< cos sqrt = sqrt >-< recip ( 2 * sqrt ) ...
Now we have an executable implementation again .
These method definitions and the definition of ( >-<) are exactly as in What is automatic differentiation , and why does it work ?.
Fun with rules
Let ’s back up to our more elegant method definitions using adiff :
sin = adiff sin sqrt = adiff sqrt ...
We made these definitions executable in spite of their appeal to the non-executable deriv by ( a ) refactoring adiff to split the deriv from the residual function ( >-<) , ( b ) inlining adiff , and ( c ) rewriting applications of deriv with known derivative rules .
Now let ’s get GHC to do these steps for us .
List the derivatives of known functions :
{-# RULES " deriv negate " deriv negate = - 1 " deriv abs " deriv abs = signum " deriv signum " deriv signum = 0 " deriv recip " deriv recip = - sqr recip " deriv exp " deriv exp = exp " deriv log " deriv log = recip " deriv sqrt " deriv sqrt = recip ( 2 * sqrt ) " deriv sin " deriv sin = cos " deriv cos " deriv cos = - sin " deriv asin " deriv asin = recip ( sqrt ( 1 - sqr ) ) " deriv acos " deriv acos = recip (- sqrt ( 1 - sqr ) ) " deriv atan " deriv atan = recip ( 1+sqr ) " deriv sinh " deriv sinh = cosh " deriv cosh " deriv cosh = sinh " deriv asinh " deriv asinh = recip ( sqrt ( 1+sqr ) ) " deriv acosh " deriv acosh = recip (- sqrt ( sqr - 1 ) ) " deriv atanh " deriv atanh = recip ( 1 - sqr ) #-}
Notice that these definitions are simpler and more modular than the standard differentiation rules , as they do not have the chain rule mixed in .
For instance , compare ( a ) deriv sin = cos , ( b ) deriv ( sin u ) == cos u * deriv u , and ( c ) deriv ( sin u ) x == cos u x * deriv u x .
Now we can use the incredibly simple adiff - based definitions of our methods , e.g. , asin = adiff asin .
The definition of adiff must get inlined so as to reveal the deriv applications , which then get rewritten according to the rules .
Fortunately , the adiff definition is tiny , which encourages its inlining .
We could add an INLINE pragma as a reminder .
GHC requires that a definition must be given deriv , even it all uses are rewritten away , so use the following
deriv = error " deriv : undefined .
Missing rewrite rule ? "
In What is automatic differentiation , and why does it work ? , I gave a semantic model that explains what automatic differentiation ( AD ) accomplishes .
Correct implementations then flowed from that model , by ...
As the green movement sweeps the globe , companies , trade groups and government organizations are eager to get a piece of the pie .
‘ Green ’ can definitely translate into big profits if you do it right – but all too often , these money - hungry entities choose to fudge the facts in an attempt to make themselves seem more environmentally friendly and responsible than they really are .
That ’s called greenwashing , folks , and here are 10 of the world ’s worst offenders .
BP
BP ’s ad campaign with the theme ‘ Beyond Petroleum ’ led the public to believe the company was headed in the direction of cleaner , renewable fuels .
But , it turned out the company was spending more money on advertising than on green efforts , leading Treehugger to ask , “ What does BP stand for these days ?
Beyond Propaganda ?
Bye - Bye Planet ? Bad Pollution ? ”
After all those greenwashing ads , BP went and dropped $ 3 billion to buy into oil from the Alberta Tar Sands .
Each barrel of oil out of the tar sands generates about two thirds of a ton of CO2 , meaning BP ’s 200,000 barrels a day will generate about 127,000 tons per day .
American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity
Clean coal is n’t just a contradiction in terms – it ’s propaganda .
The ‘ Clean Coal ’ message has been brought to us by none other than a front group for the coal industry – the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity .
ACCCE gathered up tons of money from the coal and utility industries and used it to fund a far - reaching effort to convince people that coal can be used in a way that ’s not harmful to the environment .
ACCCE membership includes Peabody Coal , Duke Energy , Southern Company and American Electric Power and , as we all know , there is nothing clean about coal .
General Motors
Watching these two videos one after the other , General Motors ’ unabashed attempt to hype its green cred while also selling Hummers speaks for itself .
GM ’s ‘ Gas - Friendly to Gas - Free ’ ad campaign sought to reframe GM as eco-friendly , but the company is still the leading producer of gas - guzzling vehicles and has fought to undermine attempts to improve CAFE fuel economy standards .
ExxonMobil
It ’s not surprising that oil companies are among the worst greenwashing offenders : they ’re used to making billions off dirty energy , and they ’re getting scared that their revenue streams are going to drop off a cliff once renewables are firmly established .
Over the past few years , ExxonMobil has launched a number of ad campaigns touting their supposed new - found commitment to renewable energy and the environment .
Yet , ExxonMobil has consistently funded the climate denial industry for decades , including the Heartland Institute , the Heritage Foundation , the George C Marshall Institute and the American Enterprise Institute .
These organizations have colluded with the Bush administration to discredit the EPA ’s efforts to fight climate change and offered scientists $ 10,000 to undermine the findings of the 2007 IPCC report .
ExxonMobil finally stopped funding many of these organizations in the past few years , but the energy giant still does n’t live up to the rosy impression they ’re forcing upon us through these ad campaigns .
It is spending just $ 300 million over the next 10 years researching potential energy sources ( many of which are not renewable ) .
Compare that to the $ 47 billion they spent between 2003 and 2006 developing oil and gas .
Monsanto
Monsanto , the world ’s largest seed and pesticide company , is working to convince us that they are supporters of sustainable agriculture – all while monopolizing and homogenizing the world ’s food supply .
Hardly sustainable .
Monsanto , the maker of toxic pesticide RoundUp , has a long history of producing genetically modified seeds , including ‘ terminator ’ seeds that cannot reproduce on their own , forcing farmers to go back to Monsanto again and again for more seeds .
They ’re also the creators of rGBH ( recombinant bovine growth hormone ) , which is given to cows to increase production and often ends up in our water supply .
Check out the documentary ‘ The World According to Monsanto ’ for an in - depth look at Monsanto ’s practices and the threat they pose to the global food supply .
Monsanto : “ No food will be grown that we do n’t own ! ”
Malaysian Palm Oil Council
The companies that make palm oil - based products like soap and margarine do n’t want you to know that these things are coming to you at the expense of rainforests in southeast Asia .
The Malaysian Palm Oil Council is troubled by all of those pesky reports detailing how rainforests are cut down to make way for palm oil plantations , destroying the habitats of animals like orangutans .
In short , there ’s nothing even remotely sustainable about it – but that did n’t stop Malaysian palm oil producers from running a series of ads with the tagline “ Sustainably Produced Since 1917 ” .
American Electric Power
This utility giant falsely advertised itself as environmentally friendly and concerned about wildlife and animal habitats , while simultaneously destroying those habitats with its emissions , which contribute to air pollution , acid rain , global warming and mercury poisoning .
American Electric Power is also one of the companies behind the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity .
Dow Chemical
Dow Chemical wants us to think they ’re an environmentally responsible company with the best interests of humans and the environment at heart .
But since its inception in the 1890s , Dow has polluted property and poisoned thousands of people .
Dow created Agent Orange , and its subsidiary Union Carbide was responsible for the world ’s worst industrial disaster in Bhopal , India .
Dow Chemical has never taken responsibility for or cleaned up the poisonous gas disaster in Bhopal , which killed 8,000 people within two weeks and caused the deaths of an additional 8,000 people in the years since due to gas - related diseases .
Dow Chemical is also skirting its responsibility to clean up the dioxin contamination in the Tittabawasee and Saginaw Rivers in Michigan , claiming that scientific proof does not exist that dioxins are harmful to humans .
Dow has been dumping these chemicals in the rivers for more than a century .
So much for their regard for “ The Human Element ” .
Fur Council of Canada
The Fur Council of Canada thought they could pull the dead animal fur over our eyes by claiming that “ fur is green ” .
Yes , they really said that .
They claim that fur is “ natural , renewable , recyclable , biodegradable and energy efficient . ”
They even went so far as to call it “ the ultimate eco clothing ” .
PETA naturally had a response to that : “ It takes more than 60 times as much energy to produce a fur coat from ranch - raised animals than it does to produce a fake fur .
Plus , the waste produced on fur farms poisons our waterways .
And do n’t forget … unlike faux fur , the “ real thing ” causes millions of animals to suffer every year . ”
Fiji Water
The quality of most bottled water is no better than tap water , and more than 2 billion plastic bottles end up in the waste stream in America every year .
But , that does n’t stop bottlers like Fiji from claiming that bottled water can be green .
The website FIJIGreen.com touts the company ’s “ progress ” , buying carbon offsets and increasing recycling efforts .
That ’s all fine and good , but the simple fact of the matter is that Fiji water still travels halfway around the world .
That ’s a lot of wasted fossil fuels , and a lot of emissions .
ComputerTan.com - which went viral two months ago - claims it is a " revolutionary online tanning service . "
The website appears to be devoted to sun worshippers who want to “ look great in the office ” .
And it promises sun-starved Brits a " free five - minute tan trial " by transmitting ultraviolet rays through their laptops and PC monitors .
It even advertises a downloadable application for mobile phone tanning .
But when users click to access the trial , bars from a sun-bed appear on the screen with a warning which reads : " Do n’t be fooled - UV Exposure Can Kill . "
Shocking photographs of skin cancers also flash up on the screen , alongside a link to Skcin.org - the cancer charity behind the hoax .
Discovery 's Surprise : Did Bat Hitch a Ride to Space ?
Little winged mammal clung to Discovery 's fuel tank at liftoff .
HOUSTON , March 17 , 2009  --
The bat , seen clinging to the external fuel tank of the Space Shuttle Discovery before its launch on Sunday , apparently clung for dear life to the side of the tank as the spaceship lifted off .
And what a ride .
The shuttle accelerates to an orbital velocity of 17,500 milers per hour , which is 25 times faster than the speed of sound , in just over eight minutes .
That 's zero to 100 mph in 10 seconds .
Did it make it into space ?
No one knows yet .
But photos of Discovery as it cleared the launch tower showed a tiny speck on the side of the tank .
When those photos were blown up , it became apparent that the speck was a bat .
Flight director Paul Dye said no one has seen the bat since .
" I heard that it was clinging to the tank at liftoff , but I do n't think anyone has seen it since , " he said .
Launch controllers spotted the bat after it had clawed onto the foam of the external tank as Discovery stood at Cape Canaveral 's Launch Pad 39A .
The temperature never dropped below 60 degrees at that part of the tank , and infrared cameras showed that the bat was 70 degrees through the launch .
The final inspection team that surveys the outside of the shuttle and tank for signs of ice buildup hoped the bat would wake up and fly away before the shuttle engines ignited .
The bat is the one goofy moment in a mission that has been flawless so far -- at least after a few gliches forced the launch to be postponed .
STS 119 was delayed repeatedly while engineers struggled with hydrogen fuel control valves , and later , a hydrogen fuel leak , but the launch Sunday was flawless and the mission so far is going as planned .
Discovery docked to the International Space Station and later this week will install the final truss and solar arrays to give the orbiting lab more power , which will allow the crew to expand from three to six .
The CV - 22 , the special operations version of the controversial Osprey tiltrotor , is now ready to take on combat missions for the first time .
Capt .
Laura Ropelis , an Air Force Special Operations Command spokeswoman , confirmed to DANGER ROOM that the first CV - 22 squadron was certified " initial operation capable " as of this month .
Translated into plain English , that means the CV - 22 can now be employed effectively as a weapons system ( and that " full " capability may be declared further down the road ) .
It 's a milestone that 's been almost thirty years in the making .
The requirements for the CV - 22 emerged in part from the lessons of Operation Eagle Claw , the failed attempt to rescue hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran .
The CV - 22 is customized for commando missions ( long - range infiltration , extraction and resupply ) and can fly much farther and faster than any helicopter .
In theory , an Osprey - type aircraft would have allowed planners to attempt the mission in one pass , rather than orchestrating the complex landing - and - refueling mission that led to the debacle at Desert One .
The special operations community has already put the new machines through their paces in exercises .
The aircraft also took part in a real - world operation , assisting the Coast Guard last year in a freighter rescue during Hurricane Ike ; Ospreys of Air Force Special Operations Command also took part in Flintlock 2008 , a joint military exercise in West Africa last November .
Incidentally , the Marine Corps version of the bird , the MV - 22 , has already seen service in Iraq ; the Marines are now weighing whether to send the aircraft to Afghanistan later this year .

A plane circling Lower Manhattan escorted by two fighter jets is part of a " photo op , " said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters .
The event caused some evacuations of office buildings in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City , N.J. , on Monday morning .
Mr. Peters said the Defense Department is conducting a photo op that involves deploying two F - 16s and escorting a Boeing 747 in the vicinity of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty .
He said the maneuver is not an emergency and was coordinated in advance with the FAA and state and local officials .
" Theyll do two or three spins and be done by 10:30 , " Mr. Peters said .
Kevin Chin , a 25 - year - old IT analyst with UBS working in Jersey City , N.J. was in the building when his coworker Yumi Nishiyama snapped this picture ( above ) at around 9:40 a.m. on her iPhone .
" We did n't know what was going on until later on , " said Chin , who did not evacuate the building .
Update : According to Reuters , the plane involved was one of President Barack Obama 's backup aircraft .
The wire service reported that Obama was not on board .
The " aerial photo mission , " conducted by the Air Force 's Presidential Airlift Group was supposed to be in the area of Lower Manhattan and New Jersey for around 30 minutes .
It involved one 747 and one F - 16 fighter jet , said Vicki Stein , an Air Force spokeswoman .
" You would have to ask the White House the specifics on the mission , " Stein said .
Update : The Staten Island Advance has some pictures of the plane as it was going over the island .

In the late 1800s , the Brooklyn Bridge was built with no power tools , no heavy machinery , and only a basic , evolving understanding of how to make steel .
It ’s not these facts , but the stories surrounding the facts that inspire me when I take a good , long stare at a suspension bridge .
But first …
Stunning .
In a good bridge , I see the defiant end result of how some of my favorite engineering stories begin :
“ I ’m sure you can arrange an impressive line of people who say it ’s impossible .
I take personal joy in ignoring those who say no . ”
“ Yes , halfway through this project we ’ll discover the impossible , but we know how to build through the impossible .
Impossible is when we do our best work . ”
“ Trust me when I say that I can close my eyes and see the end result , and when you can see it , too , you will be amazed . ”
Ignore the No . When Brooklyn and New York ’s population was booming at the end of the 19th century , the best way to get to and from Brooklyn was via ferries .
As solutions were considered , I ’m sure there were those who simply thought , “ More boats ! ”
These ardent defenders of the status quo were not engineers — they were the business .
Their goal was not to build something great , but to make a profit .
It was an engineer named John Roebling who proposed a suspension bridge .
We take bridges for granted now , but back in the 1800s , bridges were in beta .
They fell .
One out of every four bridges … fell .
He convinced them by designing a bridge half again as big as any before it that was six times stronger than he estimated it need to be .
Roebling designed the complete specification for the bridge in a mere three months and then died of tetanus from an injury he received surveying the bridge site .
Discover the impossible .
Both of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are in the water of the East River .
Ever wonder how you dig a big hole in the bottom of a river bed ?
In the late 1800s ?
It ’s called a caisson , which is a huge , watertight wooden box half the size of a city block .
This monstrosity was constructed on the river , sealed with pine tar , and carefully floated to a specific location on the river .
It was then slowly sunk to the riverbed by placing stone on top that would eventually become the foundation .
Done , right ?
Wrong .
With the caisson on the riverbed , it ’s time to push it another 45 feet into the riverbed in search of bedrock .
Workers did this through the continued application of stone to the top while workers in the caisson dug out the riverbed with shovels , buckets , and , when necessary , dynamite .
There was nothing resembling an electrical grid , so there was nothing resembling modern lighting in this watertight pine - tarred box , which was slowly descending through the floor of the East River .
There were no jack hammers , so when they hit rock , they used small amounts of dynamite to crack these rocks .
In a pine - tarred box , at the bottom of a river , mostly in a very wet dark .
And when the caisson finally hit bedrock 45 feet underground , they had to do it all over again for the New York tower .
30 feet deeper .
You will be amazed .
With his father killed via an accident early in the surveying process , it was Washington Roebling , John ’s son , who was chief engineer .
He did the balance of this work bedridden in Brooklyn Heights , suffering from caisson disease , which he acquired working in the caisson as it descended into the New York - side of the East River .
It ’s not technically a disease ; it ’s decompression sickness or the bends , and it forced him to monitor all of the work from a window in his bedroom .
He relayed detailed instructions via his wife , Emily , who effectively managed a cadre of politicians , competing engineers , and anyone else working on the bridge for over a decade .
As the New York caisson descended further than its Brooklyn counterpart , the incidents of the bends increased , killing two men .
With no bedrock in sight , Roebling used his knowledge of geology and mineralogy to make an amazing decision : stop digging .
It was n’t bedrock , but it was compacted sand .
The New York tower . 78 feet deep into the riverbed .
Resting on sand .
It has n’t moved .
We Are Defined By What We Build
The Brooklyn Bridge was built from 1870 until 1883 .
A quick history refresher : five years after we finished shooting each other in the American Civil War , we started building this :
Three years after that , work started on another :
And before the Williamsburg Bridge was even done , work started on the Manhattan Bridge :
These are the words and the stories I hear in the Brooklyn Bridge : enthusiasm , audacity , impossibility , and amazement .
More importantly , I see a work of bare utility with a palpable sense of confidence , an equilibrium with nature , and a beauty that only grows with time .
We are defined by what we build .
It ’s not just the engineering ambition that designed these structures , nor the 20 people who died building the Brooklyn Bridge .
It ’s that we believe we can and decide to act .
I ’m happy to report our new President agrees when he says ,
“ In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given .
It must be earned .
Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less .
It has not been the path for the faint - hearted — for those who prefer leisure over work , or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame .
Rather , it has been the risk - takers , the doers , the makers of things — some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom . ”
Someone , sometime soon is going to start describing the climb out of this impressive hole we ’ve dug for ourselves , and they ’re going to call it “ America 2.0 ” .
Clever , yes .
We need a new version of ourselves and that ’s going to involve bright , unexpected ideas from those we least expect them from , and they ’re going to strike you as impossible .
All you need to do to understand these terrifyingly ambitious ideas is to look back at what we ’ve already done to understand what we can do .
The Olympic swimming star Michael Phelps quickly acknowledged his poor judgment after a photograph showing him inhaling from a marijuana pipe was published Sunday in a British newspaper .
Although his admission is unlikely to affect his swimming eligibility , it could affect the millions of dollars he has secured in endorsement deals .
In a statement released Sunday by his marketing agency , Octagon , Phelps , who won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics , did not challenge the legitimacy of the photograph published by the tabloid News of the World .
“ I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment , ” Phelps said .
“ I ’m 23 years old and despite the successes I ’ve had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner people have come to expect from me .
For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public it will not happen again . ”
This is not the first time Phelps has been compelled to issue a public apology for his behavior .
In 2004 , a few months removed from winning six gold medals and two silvers at the Athens Olympics , Phelps , then 19 , pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge .
The Faceless Watch will confuse and bamboozle as much as anything from those cryptic horologists at Tokyo Flash .
The wrist - band itself is handsome enough , and when I first saw the pictures I though that it was just that — an ironic man-bracelet .
But in the side - by - side comparison you can clearly see the digits peeking through the gaps .
Press the button and the LEDs glow to tell the time in refreshingly traditional digits .
The LED watch is sadly marked as “ coming soon ” , and is currently stranded on the product page without a price or shipping date .
I want one enough that I have set a calendar reminder for two months in the future when I will return to check up on it , and thence inform you , the stylish and handsome / beautiful reader , of its availability .

After my last post about File :: Find alternatives , chromatic responded , and said that it was opinion that the core should not be bloated further and that he would prefer if File : : Find did not exist in the core in the first place .
I brought the relevant links on perl5 - porters , and David Cantrell wrote a patch to add a warning to File : : Find , while disabling it from all the places in the core that use this module .
As other people noted , we should practice what we preach , and so if we decide that File : : Find is deprecated , then we should include a different alternative in the core , and adapt all the existing code to make use of it instead .
Someone even suggested implementing File :: Find in terms of the new module .
Eventually , I realised that the best solution would be to include a note in the File : : Find documentation about its limitations , and refer the interested people to the better alternatives on CPAN .
In any case , since my " Shavin ' Another Second " post , I implemented several more small optimisations ( and general code cleanups ) to File - Find - Object , and it now takes about 27 seconds to run in my test run .
One thing that surprised me was the fact that after a relatively large optimisation and overhaul to the code , all the tests pass immediately after the first clean run .
Usually , the code required more persuasion to make it work .
I also began File - Find - Object - Rule , which is the File - Find - Object - enabled - fork of File - Find - Rule , which provides a more convenient interface above File : : Find .
The first release of F - F - O - R had missing dependencies , and so consistently failed all CPAN testers ' reports .
Version 0.0101 was better , but its tests failed on MS - Windows , due to the fact that the File - Find - Rule tests excepted UNIXish paths ( which File : : Find happily provided , but File - Find - Object does n't ) .
This was fixed in File - Find - Object - Rule version 0.0200 .
Version 0.0200 is still a mostly " smallest - effort " port of File - Find - Rule , so now comes the interesting part of truly making use of File - Find - Object 's advantages , which may involve extending the latter API .
I also would like to create a documented API for File - Find - Object - Rule , so the code wo n't be tightly coupled with File - Find - Object .
Speaking of File - Find - Rule , you may find this recent discussion on use .
perl.org interesting .
Except for that I also did some work on XML :: RSS , like integrating some patches that someone else sent me , doing QA , and answering an email someone sent about one of its limitations ( which I 'd like to fix . ) .
I also found a bug in ack , and submitted a patch fixing it .
Finally , after my home - site 's remote repository good condition was restored , I decided to try to build it from scratch and correct the process that has gathered a lot of rot since I last did it .
I discovered a lot of problems with installing the necessary CPAN modules that I wrote in part for the homepage , but I 'm waiting on a reply to this question about Module - Build on its mailing list , before I can correct the build .
まずは 、Audrey さんが言った Haskell の殺し文句を思い出して頂きたい 。
正規表現ベースのパーサはメンテナンスしにくいのに気づいた？
Parsec を使って 15分で Perl6 の完全なパーサを書く方法を勉強しましょう。
15分というのは誇張が入っていると思うが、正規表現が保守しにくく、Haskell の Parsec は強力で保守し易いのは事実だ。その理由を
Perl と Haskell のコードを示しながら説明してみたいと思う。
Perl を愛する方に：この記事 は
Perl を攻撃するために書いたのではない
。Perl を選んだのは、正規表現を広めた言語であり、僕がそれなりに
Perl のコードを書けるためである。この記事の目的は、正規表現よりも関数型パーサー( Parsec ) の方が優れていると示すことだ。
例題 この記事では例題として 、IPv4 アドレスを解析する関数を書くことにする。たとえば、こんな文字列を解析したい。
192.168.0.1 返り値は、0 〜 255 の数値の配列/リストとする。上記の例に対する返り値はこうだ。
[ 192,168,0,1 ] 配列/リストの長さは 4 である。
用語 あらかじ め
「再利用」という言葉を定義しておこう。この記事で言う再利用とは、定義した関数を(別の機会に)加工しないで利用できることである。切り貼りし加工して利用した場合、再利用できたとは言わない。
数字の解析 ( Perl ) プログラムを書く際は、まず問題を小さな問題に分割し、それらの小さな問題から解いて行く。今回も、IPv4 アドレスを分解し、まず 0〜255 の数字にマッチするコードを書いてみよう。 最初に Perl の正規表現を考えてみる。正規表現自体で「 0 から 255 まで」を表現すると、あまりに煩雑になるので、簡単な正規表現を書き、Perl のコードでエラーチェックすることにする。 sub digit_byte { local ( $ _ ) = shift ; unless ( / ( \d+ ) / ) { die ' Illegal IPv4 ' ; } die ' Illegal IPv4 ' if ( split ( // , $ 1 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' ; die ' Illegal IPv4 ' if $ 1 > 255 ; return $ 1 ; } 「 もっと短く書ける」などの指摘は、本質ではないので、遠慮して頂きたい。
Perl は文脈に応じて文字列と数字を変換するので、このコードは明示的に型を変換していない。
数字の解析 ( Parsec ) Parsec で「数の文字列」にマッチし、数値を返す関数を書こう。
いろんな方法があるが、ここでは Parsec が提供する digit という関数を使って、まず 「 数の文字にマッチし数値を返す 」補助関数 n Digit を書く。 n Digit :: Parser Int nDigit = do c <- digit return $ digitToInt c digit は、数の文字にマッチし、その文字を返す。nDigit は、この文字を digitToInt を使って数値に変換して返している。 念のため述べれば、digit という関数は特殊な関数ではない。nDigit を定義したのと同じような感じで、digit も定義できる。違いは 、Parsec があらかじめ提供しているということだけだ。 勘のよい人へ 、Parsec の素晴らしさを示すのには、この例だけで十分だろう
。Parsec の部品は、すべて単なる Haskell の関数である。そして、この関数は 「 マッチ 」 と「 仕事 」 ( この場合は型変換 ) の両方をこなす。 n Digit が手に入ったら、0 〜 255 にマッチする関数は、以下のように書ける。 digitByte :: Parser
Int digitByte = do ns <- many1 n Digit when ( head ns == 0 ) ( unexpected " Illegal number " ) return $ nsToInt ns Parsec が用意している many1 を使っており、ns には数値のリストが入る。nsToInt では、数値のリストを数値に変換する。この関数は次のように定義できる。 nsToInt :: [ Int ] ->
Int nsToInt ns = foldl ( \ x y -> x * 10 + y ) 0 ns
IPv4アドレスの解析 ( Perl ) 次に正規表現で 、IPv4 アドレスを解析するコードを書いてみる。 先ほど書いた数字の解析する関数を部品として扱いたい。せっかくエラー処理も書いたのだから。しかし、正規表現では消費した対象物を単純には制御できないので、関数をコピペして、正規表現を拡張することになる。こんな感じだ。 sub ip v4 { local ( $ _ ) = shift ; unless ( / ( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) / ) { die " Illegal IPv4 " ; } die ' Illegal IPv4 ' if ( split ( // , $ 1 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 2 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 3 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 4 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' ; die " Illegal IPv4 " if $ 1 > 255 || $ 2 > 255 || $ 3 > 255 || $ 4 > 255 ; return [ $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 ] ; }
IPv4アドレスの解析 ( Parsec ) Parsec で IP v4 アドレスを解析するコードを書いてみよう 。Parsec が提供する sepBy1 を使い、そしてここが重要なのだが、digitByte を利用して、以下のようなコードが書ける。 ipv4 :: Parser [ Int ] ip v4 = do ns <- sepBy1 digitByte ( char '.' ) check ns return ns where test n = when ( n > 255 ) ( unexpected " IP v4 should be 0 - 255 " ) check ns = do when ( length ns /= 4 ) ( unexpected " IPv4 should be 4 bytes " ) mapM_ test ns
IPv4アドレスへの完全マッチ ( Perl )
Perl で書いた ip v4 は、任意の位置の IP v4 アドレスにマッチする 。
Web のフォームなどに入力された IP v4 アドレスを検査するには、完全マッチにする必要がある。そこで、ipv4 を完全マッチに変えてみよう。またしても
、Perl の関数は再利用できず、ipv4 をコピペして、こう書き直す必要がある。 sub exactIP v4 { local ( $ _ ) = shift ; unless ( / ^ ( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) \.( \d+ ) $ / ) { die " Illegal IPv4 " ; } die ' Illegal IPv4 ' if ( split ( // , $ 1 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 2 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 3 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' || ( split ( // , $ 4 ) ) [ 0 ] eq ' 0 ' ; die " Illegal IPv4 " if $ 1 > 255 || $ 2 > 255 || $ 3 > 255 || $ 4 > 255 ; return [ $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 ] ; }
IPv4アドレスへの完全マッチ ( Parsec ) 実は 、Persec では対象物の最初にマッチすることを要請する。つまり、単純に関数を書いたのでは、正規表現で言う
/ ^pattern / を実装したことになる。 任意の場所の IP v 4 アドレスにマッチ( / pattern/)する関数が欲しければ、ipv4
を再利用して、以下のようなコードを書けばよい。 inFixIPv4 :: Parser [ Int ] in FixIPv4 = try ip v4 < | > do any Char ; in FixIPv4 対象物の先頭が ipv4 にマッチしなければ、try で消費した文字を元に戻し、any Char で任意の一文字を消費して、自分自身に再帰する。 このパターンはよく使うので、inFix という関数に抽出してみよう。するとこうなる。 in Fix :: Parser a ->
Parser a in Fix p = try p < | > do any Char ; in Fix p in FixIPv4 :: Parser [ Int ] in FixIPv4 = in Fix ip v4 再帰を見てギョっとする人もいるかもしれない 。Haskell には繰り返しはないので、こういう場合必ず再帰を使う。
「 再帰しか使えないの は Haskell の欠点だ」と言うのは的外れな指摘だ。そもそも繰り返しは、力を限定された特殊な再帰である。あなたは、単に繰り返しという表現に慣れているだけだ。
僕には昔、左手を鍛えるために、箸を左手で握っていた時期がある。最初は、ご飯を食べている気分になれなかったが、その内「どうして今まで右手で箸を握っていたのだろう」と思うようになった。要は慣れの問題なのだ。 さて、今度は IPv4 アドレスに完全マッチ(/^pattern$/)するコードを書く。これは、以下のように書ける。 suffix :: Parser a ->
Parser a suffix p = do x <- p eof return x exactIPv4 :: Parser [ Int ] exactIPv4 = suffix ip v4 ついでだが、対象物の最後にマッチ( / pattern$ / ) する
IP v4 アドレスのコードは、こういう風になる。 suffixIPv4 :: Parser [ Int ] suffixIP v4 = suffix in FixIPv4
正規表現は異分子 正規表現では、問題を小さなコードに分割して解き、それをつなぎ合わせることができないと実感できただろう。正規表現は結局モノリシックになって、保守しにくく、再利用もできない。 一方 Parsec では、完全に再利用可能 な5 つの関 数( nDigit , digitByte , ipv4 , in Fix , suffix ) を定義できた。それを元に in FixIPv4、exactIPv4、suffixIPv4 も定義できた 。
Perl で正規表現が再利用できない本質的な理由は、正規表現は別の言語であって、Perl ではないからだ 。Perl にとって、正規表現は異分子なのだ
。Perl の関数を書いても、正規表現のメタ文字が増える訳ではない。
Perl と正規表現の関係は、細胞とミトコンドリアのそれに似ているという人がいる。嫌気であった太古の細胞は、酸素を利用した燃焼エンジンであるミトコンドリアを細胞内に取り込んで巨大な力を手に入れた。現在、両者はよく親和しているが、結局
DNA は異なるのだ。( ミトコンドリアの DNA は、母親からしか受け継げないし。 )
Parsec は、単なる Haskell 関数の集合だ。よって 、Haskell の型推論や型検査が利用できる。実際、僕は Parsec のおかげで、電子メール関連の RFC / Internet - Draft に定義してある BNF のバグを 2 つ発見できた。( many に空文字列にマッチするパーサーを渡すと警告を出す。 )
I remember reading Peanuts when I was younger , and I did n't realize how depressing it was until years later .
Now that I remember it and Sin City , I realize they both go together in some morbid way .
You 've done that nicely here .
You 've managed to carry out Miller 's style of coloring only a few things and leaving the rest black and white .
Oh , and the way other things ( particularly Sally ) are left in the shadow ?
That 's a nice touch , a very nice tribute to Miller .
Excellent job on making the three of them look older and more gritty , especially Charlie Brown .
Man , it 's like looking at him some years down the line after he 's realized the horror of his existance .
And of course , the narration just screams MSB ( Miller Style Brooding ) .
Excellently carried out .
So overall , I love this .
Sin City , while certainly over the top , is still interesting , and especially fun to try out for different things like this .
Time to check out the next one .
