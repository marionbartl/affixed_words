SAN JOSE , Calif . --
A familiar pattern unfolded Saturday night in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals : The Detroit Red Wings kept the game close , but found a way to lose it late .
Patrick Marleau snapped a tie at 6:59 of the third period , as the San Jose Sharks eliminated the Red Wings from the playoffs with a 2 - 1 victory at the HP Pavilion .
After reaching the Stanley Cup finals in each of the last two seasons , the Red Wings were ousted in the second round after losing four one - goal games
“ It ’s tough when you fall short of your goal , especially in a series like this , where you felt you were in this series even though we were down 3 - 0 ( in games ) , ’’ Detroit captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
“ Even in this game going into the third period we felt we had a chance to win the game but just could n’t get it done . ’’
The Red Wings could not build off the momentum from their 7 - 1 victory in Game 4 .
“ They won four games to one , so they were better than us , ’’ Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
“ I thought Game 2 was a big loss .
We had a ( 2 - 1 ) lead and got into big penalty trouble .
The games were tight , but they found a way to continue to win .
That ’s what good teams do . ’’
The Sharks reached the conference finals for only the second time in franchise history .
They will face the winner of the series between Chicago and Vancouver , which the Blackhawks lead 3 - 1 .
“ It ’s frustrating because they did n’t hold the lead once going into the third period and still found a way to win , ’’ said Red Wings defenseman Brad Stuart , who played this game with a sprained right medial collateral ligament .
“ We had ample opportunity to win those games .
It ’s a fine line this time of year .
We just found ourselves on the wrong side of it too many times . ’’
Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov rebounded from his disastrous performance in Game 4 by making 33 saves .
Marleau was wide open in the slot when he one - timed a pass from Joe Thornton past Jimmy Howard on the glove side .
Brian Rafalski was checked behind the net , leading to a giveaway , on which the Sharks quickly capitalized .
“ I did n’t have a lot of time and I was thinking everyone was still on that side , ’’ Rafalski said .
“ Obviously , we did n’t give ourselves a very big margin for error .
It seems it was like that the whole series . ’’
Just prior to the goal , Douglas Murray leveled Johan Franzen with a blindside check to the head with his shoulder .
Franzen was down while play continued .
The Red Wings felt it warranted a penalty .
Instead , it resulted in a faceoff in the Detroit zone , which led to the winning goal .
“ That ’s the way it goes , ’’ Babcock said .
“ To me , those are little events that take place in games but are n’t about the series . ’’
The Red Wings had a six - on - four advantage with 52 seconds remaining in the third period after Dan Boyle was penalized for holding and Detroit pulled Howard for the extra skater .
But the Red Wings failed to get a shot on goal .
“ You ’re just trying to get the puck in there , ’’ Lidstrom said .
“ They ’re doing a good job being in lanes , almost leaving our guys by themselves in front .
It was hard to get the shots through . ’’
Sharks center Joe Pavelski shot high and wide on a penalty shot at 3:12 of the third period , with the game tied at 1 - 1 .
He was awarded the penalty shot after beating Niklas Kronwall one - on - one to break in alone on Howard and getting hooked by the Detroit defenseman .
After being outplayed in the scoreless first period , the Red Wings dominated the second period , outshooting the Sharks 14 - 3 .
But each team scored once .
Detroit had three power plays but could n’t convert .
“ Couple mistakes here and there , not executing or capitalizing on our power play when we had opportunities , ’’ Lidstrom said .
“ I thought that was the difference in this series . ’’
Stuart returned to action after leaving Game 4 early in the first period due to his knee injury .
Babcock dressed seven defensemen , inserting Brett Lebda for forward Mattias Ritola , just in case Stuart reaggravated his injury .
Rafalski opened the scoring at 2:40 on a blast from the point that beat deflected in off the stick of the stick of Marleau in the slot , while Todd Bertuzzi was parked in front of Nabokov .
Bertuzzi checked Murray behind the net , which forced the turnover that created the scoring chance .
Thornton came back to tie on the power play at 4:54 , after Stuart was whistled for elbowing , Detroit ’s third consecutive penalty .
Thornton won a faceoff from Pavel Datsyuk and then went to the net and calmly deposited the rebound of a blast by Jason Demers past Howard .
Howard made several big stops in the first period , when the Sharks , sparked by a pair of power plays , outshot Detroit 15 - 6 .
“ Right now it ’s a bitter bill to swallow , ’’ Babcock said .
“ Once we got through the first period I thought we ’d win for sure . ’’
“ Their team played hard , their good players were really good and their goalie was excellent .
Todd ( Sharks coach McLellan ) and his group had them well - prepared . ’’
Said Red Wings center Henrik Zetterberg : “ They won fair and square , they were the first to four , they got the job done and we did n’t .
You can say we were real close in every game , but it does n’t matter . ’’

This frame grab image from classified US military gun camera footage released by Wikileaks.org in April 2010 shows an Apache helicopter attack on pedestrians including a Reuters photographer in Baghdad in 2007 .
A US Army intelligence analyst has been arrested in connection with the leak of classified US military combat video to whistleblower site Wikileaks , Wired.com reported .
A US soldier in Iraq has been arrested for allegedly leaking classified information to whistleblower website WikiLeaks , including video of a helicopter strike in Baghdad and US diplomatic cables .
Specialist Bradley Manning , 22 , who was deployed at a base near Baghdad , is in " pre-trial confinement for allegedly releasing classified information and is currently confined in Kuwait , " US Forces Iraq said in a statement .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said investigators were probing allegations that Manning supplied classified video and 260,000 secret diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks , as first reported by Wired.com , the website of technology magazine Wired .
" I think that 's why the Criminal Investigative Division is taking a very scrupulous look at this , " Whitman told reporters here .
Wired.com said Manning , of Potomac , Maryland , was arrested nearly two weeks ago by the US Army 's Criminal Investigation Division at Forward Operating Base Hammer , 40 miles ( 64 kilometers ) east of Baghdad .
Manning , who was serving with the 2nd Brigade 10th Mountain Division , was turned in late last month after boasting to a former computer hacker in an online conversation that he had leaked video of a 2007 US military helicopter strike to WikiLeaks , Wired said .
WikiLeaks released video in April of the Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad which killed two employees of the Reuters news agency and a number of other people .
WikiLeaks said at the time that it had obtained the video " from a number of military whistleblowers " but did not provide any further information about how it got ahold of the footage , which it posted at Wikileaks.org and on YouTube .
Manning reportedly said he had leaked other material to WikiLeaks , including separate video of a 2009 air strike in Afghanistan , a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat and classified US diplomatic cables .
" Hillary Clinton , and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning , and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , in searchable format , to the public , " Wired quoted Manning as writing .
Wired said it could not confirm WikiLeaks had received the classified cables .
It said a single diplomatic cable appeared on the site in February concerning a meeting between the US embassy and the government of Iceland .
WikiLeaks said in a message on its Twitter feed that " allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect . "
Spokesman Philip Crowley said the State Department would take a leak of classified documents " seriously . "
" It has particular impact in terms of revealing what we call sources and methods , compromising our ability to provide government leaders with the kind of analysis that they need to make informed decisions , " Crowley said .
WikiLeaks said that " if " Manning is the " whistleblower then , without doubt , he 's a national hero . "
Wired said Manning had been in touch with former hacker Adrian Lamo , who contacted Army investigators and FBI agents after being told of the leaks .
" I would n't have done this if lives were n't in danger , " Lamo told Wired about turning Manning in to the authorities .
" He was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could , and just throwing it up into the air , " Lamo said .
WikiLeaks , run by Sunshine Press , describes itself as a " non-profit organization funded by human rights campaigners , investigative journalists , technologists and the general public . "

Public universities can refuse to recognize student groups that discriminate in their membership , the United States Supreme Court ruled Monday in a case between a University of California law school and a Christian student group that bars those who engage in “ unrepentant homosexual conduct ” or fail to sign a pledge of faith .
A 5 - 4 majority found that UC ’s Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco could legally reject a chapter of the Christian Legal Society under the school ’s “ all - comers ” anti-discrimination policy that requires recognized student groups to allow any student to join .
The recognized groups gain access to campus meeting facilities , e-mail and bulletin board privileges and up to $ 5,000 in travel funds paid from student activity fees .
Christian Legal Society , or CLS , argued that the school violated the group ’s constitutional right to free speech , expressive association and free exercise of religion when Hastings rejected it in 2004 .
The policy , it contended , was just a convenient excuse .
The high court split largely along ideological lines , with Justice Anthony Kennedy swinging to the court ’s liberal side .
For the majority , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the Hastings policy is “ a reasonable , viewpoint - neutral condition ” for recognition .
“ In requiring CLS — in common with all other student organizations — to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of official recognition , we hold , Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations . ”
Justice Samuel Alito called the majority opinion “ deeply disappointing ” in a dissent joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
Alito sharply criticized the Hastings policy as “ a pretext to justify viewpoint discrimination . ”
“ The proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘ the thought that we hate , ’ ” Alito wrote .
“ Today ’s decision rests on a very different principle : no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country ’s institutions of higher learning . ”
But the majority rejected the idea that the action deprived the Christian group of any rights .
“ The court is saying , ‘ We ’re not interfering with your organizational rights , ’ ” said law professor Steven Green , director of the Center for Religion , Law & Democracy at Willamette University .
“ This is unlike the Boy Scouts case from years ago where the Boy Scouts had a gun to its head , going to be forced by the State of New Jersey to admit gays .
CLS can still be CLS .
It just may not be able to receive the government benefit . ”
Bruce Simon , Hastings board chairman , called Monday ’s ruling “ a major victory ” and defended the policy .
“ The whole school is premised as a public institution on diversity and allowing an open forum , ” he said .
“ Hastings has done nothing to step in the way of ( CLS ) meeting and fulfilling its goals . ”
Kim Colby , senior counsel with the Christian Legal Society , noted that the Hastings policy requires an all - black student group , for instance , to admit a Ku Klux Klan member — as Leo Martinez , acting chancellor and dean of the college , acknowledged in a recent interview .
“ What ’s troubling is it ’s so blatantly unconstitutional , but you have the liberal wing of the court willing to sacrifice a lot of the First Amendment to uphold a policy that even its defenders admitted was weird and not really a policy of common sense , ” Colby said .
The high court did not rule on whether Hastings enforced its policy in a nondiscriminatory way , remanding that issue to the Ninth Circuit .
Michael McConnell , a former federal judge who argued the case for CLS , said the group planned to show that Hastings does not enforce its policy across the board .
“ The only thing I would really predict is , this is going to lead to a lot more conflict , tension and litigation , ” said McConnell , director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center .
“ The court had an opportunity simply to say , every group has a right to participate and a right to control their own leadership . ”
One constitutional scholar said the ruling could be interpreted to give government wide berth to withhold benefits — including tax breaks for nonprofit groups — from those that do n’t follow an anti-discrimination policy .
“ I do n’t think ( the ruling itself ) has much of an effect .
They ’re relatively modest benefits , ” said UCLA law Professor Eugene Volokh , who agreed with the outcome .
“ When it comes to other things , especially tax benefits “… that could be a big deal . ”
The case presented the Supreme Court with a clash of two potent principles , said William Marshall , a University of North Carolina law professor .
“ One is our nation ’s commitment to anti-discrimination policy , and the other is our commitment to have different kinds of groups that have different kinds of beliefs , ” he said .
“ These are very , very difficult cases when they come . ”

__1931 : __The world 's first full - scale wind tunnel opens at Langley Field near Hampton , Virginia .
With a test area 60 feet wide and 30 feet high , aerodynamic testing is performed on everything from World War II fighters and space capsules to submarines and modern jets .
Since the beginning of powered flight , wind tunnels have proven to be a critical part of the aerodynamic research needed to develop new aircraft .
The Wright Brothers themselves built a small , 6 - foot - long wind tunnel to test scale models of wing sections before their historic first flight in 1903 .
But the limitations of using models were recognized early in aircraft design , and there was a desire to be able to test full - size structures and airplanes .
Early in 1930 on a swampy corner of Langley Field in southern Virginia , construction began on a new wind tunnel that would allow engineers to examine actual airplanes in flight , without having to leave the ground .
In a massive building covering more than two acres , the wind tunnel used a pair of 35 - foot propellers connected to 4,000 - horsepower electric motors .
Air was sucked through large funnel - like structures that directed a smooth flow of air past the staging area where airplanes , helicopters , race cars and even a Navy SEAL submarine were tested .
The wind tunnel allows engineers to examine real - world aerodynamics around objects , to confirm or test their calculations .
Wind - tunnel discoveries are still made today that even the most advanced , modern computational fluid - dynamics software does n't predict .
In the era of slide rules and drafting tables , wind tunnels were even more valuable for discovering bugs in an aircraft design .
At an aviation conference in 1934 , Orville Wright , Charles Lindbergh and Howard Hughes all watched as Boeing 's latest fighter plane , the P - 26 Peashooter , was tested at the Langley wind tunnel .
During World War II , every American fighter aircraft was tested in the facility .
Word spread about its engineering capabilities , adding to the prowess of the American military .
The Langley wind tunnel remained the world 's largest until 1944 .
The Langely wind tunnel was critical in drag reduction , allowing engineers and designers to clean up an airplane aerodynamically , allowing it to fly faster .
And the drag reduction was n't limited to airplanes .
Modern semi trucks have been tested at Langley .
It was n't about getting more speed , but using less fuel .
As aircraft speeds increased after World War II , there was a need for wind tunnels that could provide faster - moving air .
The 30 - by - 60 - foot facility at Langley was limited to about 125 mph .
Eventually new wind tunnels were built that could test supersonic aircraft , providing wind speeds well over 1,500 mph .
Others were built for even larger airplanes , including the world 's largest wind tunnel at NASA 's Ames Research Center south of San Francisco .
That one can accommodate aircraft with 100 - foot wingspans .
Operation of the Langley wind tunnel eventually passed from the military to NASA .
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and was shut down in 1995 .
However , a new agreement was reached for Old Dominion University to operate the facility , and the wind tunnel was used for several more years by many groups , including NASCAR teams .
Boeing tested one of its futuristic - airliner scale models , the X - 48 C , there .
The airplane company was the last to use the first full - scale wind tunnel before it was shut down for good in September 2009 , after 78 years of research .
But Langley is still home to nine other wind tunnels .

I 've hade some requests to explain some of the less common functions used in my log analysis screencast .
I think the most straightforward approach is to examine each of the lines in a literate Haskell style .
This is going to be a long - winded description of exactly what 's going on .
If you understood everything in the screencast , this post will probably bore you .
But if you found yourself wondering what the heck was going on , this post might help .
These four lines are pretty straightforward . " :m + " is GHCi syntax that is similar to an import .
readFile :: FilePath ->
IO
String reads the contents of a file into a string .
The lines function splits the string on newlines and creates a list of strings representing each line in the file .
We map the words function over each of these lines to split the lines around whitespace .
At this point t :: [ [ String ] ] .
You can think of it as a table ( hence the name 't ' ) where each row is a line in the file and each column is a field .
The " mapM print " displays the first two elements of t on separate lines .
Now we get into the meat of the analysis .
The noDay line uses a simple map and a lambda to strip off the last three characters of the first field in every line , turning the field into unique month identifier .
" groupBy " is a handy function that groups a list into " partitions " where the elements in a partition are all equal for a user - specified definition of equality .
In this case , we 're grouping the rows in noDay and we want to use equality of the first field to define our groups .
The ' on ' function is a handy little tool defined in Data .
Function that makes this easier .
On 's first argument is a binary operator " b -> b -> c " .
It 's second argument is a function that transforms a's into b's .
It returns a new binary operator " a -> a -> c " that applies the transform function to the a's to get two b's that it can use with the original binary operator .
In our example , the " a -> a -> c " is equivalent to " row -> row -> Bool " ( straight out of the definition of groupBy ) .
So the ' on ' function helps us construct this row comparator by first transforming the row and then comparing those things .
Our comparison function is ( == ) , and our row transformation is " head " , which gets us the month field .
Here 's a simple example :
This groupBy call returns [ [ ( 1,9 ) , ( 1,7 ) ] , [ ( 2,16 ) , ( 2,6 ) ] ] .
It has grouped all the consecutive tuples with 1 as the first element into one list and all the 2's into a second list .
These lists then must be grouped with a surrounding list .
In the original example , we get a list of groups by months .
The result can be conceptualized as list of bins representing each month where each of those bins is a list of all the log entries that happened in that month .
Our next line has the form " map ... months " .
This means that we 're doing some operation on each of the " month bins " we just created .
In this case our operation is " nubBy ( ( == ) `on` ( !! 2 ) ) " .
It 's very similar to the groupBy line .
' nubBy ' removes duplicates from a list , where the supplied comparison function defines what things are duplicates .
We again call on the trusty ' on ' function to make nubBy use the third field ( the username ) to determine equality .
This removes all duplicate usernames from each of the month bins , so the number of items in each of the bins is the number of unique registered users that came to the site in that month .
Now we want to display the length of each of the bins .
The lengths are more interesting when we know which months they go with , so we use the zip function to combine two lists into one list of tuples .
By now these patterns should be looking familiar .
Here we 're grouping by the username field just like we grouped by the month field before .
The only difference is that we have to sort the list by the username field first because groupBy only groups equivalent elements that are adjacent .
The result of this is a list of bins representing each user .
The length of this list tells us the number of registered users that have logged in .
Now we 're nubbing the user bins to remove duplicate days .
( It 's days becausewas created frominstead of . ) This tells us how many different days each user has visited the site .
None of what we have done here is particularly difficult .
It would n't be hard to do the same thing with Ruby or Python .
The point of the screencast is to show that it can also be done easily in Haskell , a statically typed , compiled language ; and to demonstrate some useful functions in Haskell 's standard library .

Just when you thought it was safe to use your computer , hackers have figured out how to attack everyday items .
Your printer , your cellphone -- even the blender in your kitchen -- can be hacked and used against you .
And in the not - too - distant future , as the medical field makes advances with machine - to - human interfaces , even your own body and brain could be at risk .
Here are 10 everyday items that are open to fresh attacks from criminals .
1. Your Car
Vehicles like the Mercedes S550 use a cellular connection that lets you lock and unlock your car remotely .
The Chrysler Grand Caravan has an on - board Wi-Fi connection to the Internet .
GM vehicles use OnStar to communicate with the outside world ; the company even incorporates a kill switch you can use if your car is stolen .
David Perry , a virus expert at Trend Micro , notes that most cars have multiple computers on board and a network of devices that use Wi-Fi , GPS , and Bluetooth .
Perry claims " white hat hackers " -- the good guys who hack into systems to prove they have security problems -- have shown that cars are at risk .

" The future of car theft might easily turn digital , " said Perry .
" It might be possible to freeze traffic on a crowded road , stopping enough cars using a Bluetooth hack or a connected mobile phone .
These attack vectors are real ; what really matters is what the hacker wants to do . "
Car hacking is so new , the auto industry has not addressed the problem fully .
You can request that your dealer disable some of these computer systems and wireless networks .
Cellular networks protect signals by switching base stations routinely .
2. That New GPS Gizmo
GPS uses orbiting satellites to route you through traffic .
According to Robert Siciliano , the CEO at IDTheftSecurity.com , hackers would have a hard time causing trouble with these satellites .
But the bad guys can access a GPS device when it downloads updates over the Internet -- and then can install a remote access tool and track your whereabouts .
Perry said criminals who tap into your GPS could send you to a shady location , such as an empty warehouse , and then rob you .
Hackers also use GPS jammers , readily available online , that confuse the signal and can cause traffic jams and driver errors .
3. Your Cellphone
Your cellphone is an easy target for hacking .
Spyware tools that infect your phone are readily available on the Internet , Siciliano says .
First you receive a text message with a link offering some free service .
When you click the link , the hackers gets full access to your phone .
In one deceptively simple attack , you get a free cellphone in the mail with printed materials that make it look like you can test it for a week and send back .
As you test , the phone records video and audio .
When you send it back , the hacker uses the personal info against you .
Perry said another dangerous hack occurred in Japan .
Hackers tapped into emergency phone services and disabled emergency calling .
He said it 's an example of one of the more dangerous exploits -- hackers shutting down important city services .
As with any connected device , you can disable Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and even carrier service when you 're not using the phone .
Also , never click text message links from unknown senders .
4. The Front - Door Security System
You bolt the door , install videocams , and add a security alarm -- and still the criminals can break in !
The reason : a lock bumping technique where a master key -- designed for popular locks -- unlocks the front door .
That video signal , if transmitted over an unsecured Wi -Fi signal , is easy to compromise .
And , according to security expert Winn Schwartau from The Security Awareness Company , a zap from a powerful ( but expensive ) electro - mechanical interference device can disable some alarm systems .
Perry said home automation systems designed for convenience ( like the popular Schlage Link ) make the front door hackable -- criminals can simply intercept the wireless signal to unlock or lock the front door .
And if a hacker steals your cellphone , he can access your home with these convenience tools .
But it 's easy to prevent :
Enable the password feature that blocks access to your phone .
Also , make sure you use strong encryption , such as AES , on your home wireless network .
5. Your Blender .
Yes , Your Blender
That 's right : your blender is under attack !
Most mixers are self - contained and not hackable , but Siciliano says many home automation systems tap into appliances such as blenders and coffee machines .
These home networks are then open to attack in surprising ways :
A hacker might turn on the blender from outside your home to distract you as he sneaks in a back window , he warns .
Interestingly , home automation systems such as those from Hawking Technology use wireless networks that home owners install on their own .
Many folks simply do n't bother to configure the security options -- it 's easier and faster to just run an open ( and easy to hack ) network .
6. Your Printer
Your printer is open to attack -- especially if you use a model that uses a Wi -Fi connection , like the HP Deskjet 6980 .
That over - the - air signal is probably not as protected as computer connections , which often use industrial - grade encryption , such as AES .
Once a hacker can access your printer , Siciliano says he can read ( and steal ) anything you print -- or the criminals can access the network and your PC to steal data directly .
7. Your New Digital Camera
Yes , even a camera can be hacked .
Any hardware gadget that has local storage , which includes video cameras , digital cameras , and even those cheap and wildly popular Flip cams , can be infected with a virus .
Once you connect the cam to your computer , that virus can corrupt the device or provide remote access to spies .
Perry said TrendMicro has identified commercial malware that can run on a video camera or the webcam on your laptop .
It records all activity and can be used for spying on you .
8. The Power Sockets in Your Walls
The power in your home is hackable as well , especially as the U.S. moves to a " smart grid " that lets consumers monitor and control their own power consumption .
Perry said the danger is that criminals will figure out how to steal power , use it in their own homes or businesses , and make it look like you 're the consumer .
Or hackers could turn off your power , or cruelly jack up the meter to increase your bill .
For now , most of us are safe ; the smart grid is more of an idea than a reality , although there are several test deployments across the country .
Once the smart grid becomes common , Schwartau said filtering , a method of making sure the power is actually reaching the intended recipients , could help ensure the grid is not hackable .
We 'll see .
9 . The Human Body
It sounds far - fetched because most of us do n't have that computer - to - human interface installed quite yet .
But researchers at MIT have shown how computers can help the disabled walk or play videogames .
And it could be just a matter of time before humans are " augmented " this way .
Besides ,
Perry said , the idea of hacking into a pacemaker is a proven reality , since some of the devices use Bluetooth connections for control .
" In several studies , it was shown that hacking a pacemaker was pitifully easy , " he said .
" This might be a good example of a cyberkill . "
" I 've given demonstrations of high power electro - mechanical interference .
We had to make sure that folks with pacemakers were at least 100 meters away , " Schwartau said .
10 . Even the Human Brain
The last frontier of hacking : stealing information directly from your brain .
Once again , research institutions such as Harvard and MIT have shown that it is possible to tap into the brain at some level to control motor functions , such as lifting an arm or blinking .
Criminal control of your brain sounds like science fiction , but Schwartau insists that anything is hackable -- even your mind .
Perry said hackers already infect the human brain , using a process call social engineering .
This involves tricking you into giving out a password over Facebook or revealing private info during an earnest ( but fake ) phone survey .
Most security experts agree : the most dangerous hacks are those that trick employees at a company or any consumer who divulges private information .

But apparently it has .
Events are such that the Rudd Government has decided to suspend its own flimsy guidelines for policing taxpayer funded advertising in order to get $ 38.5 million worth of ads praising its tax reforms on the air .
Pronto .
Like tomorrow .
And the day after .
The new tax ads start tomorrow .
Newspapers first .
TV to come .
Yes , this morning , Special Minister of State Joe Ludwig had the honourable task of telling us that the government had decided to clear any hurdle between them and a big expensive ad campaign to counter the sound and fury from the resources industry .
These ads have not been cleared by the independent committee now charged with ensuring government ads contain necessary information rather than thinly disguised partisan propaganda .
They have been cleared by the government .
No one else .
I hope you all find them interesting and informative given you are paying for them .
The Government has set aside its own process because . . .?
It decides it wo n’t even bother with its new watered down accountability process and just whacks ads on the air .
Ludwig : ‘‘ I note and accept the Treasurer 's advice that there is an active campaign of misinformation about the proposed changes and that Australians are concerned about how these changes will affect them .
I further note and accept the Treasurer ’s advice that , as tax reform involves changes to the value of some capital assets , they impact on financial markets .
‘‘ Given that co-ordinated misinformation about the changes is currently being promulgated in paid advertising , I accept the need for extremely urgent action to ensure the Australian community receive accurate advice about the nature and effect of the changes . ’’
Let ’s recap the whole sequence for a second .
Kevin Rudd comes to office in 2007 promising he will not abuse the process of government funded advertising like the Howard government did so egregiously .
If climate change was the " great moral challenge of our time " government advertising , according to Rudd in 2007 , was " a long term cancer on our democracy . "
He wins .
He appoints the Auditor - General to police government ads .
The Auditor - General runs a ruler over everything , thinking he ’s doing his job ( given the cancer and all that ) .
He asks lots of questions .
The government gets annoyed and bones him .
The government installs a new independent committee of former public servants to play the auditors ’ role .
These public servants report to the government , ( unlike the Auditor - General , who is independent from Government and reports to the Parliament . )
To cap off the backflip , it amends it own guidelines to give itself more discretion to bypass even the new watered down process to respond in cases where someone in the government decides there is a ‘‘ compelling reason ’ ’ to — how can I put this delicately — go for broke at the taxpayers expense .
Then , today , it fulfils its own disappointing prophesy .
It takes advantage of its new ‘‘ flexibility ’ ’ .
It decides it wo n’t even bother with its new watered down accountability process and just whacks ads on the air .
The trend of decision - making on this issue is all bad , not quite as bad as John Howard , but getting there .
Now let ’s try and see things from their point of view for a moment .
Of course the miners are digging into their deep pockets in order to beat up the government and squeeze the best deal possible out of the proposed Henry changes .
A number of big reforms — most importantly the emissions trading scheme — have been killed by negative fear campaigns by special interests .
There is a case to advertise the tax changes because they are far - reaching and complex .
But is there really a case to suspend its own standards of accountability to do it ?
Seriously ?
Loading
Does the Government conclude that voters are so silly that they ca n’t see a special interest campaign when they see one ?
Do they so doubt their own capacity to communicate a clear message that they have to bring in the ponytails of ad land to dig them out of a political hole ?
Whatever Joe Ludwig gets paid , it ’s not enough to be the minister responsible for accountability in this government - having to routinely and consistently announce he is hacking into the high standards the government set itself when it came to office in 2007 .
They are slipping on this issue , and they are mugs if they think voters wo n’t notice .

Big Think Interview with Anatoly Karpov
World Chess Champion 1975 - 1985
Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov was the world chess champion for a decade , from 1975 to 1985 .
He won the title when Bobby Fischer , the American grandmaster and reigning world champion , failed to show up at the chessboard .
Born in 1951 in Zlatoust , a Russian industrial city in the Urals , Karpov is widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time .
He finished first in more than 160 tournaments and occupied the Number 1 spot on the world chess rating list for 90 months , a record surpassed only be the man who dethroned him as world champion , Garry Kasparov .
Today , two and half decades after his reign as world champion , Karpov is still an active and strong grandmaster ( rated Number 155 in the world , as of June 2010 ) .
Karpov is running for president of FIDE , the world chess federation .
The following interview was recorded on May 17 , 2010 by Paul Hoffman .
The full interview – 20 min 40 seconds
You can watch the interview with a full transcript here .
A Life Devoted to 64 Squares ( 3 min 32 sec )
Question :
What qualities does it take to play world - class chess ?
Anatoly Karpov : A lot of things .
Chess is a very tough game , and psychologically a tough game .
And of course chess needs a lot of qualities , human qualities .
And so you must have very strong nervous system and then you must be well prepared , you must be able to work a lot .
Chess need good preparation and so you must work for hours if you play , let ’s say , for world championship .
Question :
What ’s the appeal of chess ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So , I like beauty in chess .
I like interesting ideas that could be fantastic combination , but it could be also very deep positional idea , or , or very high level technique in endings .
So , I can feel and I can see beauty in each of this ; beauty of chess , but also chess is always competition and so I like to compete and so this is part of my life .
Question :
When did you learn to play chess ?
Anatoly Karpov : I started to play chess at four years watching my father playing with his friends .
I showed interest quite early and then I started to have lessons in school .
I visited chess club and I played my first tournament when I was seven , and then I ca n’t say that I wanted to be professional and I thought I would be professional until the moment I became strong grandmaster .
When I became the youngest grandmaster at the time , at 19 , then I thought maybe it could be my profession .
But still I graduated Moscow University and I got profession of economist and in the meantime I made progress in Chess and I became world champion in 1975 , when I was 24 years old .
Question :
At what age do chess players usually peak ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So , in my time , it was from let ’s say 25 to 35 , now it ’s earlier because you have easier information then you have computers and then okay maybe young people changed and so now I think it should be from maybe 18 even , or at least 20 to 30 .
Question :
Are we reaching the time when computers might solve the game of chess ?
Anatoly Karpov :
Theoretically , yes .
Because the number of variations are limited , is limited .
But still even the most powerful computers cannot calculate all possibilities which you have over a chess board .
Question :
So you ’re not worried about computers ending the game ?
Anatoly Karpov :
Who knows .
Who knows .
But I do n’t think in my life we shall reach that level .
Will Chess Ever Be as Popular as Poker ? ( 3 min 27 sec )
Question : How popular can chess become ?
Anatoly Karpov : First I can say that 20 years ago , chess was much more popular than poker , and so if poker can make such progress we can’t deny that chess could make also progress and become popular as it was before .
Question :
Why should children play chess ?
Anatoly Karpov : Chess can develop very important characteristics , individual characteristics .
First of all , chess develops logic , memory , and then with chess you can easily understand the necessity of plan .
then you can learn how to make strategy , which is important for normal life , for any profession and that ’s why chess is entering school programs in many countries because teachers realize that with help of chess you can give this knowledge much easier than with the help of other subjects .
Question :
Why do you want to lead the World Chess Federation ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So this is a unique opportunity now to change the , change the situation .
And chess is in danger as profession and so federation which is lacking now in leadership and so they made many mistakes and so now we have feeling that professional chess players have difficulties in financing and such prizes going down and then it ’s difficult to keep this profession .
And , internationally , we have a very good situation now because we have grandmaster , Magus Carson from Norway who is one of the best chess players and most probably he will be next world champion , and then we have , we have American player , Hikaru Nakamura , who is also on the top , and then we have Sergey Karjakin in Russia , and then we have good players in China , in Holland , in India , and so it ... and then Indian grandmaster , Vishy Anand , he just defended his title in match in Sofia against Bulgarian player , Topalov , and so he ’s world champion for many years already and then this is very international view .
And chess , from a time it was just privilege of mostly Soviet players , and later Russian players , but now it became very international so it gives a lot of opportunities .
And these opportunities could be used with new team and I will have top professional team representing , of course different parts of the world .
Mental Toughness in Chess — and Life ( 4 min 14 sec )
Question :
How would you describe your playing style ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So , I was , and I am , how to say — a positional player , but active positional player .
So , we had purely positional player who was Tigran Petrosian , world champion for six years .
But I have active positional style and so I played quite strongly endings .
So this was my advantage also and then I could defend difficult positions , which is quite seldom in modern chess .
So , and I could resist in positions where other players probably would resign .
And I was finding interesting ideas how to defend difficult positions and I could save many games .
So , I never gave up .
I was ... okay , I was stubborn as a chess player , and so I tried to defend even very bad positions , and in many cases succeeded .
Question :
So you played on in bad positions ?
Anatoly Karpov : Yeah , so as a personality , I ’m fighter , you know .
And I do n’t give up and if I believe I ’m correct , I ’m right , then I work and I fight .
Okay , this could be over chess board , this could be in life and so I defend my principles .
And in chess , okay , this is a special , how to say , characteristic when you , when you try to find the best move whatever the position is , because many people they say , okay , this is bad and then they lose will to fight .
I never lost will to fight .
Question :
How do remain calm after you realize you ’ve made a poor move ?
Anatoly Karpov :
No , this is a very important and this is good question because many people would call back the situation , they missed chances , and then of course it will spoil the rest of the game .
But it is concerning not only special situation during the game , but also the bad result of previous game for the next game you play .
So , in my life , I tried and I succeeded in many cases to forget everything that was in the past .
So , of course you need to make some analysis and not to repeat mistakes , but it ’s extremely important to accept situation like it is , the real situation , not with thoughts of regrets of what you missed and okay , two moves ago you had winning position now , you have to defend a difficult position and probably you might lose the game .
So , this thought should n’t be when you play chess game .
And so later on maybe you analyze and then you will , how to say , make some conclusions .
But during the game ... and this is also very important part for chess education because chess is getting ideas how to accept the real situation and how to be objective .
To be objective and to meet unexpected situations and to adapt to this immediately and to start to think and to solve the problems .
You have to develop this .
I do n’t think it comes from your childhood or with birth .
Karpov ’s Chess Confession ( 1 min 33 sec )
Question :
What are your weaknesses as a player ?
Anatoly Karpov : Weaknesses ?
So , I did n’t know so well chess theory , the theory of chess openings .
And so , of course I knew the theory , but not on the level of the best players , so this was my ... this was always my weakness .
But this is you know , this is weakness and this is advantage because if I would know Chess theory so well , so probably I would not work out this style to defend difficult positions because from my childhood I could receive difficult positions against even weaker players , but okay nothing happened , so I was continuing to fight .
And so this is weakness , this is positive thing , but still more this is weakness .
It is better to know Chess Theory and not to get in difficult positions from the beginning .
Question :
Why did n’t you study chess openings ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So , it was boring to study this , so people consider that it is boring to study end games , but for me it was more boring to study openings and then also I did n’t want to play when I know everything till almost 25 or 30 .
I wanted to create something over the board .
Garry Kasparov Hates
It When You Mess With His King ( 54 seconds )
Question : What are Kasparov ’s strengths and weaknesses ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So , opposite to me he knows chess theory , even now very well .
And he was always big expert in Chess openings , and then probably he is not so good in positional play , but he is fantastic in the positions where he has initiative .
And so he can he sacrifice material to get initiative and so he , in active positions , he is very strong .
Maybe he ’s less strong in boring positions , and then maybe his weakness was , of course now he is not playing so active like before , so he was not so strong when his king was in danger .
Close Encounters With Bobby Fischer ( 5 min 04 sec )
Question :
How did you feel when Fischer defaulted on his world title ?
Anatoly Karpov :
So I was n’t very happy that Fischer did n’t appear for the match and I made many efforts to play another match .
Okay , even it could be not official match for world title , but I wanted to play Fischer and I met him for several times , but I believe he had psychological problems at that moment .
And so first of all he could n’t accept to lose even one game .
And so you could feel it when we had discussions .
He thought that when he became world champion he had no right to make one mistake or especially to lose chess game .
And with such approach it is very difficult to play chess because when you meet a player who is on the same level and very strong , you ca n’t avoid losing game .
Even one game .
You can win a match , but not playing without losing the game .
It ’s almost impossible .
Question : Did you ever meet Fischer ?
Anatoly Karpov :
Yes I met Fischer a couple of times and the first time , I mean in this set because we met first in San Antonio in 1972 just after he became world champion , after he beat Spasky in Reykjavik .
I played in San Antonio in 1972 and then Fischer was invited by organizers .
He was guest of honor now for the closing ceremony and the final round .
That time I met him for the first time and then we had set of meetings in 1976 and 1977 .
And so 1977 , it was last time and we met here in the United States .
It was in Washington D.C .
Question :
What did you think of Fischer as a person ?
Anatoly Karpov : I must say that we had full respect of each other and so it was nice to talk to him .
And what I could realize , he had no patience to listen to his partner or opponent , and if he could find out any ideas , he should express this immediately even he could interrupt the other person .
He could n’t wait .
He was very impulsive in this way .
But I have good memory of these meetings and I must say I had not any problems to contact him and to talk to him .
Question :
Do you think Fischer was crazy ?
Anatoly Karpov : Well Fischer was always thinking that he belongs to planet and he ’s not a member , or citizen of one country or another and he thought , okay , of course he was great star and also great player , one of the greats in the history of chess , so he considered that he belongs to the planet .
And then he was very independent and so he expressed these feelings , sometimes with very sharp sentences which I would not support , but this was his character .
Question : Was n’t Paul Morphy , the only other American to become world champion , also crazy ?
[ 0 0:29:01.00 ]
Paul Morphy had another story and so he got mad because he was n’t well accepted .
If we recall the history of Paul Morphy , he made fantastic tour through Europe and he beat the strongest players of that time , the strongest part of the world in chess .
He beat Europeans and he became unofficial world champion .
But then he came back to the United States and it was time of the problems between North and South , and it was Civil War and then Morphy was well accepted , accepted with triumph in lots of United States but then he came back to his area , and he was from South , so people there did n’t appreciate his victories .
And so it created a lot of personal problems and he ended his life I think in the hospital .
Question :
Do you have to be crazy to play great chess ?
Anatoly Karpov : No. Absolutely not .
Chess in Russia Is Like Baseball in America ( 2 min 08 sec )
Question :
Why has Russia dominated the chess world ?
Anatoly Karpov : Because of long time traditions and chess was ... chess was part of intellectual life in Russian Empire .
And so big writers , great writers they were playing chess and so this was privilege in part of top society , in top society people .
And then after the revolution , new power , they saw in chess the tool of bringing knowledge and education because it was easy , it was cheap and if you recall the time when revolution happened , most of educated people and top society people they left the country .
And so new power should work out something to make new intelligencia and new intellectual people .
And so they believed that with the help of chess they could do it , and especially it ’s very cheap compared to any other things .
I do n’t talk even about sport , but about other subjects and sciences .
And that ’s why it was supported and even during civil war , when we had civil war in 1920 , first championship for Soviet Russia took place .
And later it became part of education system , before World War II .
And after all chess became national game .
Like you have here in America , you have baseball , and so Russia had chess .

One of President Obama 's chief allies on Capitol Hill when it comes to energy and climate change issues , Sen .
John Kerry , just told reporters that he sees the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as an incentive to move the nation toward alternative fuels .
" If the Gulf oil thing tells us anything , folks , it 's that this is not a good risk we 're taking , " Kerry said to USA TODAY 's Susan Page and other reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast .
" The sooner we can move off fossil fuels and into a new energy paradigm , the better for our nation . "
Kerry 's remarks echo those made last night by the president at a series of Democratic fundraisers in San Francisco .
Obama said he shares the " sense of despair " watching video of the oil spill but signaled an increased resolve to tackle the " broader " issue .
Here 's how he described the problems plugging the hole and what it means in the long run :
There 's a reason why those folks are out there drilling a mile down in the water , and then when they hit ground a mile down , they have to go another mile down to get oil .
That 's an expensive proposition , it 's a dangerous proposition , it 's a risky proposition .
Why are we doing it ?
Well , we 're doing it because we have not made a transition to a new energy future .
The president expressed support for climate change legislation crafted by Kerry , D - Mass . , and his Senate colleagues Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , and Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. Graham has since dropped off as a co-sponsor , but he talked positively about the bill as recently as yesterday -- though he 's less positive about it 's chances of passage .
As part of an effort to promote their tripartisan deal , the president this year agreed to open previously off - limits areas of the ocean bed to offshore oil and gas drilling .
Kerry makes no apologies for the offshore drilling provisions in the bill .
He said it gives states veto power over drilling off their coasts .
But , the senator said , there 's no getting rid of offshore drilling for the foreseeable future .
offshore drilling is here to stay , at least for the foreseeable future .
" There are 48,000 wells out there , " Kerry told reporters .
" You think Americans are going to suddenly stop driving to work tomorrow ? "

The Roots of Right Extremism Trial by Fire for an Aspiring Neo-Nazi
At the beginning of this year , a wannabe neo -Nazi burned down the " House of Democracy " in the small town of Zossen just south of Berlin .
The case lays bare the deep roots of extremism in eastern Germany .
In the late 1940s Moacir Barbosa , who has died of a heart attack aged 79 , was arguably the best goalkeeper in the world .
Yet he became synonymous with the most famous error in Brazilian football history .
The date is still etched on the country 's collective consciousness : July 16 , 1950 .
Brazil were playing Uruguay in the World Cup final .
Rio de Janeiro 's grand Maracanã stadium was crammed with almost 200,000 fans - an attendance never equalled .
Midway through the second half , with the score at 1 - 1 , the Uruguayan Alcides Gigghia slipped past Bigode on the right wing and shot at goal .
Barbosa , expecting him to cross , was caught off guard .
The ball hit the back of the net , silencing the crowd and giving an unexpected victory to Uruguay .
It was a national humiliation .
Not only had they lost to their local rivals , but they had lost at home in a purpose - built stadium whose vastness was supposed to underline the nation 's footballing greatness .
Brazil had to wait another eight years before they eventually won a World Cup .
Barbosa was made the scapegoat .
His career never recovered and he carried the weight of the blame for the rest of his life .
" Under Brazilian law the maximum sentence is 30 years .
But my imprisonment has been for 50 years , " he commented on his 79th birthday , a fortnight ago .
Barbosa was never allowed to forget the match , which showed an ugly side to Brazil 's passion for football .
He told a documentary that the saddest moment of his life was not Gigghia 's goal , but a comment he overheard at a market 20 years later .
A woman pointed at him and said to the boy with her : " Look at him , son .
He is the man that made all of Brazil cry . "
Even fellow professionals were unable to forgive him .
When , in 1993 , he went to visit the training camp where Brazil was preparing for the 1994 World Cup , he was not allowed to meet the players .
One of the coaches , the eternally superstitious Mario Zagallo , said that Barbosa might bring bad luck to the team .
One sportswriter wrote that he was the victim of the largest injustice in footballing history .
" If I did n't learn to stop getting annoyed when people spoke of the goal , I 'd be in jail or in the cemetery by now , " said Barbosa recently .
" People forget that in [ the World Cups of ] 1974 and 1978 there were worse humiliations .
And what about the embarrassment of France in 1988 ?
But people still prefer to talk about 1950 . "
Barbosa was born in Campinas , in the south - eastern state of São Paulo .
After playing for local teams he was transferred to Vasco da Gama in Rio , where he stayed for 14 years .
He was the first black goalkeeper to have a solid career in the national squad .
The colour of his skin is thought by many to have been a decisive factor in the antipathy felt towards him - in 1950 , Brazilian football had not grown out of its racist past .
Barbosa retired from football at the age of 42 .
He worked in administration at the Maracanã for more than two decades .
When he retired from his second career he moved to Praia Grande , on the São Paulo coast .
His wife of 50 years , Clotilde , died of bone marrow cancer in 1997 and he struggled to make ends meet until Vasco da Gama heard of his situation and gave him £ 700 a month , which meant that he could rent his own flat .
He lived on his own , had no children and was not in contact with his few relatives .
After the death of Clotilde he had been helped out by a friend , Teresa Borba .
She said : " He even cried on my shoulder .
Until the end he used to always say : ' I 'm not guilty .
There were 11 of us . ' "

Downtown Austin ’s stretch of I - 35 will receive some much needed improvements , confirming our report from September of last year .
Short of burying or capping I - 35 , these improvements are the best we can hope for .
A grant from Keep Austin Beautiful ( KAB ) will contribute $ 250,000 towards the landscaping .
City Council set aside $ 1.5 MM in form of non-tax supported certificates of obligation ( bonds , I guess ? ) .
Revenues from the parking underneath the freeway ( which will be completely redesigned ) will also fund the project .
The project is expected to start in June and take approximately seven months .

The most important criteria for choosing a video card for HTPC are : How about HDMI ?
HDMI ( High - Definition Multimedia Interface ) is an high - definition digital audio / video interface that is replacing analog audio / video and older digital standards such as DVI and has become the de facto standard interface in the consumer electronics market .
HDMI 1.0/1.1/1.2 providesbandwidth and the current HDMI 1.3 providesthat has enough headroom for 1080 p at 60 Hz and ( e.g. sounds decoded from the new digital audio codecsand ) as the following simple calculation shows :
HDMI video is compatible with the existing digital standard DVI and in fact one form can be converted to the other via a simple adapter .
So there is nothing new .
In contrast HDMI audio completely takes over the aged digital standard S / PDIF which supports onlyandwith the maximum bandwidth around 12 Mb/s.
Unfortunately HDMI audio has not been realized yet in the PC world and we are still confined to S / PDIF .
As a matter of facts , every HDMI video card simply passes S / PDIF signals from a sound card or onboard audio codec over the HDMI connector .
Thus .
Recent IGPs ( ATI Radeon Xpress 1250 for Intel and AMD 690G ) are no exception .
Right now
The upcoming ATI HD 2000 series GPU has a built - in audio controller that makes it possible to grab audio outputs directly through the PCI Express bus , but the audio quality is still at the level of S / PDIF .
The following figure shows the ideal HDMI audio solution we are waiting for that transmits lossless full - bitrate multichannel PCM audio streams .
NVIDIA 's second generation PureVideo HD engine providesfor H.264 decoding .
That means that any decent PC with a video card with this engine can play back HD contents smoothly .
The new engine consists of The first two engines accelerate the four major steps of the decode process for MPEG - 2 , VC - 1 , and H.264 : and the AES - 128 Decryption engine accelerates the decode of the AES - 128 encryption protocol .
Among them offloading the bitstream process in the H.264 decode process dramatically reduces the CPU usage .
However there isbetween the original PureVideo HD engine and the reworked PureVideo HD engine as the bitstream processor is not for VC - 1 .
This is the video part .
None of the NVIDIA cards is able to transmit 7.1 LPCM audio through its HDMI connector .
The second generation PureVideo HD is implemented in GeForce 8600 and 8500 series GPUs , but right now supported only under for Windows Vista .
PureVideo HD support for the 8500 and 8600 GPUs under Windows XP is expected in June 2007 .
Here are brief specs :
You can see a complete list of GeForce 8600 and 8500 Series video cards in Appendix IV .
Including it here is almost useless because every card is identical with the reference card !
And almost all NVIDIA cards seem to be built by one company , Flextronics in China .
Companies like BFG
Tech , EVGA , and XFX are simply putting their own stickers and maybe cooling on the card then tweaking the BIOS with their own overclock settings ( Hard|OCP ) .
So which GPU should you choose ?
As for HD contents playback , there is not much difference between 8600 GTS , 8600GT and 8500 GT as seen in the HARDSPELL article DX10 is universalizing : G86/G84 complete test ! .
Unfortunately there are only a couple of 8600 GT / 8500 GT cards that support HDCP .
There are noticeable differences between them for gaming , however .
My picks are : ATI 's new Avivo HD Technology , the successor to the Avivo Technology , integrates two new engines :
The UVD features more or less the same functions as NVIDIA 's PureVideo HD : offloadingfrom the CPU , but .
( The old Avivo Visual Processing Unit , VPU , lacks the bitstream processing capability , just like the first generation PureVideo HD . )
On the other hand the AVP allows the GPU to apply hardware acceleration and video processing functions while keeping power consumption low .
Another striking feature of the new ATI cards is athat grabs audio output through the PCI Express bus and transmits it through HDMI .
Unfortunately .
Although it is a step forward toward the true HDMI audio , practically there is no advantage over the current S / PDIF passthrough solution .
Originally ATI planned to implement the UVD in X1xxx series GPU , but it did not happen .
The upcomingGPUs ( to be released in July 2007 ) integrate the Avivo HD Technology : Note that the high - end model Radeon HD 2900 XT lacks UVD .
The upcoming IGP ( Q1 2008 ) will also support DirectX 10 and the Avivo HD Technology .
UPDATE : TORONTO — More than 500 people have been arrested in Toronto after a night of rioting that saw police cars burned in the financial district and storefront windows broken as leaders of the world ’s largest economies gathered in the city for the G20 summit .
As clashes between police and protesters moved into their second day , there were more reports of journalists and peaceful protesters being arrested .
The National Post reported that two of its photographers were arrested , and a Post blogger says a cyclist was arrested after accidentally bumping into a police officer .

Meanwhile , the UK ’s Guardian confirmed earlier reports that one of its freelance journalists , Jesse Rosenfeld , was beaten and arrested at a protest Saturday night ( see below ) .
The arrested protesters are being held in cages at a converted film studio on the city ’s downtown east side .
News reports indicate that , so far , none of the arrested have been let go .
The Globe and Mail reports that about 100 peaceful protesters converged on the facility Sunday , chanting “ let them go . ”
As they stood outside the gate to the facility , at least two vans pulled up .
Officers in plain clothes jumped out of the van and arrested a few protesters .
Others began fighting back .
A tense stand - off ensued as a bus with officers in riot gear pulled up to the scene .
Police grabbed some protesters out of the crowd , throwing them to the ground and dragging them away .
Others streamed away from the area , crying .
Three stood nearby consoling each other and hugging .
A woman who said she was arrested while peacefully protesting yesterday described the conditions inside the detention facility to CTV .
She said protesters were housed in cages , some without benches .
A video posted to YouTube shows police in riot gear attempting disperse a non-violent protesters at Queen ’s Park , next to the provincial legislature , on Saturday .
Officers can be seen grabbing protesters out of the crowd and assaulting them .

TORONTO — Reporters covering the G20 summit in Toronto say they were the target of police violence overnight , as riots blamed on anarchist groups left four police cars burning in the financial district and resulted in the arrests of some 150 people .
“ A newspaper photographer was shot with a plastic bullet in the backside , while another had an officer point a gun in his face despite identifying himself as a member of the media , ” reported the Canadian Press news agency .
The agency did not say if it was its own reporters who were targeted .

In a remarkable series of Tweets early Sunday morning , journalist Steve Paikin of public broadcaster TV Ontario said he witnessed “ police brutality ” against a reporter and the arrests of peaceful demonstrators .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I saw police brutality tonight .
It was unnecessary .
They asked me to leave the site or they would arrest me .
I told them I was doing my job , ” he Tweeted .
“ As I was escorted away from the demonstration , I saw two officers hold a journalist .
The journalist identified himself as working for ‘ the Guardian . ’
He talked too much and pissed the police off .
Two officers held him a third punched him in the stomach .
Totally unnecessary .
The man collapsed .
Then the third officer drove his elbow into the man ’s back .
No cameras recorded the assault .
And it was an assault . ”
Paikin had been at a demonstration in Toronto ’s Esplanade neighborhood , a densely - populated area near the waterfront .
He said police moved in on a crowd of peaceful , “ middle class ” protesters and began arresting them .

“ Police on one side screamed at the crowd to leave one way .
Then police on the other side said leave the other way .
There was no way out , ” he Tweeted .
“ So the police just started arresting people .
I stress , this was a peaceful , middle class , diverse crowd .
No anarchists .
Literally more than 100 officers with guns pointing at the crowd .
Rubber bullets and smoke bombs ready to be fired .
Rubber bullets fired . ”
Paikin , a respected journalist who has hosted national election debates in Canada , said he was “ escorted ” away by police before he could see how many people were arrested , “ but it must have been dozens . ”
“ I have lived in Toronto for 32 years .
Have never seen a day like this .
Shame on the vandals and shame on those that ordered peaceful protesters attacked and arrested . ”
Earlier in the day , police told media that a small group of “ Black bloc ” demonstrators broke off from a protest of 10,000 people and began smashing storefront windows along the city ’s trendy Queen Street .

The CBC News Network reported that protesters smashed in the windows of an American Apparel outlet , pulled out the mannequins and spread feces on the floor .
The storefronts of McDonald ’s and Starbucks locations were also damaged , as were numerous bank branches .
Police shut down all public transit in the city center , including subway and streetcar lines .
They also shut down a large downtown shopping complex after reports of looting .
AFP reported that some 200 people were trapped inside , unable to leave after the mall was put into lockdown .
Watch : Protesters seize police car
“ When the G20 protest began turning violent Saturday , police abandoned some of their police cars , ” reports the Toronto Star .
“ This one was briefly occupied on Queen Street . ”

Evidence obtained under torture cannot be used in China 's courts , the government has said , weeks after a convicted murderer was set free because his victim turned out to be alive .
Laws banning torture are already in place , but analysts say they are widely disregarded .
Officials were embarrassed by the case of Zhao Zuohai , who spent 11 years in jail for a murder that never happened .
He says he was beaten by police until he confessed .
He was eventually given $ 96,000 ( £ 67,000 ) in compensation and two policemen accused of beating him were arrested .
Correspondents say convictions in the Chinese court system are strongly dependent on confessions , motivating police to use force .
' Big progress '
The government issued two new sets of procedures - the first covers evidence in cases subject to the death penalty , and the second rules on evidence obtained under duress in all criminal cases .
For people appealing against the death penalty , testimony given under duress and evidence from unnamed sources is now to be excluded .
Death - penalty defendants have also been given the right to ask for an investigation into whether their testimony was obtained illegally .
The regulations banned any evidence of unclear origin , confessions obtained through torture , or testimony obtained through violence and intimidation .
Legal expert Zhao Bingzhi told the state - run China Daily that it was the first time a " systematic and clear regulation " had been given on the issue .
" Previously we could only infer from abstract laws that illegal evidence is not allowed .
But in reality , in many cases , such evidence was considered valid , " he said .
" This is big progress , both for the legal system and for better protection of human rights .
It will help reduce the number of executions . "
Despite Israel ’s Thursday decision to “ ease restrictions on Gaza ” , the Israeli Authorities closed all trade crossings leading to the coastal region .
The closure , unless extended , will last until Sunday .
Fattouh of the Border Crossings Authority in Gaza , said that Israel declared the crossings open on Thursday and shut them down Friday , and added that Israel allowed the entry of 200 types of goods in recent weeks .
Most goods allowed into Gaza are food products , wood , aluminum and glass .
Fattouh added that the allowed goods do not fill the real need in the Gaza Strip as construction materials are still not allowed into Gaza , in addition to materials needed for factories and other basic supplies .
Israel recently agreed to allow the entry of stationary supplies for students , cooking tools , toys for children and some types of furniture .
Federal Attorney - General Robert McLelland has reportedly asked the Australian Federal Police to investigate whether Google breached any laws during its inadvertent collection of Wi-Fi data by it Street View cars while they were taking photographs of locations around the globe .
In a post on 23 April , the search giant discussed on its Lat Long blog ( which is used by the developers of its geographic Earth and Maps services to post updates ) the fact that its Street View cars were simultaneously collecting data on Wi-Fi hotspots as they drove around populated countries automatically taking photos .
Google ’s senior vice president of Engineering and Research , Alan Eustance , said the search giant would delete the data and stop collecting Wi -Fi data , period ( including in Australia ) .
“ The engineering team at Google works hard to earn your trust — and we are acutely aware that we failed badly here , ” he wrote .
However , the potential privacy breach has not been received well , with governments around the globe expressing outrage towards Google over the matter .
In Australia , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has described the Google breach as possibly “ the largest privacy breach in history across Western democracies ” .
Multiple outlets reported this afternoon that at the launch of Cyber Security Awareness Week in Melbourne , Federal Attorney - General Robert McLelland said he had referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police .
“ On Friday the attorney - general ’s department did refer those allegations and those reports to the Australian Federal Police .
They relayed in substantial part to possible breaches of the telecommunications interceptions act , which prevents people accessing electronic communications other than for authorised purposes , ” outlets such as AAP and APC Magazine have reported the politician as stating .
The AFP has not yet responded to a request for comment on what action it is taking with respect to the situation .
“ This was a mistake .
We are talking to the appropriate authorities to answer any questions they have , ” said a Google spokesperson today on the issue .
The news comes several weeks after the Opposition pressured Conroy in a Senate Estimates Committee hearing to refer the Google Wi-Fi matter to authoritises .
“ Why are you sitting back and watching ?
Why are you not referring the matter ? ” Liberal Senator Mary Jo Fisher asked Conroy , who responded that the matter was being handled through the Federal Privacy Commissioner .
“ The Privacy Commissioner is the appropriate place to start this process , ” he said .

Introduction
With the advent of multi-core processors concurrent programming is becoming indispensable .
Scala 's primary concurrency construct is actors .
Actors are basically concurrent processes that communicate by exchanging messages .
Actors can also be seen as a form of active objects where invoking a method corresponds to sending a message .
The Scala Actors library provides both asynchronous and synchronous message sends ( the latter are implemented by exchanging several asynchronous messages ) .
Moreover , actors may communicate using futures where requests are handled asynchronously , but return a representation ( the future ) that allows to await the reply .
This tutorial is mainly designed as a walk - through of several complete example programs that can be readily compiled and run using Scala 2.4 or newer .
First Example
Our first example consists of two actors that exchange a bunch of messages and then terminate .
The first actor sends " ping " messages to the second actor , which in turn sends " pong " messages back ( for each received " ping " message one " pong " message ) .
We start off by defining the messages that are sent and received by our actors .
In this case , we can use singleton objects ( in more advanced programs , messages are usually parameterized ) .
Since we want to use pattern matching , each message is a case object : case object
Ping case object
Pong case object Stop
The ping actor starts the message exchange by sending a Ping message to the pong actor .
The Pong message is the response from the pong actor .
When the ping actor has sent a certain number of Ping messages , it sends a Stop message to the pong actor .
All classes , objects and traits of the Scala actors library reside in the scala.actors package .
From this package we import the Actor class that we are going to extend to define our custom actors .
Furthermore , we import all members of the Actor object since it contains many useful actor operations : import scala.actors .
Actor import scala.actors .Actor ._
Actors are normal objects that are created by instantiating subclasses of the Actor class .
We define the behavior of ping actors by subclassing Actor and implementing its abstract act method : class Ping ( count : int , pong : Actor ) extends Actor { def act ( ) { var pingsLeft = count - 1 pong !
Ping while ( true ) { receive { case Pong => if ( pingsLeft % 1000 == 0 ) Console.println ( " Ping : pong " ) if ( pingsLeft > 0 ) { pong !
Ping pingsLeft -= 1 } else { Console.println ( " Ping : stop " ) pong !
Stop exit ( ) } } } } }
The number of Ping messages to be sent and the pong actor are passed as arguments to the constructor .
The call to the receive method inside the infinite loop suspends the actor until a Pong message is sent to the actor .
In that case the message is removed from the actor 's mailbox and the corresponding action on the right side of the arrow is executed .
In the case where pingsLeft is greater than zero we send a Ping message to pong using the send operator ! , and decrement the pingsLeft counter .
If the pingsLeft counter has reached zero , we send a Stop message to pong , and terminate the execution of the current actor by calling exit ( ) .
The class for our pong actor is defined similarly : class Pong extends Actor { def act ( ) { var pongCount = 0 while ( true ) { receive { case Ping => if ( pongCount % 1000 == 0 ) Console.
println ( " Pong : ping " +pongCount ) sender !
Pong pongCount = pongCount + 1 case Stop => Console.println ( " Pong : stop " ) exit ( ) } } } }
There is one interesting point to notice , however .
When receiving a Ping message , a Pong message is sent to the sender actor , which is not defined anywhere in our class !
In fact , it is a method of the Actor class .
Using sender , one can refer to the actor that sent the message that the current actor last received .
This avoids having to explicitly pass the sender as arguments to messages .
After having defined our actor classes , we are now ready to create a Scala application that uses them : object pingpong extends Application { val pong = new Pong val ping = new Ping ( 100000 , pong ) ping .
start pong.start } Analogous to Java threads , actors have to be started by calling their start method .
Let 's run it !
The complete example is included in the Scala distribution under doc/ scala - devel / scala/ examples/actors/pingpong.scala .
Here is how you compile and run it : $ scalac pingpong .
scala $ scala - cp .
examples.actors.pingpong
Pong : ping 0 Ping : pong Pong : ping 1000 Ping : pong Pong : ping 2000 ...
Ping : stop Pong : stop
Make it Thread - less !
Actors are executed on a thread pool .
Initially , there are 4 worker threads .
The thread pool grows if all worker threads are blocked but there are still remaining tasks to be processed .
Ideally , the size of the thread pool corresponds to the number of processor cores of the machine .
When actors call thread - blocking operations , such as receive ( or even wait ) , the worker thread that is executing the current actor ( self ) is blocked .
This means basically that the actor is represented as a blocked thread .
Depending on the number of actors you want to use , you might want to avoid this , since most JVMs cannot handle more than a few thousand threads on standard hardware .
Thread - blocking operations can be avoided by using react to wait for new messages ( the event - based pendant of receive ) .
However , there is a ( usually small ) price to pay : react never returns .
In practice , this means that at the end of a reaction to a message , one has to call some function that contains the rest of the actor 's computation .
Note that using react inside a while loop does not work !
However , since loops are common there is special library support for it in form of a loop function .
It can be used like this : loop { react { case A => ... case B => ... } } Note that react calls can be nested .
This allows to receive several messages in sequence , like this : react { case A => ... case B => react { // if we get a B we also want a C case C => ... } }
To make our ping and pong actors thread - less , it suffices to simply replace while ( true ) with loop , and receive with react .
For example , here is the modified act method of our pong actor : def act ( ) { var pongCount = 0 loop { react { case Ping => if ( pongCount % 1000 == 0 ) Console.
println ( " Pong : ping " +pongCount ) sender !
Pong pongCount = pongCount + 1 case Stop => Console.println ( " Pong : stop " ) exit ( ) } } }
CBD Reviews
“ There ’s a lot of hype about everything about CBD , ” said Dr. Orrin Devinsky , the director of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center , who led the Epidiolex studies and went out of his way to say the drug ’s effect was “ not miraculous . ”
“ There is certainly data that CBD oil has a variety of anti-inflammatory effects , but whether that translates into improving human health is unknown .
Does it help people with eczema , rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis ?
We do n’t know .
There is a good theoretical basis , but the CBD studies have not been done . ”
CBD has a relatively good safety profile and is “ hands - down safer generally than THC , ” the intoxicating component of cannabis , Dr. Hurd said .
But it can cause adverse side effects , including sleepiness and diarrhea .
Patients in the CBD trials also had more infections and rashes , as well as depressed appetite , sleep problems and elevated liver enzymes .

Reputable hemp companies always use pressurized CO2 for extraction process because it allows them to achieve clean and potent extracts .
If a processor is using harsh solvents like butane or propane ( or they do n’t tell you anything about their extraction methods ) , it ’s a red flag that you should look for another brand .
These solvents often left toxic residue behind , which can be dangerous for your health .
The main reason why parents are so enthusiastic about CBD is that this cannabinoid is no THC , does n’t cause addiction , and has only a few mild side effects when taken at excessive doses .
Research shows that even doses up to over a gram and one - half have no serious side effects on human health .
Like most cannabis products , too much CBD oil can make your mouth feel dry .
Another common side effect is lowered blood pressure , which may trigger another unwanted reaction — lightheadedness .
Before taking any CBD products , make sure to consult with a qualified health care professional , especially when you ’re on medications .
CBD oil can interact with certain drugs and increase their concentration in the bloodstream ; as a result , you can experience side effects that are not directly linked to hemp oil itself .

What I Like About Joy Organics :
I ’ve been using HempBombs for quite some time before switching to Joy Organics water soluble CBD and in my opinion , this is the best brand when it comes to CBD softgels .
Their products contain nano emulsified pure CBD and ZERO THC .
You can buy this isolate as tinctures , vape oils , capsules , and edibles .
HempBombs CBD oil is available in five different strengths , from 10 mg to 25 mg per softgel .
With water soluble you absorb 20X more actual CBD purity , the strongest bottle gives you a total of 300 mg of pure Nano CBD per unit .
Although I think full - spectrum extracts are more effective than isolates , I understand that for some people , the latter is the only option ( legal matters , allergies to certain cannabinoids , the fear of testing false positive on a drug test ) .
If that ’s your story , Hempworx is the way to go .
You can also use their oils in combination with full - spectrum CBD oil for insomnia products for extra potency kick .
Their isolate will give you the highest dose per serving , which is great news for people struggling with pain and sleep disorders , as higher doses of CBD induce sedation .
Who are the Observers ?
The Observers have been recorded at numerous events and locations throughout time and space .
History is littered with their presence .
Important moments observed : wars , presidential inaugurations , inter-reality invasions , Peter kidnappings .
Perhaps even this very site at this very moment …
The Observers are here , and whether we like it or not , they are influencing our past , present and future .
Former fringe television series stars write about addiction treatment and legal issues .
People from all different walks of life struggle with addiction — whether they ’re doctors , lawyers , students , stay - at - home moms , professional athletes or performers .
And while some struggle in silence for many years , it ’s important for them to know that they ’re not alone .
The more we talk about addiction , the easier it is for people to find help — and these celebrities have decided to share their stories of addiction treatment throughout the years .
From Wendy Williams to Oprah Winfrey and Britney Spears to Elton John , their experiences and openness have become an important part of the conversation , but it just goes to show that drug and alcohol addiction does not discriminate and struggling with addiction is nothing to be ashamed of .
It ’s a human experience that , in order to beat , one must first face head - on .
He explained : “ I started working at 16 in the West End and I ’m now 47 – and do n’t I look good for it !
“ It ’s something that I ’ve used throughout my career and throughout my life , any form of addiction is about not wanting to feel , whether that is heroin , prescription pain medication , drugs , drink , shopping , sex – that ’s what it ’s about and that ’s what I did n’t want to do .
” I finally decided to enter the alcohol detox program at Daylight Recovery .
I have remained sober since that time .
“ I did n’t want to feel .
I never felt confident in just being myself , in just allowing myself to feel like me .
Doing
The Full Monty at the beginning of the year allowed me to open up and be honest about an aspect of my life I ’ve kept private , even from my family , for 14 years .
That was a floodgate for me .
“ The overwhelming sense of relief and comfort and support I got from the public , from my friends and from my family gave me confidence to open that out .
And explain where I had been .
I chose to talk about my sobriety and my addiction in a stage show because that ’s where I feel most comfortable . ”
Last year , the actor opened up about the death of his mother after her battle with Alzheimer ’s – he previously entered CBB to raise money for her care .
John finished by saying : “ I say my greatest performances were not on the stage , they were in my real life , because you would never have known .
I was always up and dressed and first on set .
And now I do n’t need to be like that . ”

You 've described the new series of Doctor Who as a dark fairy tale .
Do you think we still love fairy tales , in the era of video games and everything else ?
Do they still have the same power ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
There are two things to say to that .
One , with my arm up my back I came up with " dark fairy tale " — and the word dark is entirely redundant when it comes to fairy tales , at least until Disney makes a version of them .
And do fairy tales still have power ?
Well , look at the movies that have been made .
Yes they do .
Advertisement
But when I say " fairy tale , " a better way of saying it would be " modern fairy tale . "
It 's not that it 's like the old fairy tales , or that it resembles them , it 's the modern equivalent .
It 's the way we teach our children that there are things in the world that might want to eat them .
It just feels like a fairy tale : A man who fights monsters but never becomes one .
It 's not that it 's a bit like Red Riding Hood .
It is n't .
But it occupies the space that fairy tales occupy .
Children have nightmares and monsters all the time , so we take that fact and spin yarns out of it , the way fairy tales always have .
And just the way that fairy tales of old would use the real world around them of forests and villages , and make them dark and mysterious and reveal dangers in the shadows , so Doctor Who does that at its best .
Because a lot of Doctor
Who takes the real - life world around you and twists it a bit .

I 'm always saying — to everyone 's boredom , I 'm sure — that Doctor Who does n't take place in outer space or the future , it takes place under your bed .

Do you think the fairy tale aspect is at odds with the science - fiction aspect , where everything has to have a scientific explanation ?
Or do you think those things go together ?
That 's just how you justify it .
It 's a mechanism by which you justify what happens .
There was magic in fairy tales back when people believed in magic .
That 's just the machinery of it .
That 's not a problem .
There is n't magic in Doctor Who — there are sometimes [ laughs ] token scientific explanations for everything , yes .
But I mean , you know , he lives in a box that 's biger on the inside than on the outside .
When he regenerates , he turns into somebody with a new hairstyle and sideburns a particular length .
Explain that , science !
When Doctor
Who 's really , really good , there 's a feeling of magic about it .
It 's a magical - feeling show .
We 've got a justification for why this time machine looks like a battered old blue box with all the wonderful panels .
But the explanation does n't matter so much as the aesthetic of it .
It makes it feel like a wizard 's box .

One of the things I love about your stories in particular is the mystery aspect of it , where there 's clues and there 's puzzles .
And puzzles in particular seem to be a big part of the texture of what make it like a fairy tale .
You have to solve these puzzles to move on .

I think kids love that sort of thing .
I watch Doctor Who with my children , and they 're always trying to figure it out .
That 's a thing they enjoy .
They 're not cynical , like adults who'll just sit there and say , " Oh , it 'll all be explained in the last scene . "
They 'll sit there and theorize out loud about what 's going on .
So I think it 's an important thing .
But also , if you make it a puzzle or a mystery , that 's a great way of making sure the Doctor 's at the heart of the action .
He 's not a warrior .
He 's not that kind of hero .
If there 's a great big fight scene , he probably wo n't be at the heart of it , because that 's not his style or his skill .
But if you make it a mystery to solve , if you make the clinching thing for him to put all the pieces together and figure out what 's going on , then he's at the heart of the action .

Speaking of action , we talked to you before about the lack of people being killed on - screen in your stories .
Compared to Russell T. Davies ' stories which had a lot more bloodshed .
Are you trying for a more subtle menace that 's just outside the frame ?
As I said before , it 's not a deliberate decision on my part or on Russell 's , that he should have slaughtered millions and I should n't .
We did n't have that discussion .
We were shocked at our respective roles .
I think if you met each of us , you 'd put it the other way around .
No , it 's not really .
I think Doctor Who can get on , can do remarkably well with very , very small amounts of jeopardy .
I love the big jeopardy stories , but " Girl In The Fireplace " hinges on a threat to one woman .
And it 's not even an evil threat , it 's just some robots that seem very stupid .
And yet it 's not as if that feels less substantial than another story .

You 've said that Doctor Who is n't the Doctor 's story , it 's the companion 's story .
But we 're coming off a year of David Tennant stories where he did n't have a regular companion .
And the previous years , Martha and Donna did n't feel quite as central as Rose did in her time .
Are you making an effort to bring the companion back to the center stage with Amy ?
Advertisement
I think Doctor Who just goes that way .
I think you can't stop it .
I can make that sound like a decision .
But I think it 's the natural resting place of the show .
The Doctor 's the hero , the guy with the best lines and grandstanding moments , but it 's really the story of the people who come on board .
Never mind looking at " Rose , " look at [ original pilot ]
" An Unearthly Child . "
Doctor
Who does not start with the Doctor running away from [ his home planet ]
Gallifrey because he 's bored .
It starts with people finding the blue box .
Actually , episode one in 1963 is just the same kind of episode one as " Rose " is and " The Eleventh Hour " is , it 's where the story naturally begins is with a new person discovering the Doctor and how it 's going to change that person .
How their life is going to alter as a result of their encounter with the Doctor .
And that is a thrilling , amazing story , and one that you can imagine yourself in .
Imagine one day that the blue box landed in your garden , that would be exciting .
What would you do ?
Where would you go ?
How would you react ?
In a way — in a vague way — I suppose it 's kind of the story of the Doctor , but you know he 's 907 .
He changes a lot in one way , and not at all in another .
He 's not probably going to settle down , get kids and a Volvo .
He 's probably going to carry on doing what he does .
So it 's the story of the people he meets and the lives he changes .
He 's made his decisions , and he can't really go back on them .
Advertisement
That 's a really interesting way of looking at it .
In the modern era , it seems like the companion has the hero 's journey , where they start out as somebody ordinary and then become something quite different .
Advertisement
I think you 've almost defined every story every told when you 've said that .
The transformation of an initially ordinary person into something different almost defines every story .
And obviously , in the lovely comic strip world of Doctor Who , that tends to be the journey to great heroism .
Or anyway , to great understanding .
Or something like that .
Both Rose and Donna had moments where they became almost god - like figures .
I wo n't ask if that 's going to happen with Amy .
But do you think there 's an element of becoming post - human with the companions ?
Advertisement
I think it 's a danger .
Because I think you 'd lose the person to whom the story is happening if you did that .
You want them , in a way , in a very basic way , to be your representative in the TARDIS , experiencing the story as you would experience it .
The Doctor is extraordinary enough .
Do we need other extraordinary people ?
I think anyone who agrees to go aboard the TARDIS is clearly a bit of a loony , but aside from that , you want it to be ordinary , recognizable people .

How is it different writing humor in something like Doctor Who , versus in a comedy show like Coupling ?
I never really think about the humor .
I like writing comedy , and humor comes fairly — I hesitate to say this — it 's not a stretch for me .
I 'm good at funny .
Because Doctor
Who 's a funny show , and you always want to keep it funny .
Apart from anything else , the Doctor himself is bloody hilarious .
I think it derives naturally .
The only big difference is really in something like Coupling or in a sitcom , humor is all that you 're doing .
You have to make sure it 's funny all the time .
Whereas I 'm quite relaxed about humor in Doctor Who .
If the scene lends itself to comedy , I 'll take it quite far down that road .
If it does n't , I do n't worry about it .
I do n't worry if I have n't had a joke for 20 pages , that 's fine .
I 'd worry if I had n't had a joke for half a page on Coupling .

Your stories often revolve around time travel , much more than the show has in the past .
Is there a danger in making Doctor Who too much about time travel , in that it becomes too meta or self - referential ?
I think there 's a danger of having too much time travel , I do .
On the other hand , it 's a show about a time - traveler and that 's kind of fun .
But me popping up once a year and doing a story that 's centered a bit more on time travel is different from me popping up six times a year and doing the same thing .
You would n't want to do it all the time .
At the same time , an absolute underlying — I hate to use the word " theme " because it 's rubbish — an underlying strand of Doctor Who is that he is a time traveler and his companions , as passengers on the same vehicle , have an odd relationship with time , because it 's not passing in the same way for them .
I think it would be strange not to foreground that , or at any rate not to make it a strand of the story when uniquely , your entire regular cast do n't just have a time machine , they live in it .
It 's a very different kind of thing .

So are we going to get more of a sense of what it 's like to live aboard the TARDIS ?
Advertisement
Not this time around .
I 've made it clear there 's a lot more inside that TARDIS .
But the truth about Doctor Who .
When it 's really working , you 're out those TARDIS doors as fast as you can go and into the adventure .
That 's what you do .
You do n't want to hang around people having chats about decorating their rooms .
You want them to be fighting giant electric slugs .
That 's what you paid your money for .
The winner of the Associated Press ( AP ) college football championship trophy may no longer be a determining factor in the Bowl Championship Series formula , however , the long - running AP poll carries a lot of weight in the college football world .
Awarded annually by the AP , the trophy goes to the team who finishes the season at the number one spot in the AP Poll .
That team is named the national college football champion for that season
How the Poll Works
The AP Poll weekly ranks the top 25 NCAA teams in Division I football , men 's basketball and women 's basketball .
Sixty - five sportswriters and broadcasters from across the nation are polled .
Each voter creates a ranking of the top 25 teams .
The individual rankings are combined to produce the national ranking by giving a team 25 points for a first - place vote , 24 for a second - place vote , and so on down to 1 point for a twenty - fifth place vote .
Voting members ballots are public .
History of the AP National Poll
The AP college football poll has a long history .
In the early 1930s , there was a flurry of news media running polls of their sportswriters to determine who was , by popular opinion , the best football team in the country at the end of the season .
For consistency , in 1936 , the AP established a poll of sports editors , which then became the standard .
For decades , the AP poll was considered the final word on college football rankings and being named the AP ’s poll winner meant being that team was the national champion .
In 1997 , the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) was developed to pick the two top - ranked teams for a national championship game .
For the first several years the AP Poll factored in the determination of the BCS rankings , along with other factors including the Coaches Poll and computer - based polls .
In December 2004 , due to a series of controversies surrounding the BCS , the AP demanded that BCS stop using its poll for their ranking calculations .
The 2004–2005 season was the last season that the AP Poll was used .

Vladimir I. Arnold , a Russian mathematician who discovered important theorems that found application in astronomy , mechanics and even weather forecasting , died June 3 in Paris .
He was 72 and had homes in Paris and Moscow .
The cause was acute pancreatitis , his son Igor said .
Dr. Arnold ’s work ranged widely across mathematics .
He was a founder of singularity theory , or , as it is sometimes more ominously called , catastrophe theory .
Singularity theory predicts that under certain circumstances slow , smooth changes in a system can lead to an abrupt major change , in the way that the slipping of a few small rocks can set off an avalanche .
The theory has applications in physics , chemistry and biology .
“ He was a genius and one of the greatest and most influential mathematicians of our time , ” said Boris A. Khesin , a former student of Dr. Arnold ’s and now a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto .

Never underestimate the power of the field trip .
Turns out , visiting real scientists doing real science had a big impact on what one group of seventh graders thought scientists looked and acted like .
The kids drew and captioned pictures before and after their trip .
One of the first things that struck me , flipping through these shots , was how much more hair the real scientists had .
The " before " drawings look like something out of central casting — a lot of old white guys in lab coats , often hovering over beakers full of bubbling , green liquid .
The " after " images become real people — men and women , of all races , with much lower rates of male pattern baldness .
Apparently , the kids caught on to the basic idea behind the existence of the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists .
Also noteworthy :
The way scientists became relateable to the kids , what seem to have previously thought of scientists as weird , crazy people that did n't do anything but work .
Here 's what a student named James said before :
When I think of a scientist I think of brainy and very weird people .
I think of lots of bottles with chemicals in them .
I think of explosions with chemicals .
I think of tiny little disks with data information on them .
I think of little gadgets that are used for things that I do not know what they are .
And after :
A scientist is a normal person .
They have a life .
Scientists are just like you .
Scientists wear normal clothes and not big lab coats .
Scientists have hobbies like baseball and volleyball and basketball .
A scientist 's job looks like a lot of fun .
Randy
Hahn is the current play by play announcer for the San Jose Sharks on CSN - California .
He has held that position for seventeen seasons , and along with partner Drew Remenda , has won four Northern California Emmy Awards in the " On Camera Sports " category .
Mr. Hahn was kind enough to talk with Plank about the upcoming playoff series with Colorado and what he feels are the keys to the series for San Jose .
You can read more his thoughts on the playoffs at The Seagate Broadcaster 's Blog , as well as joining him and Drew during the entire first round on CSN - CA .
Fear The Fin would like to thank Randy Hahn and Comcast for making this interview happen .
San Jose has had some tough first round matchups the last two postseasons with Calgary and Anaheim .
How does a series with Colorado compare ?
The big trap that we , the collective Shark nation , can fall into here is to exhale and say , " Oh thank god we do n't have to play Detroit . "
Colorado has proven all year long that they are a legitimate team , a legitimate contender , and are tough to beat .
I think that it 's going to be a very difficult series .
What they lack in experience they will make up for in youthful exuberance , and I think they will be a real tough opponent .
You look at the Sharks , and essentially they have all the pressure on their shoulders .
Like you talked about , Colorado is coming in with that youthful exuberance , they were n't predicted to be here .
Do you think that plays a role in the first round or will San Jose come out chomping at the bit following the loss to Anaheim last season ?
Well they better .
I think that everybody who was in that dressing room last year that is still around ought to have that on their minds the next couple of days , and use that as motivation to get ready for game one .
Losing those first two home games to the Ducks last year basically spelled the end of the series .
The Sharks worked all year long to get home ice advantage and in two nights it was gone .
Really in one it was gone , but in two , you know , the series was done and they never recovered from that .
Get ready for game one and get ready to win it , flex your first - place home - ice advantage muscle against a less experienced team , but also do n't fall into the trap of not respecting them .
I think if the Sharks do that then they 'll be okay .
If they fall into the trap of thinking that they got off lightly they 're going to be in trouble .
Colorado has a lot of quick forwards , a lot of team speed .
In what ways do you think the Sharks can nullify those assets , because it seemed San Jose struggled containing that during the season .
I think the Sharks have to use their skill and have to play fast too .
Everybody in the NHL plays fast now .
It remains to be seen whether or not Matt Duchene is going to be ready for game one , whether or not Peter Mueller is going to be ready for game one , but beyond that they still bring a lot of speed to their lineup .
The Sharks have speed too with Marleau on the top line , and other players who bring that asset as well -- Devin Setoguchi , Torrey Mitchell are good skaters , Dan Boyle is one of the best on the team .
Maybe if you go pound for pound Colorado has a little more team speed , but I think the Sharks skill can overcome that .
Speaking of Mueller -- do you think Rob Blake 's hit on him brings another layer of intrigue to the series , or is that something the players may not pay that much attention to ?
I 'm not sure the players will pay that much attention to it , but as a broadcaster we sure will .
Same goes for the fans , especially if Mueller does n't play .
Here you have the fans in Colorado used to cheering for Rob Blake when he won a Stanley Cup there , and then after that hit they were on him .
If Mueller 's out they will be all over Rob Blake in games three and four .
You know what though , I find in these playoff series the issues come from the actual games from within the series themselves .
More so than what carries over from the regular season .
Because game one is in San Jose , Sharks fans probably are n't thinking about whether or Mueller is going to play as far as an emotional standpoint is concerned .
By the time you get to game three in Denver so much has already happened in the first two games in the series .
New storylines have begun to present themselves ...
Yeah , I can't imagine Rob Blake is going to be a focal point anymore unless he 's been a huge offensive threat for the Sharks .
By the time we get to Sunday I doubt that hit will be that big of a deal anymore .
Who 's a player on Colorado , outside of Paul Stastny and Milan Hejduk , that you look at and say , " You know , this guy could be a game changer . "
Someone that may not be on the radar of Sharks fans .
I think Chris Stewart is fantastic , Mueller was obviously making a big impact until he got hit .
Another guy who flies under the radar for them is T.J. Galiardi .
One more young player who has received an opportunity to make a statement and he has done that from time to time throughout the season .
I would have to say Stewart is definitely the guy outside of Stastny and Duchene .
If I remember correctly Galiardi is one of the leaders on the team in terms of points per sixty minutes played [ Ed.
Note : Galiardi is third behind Stewart and Stastny ] .
Yeah , and again , league - wide he certainly flies under the radar .
It was kind of weird how the schedule worked this year , playing them twice in October and then not again until twice in March .
You kind of lose track of them except what you read and see on TV .
I 'll throw one other name in there because I think he is a guy to really watch , and that 's Brandon Yipp .
He only played thirty two games but he has nineteen points , eleven goals , and is a really dynamic hockey player the Sharks are going to have to deal with .
In past postseasons the Sharks have lacked a player like Scott Nichol who is going to go into the corners , serve that agitator role .
What does he bring to the Sharks in the playoffs and what has he taught the locker room during the regular season ?
Nichol is leading that group of guys who make up the Sharks energy players .
He is going to be a great role model for the younger players to watch , guys like Couture , Mitchell , Setoguchi , Vlasic .
It is a great learning tool for players of that ilk to watch the energy he brings and how he prepares himself for the playoffs .
This is a guy , if you look at his background , who had to fight and scrap to get to the NHL , and then again to stick around .
When you are Scott Nichol and you get the opportunity to be in the Stanley Cup playoffs you cherish it .
From that standpoint I think he will be a great role model going into these big games .
The other thing that he does is get under the skin of the other team , which is something that is instrumental in the playoffs .
You have to go after people and do it in a way where you get them off their game without taking penalties .
The third thing is , those players such as Nichol and Ortmeyer are going to need to score .
I 'm not saying the Sharks are going to rely on them all the time , but they will need to contribute offensively if they are going to play .
Looking back on the history of any playoff team that has gone deep , those guys on those lines contribute offensively and get goals for you .
An example would be , even though they lost on Sunday , Jody Shelley who down the stretch got some goals when they were fighting to get into the playoffs .
That same thing needs to happen for the Sharks .
It was nice to see some ex-Sharks get in on the action during the final day -- Shelley , Carle , Boucher , Stuart with the shootout winner .
One more benefit from the Joe Thornton trade right ?
( laughs )
There you go , that 's a good way to look at it .
How impressed have you been with the young players who have made an impact this year ?
Do you think they manage to contribute on the scoresheet ?
Again , you 're talking about young guys stepping into the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in their lives .
And that 's always a challenge .
On the same token , that is something Colorado will really have to deal with as well .
Are those guys just happy they got to the playoffs , or are they going to make some noise and commit to playoff hockey ?
All this remains to be seen , people handle pressure in different ways .
We 'll see if Logan Couture and Jamie McGinn , using those two as an example , are ready to step up and contribute at the NHL Playoff level .
Logan has only had one year of American League and Jamie has had a little more experience .
What I do like however is that when Couture came up this time he looked like he was never going to go back .
The other times he came up you saw him for a few games , and he made some contributions here and there , but you could tell he was n't quite ready and he needed to go back to Worcester for some more development .
Now he 's making a difference .
Scoring big goals , not afraid to go to the net .
The other great thing about it is that as soon as he got here , Jamie McGinn got going .
I really do think those things are connected .
Jamie was kind of stagnant when he came up this last time -- sort of just here , not making a real impact .
And if you look at when he started to get going it was when Logan came here .
They are n't always on the same line , but I think the fact that their energy fed off each other due to the time they spent together in Worcester .
Those two are going to be really important .
We need them to be .
Going back to what I was saying before , those guys have to contribute .
If they 're here , they have to score .
They have to make a contribution offensively .
They just have to .
That 's what they do .
We spoke with McGinn earlier in the year and he mentioned some of the things you were saying , that playing with Couture in Ottawa with the 67's and then in Worcester established some chemistry .
They clicked with one another .
I think it helps with their confidence .
As young players , to be able to go into this adventure together allows them to look across the room and see a guy who they have been through some things with before .
That 's a good thing .
When you add up these intangibles they all matter in the playoffs .
I 'm real excited to see how these kids do .
Couture left us with the final regular season moment last night with that winning shootout goal .
That was a special play .
Not everybody in this league makes that play , knowing that you have a chance to win the Conference with that goal .
And it turns out we did .
What do you think is the Sharks biggest weakness ?
Their greatest strength ?
The biggest weakness is probably the obvious one , and that is playoff baggage .
The best way to shed that is to go out and start well .
If you establish yourself as a top team in game one , that baggage will slowly start to fall to the wayside .
If you do that again in game two and go to Denver with a 2 - 0 lead in the series all of a sudden no one is talking about your baggage so much anymore .
That past mental baggage is probably the big thing that they carry as a group , although there are enough guys who were n't here last year that may not have that same tag on them .
Even still , as a team they still carry that around .
Their biggest advantage is the fact that they have played reasonably well for the whole year , good enough to win the West .
The Sharks have gotten solid play down the middle , and some players are beginning to come on as of late .
Torrey Mitchell is one of those guys .
You look at the defense and Boyle has been good all year , but you can tell Rob Blake really wanted to make sure he was ready for this part of the season .
He 's been playing the best hockey of the year right now .
Post - Olympics he has really turned it on .
The nice thing about that is it puts Douglas Murray in a three / four role , and with Vlasic back as a two after Boyle , it balances the defense much better .
When Vlasic was out you saw Murray forced to play outside of his envelope on some nights .
I 'm not saying he was overmatched , because he has gotten better and better every year and will continue to do so , but sometimes I thought he had to handle a little too much .
Now with Vlasic back , who has played really well again , you stack up with Boyle , Vlasic , Blake , Murray as your top four .
That 's pretty solid .
In goal Nabby has always been behind Brodeur , and I do n't know why anybody has n't been talking about him for Vezina .
Maybe because they think the Olympics has something to do with voting for the Vezina , which it does n't .
He has been one of the best goalies all year .
If your top three or four defenseman are solid and you get the goaltending , you are going to contend .
Then the only thing that separates you from the rest of the pack is your character , and your scoring depth .
Going back to what we were saying about those lines outside of the top two , they have to contribute in the playoffs or you wo n't be going very far .
Both Todd McLellan and Joe Sacco are young coaches in the NHL .
Do you think last year 's experience against the Anaheim Ducks allowed McLellan to get a feel for a playoff type atmosphere as a head coach ?
For example he broke up the top line after game one and then went back to them in game three -- will we see HTML all the way through or is there still some flexibility there ?
I think going into game one McLellan is going to go with Marleau , Heatley , and Thornton because that is what he 's been playing down the stretch .
That 's his top line and he wants to establish them as a top playoff line .
Even though it is only his second year as a NHL head coach he was an assistant with Detroit when they won the Stanley Cup , and a head coach in the American League when they won the Calder Cup .
McLellan is a winner who has won at the pro level before .
He has a Stanley Cup ring .
He definitely knows what he is doing .
Every situation dictates the action , and he's not rigid -- we 've seen it all year that he is more than willing to tinker .
When the team was going through that post -Olympic funk he had all three of them on different lines trying to break out of that losing streak .
He did everything he could to try and get them going , and he succeeded in that .
Heatley 's pass to Thornton against Vancouver was a pretty play where that line clicked again .
He also has a great staff of people with him .
These guys will do whatever it takes to create the right matchups against Colorado , and I know that Todd learns from every failure , as well as every success , to make himself better .
He 's just that kind of a coach .
To wrap this up , do you think the altitude at the Pepsi Center will play a factor as it has in previous sporting events ?
In your years covering the team has this ever been an issue for the players ?
I think if you start introducing that argument as a team you 're setting up excuses .
There 's no excuses .
You 're the number one team in the West , the best team through the regular season in your Conference for the second year in a row .
It 's a salary capped team , elite players on your top line , blueline , between the pipes .
If you 're starting to talk about the altitude you 're building in excuses .
And there 's no room for that .
Your series prediction , and who will score the game winner .
I believe the Sharks will win it in five .
The game winning goal will be scored by Douglas Murray .
Go Sharks .

There has n’t been anything truly new in homeopathy since its invention ( no , not discovery ; discovery implies that something actually exists to be found ) by Hahnemann in 1796 .
Well , perhaps that ’s not quite fair .
As our knowledge of reality ( medicine , pharmacology , chemistry , physics , etc ) has steadily improved , homeopathy ’s plausibility has dwindled to the point of being indistinguishable from the roundest of numbers ( 0 ) .
And I suppose the recent contortions of logic , abuses of legitimate science , and pure magical thinking put forth to protect homeopathy from the relentless assault of science are far more impressive than that laid out by Hahnemann .
So that ’s news of a sort .
There ’s also homeopathy ’s long and rich tradition of abject failure in randomized controlled trials to consider .
The overwhelming mountain of evidence showing homeopathy to have no effect beyond placebo is impressive and definitive .
That ’s data Hahnemann did n’t have , so that ’s news too .
Each of these properly conducted studies and analyses demonstrates the scientific method ’s utility to help us understand reality and protect us from our own delusions , but frankly , at this point they are about as exciting and useful as proving that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow morning .
News ?
Not so much .
Nuremberg ’s Less Famous Trial
I found myself wondering how far back this trail of negative trials goes ; how long we ’ve been having the identical argument .
Pubmed ’s earliest mention of homeopathy was in 1906 , and the first RCT I found in its database was in 1980 .
However , the oldest double - blind RCT of which I found record was conducted in 1835 in Nuremberg , Bavaria , and subsequently described in an editorial in 2006 entitled “ Inventing the randomized double - blind trial : The Nuremberg salt test of 1835 . ”
Though the trial has its flaws , it was of sufficient quality to satisfy my historical curiosity with a thoroughly depressing answer : 175 years .
The local physicians and public health officials of Nuremberg held an understandably dim view of homeopathy , and as it gained popularity in Nuremburg they became more vocal , and more public , in their opposition :
Von Hoven accused homeopathy of lacking any scientific foundation .
He suggested that homeopathic drugs were not real medicines at all and alleged homeopathic cures were either due to dietetic regimens and the healing powers of nature , or showed the power of belief .
He called for an objective , comparative assessment by impartial experts .
If , as he expected , homeopathic treatment proved ineffective , the government would need to take drastic measures to protect the lives of deceived patients . ”
Sounds familiar , does n’t it ?
Nuremburg ’s resident homeopath Karl Prue ’s defense should as well :
[ Prue ] pointed out that even children , lunatics and animals had been successfully cured .
Based on Hahnemann ’s assertions , he challenged Wahrhold / von Hoven to try the effects of a C30 dilution of salt on himself .
The odds were 10 to 1 , he claimed , that his opponent would experience some extraordinary sensations as a result – and these were nothing compared to the much stronger effects on the sick . ”
Eventually a trial was designed and agreed upon by both parties to test the effect of a 30C dilution of salt .
The trial design was surprisingly good , as it was :
Randomized : participants had an equal chance of being in either the control or experimental group
Controlled : participants not given the experimental therapy were given an indistinguishable and inert placebo
Blinded : participants did n’t know if they received the homeopathic dilution or placebo
Double - blinded : the experimenters did n’t know which participants received the homeopathic dilution or placebo , as the placebo and homeopathic dilution were prepared and the vials containing them randomized and coded by people independent from the experimenters .
Well Powered : the trial contained enough participants so that if , as Prue claimed “ the odds were 10 to 1 … to experience some extraordinary sensations ” that it could detect a difference between the two groups .
Transparent :
The design , hypothesis , methods and outcomes were agreed upon beforehand and explained in detail to all participants , conducted publicly ( in a literal Pub in fact ; these people were full of good ideas ) , results were published quickly , and any deviation from protocol was acknowledged .
Of the 54 people they managed to enroll , 50 completed the study three weeks later by reporting what , if any , “ extraordinary sensations ” they had experienced following ingestion of their vial .
5 people reported sensations in the homeopathic group , 3 in the control , which was statistically insignificant .
Homeopathy had failed the first of many RCTs .
I am not putting this trial forward as the final ( though perhaps it could be considered one of the first ) nail in homeopathy ’s coffin .
The trial design had areas of potential bias , most notably that the symptoms which qualified as “ extraordinary ” are not well defined ( though a glance at the homeopathic proving of “ Natrum Muriaticum ” or “ table salt ” provides some insight into this particular problem ) , and the fact that it relied upon participants to honestly report all symptoms ; a hostile or imperceptive set of participants could easily confound the study .
Nevertheless , on the whole it was solidly designed and executed , particularly when one considers that this is one of the first double - blind , randomized controlled trials ever documented .
Time To Move On
Here we are in 2010 , 175 years after the first of legion negative RCTs of homeopathy , yet it persists with the same tired old arguments .
Is there anything to gain from investing more time , money , resources , and ignoring the highly dubious ethics of subjecting human subjects to a trial that has no hope of benefiting them or humanity , just to prove one more time that homeopathy is an utter failure ?
No , and here ’s why .
I look at the current debate surrounding homeopathy , and I see three primary groups .
The first accepts the last two centuries of scientific progress and evidence and concludes that homeopathy is a delusion unworthy of further study .
They do n’t need another trial .
The second believes in homeopathy in spite of the gargantuan volume of evidence ; further evidence will do nothing to change their minds .
They do n’t need another trial .
The final group is comprised of people who are unaware of the nature of homeopathy or the evidence that already exists .
This final group requires exposure and education ; they require World Homeopathy Awareness Week ( SBM edition ) .
They do n’t need another trial .
Waste Management has opened a landfill - gas - to - energy facility at its Superior Landfill and Recycling Center in Georgia , which uses methane gas to power up to 3,400 homes in the surrounding area .
The facility is among the largest of its kind in Georgia and the Southeast , according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) data .
Methane gas — created from the natural decomposition of waste — is taken from the landfill through a series of wells placed around the site .
From there , gas is used to power eight large engines to generate electricity , creating approximately 6.4 megawatts of power .
“ The opening of this facility represents a new source of clean , renewable energy for our community , ” said Robby White , district manager for Waste Management in Savannah .
“ It is an environmentally responsible way to harness the energy from the waste we all generate . ”
Georgia Power and Waste Management Renewable Energy LLC entered into a 10 - year deal for electricity , which was approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission in April .
Georgia Power selected Waste Management from a number of independent renewable generators that submitted bids through the company ’s green request for proposals issued in April 2009 .

IBM does n't seem to be too happy with this situation and has been working for the past three years on perfecting its Watson supercomputer : an array of server racks that 's been endowed with linguistic algorithms allowing it to not only recognize oddly phrased or implicative questions , but to answer them in kind , with direct and accurate responses .
Stuffed with encyclopedic knowledge of the world around it , it answers on the basis of information stored within its data banks , though obviously you wo n't be able to tap into it any time soon for help with your homework .

The Western Australian Government has suspended all flu vaccinations for children under five while it investigates a spike in admissions to Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth .
The Health Minister , Kim Hames , says 45 children have been taken to hospital suffering high temperatures and febrile convulsions after receiving the vaccination .
Dr Hames says the program will be suspended until the department finishes its investigation .
He says parents who have had their children vaccinated should take precautions .
" If it 's longer than 12 hours ago then there is no risk , " he said .
" But if it 's in the last 12 hours they should make sure that they give their child paracetamol and then take every effort to make sure that the temperature of their child is settled . "
Dr Hames says parents can call Health Direct for more information on 1800 022 222 .

Researchers have long proven emissions from cars , trucks , coal plants reduce air quality and affect our health .
Yet another study documents the serious health impacts on all of us , specifically our heart and arteries .
Reuters take :
The evidence is stronger than ever that pollution from industry , traffic and power generation causes strokes and heart attacks , and people should avoid breathing in smog , the American Heart Association said on Monday .
Particulate matter appears to directly increase risk by triggering events in susceptible individuals within hours to days of an increased level of exposure , even among those who otherwise may have been healthy for years , ” said Dr. Robert Brook of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who headed the group writing the report .
A review of six year ’s worth of medical research also showed strong evidence that pollution can help clog arteries , and a “ small yet consistent ” association between short - term exposure to air pollution and premature death .
….
The group recommends that the elderly or anyone with heart disease , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , or diabetes should pay attention to air pollution and air quality index warnings .
“ People can limit their exposure as much as possible by decreasing their time outside when particle levels are high and reducing time spent in traffic — a common source of exposure in today ’s world , ” Brook said .
US justice department making preliminary inquiries into tech giant 's activities in the digital music market , say reports
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The US justice department is making preliminary inquiries into Apple 's activities in the digital music market , according to reports .
The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported that the justice department contacted music labels and digital music providers earlier this month to ask them about Apple 's conduct in the market .
" It was a very preliminary conversation , " one source involved told Reuters .
Given Apple 's leading market share the broad questions involved iTunes , these people said .
Billboard magazine reported in March that Apple had used its market dominance to prevent labels from agreeing to let Amazon.com exclusively debut new songs .
Spokespeople for Apple , Amazon and the justice department declined to comment .
It was reported yesterday that Apple 's market value had overtaken Microsoft at $ 222.1 bn ( £ 155bn ) .
Analysts suggested that the fact that the former underdog is now attracting attention from US regulators is a sign of its strength in the technology market .
When he arrives at that night 's casino of choice , Wayne makes a beeline for the penny slot machines .
If it 's the middle of the month and he has just cashed his Social Security check , he will keep battling the one - armed bandits until 2 a.m .
Wayne is waiting to hit the jackpot , and he is long overdue .
If Ron Wayne , now 76 , were n't one of the most luckless men in the history of Silicon Valley , it would n't have turned out like this .
He was present at the birth of cool on April Fool 's Day , 1976 : Co-founder - along with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak - of Apple Computer , Wayne designed the company 's original logo , wrote the manual for the Apple I computer and drafted the fledgling company 's partnership agreement .
That agreement gave him a 10 percent ownership stake in Apple , a position that would be worth about $ 22 billion today if Wayne had held onto it .
But he did n't .
Protecting his assets
Afraid that Jobs ' wild spending and Woz 's recurrent " flights of fancy " would cause Apple to flop , Wayne decided to abdicate his role as adult - in - chief and bailed out after 12 days .
Terrified to be the only one of the three founders with assets that creditors could seize , he sold back his shares for $ 800 .
In a place where risk and innovation are part of the accepted equation of change , he became Silicon Valley 's ultimate what - if story .
" If he'd had the foresight and , more importantly , the fortitude to hang on for another six months , it would be a completely different situation for him , " said Tim Bajarin , an analyst for Creative Strategies , who has covered Apple since 1981 .
No second - guessing
Though Wayne remains an obscure figure whose story is rarely told - and then usually as a cautionary tale - he refuses to second - guess himself .
" I do n't waste my time getting frustrated about things that did n't work out , " he says .
" I left Apple for reasons that seemed sound to me at the time .
Why should I go back and ' what if ' myself ?
If I did , I 'd be in a rubber room by now . "
Moments later , however , he turns somber .
" Unfortunately , my whole life has been a day late and a dollar short , " Wayne says .
With the recent unveiling of the next - generation Apple iPhone , the company 's other co-founders can expect to see their personal fortunes rise .
Again .
Since the release of the first iPhone two years ago , shares of Apple stock have more than doubled in value .
Jobs ' stake today is worth $ 1.5 billion .
Wozniak 's Apple holdings are not a matter of public record .
Neither responded to interview requests .
Wayne was 42 and chief draftsman at Atari when he first encountered 21 - year - old Steve Jobs , who was freelancing at the pioneering video game company after dropping out of college .
Jobs had already met Wozniak , whose designs for a computer in a box he had seen at the Homebrew Computer Club , and now he was thinking about trying to sell them .
Role as sounding board
Wayne , who still lived with his mother , served as a frequent sounding board .
" He was talking about the possibility of coming up with a personal computer , " Wayne says of Jobs .
" There were all these other things he wanted to do , so should he waste his time being focused on that ?
I told him that whatever he wanted to do , he could do it more easily with money in his pocket . "
But he cautioned Jobs never to forget that the money was just a vehicle for creating things .
" But he forgot , " Wayne says now .
" He probably wo n't like me for saying this , but I think he got caught up in the business of business .
He became so enamored with succeeding at this stuff that he began doing it for the sake of itself .
He began making money for the sake of making money .
What can somebody do with $ 200 million that they can't do with $ 100 million ? "
The ' tiebreaker '
Jobs quickly figured out that his budding partnership with Wozniak would require adult supervision and asked Wayne to step in as the " tiebreaker . "
The two Steves came to Wayne 's Milpitas , Calif. , apartment , and after two hours of thrashing it out , the older man explained to Wozniak that the electronic architecture he was creating was critical to the ongoing existence of Apple .
" It was at that point he said , ' Let 's form a company , ' " Wayne recalls .
Jobs came up with the idea of giving himself and Wozniak each 45 percent , the final 10 percent going to Wayne , who would mediate disputes between his headstrong partners .
" That would resolve any problems forever and ever , " says Wayne , who drew up the contract on a typewriter .
There was no such thing as a word processor yet .
They were about to invent it .
After the agreement was signed by all three , Wayne took it to the county registrar 's office .
Never owned an Apple
These days ,
Wayne sells stamps , rare coins and gold out of his home to supplement his monthly government check .
When his precious metal clients drop by , he straps on a .38 caliber Police Special , in case one of them tries to rob him .
He has never owned any Apple product , and when Wayne recently bought his first desktop , it was a Dell .
It 's been years since he last heard from Jobs .
Wayne insists he has no regrets about his choice then , though he 's careful not to say he would do the same again .
" I'm as enamored with money as anybody else , and there are all sorts of things I 'd love to do if I had it , " he says .
Acts - as - taggable - on , subdomain - fu , tweetstream , seed - fu , oauth2 , and multi_json .
What do all of these open source projects have in common ?
Why , Michael Bleigh , of course !
This week , meet our Creative Director , Michael : expert programmer , prolific designer , and open source crusader .
In his three years at Intridea , Michael has created a staggering number of open source solutions for Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers .
His contributions to our community are noteworthy and it is for this reason that I start off the interview by asking him about his inspiration and passion for open source software and development .
For Michael , it was simple : “ I saw people doing cool things and thought , hey , I want to be like those people ! ” .
His first ( and most popular ) project was acts - as - taggable - on , “ a tagging plugin for Rails applications that allows for custom tagging along dynamic contexts ” .
Michael says that the project came about because , “ I really needed the functionality , and I was able to get it by modifying an existing plugin .
I rewrote it and then I figured , well , I should release this .
Instantly , I was hooked . ”
He has created over twenty open source projects since he started with Intridea , and cites several of them as personal favorites , such as subdomain - fu : “ Lots of people were making Rails apps with subdomains and everyone seemed to be complaining about it .
This one just took a lot of hard work and perseverance reading Rails internals to make it work right , and once it was done , subdomains just worked . ”
Most recently , he has been working with OAuth2 ; “ I ’ve really gotten interested in these open standards , and when OAuth 2.0 came out I was happy to be able to write the first Ruby library for it . ”
As our internal open source pioneer , Michael spends a lot of time focusing on creating these open source tools .
But he does n’t just create open source solutions ; he also points out that he uses dozens of open source projects every day .
It might sounds like a high number , but Michael explains , “ Anyone who develops for Rails is using a ton of open source projects .
Every gem in your Rails app is someone ’s hard work , sweat and tears . ”
Michael contends that more developers should make time to develop or work on open source software .
“ I ’ve always wanted to give a sort of open source cheerleader talk at one of these conferences .
It ’s so easy , there ’s no reason everyone ca n’t do it . ”
Michael is equally a programmer and a designer .
From an early age he had a passion for both computing and gaming , as well as drawing .
“ I really enjoyed cartooning .
I used to do dead - on Penny Arcade art style as well as a decent anime style .
My freshman year of college I had a webcomic called ‘ Fun With Sharpies ’ that were just hastily drawn Sharpie comics . ”
He has even contemplated starting a weekly webcomic for Intridea .
As a designer , he laments the lack of design talent in the open source community .
“ Apple has a monopoly on pretty graphics with a POSIX shell ( though the new Ubuntu is nice ) .
I ’d love to find a way to encourage more designers to get involved with open source and make things that cause Cupertino to be jealous instead of the other way around . ”
Michael admits that although he makes every attempt to use open - source software , he still uses proprietary software .
Mac OS
X is his primary operating system due largely to the availability of Adobe ’s design tools .
Michael does his best to try to bridge the gap between designers and the open source community ; “ I ’ve created some open source projects with a UI , like my Twitter client for Google Chrome , but I ’d like to do more . ”
He notes a barrier to entry for open source design : “ I think that coders can understand the open source process more easily .
We deal with version control and team development all the time , but designers are n’t used to that .
There needs to be a channel of communication and encouragement . ”
A good example of Michael ’s exceptional talent as both designer and developer can be seen in his RailsConf 2010 presentation , “ The Present Future of OAuth ” .
“ It ’s a subject that lots of people find confusing and boring , so making the slides fun helped keep it lively and explain things in simpler terms . ”
He enjoyed working with simple illustrations styled after the Zero Punctuation reviews .
“ Embracing constraints ( like block people with circles for hands and logos for heads ) can be really rewarding .
My favorite slide is the one where OAuth 1.0 is looking down at the ground …
I feel like it conveys a dejected emotion really well ; getting emotion to translate within such constraints is a fun challenge . ”
Michael has given a number of presentations at conferences around the world .
But , surprisingly , he ’s a pretty shy and timid guy .
“ I ’m not the most extroverted guy , I love to meet new people but I ’m not always great at striking up conversations .
That ’s why I love speaking at conferences . ”
He hopes to be able to speak as early as possible at the conference so that he ’ll have a “ jumping off point ” for conversation .
Michael has always enjoyed speaking ; he was a member of the debate team in high school where he grew up in Olathe , KS and participated in mock trial in college at Georgia Tech .
Although Michael is well known for his open source contributions , he spends most of his time working on internal products and client work at Intridea .
He most enjoys working on products ; “ I have all these ideas in my head and it kills me not to be constantly making them a reality . ”
In the coming year , Michael will be leading a structured team of our internal product developers to help bring innovative ideas to fruition .
Though it may seem that he never stops working , Michael has a great life outside of the office too .
He recently married his high school sweetheart .
“ Morgan sat next to me in a history class my junior year for reasons beyond even her understanding .
I already liked her , but was too shy to say anything . ”
Michael was pretty surprised when she agreed to go to the movies with him for the first time .
“ We went to see ‘ The Mothman Prophecies ’ .
I was so inexperienced with dating that I did n’t know that I should have picked her up and that there should have been dinner involved . ”
But as fate would have it , she fell in love with him despite his lack of knowledge in courtship .
Now he is ecstatic to be married to his “ best friend ” ; the brilliant woman who reads manga and plays video games with him and loves zombies even more than he does .
They are under contract for their first house , a loft in downtown Kansas City , and he says that one of the first things they are going to do is “ get a 6 ’ x4 ′ matisse - style artwork of the Left 4 Dead zombies made to hang in the new loft . ”
He speaks so highly of his wife that it might be hard to believe there is another woman in his life that he adores : his Pomeranian / Papillon mix dog , Zoey .
“ She is 10 pounds , and she acts more like a stuffed animal than a dog .
She warms my feet while I code . ”
Michael and his wife enjoy watching movies , especially going to the movie theater .
“ I will often want to go to the movies ( and drag Morgan there ) for its own sake , not because there ’s anything out I even remotely want to see .
There ’s something about setting everything else aside and just experiencing someone else ’s story for a few hours .
Watching movies at home there are too many distractions . ”
He also enjoys “ standup comedy and concerts in seedy bars . ”
His favorite artist is Ben Folds , and he has been to seven of his shows ( eight in July and five with his wife ) .
He jokes , “ Ben Folds Five was my first concert ever , back in the mid ’90s .
So my musical taste has really evolved . ”
Maybe it ’s true that his musical taste has n’t evolved , but Michael has certainly evolved as both a designer and developer .
He has made great use of his time at Intridea between his open source contributions , his product ideas and developments , and the speed and accuracy with which he can develop client projects .
It ’s no mistake that he so widely known and appreciated in our community .
He works relentlessly to follow through on projects , and has a passion for quality and excellence that is hard to match .
What can I say , we love him !
A GP cleared of murdering three patients five years ago has admitted to a newspaper that he did hasten the deaths of people in his care .
Dr Howard Martin told the Daily Telegraph he acted out of " Christian compassion " for patients ' dignity .
The now retired County Durham GP was struck off on Friday by the General Medical Council for giving excessive morphine doses to 18 dying patients .
Durham Police said it was considering whether to reopen its investigation .
Friday 's GMC disciplinary panel found he had not acted negligently , but it did say he had " violated the rights of the terminally ill " and the 75 - year - old was struck off for " completely unacceptable " treatment of some patients .
It said Dr Howard had acted on the " scantiest of evidence " of unbearable pain .
Dr Martin told the Telegraph that , in two cases , he hastened the deaths of patients without their permission .
" I twice helped people die , not because they wanted to die but because they had such dreadful suffering .
Everyone else wanted to [ die ] - they could make that choice . "
A vet would put a dog down , but under the current system a doctor is not allowed to take positive action to help a patient in a humane way Dr Howard Martin Your comments on Dr Martin case
In an interview with the paper , he said : " There are times when you get called to people , maybe as a locum doctor , maybe as an emergency in their last day of life and you just do n't have the time to go through all that formality .
" I have to treat the situation as I find it .
My conscience is clear .
I do n't have anything to fear . "
He went on to say he accepted that his confession put him at risk of " spending the rest of my life in prison " if police reopened his case .
One of those who he gave a final injection to was his son , Paul , 31 , when he was dying from cancer in May 1988 .
" A vet would put a dog down , but under the current system a doctor is not allowed to take positive action to help a patient in a humane way , " Dr Martin told the newspaper .
Regarding his dying son , he said : " What more could I do for him other than make sure he had dignity ? "
My dad was not in any pain and had no intention of wanting to die Paul Gittins Son 's story : ' No reason to die '
" I do n't believe I 've killed any patients .
I believe I 've made them comfortable in their hour of need .
But I am deemed to be arrogant because I used my discretion .
" They want to extrapolate that to say I 'm choosing to kill people .
It 's not like that .
The patients are about to die and I want to make sure they are comfortable .
" How can a so - called caring society not understand that ?
How can I be reckless with someone who is about to die ? "
Some relatives of Dr Martin 's patients told the Telegraph he had betrayed their trust , others gave him their full support .
' Autocratic attitude '
Dr Martin told the Telegraph he had decided to talk about what he had done to call for reform of care for the dying , which he claims confines the terminally ill to hospitals and hospices rather than allowing them the " dignity " of dying at home .
" The management of people that are dying I think is not good in our country , and I had personal responsibility for that and I used my discretion , " he told the Telegraph .
" And I think that the public needs to discuss this and it should n't be a decision made by a few people who are controllers in this society like the politicians . "
Dr Martin , a former Army doctor and police surgeon who qualified in 1958 , said that during his three decades spent as a GP he had not hidden his views .
I 'm horrified that the doctor seemed to indicate in the interview that he actually hastened the death of two patients without their consent - I 'm speechless Professor Steve Field , Royal College of General Practitioners chairman
" I just promised people that they could die free from pain and with dignity , " he said .
" Most times patients and relatives were of an accord and wanted the patient to be free from pain and have dignity .
In that scenario , I would take control by keeping people asleep until they had passed over . "
Professor Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners , said he was horrified and there was no excuse for hastening patients ' deaths .
" What we try to do as GPs is support patients in their last hours , last days and if we 're finding that the patients are suffering unduly , we can refer and get expert advice from our palliative care colleagues .
" I 'm horrified that the doctor seemed to indicate in the interview that he actually hastened the death of two patients without their consent - I 'm speechless . "
Supt Paul Unsworth , of Durham Police , said : " We are aware of comments Dr Martin is said to have made to the media in the wake of the GMC hearing and our immediate concern is the impact on the relatives involved .
" A decision will have to be made on whether there are any new grounds on which to reopen the investigation and any such decision will be taken following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service . "
The GMC 's fitness to practise hearing in Manchester centred on the deaths of patients between 1994 and 2004 at surgeries in Newton Aycliffe , Shildon and Eldon .
It heard that Dr Martin had an " autocratic attitude " and believed he was always right .
It also heard that while some of the 18 patients might have had only days or hours to live , the deaths of some could have been hastened .
Record - keeping ' appalling '
GMC panel chairman Professor Brian Gomes da Costa said : " Dr Martin 's decisions to administer large doses of strong pain - killing drugs were made on the scantiest of evidence .
" There were many occasions when there was no clinical indication that the patient was suffering any pain .
" His record - keeping , including reasons for giving treatments , was appalling . "
Dr Martin did not attend the hearing , and in a letter from his solicitor he said he had no intention of doing so as he did not intend to practise again .
In 2005 , he was found not guilty of murdering patients Frank Moss , 59 , Stanley Weldon , 74 , and Mr Gittins .

The financial sector faces widespread reforms under the new government
The Conservative - Lib Dem coalition has reiterated its far - reaching plans for the reform of the banking sector .
The government plans to introduce a tax on banks and measures to tackle " unacceptable " bank bonuses , according to its coalition agreement .
An independent commission will also be established to look at breaking up banks into their retail and investment banking arms to reduce risk .
The commission will be given one year to report back on the plan .
But in the agreement document , the government admitted that splitting the banks would be complex , and said it needed to be done in a sustainable way .
The idea has long been championed by the new Business Secretary , Vince Cable .
Meanwhile , some form of additional tax on banks in order to fund possible future bail - outs of the sector has already been proposed by the International Monetary Fund and the Obama administration in the US .
The banks in which taxpayers own huge stakes ... may be somewhat alarmed by the remarks this morning of Vince Cable Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blog in full ' Radical ' coalition deal unveiled Policy - by - policy guide
Mr Cable said that fairness was at the heart of reforms to the banking sector .
" The banks that have been rescued or underwritten by the taxpayer must be treated as the servants , not the masters , of the economy , " he said .
He added that banks would be expected to support economic growth through lending , with tougher lending targets introduced .
The Bank of England will also get greater responsibility for overseeing financial stability , though plans for the future of the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) were not given .
Before the election , the Conservatives said they planned to scrap the FSA , which has been widely criticised for its handling of the financial crisis .

Granted , U.S. market indices are not at sub -March 2009 territory .
The S&P 500 is still up
from its early March low .
But a correction has been due for quite a while .
The value of stocks compared to their companies ' respective earnings potential were simply out of whack -- even if the correction is n't completely behind today 's antics .
" We ’ve been cautiously pessimistic about stock valuations for some time , " said Jim Corbeau , a certified financial planner at Maas Capital Advisors in Portland .
" However , this market drop is unrelated to valuations , and only tangentially related to the Greek fiscal crisis .
It seems to be a case of trading programs taking over . "
Wrote
:
McKay went on to quote Phil Roth , chief technical analyst at Miller Tabak : " This could be the thing that sets off a real correction , but we 'll have to wait and see . "
If you did n't plan for this correction over the past few months by rebalancing your allocations of stocks and bonds , or by harvesting profits from the recent rise in stock values and plugging them into bonds or money - market - like assets , you should n't necessarily take action now .
Check yourself before you do .
First , talk to someone -- a friend or pro -- whose investment judgment you trust .
" If you ca n’t stomach the thought of a 3 % ( much less a 10 % ) drop in stocks , you should n’t have a material exposure to them , " Corbeau said .
If you do make a move , make sure you 're comfortable with what your portfolio's overall return since inception looked like at the end of 2009 .
Because that 's about the point to where we 've slid .
Feel free to disagree .
But that 's my " personal finance without the moodswings " advice .
A porn -film actor who was wanted for murder has died after falling from a rocky hillside in Los Angeles , following a day - long stand - off with the police .
Officers had tried to talk Stephen Hill into surrendering after he fled to the edge of the hill , clutching a sword and threatening to kill himself .
Police said he fell 40 ft ( 13 m ) after being hit by a non-lethal munition .
Hill , 34 , was suspected of killing a colleague with a samurai sword .
About a week ago , he had been told he was being fired from a DVD production house which specialises in pornography .
On Tuesday , several people were attacked at the firm and one died .

Hill had been sacked from the porn company he worked for
Hill , whose screen name was Steve Driver , was accused of attacking colleagues with a samurai sword that the production house used as a prop .
He fled the scene and evaded capture for days , but was surrounded by police marksmen on a rocky hillside on the outskirts of Los Angeles on Saturday .
Perched on the edge of a cliff for some eight hours , he was apparently threatening to kill himself with a sword .
Officers eventually tried to subdue Mr Hill with what the police say was a " less than lethal munition " , but he fell and later died .

As nations focus on controlling carbon , global demand for and production of coal - based electricity continues to increase .
According to the International Energy Agency , the world ’s power demands are expected to rise 60 percent by 2030 , with fossil fuels , including coal , accounting for 85 percent of the energy market .
Ultimately , building towards a sustainable generation future , means balancing carbon objectives , energy demand and affordability .
Biomass co-firing technology can provide a path to addressing climate change while mitigating costs to the world ’s coal - generation base and the customers served .
About half of the electricity in the United States is generated from coal .
At the same time , the increasing focus on energy and climate change policy in the U.S. has introduced significant regulatory uncertainty in generation planning and operations .
This uncertainty around where U.S. carbon policy is headed and when - along with the nature of modern utilities ’ complex planning - requires a long - term , forward - looking strategy , one that fully integrates generation portfolio management with changes in demand behavior .
An integrated asset and fuel optimization approach can help the energy industry create a robust strategy set that will stand the tests imposed by constantly changing regulatory requirements , market dynamics , evolving environmental policies and uncertainties regarding timing , funding levels and rate recovery mechanisms .
Co-firing may indeed make sense , from cost and environmental perspectives , for many coal - based electricity producers .
Co-firing makes use of existing power generation assets and infrastructure with the lowest cost of generation for renewable energy , while providing a means to mitigate the future cost of carbon .
It offers renewable energy generation with low capital costs and takes advantage of the latest technologies and the high efficiencies of today ’s coal power plants .
Many national governments provide tax and financial incentives to encourage electric producers to adopt co-firing .
In the U.S. , where biomass is recognized as a renewable fuel , replacing coal fuel with biomass results in a substantial credit reduction in coal - based carbon dioxide emissions .
Biomass co-firing has been used in Europe for over a decade .
Full - scale commercial co-firing of at least 10 percent biomass - based on heat input - is common practice , with a wide variety of bio-fuels and co-firing configurations .
The European biomass co-firing market has advanced to the point where the EU is implementing a new certification process for sustainably produced biomass for energy generation purposes .
KEMA is assisting in establishing this biomass certification based on the chain of custody - from producer to processors to end -user .
Often electricity producers opt to conduct trials first , to prove the viability , reliability , sustainability and cost - effectiveness of biomass co-firing in their plants .
KEMA has been actively engaged in supporting biomass co-firing initiatives already underway in Europe for over a decade , and this technology has been demonstrated in many boiler types .
The U.S. can leverage the experience gained in Europe to fast - track implementing biomass co-firing .
Complete conversion to 100 percent biomass in a specific unit at multi-unit stations has already proven to be viable and sustainable in certain circumstances .
The challenges in the U.S. are around reliable fuel supply and quality , a lack of incentives and a general reluctance by plant operations to introduce new fuels into existing boilers .
We are seeing biomass co-firing on the rise in North America .
KEMA has performed feasibility studies on co-firing for a number of large North American utilities looking to assess and quantify the risks , review fuel supply surety and obtain a detailed techno - economic assessment and conceptual design for co-firing of biomass in coal - fired plants .
Utilities planning on co-firing between 5 and 10 percent biomass ( by heat input ) initially have also been interested in knowing what it takes to move towards a 100 percent fuel switch to biomass .
In considering the full fuel switch , utilities are looking to ensure a mix of interrelated considerations , including minimal unit de-rating , no severe adverse operating conditions , no degradation of ash quality , no increase in emissions , compliance with regulation and legislation , broad initial fuel scope and competitive economics / favorable internal rate of return .
By using proprietary co-firing control model software , we have been able to facilitate efficient and effective assessment process - providing utilities immediate quantitative insight into the risks associated with firing a mix of fossil and / or biomass fuels in existing coal - fired power plants along with specific guidance to optimize combustion .
As co-firing biomass has become a recognized option in the U.S. electric generation market , biomass co-firing can be a real option in a utility ’s portfolio - based approach to climate planning .
We have worked with a number of U.S. and European utilities in defining their long - term carbon strategies , the majority of whom are asking to include biomass co-firing as a portfolio option within our sustainable integrated energy modeling tools being employed .
This portfolio - based carbon planning process offers another avenue for utilities to assess the impact of biomass co-firing on profit and loss and on the balance sheet along with risk - based scenarios .
For those of you wondering , no I do n’t absolutely hate clowns .

Vast underwater concentrations of oil sprawling for miles in the Gulf of Mexico from the damaged , crude - belching BP PLC well are unprecedented in " human history " and threaten to wreak havoc on marine life , a team of scientists said today , a finding confirmed for the first time by federal officials .
Researchers aboard the F.G. Walton Smith vessel briefed reporters on a two - week cruise in which they traced an underwater oil plum 15 miles wide , 3 miles long and about 600 feet thick .
The plume 's core is 1,100 to 1,300 meters below the surface , they said .
" It 's an infusion of oil and gas unlike anything else that has ever been seen anywhere , certainly in human history , " said Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia , the expedition leader .
Bacteria are breaking down the oil 's hydrocarbons in a massive , microorganism feeding frenzy that has sent oxygen levels plunging close to what is considered " dead zone " conditions , at which most marine life are smothered for a lack of dissolved oxygen .
Such low - oxygen conditions were noticed farther from the spill site , although Joye said she did not think the process would immediately produce a dead zone , since low nutrient concentrations in the water would limit the rate of the bacterial consumption .
Joye said her team also measured extremely high levels of methane , which is also spewing from the gushing BP well at up to 10,000 times background levels in Gulf waters .
" I 've been working in the Gulf of Mexico for 15 years , " Joye said .
" I 've never seen methane concentration this high anywhere in the water . "
Less clear to researchers like Joye are what role the unprecedented deployment of oil - dispersing chemicals are having on the undersea gathering of oil .
She said dispersants likely played a role in keeping the oil underwater but that they are " certainly not required " to produce such an effect , given the deep - water -- as opposed to surface -- injection of oil and gas .
Also still unclear , she said , are the long - term effects of oil and dispersant use on fisheries .
" The primary producers -- the base of the food web in the ocean -- is going to be altered .
There 's no doubt about that , " Joye said .
" We have no idea what dispersants are going to do to microorganisms .
We know they are toxic to many larvae .
It 's impossible to know what the impacts are going to be . "
A full understanding and the full impact to the Gulf 's fishery may be years away , she said .
" It 's a very , very complicated problem , and there are a lot of people doing fisheries work to try to get a handle on this , but it 's going to be months or years probably before we realize the full consequences of this spill , " Joye said .
Asked to react to BP officials earlier assertions that the Gulf of Mexico was a large enough body of water to absorb the impact of an oil spill under way , Joye bristled .
" The solution to pollution is not dilution , " she said .
" It 's an excuse , and it 's arm - waving , and it takes away from the important things that we should be thinking about , " she said , such as measuring the scope of the spill and its effects .
Federal confirmation
Federal officials for the first time today confirmed the researchers ' findings , although Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , who is leading the federal response to the spill , questioned the use of the term " plume " to describe that underwater oil .
" The term ' plume ' has been used for quite awhile , [ but ]
I think what we are talking about are concentrations , " he said .
" ' Cloud ' is a better term . "
Joye 's team 's results echo the findings of a University of South Florida team aboard the Weatherbird II vessel .
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco said her agency had finished testing water samples collected by the USF team that confirmed the presence of the oil .
" The bottom line is , yes there is oil in the water columns , " she told reporters .
" That 's confirmed for the sites we 've done the analyses . "
BP CEO Tony Hayward had disputed the presence of plumes , saying on June 6 that there was " no evidence " of their existence .
BP spokesman John Pack said today they would be paying attention to the data that is coming in .
" We will obviously listen to what they have to say , " Pack said .
Lubchenco said the test confirms the presence of subsurface oil , which she said federal scientists suspected was present .
Lubchenco said that oil was found in " very low concentrations " in the range of less than 0.5 parts per million .
NOAA tested samples from three collection sites , confirming the presence of subsea oil 40 nautical miles northeast of the well .
She said samples from a site 42 nautical miles northeast were inconclusive and that samples from a site 142 miles southeast " were not consistent with the oil spill . "
" That does not mean it does n't have significant impact .
A more complete picture will require additional information , and we 're in the process of getting that , " Lubchenco said .
" We remain concerned about the location of oil on the surface and under the sea , " Lubchenco said .
" We are attacking it aggressively to mitigate the harm and understand the impact . "
Lubchenco said " there is definitely oil subsurface " and that NOAA would continue to analyze water samples as they were collected .
" We will continue to do research to understand where it is and in what concentrations and what are its impacts , " she said .

Growing Protests As UN Attacks Haitian Refugee Camp
Last week , the United Nations peacekeeping mission fired tear gas and rubber bullets into a crowded refugee camp , leaving at least six hospitalized and others suffering respiratory problems .
Citizen organizations plan demonstrations for today , the sixth anniversary of the U.N. armed presence in Haiti .
The march is part of growing protests against the military forces which have amassed in Haiti since the January 12 earthquake and the lack of attention to displaced peoples needs .
On May 23 , students at the School of Ethnology of the State University of Haiti held another in a series of protests on the central Champs de Mars Boulevard .
The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti ( MINUSTAH , by its French acronym ) and Haitian police went into the school , firing tears gas and rubber bullets while the students threw rocks .
Then at about 3:00 , MINUSTAH troops began firing in the internally displaced peoples camp in the downtown parks around Champs de Mars , where many thousands of people are crowded into tight quarters .
The firing continued for hours , according to residents interviewed for this article and other reports .
Camp residents reported that babies and small children choked on the gas and passed out , as did at least two women with preexisting heart conditions .
Three doctors with Partners in Health at the University Hospital reported treating at least six victims of rubber bullet rounds .
Two children were wounded in the face , one of them requiring about ten stitches , according to one of the doctors . [ 1 ]
When the attack began , camp residents , including many elderly and infirm people , and babies and small children fled .
 I saw one woman running with her twins that are three or four months old ,  said Eramithe Delva .
 She had one in each arm , and with every step as she ran they banged against her chest .
Is this what they want for us ?
Many spent the night in the streets , for fear of returning to the camp .
Residents interviewed said they had no idea why MINUSTAH fired on them .
MINUSTAH has since issued an apology for entering in the School of Ethnology .
The statement did not mention the attack on the camp .
Demonstrations in Port - au - Prince and other areas of the country have become a daily occurrence .
Most of them protest the governments handling of the disaster and the heavy political and military presence of foreign powers since January 12 .
Within days after the earthquake , 12,600 U.N. troops , 20,000 U.S. troops , 2,000 Canadians , 600 French , and more from other countries amassed there .
Rural organizer Selina Pierre - Louis said ,  We dont know what these soldiers came to do .
They have batons and guns in their hands .
They zoom up and down in their huge vehicles all day .
We re not at war and were not armed .
We need technical support , we need reconstruction , we need psychological help .
They re not doing anything to help the rebuilding .
They re just adding to our trauma .
Troop levels overall have abated since the first months after the earthquake .
The most recent figures on MINUSTAHs web site show that just over 9,000 MINUSTAH forces remain there .
The missions cost for the current fiscal year is $ 611.75 million . [ 2 ]
The Security Council - approved MINUSTAH was established on June 1 , 2004 with a triple mandate of ensuring a secure and stable environment ,  promoting a constitutional political process , and strengthening human rights .
Francky Etienne Remy , who owns a small craft shop in Jacmel , said ,  The Haitian police are totally ineffectual so MINUSTAH fills a vacuum . 
Yet MINUSTAH troops have repeatedly been accused of killings , arbitrary arrests , and human rights violations throughout the duration of the mission .
( See , for example , the reports of Harvard Law Student Advocates for Human Rights and Human Rights Watch . )
These charges include an attack by MINUSTAH forces in Cité Soleil on April 15 , 2005 , killing several [ 3 ] ; an attack on July 6 , 2005 , resulting in an uncertain number of deaths [ 4 ] ; the killing of at least five , and possibly many more , people in Cité Soleil in December 22 , 2006 [ 5 ] ; and the shooting death of a young man at the funeral of a prominent priest on July 14 , 2009 [ 6 ] .
In February , 2008 , the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services released its findings from an investigation into accusations against Sri Lankan MINUSTAH troops .
It found that acts of sexual exploitation and abuse of children were " frequent " and occurred " at virtually every location where the contingent personnel were deployed . " [ 7 ]
MINUSTAH forces have also been shot at and killed .
MINUSTAH claims it has suffered 152 troop fatalities . [ 8 ]
Beyond charges of unnecessary force , others like the student , small farmer , worker , and popular organizations who are organizing todays march , oppose MINUSTAH because they claim the mission undermines Haitian sovereignty .
The May 26 press statement for the march , signed by ten organizations , states ,  After the January 12 catastrophe , the occupation has been strengthened with other foreign soldiers and MINUSTAH , on the pretext that they are helping us [ T ] hey did nothing to help prevent more than 300,000 people from dying under rubble Now on the sixth anniversary of the occupation , we are taking to the streets of Port - au - Prince to get the country out from under the rubble of MINUSTAH . [ 9 ]
Community organizerNixon Boumba with the grassroots organization Democratic Popular Movement said in an interview ,  Were asking for Haitians to be the true actors in their future , and for an end to the occupation to allow the country to have dignity and autonomy for the development and transformation of the country .
We need schools , we need people in the camps attended to .
After January 12 there have been a lot of opportunities to resolve the problems in the country .
Instead , Canada , France , the U.S. , Brazil , and others have acted like imperialists , strengthening their power and trying to undermine our chance to change the quality of our country .
The U.S. wants Haiti to serve as a military base for the Caribbean , to control resistance from Latin America .
And they want to prevent a massive emigration toward the U.S. and Canada . 

If there is one thing you can say about Mark Zuckerberg it is that he great at the ass - kissing ‘ oopps we ’re sorry ‘ type of PR that Facebook is becoming so well known for .
His latest foray into this realm of gag - inducing public relations spin doctoring is a letter published in the Washington Post this morning .
It contains all the right words placed in the right way in order to try and convince everyone once more that Facebook , like some recalcitrant child caught with its hand in the proverbial cookie jar , has seen the error of its ways and will make it all up to us .
Ya .
Okay .
Whatever .
Here ’s the PR spin talking points that Zuckerberg made sure to get out there :
Here are the principles under which Facebook operates : — You have control over how your information is shared .
—
We do not share your personal information with people or services you do n’t want .
—
We do not give advertisers access to your personal information . —
We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone .
—
We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone .
Uh-huh .
Here ’s the uncensored and real principals that Facebook operates by :
Facebook needs to be making enormous amounts of money .
In order for them to make enormous amounts of money they need the users of the service to share everything possible in order to make Facebook the most attractive platform available .
In order to make these enormous amounts of money Facebook will do whatever it needs to in order to make you share everything possible .
Sure Facebook might indeed bring new easier controls for people to use but the one thing no - one is talking about is whether Facebook will be changing to opt - in rather than the current opt - on model .
As well there is no talk about whether ; in light of these new control , Facebook will be rolling back its recent changes to what they were before all this mess started .
So once again we see Facebook ’s now typical modus operandi in action – push everyone to their limits , profess regret when the outrage gets too loud , and then appear to acquiesce while rolling out the PR machine .
In the end though it is the old case of two steps forward and then one back in order to appear like they care .
Here ’s a hint – they do n’t .
NEW YORK --
When he was hired in 2006 , New York Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum vowed to look under every rock in an effort to procure talent .
That apparently includes discarded boulders .
Sources tell ESPNNewYork.com that the Jets have checked on JaMarcus Russell , and they have cursory interest in the former Oakland Raiders bust who was cut recently after reportedly ballooning to 300 pounds .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : HaskellTorrent / Combinatorrent v0.2.0
Goodbye HaskellTorrent , hello Combinatorrent !
Due to the internationally acclaimed Boing ! 'er Shae Erisson , HaskellTorrent has been renamed into Combinatorrent .
We thus present Combinatorrent v0.2 , Easter eggs release .
This release marks yet another milestone in getting a decent bittorrent client for Haskell .
There are still some performance regressions to be eliminated , but overall it looks far better than in the v0.1.1 release .
Also , the system leaks memory , albeit very slowly ( or so sayeth the great heap profiler ) .
This is the focus for the next version .
We might also look into integrating the FAST extension , since it plugs a series of problematic spots in the original bittorrent protocol specification .
If you want to hack on Combinatorrent , there are a lot of interesting things to do .
I try , deliberately , to keep tasks around which can be used to gain foothold in the source code .
Any level of skill is needed and I am happy to help a newbie if he or she gets stuck on something .
The source code is at http://github.com/jlouis/combinatorrent should you want to tinker with it .
Any kind of patch is welcome , be it fixes or improvements to the goat teleporter .
So come help us avoiding success !
Apart from numerous small optimizations and bug fixes , we can present the following big whats - new thingies ( with an imaginary neon - red blinking what 's new sign ) : NEW STUFF : * Directory Watching : Every 5 seconds , we wake up to check a directory for new torrents .
A .torrent file dropped into the directory will subsequently be downloaded automatically .
* Support multiple torrents at once :
If given multiple torrents on the command - line the client will now download all of them .
* Download rarest piece first :
Use the psqueue package for getting access to a priority search queue and use it to maintain a histogram over rare pieces .
Always try to get the rarest piece first .
* Change all use of CML to STM : Overall , it looks like this change improved the code .
There are still some need for cleanup after the bomb was thrown , but it does look like it will turn out positively .
If CML put you off the track for hacking on Combinatorrent , you can now do it with STM !
* Introduce RTS benchmarks : See http://jlouis.github.com/combinatorrent where we plot SVG - based sparklines for various key RTS parameters over time ( works best in Opera or Chrome ) .
A slow - changing regression has a much harder time hiding now .
* Fix issue # 3 : A grave bug in the Piece Manager made the assertions fail when endgaming .
Fix . -- J.

Cult show we mentioned yesterday ?
Here 's a doozy from this year 's show — the retro vinyl LP " Serenity " by River Tam and the Fireflies .
Note : it 's a Serenity - centric album , so there 's no Jayne 's Song .

Artist Joe Spiotto drew inspiration from old children 's LPs for this piece .
He 'll be selling prints of the cover eventually at his Etsy store , but he notes that there 's a musical surprise for whomever buys it in person :
Since the soundtrack to Serenity was n't actually released on vinyl , this record contains something special for whoever decides to purchase the full item from the gallery .

Kyrgyzstan 's interim government has asked Russia to help end ethnic clashes in the southern city of Osh , in which 77 people have been killed .
" We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down , " interim leader Roza Otunbayeva said .
But Russia said for the time being it would not send troops to Kyrgyzstan .
Thousands of ethnic
Uzbeks have massed at the Kyrgyz - Uzbek border as they try to escape fighting between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks that has raged for two days .
One child was crushed to death at the border .
KYRGYZ - UZBEK TENSIONS
Kyrgyz make up nearly 70 % of the population , Uzbeks account for about 15 % and are concentrated in the Ferghana Valley in the south
Osh , the country 's second city , is home to a large ethnic Uzbek community
There has been tension in the south between the two ethnic groups over land and housing
In 1990 , hundreds were killed in Osh in clashes between Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks
In a televised address , Ms Otunbayeva said she had sent a letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev asking him to send military reinforcements .
She described the situation in Osh as " out of control " .
Russia was not prepared to send troops to Kyrgyzstan under the current circumstances , but would send humanitarian aid to the violence - hit region , a spokeswoman for Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said .
" It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution , " Natalya Timakova , Mr Medvedev 's spokeswoman , was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies .
Mr Medvedev would consult with other members of the regional security grouping , the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation , about a response to the crisis , Ms Timakova said .
The 150 Russian soldiers based near the Kyrgyz capital had been given no instruction to intervene , Russian media quoted an unnamed senior military source as saying .
A plane carrying medical supplies has been sent to Kyrgyzstan to evacuate some of the badly - injured people for treatment in Russia , officials in Moscow said .
The violence is the worst to hit the Central Asian country since President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was overthrown in April .
Nearly people have been hurt , health ministry officials said , adding that there was a shortage of food and care for the injured .
' Streets ablaze '
The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie , who is at the Kyrgyz - Uzbek border , says guards have been letting people through one by one .
The refugees say their houses were burned down and they have nowhere to go .
The gunshots wo n't stop and they seem to be coming closer and closer .
We feel very vulnerable .
Dilia , Osh resident Eyewitness : Kyrgyzstan clashes
In pictures : Kyrgyzstan unrest
People at the border say that hundreds of other Uzbeks are stranded in their neighbourhoods in Osh .
They claim that people are being shot at from armoured personnel carriers , which are making way for armed gangs of ethnic Kyrgyz .
Eyewitnesses told the BBC that many people had been shot dead but it was impossible to retrieve the bodies .
" The situation is very bad .
There is no sign of it stopping .
Homes have been set ablaze ...
Entire streets are on fire , " said Interior Ministry spokesman Rakhmatillo Akhmedov .
Machine - gun fire can be heard as troops try to regain control of the streets , the Associated Press reports .
The interim government has denied security personnel are shooting at people and says its forces are preventing others from entering Osh to join the fighting .
A state of emergency was declared in a second southern city , Jalalabad , as " the area of ethnic instability is expanding " , an official with the interim government said .
Ethnic tensions
Kyrgyz TV reported that the country 's borders with Tajikistan and China have been closed because of the unrest .
According to local reports , the violence broke out between rival gangs and developed into gun battles late on Thursday .
Riots and looting followed .
The unrest comes ahead of a referendum on the constitution , scheduled for 27 June .
Ms Otunbayeva has blamed supporters of Mr Bakiyev for inciting the violence to destabilise the country ahead of the referendum .
The leaders of Russia and China - which borders Kyrgyzstan - have appealed for calm .
The political crisis has raised fears of a civil war in the country , where both Russia and the US have military bases .
Washington uses the base about 300 km ( 190 miles ) from Osh for US operations in Afghanistan .
Mr Bakiyev fled with his family to Belarus after violent clashes between government forces and protesters on 7 April .
Hate your job ?
Want to leave without giving two weeks notice ?
Thanks to Twitter , it 's never been easier to get fired .
All you have to do is sign up for an account and follow these simple steps .
You 'll be unemployed in no time !
Step 1 : Drunk Tweet
As any Spring Break partier knows , drinking impairs your judgment .
It seems to have also impaired the judgment of Major League pitcher - turned - sports - radio - host Mike Bacsik , who put on quite a show during a San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks NBA game in April .
While watching the game , Bacsik bragged that he was " About 12 deep and some shots . "
He proceeded to unleash a string of insults aimed at NBA commissioner David Stern , accused the refs of fixing the game , and even threatened to blow up the NBA 's offices .
But the one that really got people riled up came after the Mavericks lost the game , when Bacsik tweeted :
@ MikeBacsik : " Congrats to all the dirty mexicans in San Antonio . " 
After sobering up , Bacsik deleted the offending tweets and issued an apology .
But it was too little , too late .
Numerous people complained to his radio station , which first suspended Bacsik and later fired him .
After his dismissal , he told ESPN Dallas , " When you tweet like that , it 's not a playful , harmless thing ... I 'm very sorry and will try my best for my actions to speak louder than my tweets . " 
Step 2 : Break the Law ( or Just Anger Your Governor )
Twitter has become a great tool for politicians to connect to the voting public .
Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , for one , has really embraced the technology as a way to share his opinions and views .
For example , in December 2009 , he sent out a tweet saying :
@ HaleyBarbour : " Glad the Legislature recognizes our dire fiscal situation .
Look forward to hearing their ideas on how to trim expenses . " 
Jennifer Carter , one of his Twitter followers who worked for the University of Mississippi Medical Center ( UMC ) , read this message and offered up a suggestion on how Governor Barbour could personally save the taxpayers money :
" Schedule regular medical exams like everyone else instead of paying UMC employees overtime to do it when clinics are usually closed . " 
This " Oh , snap ! "  moment referred to an incident that had occurred three years earlier , when the governor requested the medical center open on a Saturday , when they were normally closed , and bring in a staff of 15 - 20 people who were paid overtime to administer his annual check - up .
This happened before Carter worked for UMC and she was simply repeating what she had been told by other employees .
The governor 's office tracked down Carter and made a formal complaint to UMC , saying Carter had violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , a privacy law that states no employee of a medical facility can reveal any information about a person 's " protected health information . " 
Some argued that Carter did n't violate HIPAA , since she did n't actually give out any information about the health of the governor .
However , others believe that simply saying the governor had even visited a doctor is a violation .
Semantics aside , UMC administrators said it was a violation , so they suspended Carter for three days without pay and strongly suggested she resign to avoid further disciplinary action , which she did .
Step 3 : Have an NSFW Lifestyle
St. Louis - based blogger " The Beautiful Kind "  had been writing online about her polyamorous sex life for years .
Knowing that not everyone would agree with her chosen lifestyle , she was always very careful about maintaining her anonymity , especially when it came to the workplace .
So when she signed up for Twitter , she wanted to be anonymous there as well .
She thought that , thanks to the similarities between the two , it was like signing up for an online message board - you supplied your real name to the website privately , but could choose to be known publicly by your username only .
But when she logged in for the first time and saw that , not only did it show her username ( @TBK365 ) , but also her real name on her profile , she immediately went back and removed it .
Thinking she was now safely anonymous , she used Twitter to promote her blog and to discuss sexually explicit topics with her followers .
However , when her boss at the non-profit group where she worked was told by upper management to do a Google search of all employees , TBK's Twitter account information — with her real name still associated — came up on the Twitter tracking site topsy.com .
The next day , TBK was called into her boss ' office and fired on the spot .
Afterwards , her former boss sent her a letter saying , " While I know you are a good worker and an intelligent person , I hope you try to understand that our employees are held to a different standard .
When it comes to private matters , such as one 's sexual explorations and preferences , our employees must keep their affairs private . " 
Because Missouri is an at - will employment state , meaning employers can fire someone for just about any reason , TBK was SOL .
Step 4 : Question Company Policy
When California Pizza Kitchen ( CPK ) traded in their standard white shirts for black ones , employee Tim Chantarangsu was n't happy with the change .
So he tweeted @calpizzakitchen his opinion :
@traphik : " black button ups are the lamest s**t ever !!! " 
He did n't expect anyone to notice or care , but the next day he received a direct message from corporate asking what restaurant he worked for .
He knew better than to respond , but they tracked him down anyway and he was fired .
They not only referenced his tweet about the shirts , but also an earlier one where he had said he was getting ready to work at " Calipornia Skeetza Kitchen . " 
Little did they know that Chantarangsu is kind of a big deal on another social website , YouTube .
Under the name TimothyDeLaGhetto2 , Chantarangsu has nearly 367,000 subscribers , accounting for over 10,500,000 views of his videos .
Of course he made a YouTube video telling his Twitter story and it has currently been viewed nearly 200,000 times .
Shortly after the incident , he asked his followers to bombard CPK's Twitter account with RTs ( re-tweets ) of his offending message , which they were more than happy to oblige .
Step 5 : Make a Celebrity Look Bad
During his five years on the job , Jon Barrett - Ingels had served a lot of celebrities as a waiter at Barney Greengrass , an upscale restaurant in Beverly Hills .
One day , Jane Adams , star of the HBO series Hung , came in and had lunch to the tune of $ 13.44 .
Unfortunately , when the bill came , Adams realized she had left her wallet in the car .
Ingels knew who she was , so he told her she could run out and grab it and come back .
The actress left , but did n't return .
Instead , someone from her agency called the next day and paid the bill .
However , they did n't leave a tip .
Ingels had recently signed up for Twitter and so , his sixth tweet to his 40 followers said :
@ PapaBarrett : Jane Adams , star of HBO series " Hung " skipped out on a $ 13.44 check .
Her agent called and payed the following day .
NO TIP !!! " 
Over the next few weeks , Ingels started using Twitter to send out a few harmless observations about celebrities that came in to eat — mainly what they ordered or what they looked like that day .
Then , out of the blue , Jane Adams came back to the restaurant .
According to Ingels ' blog , she was clearly upset and begrudgingly slapped $ 3 on the bar for Ingels as a tip .
Surprised , Ingels told the actress she really did n't have to do that , but her gesture was appreciated .
She allegedly replied with , " My friend read about it on Twitter ! "  before storming off .
Adams complained about the tweet to management , so someone from Barney 's corporate started following Ingels on Twitter to see what he was up to .
After reading his celebrity tweets , it did n't take long before they gave him the boot .
Step 6 : Do n't Get Hired in the First Place
If you 've followed steps 1 " “ 5 and you still have a job , here 's the ultimate way to make sure Twitter will keep you from gainful employment .
When recent college grad Skye Riley heard back from Cisco , the computer networking giant , about her job application , one of her first instincts was to tweet about it .
Unfortunately , this is what she tweeted :
@theconnor : Cisco just offered me a job !
Now I have to weigh the utility of a fatty paycheck against the daily commute to San Jose and hating the work .
The unfortunate part ?
An employee of Cisco , Tim Levad , came across her post while doing a Twitter search for Cisco .
He replied to her by saying :
@timmylevad : Who is the hiring manager .
I 'm sure they would love to know that you will hate the work .
We here at Cisco are versed in the web .
Riley 's story was the tweet heard round the world .
It became a hot topic on tech blogs for weeks afterwards , with writers calling it the " Cisco Fatty "  incident .
She later claimed that the tweet was taken out of context — that part of her message was referring to a well - paid internship she had turned down — but it appears the damage had already been done .
While only she and Cisco know what really happened , according to her online resume , she has never worked for the company .

She also joked about how long it had been since the 907 - year - old Time Lord last had sex , making suggestive innuendoes and provocatively lying down on the bed in front of him .
This article is excerpted from An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought , vol . 1 , Economic Thought Before Adam Smith .
An MP3 audio file of this article , read by Jeff Riggenbach , is available for download .
It was in the 16th century that England began its meteoric rise to the top of the economic and industrial heap .
The English Crown in effect tried its best to hobble this development by mercantilist laws and regulations but was thwarted because , for various reasons , the interventionist edicts proved unenforceable .
Raw wool had for several centuries been England ’s most important product , and hence its most important export .
Wool was shipped largely to Flanders and to Florence to be made into fine cloth .
By the early 14th century , the flourishing wool trade had reached a height of an average annual export of 35,000 sacks .
The state naturally then entered the picture , taxing , regulating , and restricting .
The principal fiscal weapon to build the nation - state in England was the " poundage , " a tax on the export of wool and a tariff on the import of woolen cloth .
The poundage kept increasing to pay for continuing wars .
In the 1340s , King Edward III granted the monopoly of wool exporting to small groups of merchants , in return for their agreeing to collect the wool taxes on the king ’s behalf .
This monopoly grant served to put out of business Italian and other foreign merchants who had predominated in the wool export trade .
By the 1350s , however , these monopoly merchants had gone bankrupt , and King Edward finally resolved the issue by widening the monopoly privilege and extending it to a group of several hundred called the " Merchants of the Staple . "
All wool exported had to go through a fixed town under the auspices of the company of the Staple , and be exported to a fixed point on the continent , by the end of the 14th century at Calais , then under English control .
The monopoly of the Staple did not apply to Italy , but it did apply to Flanders , the major place of import for English wool .
The Merchants of the Staple soon proceeded to use their privileged monopoly in the time - honored manner of all monopolists : to force lower prices upon English wool growers , and higher prices upon Calais and Flemish importers .
In the short run , this system was quite pleasant for the Staplers , who were able to more than recoup their payments to the king , but in the long run , the great English wool trade was crippled beyond repair .
The artificial gap between domestic and foreign wool prices discouraged the production of English wool while it also injured the demand for wool abroad .
By the mid-15th century , average annual exports of wool had fallen greatly to only 8,000 sacks .
An Austrian Perspectiv ...

The only benefit to Englishmen from this disastrous policy ( apart from the joint short - term gains to King Edward and to the Staplers ) was to give an unintended boost to the English production of woolen cloth .
English cloth - makers could now benefit from their artificially lower prices of wool in England , coupled with the artificially high prices of wool abroad .
Once again , the market managed to get a leg up in its unending , zigzag struggle with power .
By the mid-15th century , fine , expensive , broadcloth " woolens " were being produced abundantly in England , centering in the West Country , where swift rivers made water plentiful for fulling the woven cloth , and where Bristol could serve as the major port of export and entry .
During the mid-16th century , a new form of woolen - cloth manufacture sprang up in England , soon to become dominant in the textile industry .
This was the " new draperies , " or worsteds , cheaper and lighter - weight cloth that could be exported to warmer climates and was far more suitable for dyeing and decoration , since each individual strand of yarn was now visible in the cloth .
Since the worsted was not fulled , the draperies did not need to be situated near running water , and so new textile manufacturers and workshops sprang up in the countryside  and in new towns such as Norwich and Rye  all round London .
London was the largest market for the cloths , so transportation costs were now cheaper , and furthermore , the southeast was a centre for sheep bearing the coarse , long - stapled wool particularly suitable for worsted production .
The new rural firms around London were also able to hire skilled Protestant textile artisans who had fled the religious persecution in France and the Netherlands .
Most important , going to the countryside or to new towns meant that the expanding and innovating textile industry could escape from the stifling guild restrictions and frozen technology of the old towns .
Now that over 100,000 cloths were exported annually , compared to a few thousand two centuries earlier , sophisticated production and marketing innovations took place .
Establishing a " putting - out " system , merchants paid artisans by the piece to work on cloth owned by the former .
In addition , marketing middlemen sprang up , yarn brokers serving as middlemen between spinners and weavers , and drapers specializing in selling the cloth at the end of the production chain .
Seeing the rise of effective new competition , the older urban and broadcloth artisans and manufacturers turned to the state apparatus to try to shackle the efficient upstarts .
As Professor Miskimin puts it ,
As often happens during an evolutionary period , the older , vested interests turned to the state for protection against the innovative elements within the industry and sought regulation that would preserve their traditional monopoly . [ 1 ]
In response , the English government passed the Weavers ’
Act in 1555 , which drastically limited the number of looms per establishment outside the towns to only one or two .
Numerous exemptions , however , vitiated the effect of the act and other statutes placing maximum controls on wages ; restricting competition in order to preserve the old broadcloth industry came to naught from systemic lack of enforcement .
The English government then turned to the alternative of propping up and tightening the urban guild structure to exclude competition .
These measures succeeded , however , only in isolating and hastening the decay of the old urban broadcloth firms .
For the new rural firms , especially the new draperies , were beyond guild jurisdiction .
Queen Elizabeth then went national , with the Statute of Artificers in 1563 , which placed the nation - state squarely behind guild power .
The number of apprentices each master could employ was severely limited , a measure calculated to stifle the growth of any one firm , and to decisively cartelize the wool industry and cripple competition .
The number of years of apprenticeship , before the apprentice could rise to become a master , was universally extended by the statute to seven years , and maximum wage rates for apprenticeships were imposed throughout England .
Beneficiaries of the Statute of Artificers were not only the old , inefficient urban broadcloth guilds , but also the large landlords , who had been losing rural workers to the new , high - paying clothing industry .
One announced aim of the Statute of Artificers was compulsory full employment , with labor directed to work according to a system of " priorities " ; top priority was accorded to the state , which attempted to force workers to remain in rural and farm work and not leave the farm for glittering opportunities elsewhere .
To enter commercial or professional fields , on the other hand , required a graded series of qualifications such that the occupations were happy in having entry restricted by this cartelizing statute , while the landlords were delighted to have workers forced to remain on the farm at lower wages than they could achieve elsewhere .
If the Statute of Artificers had been strictly enforced , industrial growth might have been permanently arrested in England .
But fortunately , England was far more anarchic than France , and the statute was not well enforced , particularly where it counted , in the new and fast - growing worsted industry .
Man , Economy , and Stat ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 22.75 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 07:50 EST - Details )
Not only was the countryside beyond the grasp of the urban guilds and their nation - state ally , but so too was fast - growing London , where custom decreed that any guild member could engage in any sort of trade , and no guild could exercise restrictive control over any line of production .
London ’s position as the great export centre for the new draperies  largely to Antwerp  partially accounted for the enormous growth of this city during the 16th century .
London ’s population grew at three times the rate of England ’s as a whole over the century , specifically from 3040,000 at the beginning of the 16th century to a quarter of a million early in the next .
The London merchants were not , however , content with free - market development , and power began to move in on the market .
Specifically , the London merchants began to reach for export monopoly .
In 1486 the City of London created the Fellowship of the Merchant Adventurers of London , which claimed exclusive rights to the export of woolens to its members .
For provincial merchants ( outside of London ) to join required a stiff fee .
Eleven years later the king and parliament decreed that any merchant exporting to the Netherlands had to pay a fee to the Merchant Adventurers and obey its restrictionist regulations .
The state tightened the monopoly of the merchant adventurers in the mid-16th century .
First in 1552 , the Hanseatic merchants were deprived of their ancient rights to export cloth to the Netherlands .
Five years later , customs duties were raised on the import of cloth , thereby conferring more special privileges on the domestic cloth trade and increasing the financial ties of the Crown to the cloth merchants .
And finally , in 1564 , in Queen Elizabeth ’s reign , the merchant adventurers were reconstituted under tighter and more oligarchic control .
In the late 16th century , however , the mighty merchant adventurers began to decline .
The English war with Spain and the Spanish Netherlands lost the Adventurers the city of Antwerp , and at the turn of the 17th century they were formally expelled from Germany .
The English monopoly of woolen exports to the Netherlands and the German coast was finally abolished after the revolution of 1688 .
It is instructive to note what happened to printed calico in England as compared to the suppression of the industry in France .
The powerful woolen industry managed to get the importation of calicoes banned from England in 1700 , a decade or so after France , but in this case domestic manufacture was still permitted .
As a result , domestic manufactures of calico spurted ahead , and when the woolen interests managed to get a prohibition - of - calico - consumption act passed in 1720 ( the Calico Act ) , the domestic calico industry was already powerful and could continue to export its wares .
The Irrepressible Roth ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 5.00 Buy New $ 7.95 ( as of 07:40 EST - Details )
In the meanwhile , calico smuggling continued , as did domestic use  all stimulated by the fact that prohibition was not enforced nearly as strictly in England as in France .
Then , in 1735 , the English cotton industry won an exemption for the domestic printing and use of " fustians , " a mixed cotton and linen cloth , which were the most popular form of calico in England in any case .
As a result , the domestic cotton - textile industry was able to grow and flourish in England throughout the 18th century .
Prominent in English mercantilism was the pervasive creation by the Crown of grants of monopoly privilege : exclusive power to produce and sell in domestic and in foreign trade .
The creation of monopolies reached its climax in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ( 1558 1603 ) , in the latter half of the 16th century .
In the words of historian Professor S.T. Bindoff , " the restrictive principle had , like some giant squid , fastened its embracing tentacles round many branches of domestic trade and manufacture , " and " in the last decade of Elizabeth ’s reign scarcely an article in common use  coal , soap , starch , iron , leather , books , wine , fruit  was unaffected by patents of monopoly . " [ 2 ]
In sparkling prose , Bindoff writes how lobbyists , using the lure of monetary gain , obtained royal courtiers to sponsor their petitions for grants of monopoly : " their sponsorship was usually a mere episode in the great game of place - and - fortune - hunting which swayed and swirled incessantly around the steps of the throne . "
Once granted their privileges , the monopolists got themselves armed by the state with powers of search - and - seizure to root out all instances of now - illegal competition .
As Bindoff writes ,
The " saltpetre men of the gunpowder contract dug in every man ’s house " for the nitrate - laden soil which was their raw material .
The minions of the playing - card monopoly invaded shops in search of cards lacking its seal and browbeat their owners , under threat of summons to a distant court , into compounding for their offences .
The search - warrant was , indeed , indispensable to the monopolist if he were to eliminate competition and leave himself free to fix the price of his wares . [ 3 ]
The result of this expulsion of competition , as we might expect , was the lowering of quality and the raising of price , sometimes by as much as 400 percent .

More Satisfied Than Ever
Powerful 4G smartphones like Samsung Epic 4G is one of many reasons Sprint is the most improved company in customer satisfaction , across all industries , over the last two years , according to results from the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index .
Sprint 's improvement was driven in part by substantial gains in two aspects of the survey .
In the area of customers ' perceptions of value , Sprint now leads both AT&T and Verizon .
The company also achieved an impressive improvement in the area of customer loyalty .
With these gains , the company 's overall ACSI score jumped 14 points over the last two years .
In the last six years of the ACSI survey , no other company has improved its satisfaction score by that many points in a two - year period .
The improvements in the ACSI survey come as Sprint has seen nine consecutive quarters of improved customer satisfaction and first call resolution .
The company 's improvements have also been recognized by other independent third - parties , including Sprint winning the # 1 spot for both overall satisfaction for wireless voice service providers and wireless data service providers in a Yankee Group and Mobile Enterprise magazine survey of large business decision makers .
Sprint also ranked high in small and medium business customer satisfaction .
Also noteworthy was Sprint 's two - year Reputation Pulse™ score increase in Reputation Institute 's 2010 U.S. Most Reputable Companies Study ( published annually in Forbes ) .
Sprint 's 18.22 percent gain puts its improvement in the top 10 percent of the 150 largest U.S. companies , ahead of both AT&T and Verizon .

HUNTSVILLE , AL -- A THAAD missile successfully tracked and intercepted a short - range ballistic missile target inside the atmosphere Monday night in what was perhaps the most real - world test of the system so far , according to the Missile Defense Agency and Lockheed Martin , prime contractor for the program .
There were a number of " firsts " on this test of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system , said Tom McGrath , Lockheed Martin 's vice president for the THAAD program .
The intercept occurred inside the atmosphere - it was " endo- atmospheric " - at the lowest altitude yet .
" The very low endo was key , " he said in a telephone interview Tuesday .
" It 's difficult , of course , for any system , but this system is unique in that it can intercept both inside and outside the atmosphere . "
At about 9:32 p.m. Hawaii time Monday , a " foreign military asset " ballistic missile target was launched in the Pacific west of the islands .
About five minutes later , as the THAAD system 's radars and team acquired and tracked the target , an interceptor missile was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility off the island of Kauai .
The soldiers of the 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade , from Fort Bliss , Texas , who were operating the THAAD system knew a test would occur , but were not aware of the target 's precise launch time , McGrath said .
They also used the same tactics , training , eight - missile transportable launcher and other tools that are to go with them into the field .
" We were using the software and hardware that is planned to deploy with the soldiers , " he said .
They also coordinated the test engagement with the soldiers of a PATRIOT missile defense battery located at Kauai , communicating and operating just as they would when they are eventually deployed together , McGrath said .
" We work very hard to keep the flights as realistic as possible , " he said .
After the actual test engagement , a Simulation - Over - Live - Driver software program was used to test different scenarios in the THAAD radar system , he said .
It first simulated the test intercept , then created a " mass raid " scenario with multiple targets .
All the testing was successful , McGrath said , praising the teams involved and pointing out there was much data to examine .
" It 's a lot easier to analyze successes , " he said .
This test makes a record of seven intercepts in seven attempts for an operational version of the THAAD system , which is managed by MDA in Washington , D.C. , and executed by the THAAD Project Office in Huntsville .
KMail Mobile KMail Mobile
News from LinuxTag Berlin
Today a prototype version of mobile variants of the KDE PIM suite was demoed at LinuxTag ( expect more information some time next week ) .
These applications along with GNU / Linux , Mac OS and Windows versions of Kontact accessing a Kolab Server will be on show for the duration of LinuxTag .
The application packages themselves can be downloaded by anyone willing to test them out .
Since the last update about KDE PIM Mobile , there have been many visual and functional improvements to the applications .
Video
The video demonstrates some prototype versions of applications for email and calendering on the Nokia N900 .
Most of the underlying KDE Personal Information Management ( PIM or Groupware ) platform is UI independent and is shared between mobile and desktop variants of the applications .
This allows developers to take advantage of the platform while improving it by sharing features across applications on desktop and mobile devices .
These applications being demoed at LinuxTag show the flexibility of the KDE platform for creating PIM applications .

It is important to remember that these applications are prototypes and work is ongoing at a fast pace to polish and improve them over the coming months .
In the best tradition of the Free Software " Release early , release often " mantra , the applications are available to try out for anyone with a Nokia N900 phone .
The unstable packages are recommended to interested users and testers , with the usual caveats .
The unstable packages will be updated automatically as the applications improve and will incorporate feedback from users about usability and functionality .
Get in touch if you have any feedback or if you want to help out in development .
KDE PIM uses many new platform technologies such as QML , so it provides an exciting playground with plenty of opportunities for innovation and experimentation if you want to get involved .
UI customized per device
The design of the KDE PIM platform is largely UI independent , making it easier portable to different devices .
The current target platform of the KDE PIM Mobile prototype applications is Maemo on the Nokia N900 .
Having a stable platform to work on allows the development of some mobile specific parts of the platform which can be reused in future devices .
The current work on KDE PIM Mobile applications will be largely portable to MeeGo based devices in the future .
The current choice of targetting Maemo , however , means that the applications can be used on devices which are available in shops today .
The top UI layer of the applications will likely need to be customised on a per-device basis because of differences in screen size , orientation , DPI and other factors , but the portability built into the platform itself means that future ports of the applications to new devices will not take as long as the initial development time .
Cryptographic features
Encrypted Email Encrypted Email
One of the major strengths of KDE PIM has always been support for cryptographic operations such as signing and encryption .
Those operations are also a primary use - case of mobile variants of the KDE PIM applications .
KMail - mobile makes on - the - move reading and writing of signed and encrypted emails as easy as possible , supporting multiple cryptographic technologies such as OpenPGP and S / MIME .
On - the - move access to multiple remote stores
At the center of the KDE PIM platform is Akonadi , the generic data cache .
Akonadi is a server for UI independent , fast read - write access to remote or local data , such as emails , events and addressees .
The KDE PIM platform includes a maturing client library to make it easy for developers to use the server .
Because Akonadi includes caching features , it is suitable for use on mobile devices where internet connections may not be available , and where they are available , may not be reliable .
Access your data from multiple sources
Access your data from multiple sources
Akonadi solves that problem by operating as a transparent cache to make it easy to access the data you use most often , and by recording writes you make to remote locations , playing them back when the connection is available again .
Because all remote data access is outside of application processes , this makes the applications themselves faster and insulated from network related issues .
Free Software and Your Data
The KDE PIM platform is entirely Free Software , developed collaboratively in open KDE repositories and communication channels .
Well understood benefits of Free Software include easy control and migration of data and adherence to open and accessible protocols and standards .
The KDE PIM platform already has support for accessing data from remote providers such as Kolab servers , IMAP servers , Google accounts and more .
Any application can easily make use of these resources , and the KDE PIM Mobile applications already do .
Because most available services use open standards for storing data , such as vCard and iCal , it is easy to move away from a service if the data can be retrieved , and easy to migrate to a new service that supports available standards .
In a highly cloud connected world , having multiple different storage locations for personal data allows an " eggs in different baskets " approach to managing information about yourself .
While it is convenient to have all of your emails , contacts and events hosted by a single service , the aggregation of it leads to privacy concerns because the external service often acts like it owns your data .
In some cases they actually do , due to the fine print in their agreement with you ( the one you never read ) .
One option is to fragment the data , storing related information in different locations and different clouds .
KDE PIM makes such an approach more convenient , because it provides a point to aggregate the data .
Disparate pieces of information can be collected and indexed on devices and desktop computers controlled by the user , instead of on servers controlled by someone else .
Conclusion
All in all there are plenty of reasons why the developments shown at LinuxTag are great for the KDE community and Free Software in general .
First , because excellent Free Software mail , calendar , notes and addressbook interfaces are coming to devices near us .
Secondly because it makes use ( and contributes to ) an excellent platform we also use on our desktops .
Third , this is also introducing a uniquely secure solution which ( fourth ) can help protect your data like no other client can .
So - at LinuxTag the demo devices drew many interested visitors and there is plenty of reason to expect the online demo to do similar .
Have a look at this and consider what you can do to make this happen !
Unless you ’ve been living under a rock , you ’ve probably noticed most of the world has been focusing their attention on the 2010 World Cup , which officially started yesterday .
We know many of you would love to be able to watch the matches on you phone while you ’re out and about , so we ’ve put together a few ways that this can be done .
One of the really cool things about the World Cup games this year is that so many sites are streaming them live , for free , making it pretty easy to catch a match wherever you ’re at as long as you have high speed internet and access to a computer .
For those of you that ca n’t make it to a computer or TV during a match , we ’ll explain how you can use your Android phone to watch the games on the go – but promise not to blame us when you scream ‘ GOOOOOOOAAAAAAL ’ while riding the subway .
Since 2.2 has leaked , and includes Flash , you should be able to catch the games live on any site that is streaming them in Flash – without the need for SkyFire .
We have n’t had a chance to try Since 2.2 has leaked , and includes Flash , you should be able to catch the games live on any site that is streaming them in Flash – without the need for SkyFire .
We have n’t had a chance to try espn3.com on Froyo yet , but that ’s definitely worth a shot if you ’re a subscriber to one of the supported ISPs .
Otherwise , you ’re pretty certain to have good results with Univision here , albeit with Spanish commentary .
If you ’re looking for the games in English you can try here and here , but those are streams put up by users and thus may not be the most reliable
Method 1 : SkyFire
So , the first method we ’ll look at here is SkyFire .
There was a lot of buzz around SkyFire when it first dropped for Android because it allowed you to watch Flash video without needing to upgrade to 2.2 , which at the time of SkyFire ’s release was unavailable .
It works by taking the Flash video you ’re attempting to watch and transcoding it on - the - fly and in the cloud , then streaming that transcoded video to your handset .
In my experience it ’s worked on most of the Flash videos I ’ve come across .
It turns out that SkyFire does n’t just transcode archived video , like you ’d find on YouTube , but it can also transcode Flash video that ’s streaming live .
You can probably see where I ’m going with this : if you hit up one of the sites streaming the World Cup games in SkyFire , it should allow you to watch it live on your mobile !
Now , there is a catch : there are only two sites that I know of that are legitimately and reliably streaming the World Cup games online for free .
One is espn3.com , which will only work if you ’re a subscriber to high speed internet from one of quite a few ISPs located in the United States – however , not only is this not really an option for our international visitors , but I was n’t able to get their video working with SkyFire either .
Luckily , the other site that ’s streaming all the matches not only is streaming them internationally – but they work with SkyFire !
There is a small catch though : the site that ’s streaming the video is Univision , so the commentators will likely be speaking in Spanish .
Still , it ’s small trade off for being able to stream the game ’s live in fairly high quality , plus where else are you going to hear ‘ GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL ’ every time someone scores ?
In order to catch the games in SkyFire , simply point the browser to this link while a match is in progress , and you ’ll see the video thumbnail pop up in the lower right hand corner .
Give that a tap , and SkyFire should have your video loaded in a few seconds ( or minutes depending on your connection ) .
After that , you can sit back , relax , and try not go mad from the incessant buzzing of the vuvuzela .
No , that ’s not a swarm of bees attacking the stadium .
Method 2 : Sprint Mobile TV
Now , this method is a bit easier , but I ’ve heard that quality of the video , and the overall viewing experience , lags behind what you get using SkyFire .
Additionally , in order to use this method , you have to be a Sprint subscriber , though we know that user base has grown quite a bit since the launch of the EVO 4G .
Simply put , Sprint is offering their customers the ability to stream the World Cup games live and free through their Sprint Mobile TV application .
Just fire it up , find the World Cup channel , and you ’re good to go .
You ’re probably better off if you ’re an area with 4G reception , as it seems that Sprint has disabled the use of this application over WiFi – likely to prevent unauthorized use .
For that reason , the quality of the video will depend on the cell reception available to you at the moment .
As you can tell by the picture above , in our tests , the quality was considerably worse than what SkyFire offered , so as long as you do n’t mind Spanish commentary , that ’s probably the best solution .
If you have any other tips or tricks for keeping up with you favorite World Cup teams on the go , drop us a line in the comments !
June 25 , 2010 ( KHARTOUM ) – More 25 people were shortly arrested by the Sudanese authorities in the capital Khartoum after performing the first mixed - gender fashion show on Thursday .
The arrest took place the organization of the show in a popular Khartoum club on Thursday evening .
Fashion shows are not a novelty in the Sudanese capital , but it was the first to feature male and female models parading under the same roof there .
" I spent the night in jail but it is not clear why they arrested us , " Sudan - born male model Rashad el - Nimeiry , who holds US nationality , told AFP on Friday after his release with all the arrested people .
The model further wondered " We were decently dressed .
There were wedding clothes " .
During Thursday ’s fashion show , male models showed Western outfits , parading with their shirts unbuttoned , while their female counterparts wore classical party clothes .
There was no immediate explanation from police on Friday as to why they were arrested .
However , many were told to appear on Sunday before the state prosecutor amid speculation that they could be charged with indecency .
One of arrested model said prison guards insulted them .
" In prison , the guards called me ’ you gay ’ , " he said .
Asked if they had been accused of specific crime or any violation of the law , many of the arrested said ignoring the reason .
" I do n’t know what will happen on Sunday .
This ( fashion show ) is a new thing in Sudan and they do n’t know what to do with us , " a model said .
Islamic law implemented only in northern Sudan stipulates a maximum of 40 lashes for wearing clothing deemed to be indecent .

Random Garbage
A friend of mine was asking about how to write a small interpreter so he can define new AI functions that his project can use at runtime .
After his face blanked over when I started explaining how to do it in Common Lisp ( really , there is n't that much explanation , it is like a fundamental property of Common Lisp to do such things ) , he hastily mentioned he wanted it in C .
Oh .
So , I hacked together a trivial demonstration program .
This program runs a very small interpreter which allows one to compile a C file into a shared object , then load the shared object , and bind the functions inside of the shared object to a structure full of function pointers that you can then invoke manually .
It is intended that one writes their varied functions as different C files that they can load and swap out at runtime .
Here is the lame makefile which compiles a program called stuff .c.
# Makefile stuff : stuff .c gcc - Wall - g stuff .c -o stuff - ldl clean : rm -f stuff *.o *.so
Here is stuff .c.
This program is set up using a traditional interpreter design .
However , it is totally barebones and I do n't deal with the interpreter environment in any meaningful way ( other than its reification and global nature ) since you can't define new variables or functions in the interpreter .
Also , the lexical and parsing analysis of the interpreted forms are horriffic at best .
This is because doing such things in C is a pain in the ass unless you use flex and bison or are prepared to write a helluva lot more code .
However , if I did that , this would n't be the simple demonstration that it is .
Note that I chose to perform the linking to the loaded library functions via an explicit indirection with the f structure in the Env structure .
I could have just taken the func_name variable in eval_invoke ( ) and simply performed a dlsym ( ) call upon it and called the resulting pointer with the arguments .
If I had done that , I could have called ANY function in the loaded library ( well , with the same protoype at any rate ) .
It is generally more general ( in some respects ) to do such a thing .
However , I chose the method I did because through the indirection I can associate functions of different C linkage names to the symbols I use to identify them -- such as the different names of the default functions in relation to the functions names as defined in the foo / bar .c codes .
A real world example of why the method I chose is useful would be if I wanted to have multiple implementations of C functions with the exact same name loaded at the same time where I could pick and choose between them .
In the method I chose , I could additionally associate a namespace ( or package name ) with a shared object ( meaning I 'd pair the f and lib_name fields into a ' Package ' structure and have a hash table of them in the Env keyed by package name that is specifed when loading the shared object ) and use another syntax in the interpreter to state which function I want to call out of which namespace / package .
This would be an exercise for the reader to implement .

Now , here is the first file that we 'll be using as a replacement for the stub functions .
This file ( and bar .c below ) must be in the current working directory when you start the stuff program .
/* This is foo .c */ #include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int fun1 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is foo.c:fun1 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; } int fun2 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is foo.c:fun2 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; } int fun3 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is foo.c:fun3 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; }
And here is bar.c , another definition of the above functions .
/* This is bar .c */ #include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int fun1 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is bar.c:fun1 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; } int fun2 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is bar.c:fun2 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; } int fun3 ( int a , int b ) { printf ( " This is bar.c:fun3 ( )
" ) ; fflush ( NULL ) ; return a + b ; }
Now that we have everything defined , here is an interaction with the program .
Notice the compilation of the above C files happens by us asking to compile them in the interpreter .
Also notice how the output of the functions " fun1 " , " fun2 " , and " fun3 " change away from the default to what is defined in each separate C file .

Enhancement of the interpreter would go in the direction of allowing all of the functions in the shared object to be discovered and shoved into a symbol table stored in the Env environment so they can be called .
In addition , the arguments of the functions would be more flexibly defined so you can pass other data types to them or define them to have different arities .
There is definitely more that can be done .

Man Robbed of $ 1,375 at ATM
On Monday , June 14 , a 23 - year - old male withdrew a large sum of money from an ATM machine and was allegedly violently mugged for every cent of it .
A filed police report states that the young man withdrew $ 1,375 from an ATM on Northgate Way at the particularly non-ominous hour of 3:30 p.m .
This large sum of money was intended as a deposit for a house he and his roommates were moving into that day on Greenwood Avenue North .
The man secured it in an envelope .
The police report states that he then placed the envelope in his back pocket ( mistake ! mistake ! ) .
He was walking to a bus stop on North East 95th Street when he allegedly felt something strike the back of his head .
According to the report , the victim was knocked to the ground and landed on his stomach .
While he was on the ground , the suspects allegedly began to kick him in the sides and rummage through his pockets , eventually finding and taking the fat envelope from his back pocket .
The report states the victim had a wallet and a " non-working phone " inside his jacket pocket and " was able to retain these items by lying on his stomach . "
Phew !
Good thing he saved that broken phone .
When the victim believed his attackers had left , he looked around and reportedly saw three males get into an " older , reddish , boxy , four - door Cadillac with nice rims and dark tinted windows . "
He was unable to describe their clothing or approximate ages .
He did , however , state he could identify the vehicle ( and its sweet rims ) if he saw it again .
Watch out , Seattle : Cadillacs are fast becoming signature cars of crime .
A group of indie developers are selling a package of their games which includes some of the biggest independent games on the market .
Gamers can name their own price — from 1¢ to $ 1,000 — for a pack of games that would go for around $ 80 if sold separately .
Anyone who buys the package can feel better about themselves as well ; customers can send any amount of their purchases to two major nonprofit groups .
The sale , nicknamed the " Humble Bundle " by the studios involved , is certainly epic .
The games included in the package are World of Goo , Gish , Lugaru , Aquaria , and Penumbra Overture .
Each of these titles has proven to be a solid hit , and the fact that five separate studios are working together to make them available to gamers for however much they wish to spend is unusual .
As Jeff Rosen of Wolfire explained to Ars in a recent interview , the close - knit sense of community among indie developers is largely responsible for the sale 's existence .
Small beginnings
The idea for the sale had humble origins .
There was n't any formal plan by the different developers to get together ; it was something that seemed to come about from a moment of inspiration .
" It was really one of those ' a - ha ! ' moments , " said Rosen .
" We recently teamed up with the Natural Selection 2 guys to do a bundle promotion , which was influenced by Steam 's indie bundles , and that was a huge success .
So I was kind of brainstorming about what we could do to top that , and this idea came about .
Everyone in the promotion is 100 percent independent , and we are all buddies , so it only took a few emails to organize the whole thing . "
This sense of community is seemingly common among indie developers .
Rosen says that while the Game Developers Conference helps small studios build relationships with one another , it is only the beginning .
Calling Ron Carmel of 2D
Boy a friend certainly helps , too .
" We really look up to Ron Carmel ... and he pretty much knows all indie developers , " Rosen said , though he was quick to point out how Internet communities help , too .
" There are a lot of indie forums , and mailing lists , so most indies have really easy access to each other . "
Bundles are increasingly more popular with indie developers ; as we recently saw with 2D Boy 's " pay what you want " sale of World of Goo .
" All of the technology is here now , so it 's feasible for indie developers to do something like this , " Rosen explained .
He went on to show an example of this affordable environment : " We recently wrote a blog post on our system , which got [ around ] 300,000 hits , and Google charged us 11¢ for the traffic .
So you no longer need to have access to expensive , beefy hardware and professional sysadmins to put on promotions like this .
Thanks to PayPal , Amazon Payments , and Google Checkout , we do n't have to be massive merchants to accept credit cards . "
Great indie games , great nonprofits
This sale is different from those held by indie developers in the past : aside from the number of major indie studios involved , it 's tied to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Child 's Play , two of the biggest nonprofits in the video game industry .
" I wanted to include [ both nonprofits ] for a couple of reasons , " Rosen said .
" First of all , they are truly awesome causes .
Child 's Play 's mission to bring video games to children in hospitals is really worthwhile , especially given the anti-video game sentiment [ often present in the public ] .
[ The EFF ] resonates strongly with the anti-DRM message of the humble bundle and fights many good fights .
I know that many people are going to donate one penny to the bundle to get all of the games , but maybe by having the charities involved , people will at least give a fiver to Child 's Play . "
That 's another unusual thing about this sale : customers can choose exactly how much of their money goes where .
According to Rosen , " this promo has no middle man ( other than your choice of PayPal , Google , or Amazon to process the payment ) and you can choose exactly where you want the donation to go .
You could snub all the developers — and the EFF — and just give to Child 's Play ; we would still happily give you all of our games for all three platforms , DRM - free . "
What will happen if people refuse to send their money to the developers themselves and instead send it to either Child 's Play or the EFF ?
" That is a possibility , " Rosen said .
" Even if no one donates to the developers , and they give 100 percent to charity , I would consider that a success . "
The developers go out of their way to make the games accessible to a broad audience ; they " work great " on Mac OS X , Windows , and Linux .
And they 're DRM - free : " Feel free to play them without an Internet connection , back them up , and install them on all of your Macs and PCs freely . "
There is no downside here : gamers get a great selection of indie titles , the developers enjoy a nice bit of publicity , and two very worthy causes are supported .
If you 'd like to play some games , and support the developers and / or nonprofits , there are much worse ways to spend your money .
The Labour government 's flagship ID card scheme attracted just 13,200 signups before it was finally put down by the new coalition , a Commons answer revealed yesterday .
The figure is even less than the 15,000 figure being bandied around when the ToryDems confirmed that they would indeed scrap the white elephant / albatross scheme last month .
And it really does n't sit too well with the 10,000 cards issued and 1,000 applications per week Labour ministers were claiming in March .
Paul Goggins MP asked Home Office minister Damian Green how many cards had been issued before May 11 both in total , and to residents of pilot scheme area Greater Manchester .
Green replied , " There were approximately 13,200 identity cards issued before 11 May 2010 , around 6,000 of which were issued in Greater Manchester . "
Green added that once the bill to scrap the scheme gains Royal Assent , cards would only be valid for one month .
" The Identity and Passport Service is writing to each cardholder informing them of progress and contact details for further advice , " he confirmed .
" Card refunds or credit for a future passport application will not be offered . "
Green 's answer seems to heap further ignominy on the scheme .
In March , former Home Sec Alan Johnson had predicted 17 million ID cards would be in circulation by 2017 , a staggering 28 per cent of the population .
He claimed the scheme would have paid for itself .
A week or two after that , erstwhile ID card minister Meg Hillier claimed that enrolments in Manchester alone were due to hit 10,000 in March .
The Home Office at the time was quite insistent that " Demand has been strong since identity cards were launched and recent improvements in capacity mean that enrolments are now running at around 1,000 a week " .
This despite the fact that El Reg 's admittedly crude slicing and dicing of ministers '
Commons answers suggested applications never seemed to breach 100 a day , with 14.5 seeming more typical .
No surprise then then that the government never signed leases on a network of enrolment centres .
It 's almost as if they knew the thing had the stink of death about it . ®

Learnt it at high school
SARAH ZANDER and Ashley Jacobsen are like many teenage girls .
Sarah likes soccer .
Ashley was captain of her school 's team of cheerleaders this year .
They are also earning good money as nursing assistants at a retirement home .
Sarah plans to become a registered nurse .
Ashley may become a pharmacologist .
Their futures look sunny .
Yet both are products of what is arguably America 's most sneered - at high - school programme : vocational training .
Vocational education has been so disparaged that its few advocates have resorted to giving it a new name : “ career and technical education ” ( CTE ) .
Academic courses that prepare students for getting into universities , by contrast , are seen as the key to higher wages and global prowess .
Last month the National Governors Association proposed standards to make students “ college and career ready ” .
But a few states , districts and think - tanks favour a radical notion .
In America 's quest to raise wages and compete internationally , CTE may be not a hindrance but a help .
America has a unique disdain for vocational education .
It has supported such training since 1917 ; money now comes from the Perkins Act , which is reauthorised every six years .
However , many Americans hate the idea of schoolchildren setting out on career paths — such predetermination , they think , threatens the ethos of opportunity .
As wages have risen for those with college degrees , scepticism of CTE has grown too .
By 2005 only one - fifth of high - school students specialised in an industry , compared with one - third in 1982 .
The share of 17 - year - olds aspiring to four - year college , meanwhile , reached 69 % in 2003 , double the level of 1981 .
But the fact remains that not every student will graduate from university .
This may make politicians uncomfortable , but it is not catastrophic .
The Council of Economic Advisers projects faster - growing demand for those with a two - year technical - college degree , or specific training , than for those with a full university degree .
A growing chorus of state and local leaders argues that CTE can help .
Rather than pit training against university preparation , they are trying to integrate the two .
CTE students may go on to university , to training or directly into work .
The Perkins Act nudges such efforts forward , but the big shove comes from beyond Washington .
Wisconsin 's governor , Jim Doyle , has expanded his state 's youth apprentice programme , which provides high - school students such as Sarah and Ashley with jobs .
Academic courses are complemented by those at technical colleges .
The most successful model , however , may be “ career academies ” .
Started in Philadelphia in 1969 , mimicked in California in the 1980s and supported elsewhere by Sandy Weil 's National Academy Foundation , these small schools combine academic and technical curriculums and give students work experience .
When properly implemented , career academies can produce striking results .
The non-partisan MDRC found that college attainment did not rise relative to a control group , but career academies did boost students ' earnings by 11 % .
Among boys , earnings were 17 % higher .
Young men were more likely to be married .
The challenge is to scale up such programmes .
Within a sprawling high school in Chicago , Kevin Rutter runs a small finance academy , teaching students about markets , accounting and personal finance , welcoming executives and helping students find internships .
Chicago 's schools system this year said it would revamp its CTE system to mimic academies such as Mr Rutter 's , merging academic work with training for growth industries .
California has pursued similar reforms ; CTE 's main champion is Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Mr Obama should presumably push along such efforts .
Last year he asked every American to commit to at least one year of training , whether through a “ community college or four - year school , vocational training or an apprenticeship ” .
However , the governors ' new standards still emphasise academic skills .
The education secretary 's plan to reauthorise No Child Left Behind barely mentions CTE .
Advocates hope this will change .
In the meantime , a bold new programme is inching forward .
The National Centre on Education and the Economy ( NCEE ) , a think - tank , is developing a test that students may take in their second year of high school .
On passing , they could proceed to a community college or stay in high school to apply to a four - year university .
Those who fail would take extra courses to help them pass .
A pilot programme , supported by the Gates Foundation , will begin in eight states next year .
Some parents are already outraged by the imagined spectre of tracking .
Marc Tucker , who leads the NCEE , argues that a path to a community college might keep students engaged .
Such a system would provide students with more opportunity , not less .
At Haaretz , Doron Rosenblum writes Israel ’s commando complex :
The failure of the flotilla operation is less troubling than the national " jonesing " that has followed it : the frenetic flitting between the poles of reflexive victimhood −
Oy oy oy they resisted , they had knives , swords and other weapons , the activists who were killed were " big- bodied " − and of inert heroism ‏( praise for the restraint and sensitivity that resulted in only nine and not 600 deaths ; the desperate attempt to cling to the vestiges of the myths of military prowess and the increased stifling of criticism with the slogan " Quiet , we ’re saluting " ‏ ) .
All of these , together with a great sense of missed opportunity : the illusion that a " successful " operation − difficult to define and to imagine in any event − would have relieved , even temporarily , a certain existential angst .
All these responses were more intense this week , although in fact they are constant .
They are the responses of addicts who are repeatedly denied their fix : the perfect IDF " operation , " or the decisive war , which will stifle any question and complaints ‏( and any need for statesmanship‏ ) .
Some point to a sea change in the Palestinian , and even the Hamas , leadership , saying that they have finally discovered the advantages of propaganda and statesmanship over violence and terror .
Instead of encouraging and wholeheartedly adopting this approach , Israel , which has n’t changed its thought patterns for decades , is " caught by surprise " and even dismayed .
‏( Recently an intelligence official actually called the absence of Palestinian terror a " propaganda problem " ‏ ) .
In the absence of statesmanship , all Israel can offer is another clumsy operation in which it comes off looking like some relic from the 1970s and ‘ 80s with a commando knife between its teeth .
Even worse :
It looks like Avigdor Lieberman , Eli Yishai , Moshe Ya’alon and all the rest .
Israel has always complained , condescendingly , that the neighbors it is forced to deal with are Arabs rather than " Norwegians and Swedes . "
Now , when it is dealing with Europeans and the entire world , Israel can see how it itself is perceived − and to blush furiously .
If it still can .
The faces of the dead always serve a purpose in political conflict .
That 's true when it's the beturbaned visage of the latest dead No. 3 of al Qaeda spread across the pages of media on six continents .
Or when it 's the faceless dead civilians wiped out by the most recent drone attack in northwest Pakistan .
No pictures of them , please .
Take note how the first is never considered propaganda .
But when someone somewhere does choose to present images of dead civilians in a conflict , the cries of propaganda are rife .
" You 're playing on people 's emotions . "
Or " That does n't tell the whole story . "
Or , " They were n't really civilians . "
These rationalizations rarely apply when the civilians are civilians on " our side . "
For instance , the right wing in the United States said this about the photo of Phan Thị Kim Phúc , the naked , napalmed 9 - year - old girl photographed running down a Vietnamese road in 1972 .
Propaganda , they claimed .
Aiding and abetting the enemy .
The photo won a Pulitzer despite Richard Nixon 's claim that it was probably " fixed . "
Did it tell the whole story of that conflict ?
No .
But it was no lie .
The following pictures do n't come close to telling the whole story of the events of May 31 in international waters off Gaza .
Nor of the complex larger story of decades of conflict of Israel / Palestine .
They can't .
They are simply images of nine civilians shot dead on the deck of the Mavi Marmara .
Some people will no doubt consider publishing them an act of hateful propaganda .
In truth , keeping them faceless is what actually serves that purpose .

Earlier this week I wrote about the struggle that the UK 's mobile networks were having to provide the kind of service that smartphone users demand .
Now one operator has acted to try to control the flow of data across its network .
O2 has unveiled new smartphone tariffs , in preparation for the imminent arrival of iPhone 4 , and the company has abolished the unlimited data allowance that was seen as a key feature .
Now the operator 's monthly contracts will include a set amount of data - 500 MB for a £ 35 two - year contract , 1GB for the £ 60 a month tariff .
Already some users are crying foul , and threatening to move to other networks .
But maybe O2 wo n't be too unhappy if it does see some desertions .
It is claiming that 97 % of its smartphone users will see no impact from these changes because they do not use more than 500 MB a month , indeed it says they may even see an improvement in their service .
Why ?
The implication is that just a tiny majority of bandwidth hogs are using vast amounts of data , watching streaming video or playing online games .
They are making the network less stable , and if they leave then things will improve .
Just to put this in perspective , mobile data use only really took off in the UK when unlimited tariffs arrived - before that everyone was terrified with some justification that they could pile up huge bills .
So will O2's move which seems likely to be followed by other operators - signal an end to the mobile data explosion we 've seen in the UK in the last couple of years ?
The mobile industry believes not , and there is a sense of relief that someone has made the first move .
One industry analyst , Thomas Wehmeier at Informa Telecoms , argues that unlimited plans were unsustainable :
" Whilst consumer appetite for mobile data seems unlimited , one thing that most definitely is not unlimited is spectrum .
Spectrum will forever remain a resource both short on supply and high in demand . "
In other words , there is a limit to the number of mobile super - highways you can throw open , but no limit to the traffic wanting to drive along them if you do n't apply some road tolls .
That all sounds logical enough .
But O2 has been telling its customers that it was the speedy network for smartphone users .
Having applied the brakes , it must now show that it can deliver a decent mobile surfing experience for those who stay loyal .
New Yorker Barry Hoggard draws a line in the sand when it comes to online privacy .
In May he said farewell to 1251 Facebook friends by deleting his account of four years to protest what he calls the social network 's eroding privacy policies .
" I 'm sick of keeping track of my Facebook privacy settings and what boxes I have to check to protect myself , " says Hoggard , a computer programmer .
" I do n't have a lot of illusions about online privacy , but Facebook has gone too far , " he says of Facebook 's recent privacy policy changes .
From Facebook to advertisers who may be putting your online identity up for sale to the highest bidder , and to strangers who could track you across town , new ways of using technology and the Internet are making privacy issues a flash point for controversy .
" Privacy today is n't what it was a year ago , " says Jeffrey Chester , director of the Center for Digital Democracy , a nonprofit group that promotes online privacy and free speech .
" It was n't long ago we were worried about advertisers planting cookies on our PC , " he says .
With today 's trends , keeping a handle on your privacy is going to become even harder a year from now , he adds .
What follows are several emerging privacy threats .
Social Networks
Do social networks herald the end of privacy ?
Lots of former Facebook users who recently ditched their accounts in protest think so .
With 450 million users , many say , Facebook is a bellwether for other social networks on user privacy .
Swapping small talk and vacation photos made Facebook addictive for users .
But over the years , they 've watched as their private info became shared with a growing sphere of strangers -- advertisers .
And in May , Facebook made changes to its privacy policy that exposed more personal data to a wider range of marketers .
One change involved the Instant Personalization pilot program , which let selected Facebook partner Websites access your data and tailor content to your tastes .
With Instant Personalization activated , your Facebook information can be accessed the moment you arrive on partner sites including Microsoft 's Docs.com , Pandora , and Yelp .
When the program launched in April , Facebook automatically activated it for all users .
However , a privacy uproar forced the company to revise its policy .
Instant Personalization is now optional for users .
Facebook has suffered privacy backlashes before .
In 2007 it introduced Beacon , an ad system that tracked certain actions of Facebook users on 44 partner sites so as to report those actions back to users '
Facebook friends network .
But many users revolted , citing privacy concerns .
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly apologized and made Beacon an optional feature .
" Facebook is literally turning down the Facebook privacy settings for its users , " says Electronic Privacy Information Center director Marc Rotenberg .
In early May , EPIC and 14 other consumer groups filed a complaint against Facebook with the Federal Trade Commission .
The complaint accuses the site of following unfair and deceptive business practices , in part , for disclosing previously private details to the public .
Google Buzz ( the search giant 's social network ) has also endured privacy issues .
Buzz exposed a list of users ' most frequently accessed e-mail contacts when it launched earlier this year .
Social networks have forced users to rethink what privacy is in a world where public sharing of private lives has become commonplace , observes Jeremy Mishkin , an attorney specializing in privacy law .
" The real issue is how best to assure individuals they have control of their own information , " Mishkin says .
Facebook declined interviews , but issued a statement : " It 's important that Facebook and other sites provide [ users ] with clear control over what information they want to share , when they want to share it , and with whom .
We 're listening to feedback and evaluating the best way to respond to concerns . "
Note :
We have tips to help you negotiate the maze of Facebook 's privacy settings .
Data Harvesting
Creating a digital profile on you gets a lot easier if you are on Facebook or Google Buzz and hanging a shingle on Linked In .
That marketers use your interest in , say , Volkswagen cars to target - market you a new Jetta may be no surprise .
But will your Facebook status ever be used by a credit agency , health care provider , or future employer to determine if you are a good bet ?
Firms such as California - based Rapleaf say they are working with financial institutions to run their databases of e-mail addresses to assemble customer profiles based on information shared on social networks .
Rapleaf 's vice president of business development , Joel Jewitt , says it collaborates with company marketing departments , not credit - approval departments , to better target financial services to banking customers .
Rapleaf is merely one of many firms -- ranging from Acxiom to Unbound Technology -- that tap into social networks to marry your profiles , tweets , and Linked In information with your e-mail address .
If a company wants to know more about you , it can just hire one of these outfits .
The firms bristle at the notion that your credit card interest rates could be jacked up based on a tweet that you just got laid off .
But privacy experts say that this may be a reality in coming years ( see related story : " Can Your Online Life Ruin Your Credit ? " ) .
To privacy activists , online advertisers have always been too smart for their own good .
Now two emerging trends in advertising have privacy groups once more complaining that Madison Avenue has gone too far .
The integrity of the judge who handed out a negative judgment to the Usenet community FTD has been called into doubt .
After it became apparent that the lawyer representing the movie studio and the judge were giving copyright courses together , the Pirate Party is hinting at a corruption scandal .
Last week movie studio Eyeworks won its lawsuit against Dutch Usenet community FTD .
In the verdict , Judge Chris Hensen ruled that by allowing users to talk about a movie ’s location on Usenet , FTD was effectively publishing the movie as if they had actually hosted it on their own servers .
The verdict was welcomed by local anti-piracy outfit BREIN , but several copyright lawyers and opponents at the other end of the copyright spectrum have heavily criticized it .
The ruling sets a dangerous precedent for future cases and may very well lead to more control and censorship by the pro-copyright lobby at the expense of people ’s freedoms , they argued .
Aside from the critique on the decision itself , the integrity of the judge who handed out the verdict has also been called into question .
Immediately after the verdict people involved with the Dutch Pirate Party , which is on the ballot of tomorrow ’s elections , pointed out that the judge might not be as objective as he could be .
It turns out that the movie company lawyer Dirk Visser , the same person who also scored a victory for BREIN against Mininova , has been organizing a course for copyright specialists where Judge Hensen was once of the teachers .
This prompted the Pirate Party politicians to doubt the objectiveness of the judge .
Sweden ’s Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge , who ’s currently supporting his Dutch colleagues in the election run , has been the most vocal about the issue .
“ It ’s stories like this that show why today ’s politicians simply must be kicked from office , ” Falkvinge told Torrent Freak in a comment .
“ If they do n’t see a problem with this — and apparently , they do n’t — then it ’s absolutely critical to the integrity of society and faith in the justice system that , quite frankly , some heads roll in tomorrow ’s elections in favor of the Dutch Pirate Party . ”
“ Every time something like this happens , you think the copyright lobby has fallen to a moral rock bottom .
Then as soon as you turn your back , they take out a jackhammer and start digging . ”
Falkvinge added .
“ I expect this will boost support for the Dutch Piratenpartij , and for good reason .
Today ’s politicians need to learn that their seats are n’t taken for granted , ” Falkvinge added .
In the current polls the Dutch Pirate Party is still lacking enough support to be able to scoop a seat at the local parliament , but there ’s still a day to go for them .
Undoubtedly , stories about conspiring copyright lobbyists and possible biased judges may help to give that final push .
Despite the election outcome , FTD announced today that it will appeal the verdict of the case .
They do n’t intend to follow up the bias claims , FTD ’s lawyer told TorrentFreak .

Prototype for Ozcan 's lensless microscope
Aydogan Ozcan , whose invention of a novel lensless imaging technology for use in telemedicine could radically transform global health care , has now taken his work a step further -- or tinier :
The UCLA engineer has created a miniature microscope , the world 's smallest and lightest for telemedicine applications .
The microscope , unveiled in a paper published online in the journal Lab on a Chip , builds on imaging technology known as LUCAS ( Lensless Ultra - wide - field Cell Monitoring Array platform based on Shadow imaging ) , which was developed by Ozcan , an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and a researcher at UCLA 's California NanoSystems Institute .
Instead of using a lens to magnify objects , LUCAS generates holographic images of microparticles or cells by employing a light - emitting diode to illuminate the objects and a digital sensor array to capture their images .
The technology can be used to image blood samples or other fluids , even in Third World countries .
" This is a very capable and yet cost - effective microscope , shrunk into a very small package , " Ozcan said .
" Our goal with this project was to develop a device that can be used to improve health outcomes in resource - limited settings . "
The lensless microscope , in addition to being far more compact and lightweight than conventional microscopes , also obviates the need for a trained technicians to analyze the images produced ― images are analyzed by computer so that results are available instantaneously .
Weighing 46 grams ― approximately as much as a large egg ― the microscope is a self - contained imaging device .
The only external attachments necessary are a USB connection to a smart - phone , PDA or computer , which supplies the microscope with power and allows images to be uploaded for conversion into results and then sent to a hospital .
Samples are loaded using a small chip that can be filled with saliva or a blood smear for health monitoring .
With blood smears , the lensless microscope is capable of accurately identifying cells and particles , including red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets .
The technology has the potential to help monitor diseases like malaria , HIV and tuberculosis in areas where there are great distances between people in need of health care and the facilities capable of providing it , Ozcan said .
It can even be used to test water quality in the field following a disaster like a hurricane or earthquake .
Using a couple of inexpensive add - on parts , the lensless microscope can also be converted into a differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscope , also known as a Nomarski microscope .
DIC microscopes are used to gain information on the density of a sample , giving the appearance of a 3 - D image by putting lines and edges in stark contrast .
The additional parts for conversion to a DIC microscope cost approximately $ 1 to $ 2 .
A number of design elements lead Ozcan to believe his lensless microscope will be a useful medical tool in resource - limited settings , such as some countries in Africa .
Two key requirements for such settings are ease of use and durability .
The microscope requires minimal training ; because of its large imaging field of view , the sample does not need to be scanned or perfectly aligned in the microscope .
And operating the microscope is as simple as filling a chip with a sample and sliding the chip into a slot on the side of the microscope .
Because of its large aperture , the lensless microscope is also resistant to problems caused by debris clogging the light source .
In addition , there are few moving parts , making the microscope fairly robust .
The lensless microscope is also an example of a type of medicine known as telemedicine .
In resource - limited settings , tools that are portable enough to do medical tests in the field are vital .
Tools like the lensless microscope could be digitally integrated as part of a telemedicine network that connects various mobile health - care providers to a central lab or hospital , filling gaps in physical infrastructure with mobile tools .
The transmission connections for such networks already exist in cellular networks , which have penetrated even the most remote corners of the globe .
" Making things user - friendly is what I love about being an engineer , " Ozcan said .
" It is very rewarding to create something that to the end - user is very simple , when in reality years of research and work went into the technology and product development . "

HHS to Retain Gay Blood Ban
A Department of Health and Human Services committee has voted to retain a policy barring gay men from donating blood .
The Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability 's 9 - 6 ruling on Friday , first reported by Chris Geidner of Metro Weekly , comes after two days of deliberations on whether to retain the ban , which has come under increasing fire by gay rights activists and allied congressional leaders .
On Wednesday a group of legislators , led by Massachusetts senator John Kerry and Illinois representative Mike Quigley , issued a joint statement in support for amending the ban .
" There is no prescribed consideration of safer sex practices , " the lawmakers argued .
" Individuals who routinely practice unsafe heterosexual sex face no deferral period at all , while monogamous and married homosexual partners who practice safe sex are banned for life , " Kerry and his colleagues wrote to officials .
Addressing the committee on Thursday , Kerry said he was joined by the nation 's largest blood - banking organizations in opposition to the current policy .
The American Red Cross , the American Association of Blood Banks , and America ’s Blood Centers have all blasted the policy as “ scientifically and medically unwarranted . ”
" This is a discussion with real social significance for gay men , " Kerry said before the committee .
" They are clearly the target of this policy , which was initiated in the early ' 80s , when little was known about HIV / AIDS , except that gay men seemed to be contracting it almost exclusively .
Today , this lingering policy carries with it a social stigma for this population that is still engaged in battles for civil rights on a whole array of fronts . "
In a unanimous vote the panel also called the policy
" suboptimal , " however , and recommended that distinctions be made
between low - and high - risk potential gay donors in a report to the
assistant secretary of HHS .
In 1983 the Food and Drug Administration , a subagency of HHS that regulates the nation ’s blood supply collection , barred any man who ’d had sexual contact with another man since 1977 from donating blood .
FDA policy allows heterosexual men and women who have had sexual contact with an HIV - positive partner to give blood after a one - year deferral period .
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force executive director Rea Carey called the committee 's decision " outrageous , irresponsible , and archaic . "
" We expect more out of this advisory committee and this administration than to uphold an unnecessarily discriminatory policy from another era , " Carey said in a statement .
" The most critical issue is to ensure that the blood supply is safe and abundant , and this means maximizing the potential donor pool and making sure all donors are screened appropriately and assessed based on actual behavioral risk independent of their sexual orientation . "
A spokeswoman with the American Red Cross said the organization was " disappointed " by the ruling .
" While the Red Cross is obligated by law to follow the guidelines set forth by the FDA , we also strongly support the use of rational , scientifically based deferral periods that are applied fairly and consistently among donors who engage in similar risk activities , " Red Cross director of biomedical communications Stephanie Millian said in a statement to The Advocate .
It ’s hard to talk about androgynous people .
To clarify : this is n’t because of any social taboos or prejudice , but something more literal — people who do n’t identify as male nor as female are actually difficult to discuss , because English does n’t allow people to identify as gender neutral .
All of our third - person pronouns are categorised by the male - female binary .
People are either " he " or " she " .
You ca n’t use " it " — it sounds dehumanising — and " they " can be grammatically awkward .
One way of getting around this is to adopt a new pronoun altogether .
In March , Sydney - based Norrie ( who has chosen to abandon the family name May - Welby ) introduced many of us to " zie " , in place of " he " or " she " .
Norrie — who began life as a male - to - female transsexual , before opting out of male - female distinctions — made headlines when the Sydney Morning Herald declared " hir " ( not him , not her ) the first person recognised by the state as neuter .
It took months for the NSW Registry of Births , Deaths and Marriages to process the application , before finally granting Norrie a birth certificate with " sex not specified " .
International news agencies hailed Norrie as the world ’s first legally genderless person .
For people from diverse sex and gender backgrounds , the decision was a significant win .
By the end of March , however , there was bad news .
The NSW Registry of Births , Deaths and Marriages back - pedalled , phoning Norrie to say the birth certificate was now invalid .
While Norrie proceeded to lodge a furious FOI request to unearth what deliberations led to that outcome , the verdict appears to be final .
A NSW Registry spokesperson confirmed to newmatilda.com that while people can change sex on their birth certificate , the only two options available are male to female , or female to male .
" There is no other legal possibility , " she said .
As far as NSW is concerned , every citizen is either a man or a woman .
Norrie ’s case is politically sensitive — but it also raises questions about whether the NSW Registry ’s decision was about politics or practicalities .
Norrie insists the revoked birth certificate is a political issue , since the practical aspects of registering as sex - not - specified are apparently straightforward .
In the weeks when Norrie ’s sex - not - specified birth certificate was still legal , Norrie approached banks and Centrelink to change records in person .
" It ’s hard over the phone , " Norrie told newmatilda.com .
" They say , ‘ Oh , it ca n’t be possible . ’
But when I walk in there and they look at me , they ca n’t tell if I ’m male or female .
When I give them the piece of paper from the right government department saying , ‘ This is what I am ’ , they think , ‘ Okay .
We can action that . ’"
Sex - not - specified passports are also surprisingly easy to obtain in Australia — at least in theory .
The Department of Foreign Affairs says that the Australian Passport Office has clear provisions for citizens to apply for passports as neither male nor female .
That ’s because the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) — which maintains worldwide passport standards — allows countries to have an unspecified sex option .
In those cases , the symbol X ( instead of M or F ) is used .
It ’s up to individual countries whether they want to adopt that system or not .
There is a catch , of course .
In order for an Australian to get a passport marked X , applicants need a birth certificate to demonstrate a " sex not specified " status or equivalent .
The gatekeepers of those birth certificates are state or territory registries .
If those registries refuse to release sex - not - specified birth certificates , no one from that state is able to get a passport marked X . Right now , Norrie ’s passport says " female " and Norrie wants that changed .
While most Australian queer rights campaigners support and admire Norrie ’s work , some transsexual , transgender and intersex people are also quietly wary of introducing a third sex category to official documents .
Gina Wilson , president of intersex rights group OII Australia , told newmatilda.com that the majority of intersex people — people who are born with different or anomalous sex organs — prefer to identify as male or female , or as intersex woman or man .
" When they ask ‘ What is your sex ? ’ we usually say male or female , " Gina says .
" We do n’t want to have a fight at the motor registry branch .
We do n’t want to fight to get a passport .
We do n’t want to have a dispute going into a [ public ] toilet . "
Gina argues that introducing a third sex option opens up opportunities for further discrimination .
" Two sexes have caused us trouble enough .
Having a third option , to us , is like having ‘ bastard ’ or ‘ coloured ’ stamped on your birth certificate . "
Norrie disagrees with this interpretation of the " sex not specified " category .
Rather than being a third sex , Norrie says " sex not specified " is a commentary on the male - female binary .
That is , if people are required to be either male or female in the system , then someone like Norrie cannot be " specified " by sex .
Semantics aside , both advocates agree on one fundamental thing : ultimately , all government records should abolish categorising people by sex altogether .
" In the long term , " Norrie says , " I would prefer to get rid of categorisations .
I ’d like it not to be on my identity , the same way race is not on my identity . "
Gina agrees .
" Our ultimate aim , " she says , " is to not have sex categories on any documentation , save for maybe medical documentation . "
Needless to say , such an overhaul would be a hefty task , warranting an extremely well - funded campaign and tons of legislative paperwork .
There is also the danger that in removing potentially discriminatory classifiers from official records — such as sex and race — more insidious forms of discrimination could paradoxically be introduced .
In France , for instance , a national stance against discrimination has produced government policies against discrimination .
So far , so good — but this colour blindness means it ’s illegal for the French government to collect information about anyone ’s race .
Many commentators have argued that because of this , racial discrimination against non-white French citizens thrives , since claims of colour blindness can be used as a shield to hide people ’s prejudices .
In any case , any changes to legislation to remove sex as an identifier are a distant pipe dream .
There are no international precedents for this kind of sweeping reform .
Even everyday social reforms , like changing the way people talk about androgynous people , can seem impossible .
Roly Sussex , a professor of Applied Language Studies at the University of Queensland , says amending language — especially pronouns — can be difficult .
" Changing pronouns is really , really tough , " he told newmatilda.com .
" You ’re not going to get language change unless either there is a top - down policy push , or a sufficiently large , vocal and politically engaged group in the community . "
One good example , Sussex says , is the manner in which the feminist movement effectively stopped people from using " he " and " his " ( " A student may attend if he wants " ; " The person should submit his forms " ) to refer to both men and women .
In newspaper reports , Norrie might have been quoted as preferring " zie " , but even Norrie admits it can be difficult using " zie " in everyday life .
" Even I have n’t had much practice in it , " Norrie says , laughing .
" We gender things .
If we see a cat or a dog , we call it he or she , depending on whether we think dogs or cats are yin or yang . "
Usually , Norrie opts for " they " or " them " , and does n’t get offended if people do n’t use " zie " or " hir " .
" Heavens no , " Norrie says .
" So long as they ’re smiling !
I ’d rather identify as a human being , frankly . "

World welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao has officially added a new title -- Congressman .
Pacquiao was sworn in to the Philippines ' House of Representatives on Monday in the southern province of Sarangani .
" He wants change , " Pacquiao 's trainer , Freddie Roach , said of Pacquiao before the boxer won the election .
" I think it 's genuine .
People see that he wants to help his country , and that 's why they 're voting .
That 's why they support him . "
Pacquiao accepted his third Fighter of the Year award June 4 after a year that featured a spectacular second - round knockout of Ricky Hatton to win a 140 - pound belt and a brutal 12th - round stoppage of Miguel Cotto that gave Pacquiao titles in a record seven divisions .
" When he fights they close down Parliament and all the terrorists call for a peace , " Roach said in May , only half jokingly .
" It 's not going to change anything .
They 'll just announce him as Congressman Manny Pacquiao , that 's all . "
Promoter Bob Arum will continue work on perhaps the most highly anticipated fight in decades , between Pacquiao and the undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.
The two nearly reached an agreement to fight earlier this year , but negotiations broke down when Mayweather insisted on Olympic - style drug testing and Pacquiao refused to have blood drawn within 24 days of a fight .
But Arum said that Pacquiao is now willing to have blood tests within 14 days of the fight , the cutoff point that Mayweather had agreed to in the first go - around .
Arum also said he believes the fight , which would likely happen in November , will end up in Las Vegas rather than Cowboys Stadium or another venue that could pack upward of 100,000 fans .
Congress convenes in July in the Philippines .

Personal Quote :
Show business is great , but when you 're in a movie that made more than $ 120 million , the perspective changes .
I 'd never had the experience of being in a movie that so many people found funny .
After the enormous success of Verrückt nach Mary ( 1998 ) , I was able to command much more money and I got recognized more .
But the reason for all this is only because the movie made money , not because ...
In a long puff piece in the New York Times Magazine , Frank Bruni can't help but reveal a few telling nuggets about Carly Fiorina , the former business exec who is now the favorite to win the GOP nomination to challenge California Senator Barbara Boxer .
Boxer has been slightly ahead in the polls , but Fiorina will have a ton of money to spend , and it could become a very tough race .
Among Bruni's revelations :
Back in 1999 , when Cara Carleton S. Fiorina took the helm of H.P. , all the exhilarating talk was of trails blazed and ceilings shattered .
That ended fast .
She was soon pilloried for sweeping work - force cuts , unmet earnings projections and tumbling stock prices ; disparaged by the Hewlett and Packard families , who staged a narrowly defeated proxy battle against her merger of H.P. with Compaq ; and fired in February 2005 , the climax of an exhaustively chronicled corporate melodrama .
The idea that business executives automatically are qualified to serve in government long has been an absurd presumption .
Businesses are in business to make money , not to serve the public good .
British Petroleum is an obvious case in point .
But Fiorina was n't even a successful business executive .
The job that made her nationally known revealed her as insensitive to workers and generally in over her head .
By no measure could her tenure at HP be considered successful .
For Fiorina , who is 55 , a Senate seat would be more than a fresh challenge .
It would be a new loop , a more upbeat ending , even a validation of her business know - how , because she would be winning election at a time when the economy is issue No. 1 , in a state with an unemployment rate above 12 percent .
Is n't that nice ?
Would n't that be heartwarming ?
If only Frank Capra were still around .
Because in an era of multiple national and international crises , what the world and nation really need is an upbeat ending to a story about personal validation .
Politics is n't about policy , it 's about violin crescendos .
But speaking of policy :
As the campaign has progressed , Fiorina has sounded ever more conservative .
Months ago , she said she probably would have voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor ’s appointment to the Supreme Court ; in more recent comments about Elena Kagan , she has come across as doubtful and wary .
When the passage of the Arizona immigration law first made headlines , she deflected questions about it , trying to steer the conversation to what she said was the Obama administration ’s failure to patrol the border .
It was a prudent dodge , given the high percentage of Hispanic voters in California .
But as the days went by and the questions kept coming , she said that she supported what Arizona had done , though she was n’t recommending a similar measure in California .
Well .
To those who care about issues , that might matter .
Particularly those who care about abominations such as racial profiling and violations of human and civil rights .
She does n't want to impose such an abomination on California , but she approves of it in Arizona .
Why ?
She has won endorsements from both the National Right to Life Committee and the California Pro Life Council , who see her as a trustworthy opponent of abortion , even though she says she would have no litmus test for a Supreme Court justice and believes abortion should be permitted in cases of incest , rape and danger to a mother ’s life .
She is opposed to publicly financed abortions of any kind .
Californians are strongly pro-choice , and you can be certain Senator Boxer will have a thing or two to say about that .
It 's also particularly gratifying to know that the very wealthy Fiorina has a financial litmus test for even those abortions that result from incest , rape , and endangerment to the life of the mother .
If you have money , as Fiorina does , you can choose to end a traumatic or life - threatening pregnancy .
If not , you can suffer or die .
After slogging through many more paragraphs of politically irrelevant puffery , Bruni comes to this :
Fiorina did n’t bother to vote for the 10 years she lived in New Jersey and voted in fewer than half of the last 18 elections in California in which she could participate .
I asked Fiorina about that , and she said instantly , " It was a mistake . "
But then , as if her lapse mattered only in the context of her current ambition , she added : " I felt disconnected from the process .
I was n’t running my life to seek political office someday .
Well , I ’m all in now . "
It 's always fun to observe when famous and wealthy Republicans first take an interest in politics just when they 're trying to buy themselves political offices .
Why are they doing it ?
Fiorina 's answer is telling .
She does n't seem to see politics as a means of serving the common good .
When not seeking office , she just did n't care about politics .
Now that she is seeking office , she does care .
Could anyone 's rationale be any more transparently shallow and self - serving ?
Carly Fiorina wants to be a U.S. Senator .
Not for the benefit of Californians or the nation .
Carly Fiorina wants to be a U.S. Senator for the benefit of Carly Fiorina .
Does n't that make you feel good ?
The early 1980s recession was a severe recession in the United States which began in July 1981 and ended in November 1982 .
The primary cause of the recession was a contractionary monetary policy established by the Federal Reserve System to control high inflation .
Cause of 1980s early recession …
In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis , , stagflation began to afflict the economy of the United States . , Unemployment had risen from 5.1 % in January 1974 to a high of 9.0 % in May 1975 . , Although it had gradually declined to 5.6 % by May 1979 , , unemployment began rising again thereafter . , It jumped sharply to 6.9 % in April 1980 and to 7.5 % in May 1980 . , A mild recession from January to July 1980 kept unemployment high , , but despite economic recovery unemployment remained at historically high levels ( about 7.5 % ) through the end of 1981 . , Inflation , , which had averaged 3.2 % annually in the post - war period , , had more than doubled after the 1973 oil shock to a 7.7 % annual rate .
, Inflation reached 9.1 % in 1975 , , the highest rate since 1947 . , Inflation declined to 5.8 % the following year , , but then edged higher . , By 1979 , , inflation reached a startling 11.3 % and in 1980 soared to 13.5 % .
Employment conditions deteriorated throughout the year . ,
The unemployment rate in the U.S. , reached 10.8 % in December 1982 ” higher than at any time in post - war era . , Job cutbacks were particularly severe in housing , , steel and automobiles . , By September 1982 , , the jobless rate reached 10.8 % . , Twelve million people were unemployed , , an increase of 4.2 million people since July 1981 . , Unemployment rates for every major group reached post - war highs , , with men age 20 and over particularly hard hit .
For 2008 - 2009 …
The CEO of NuCor Steel was on Squawk Box this morning . ,
He said actual unemployment is 13 - 15 % if you calculate it the way they did prior to the 80s when they changed it ( for obvious political reasons under Reagan / Bush ) . ,
If we do n’t hit double - digits it ’s likely because the stats are not accurate . ,
The reality is no one knows what is going to happen . , I ask you one simple question to demonstrate the situation we are in : where is the money going to come from to drive growth if fewer people are employed and overall those who are employed ( except for the top 5 % ) are making the same or less , , and borrowing less ( because the banks have stopped lending ) ?
What is going to drive growth , , much less enough growth to create jobs ?
Statistics lie . ,
And we all know who uses statistics . ,
This recession will be like no other simply because of the fraud being committed around the world not just in the financial industry but others ( see Satyam ) . ,
It started with Enron and it wo n’t end for another decade or two until all the fraud shakes out . , Keep your money under your mattress because there is no guarantee you ’ll ever see it again if you invest it .
Payroll declines will soon match those of the 1981 - 82 recession , , when U.S. , joblessness last broke 10 % . , But a larger workforce and a healthier starting point are softening the blow
By James Cooper
The labor market has n’t looked this gloomy since the dark days of the 1981 - 82 recession , , one of the deepest downturns since the 1930s . ,
At the recent pace of payroll declines , , averaging more than 400 , ,000 per month , , job losses will surpass that slump ’s 2.8 million drop in employment by February . ,
What ’s more , , that recession lasted 16 months . ,
The current slump , , which began in December 2007 , , is almost certain to last longer . ,
All this is raising serious questions about how high the unemployment rate will go this time .
, After all , , joblessness peaked at 10.8 % in the 1981 - 82 downturn , , and weekly unemployment claims are already at levels not seen since then .
Are we headed for a double - digit jobless rate in 2009 ?
Not unless this recession is deeper than even the most pessimistic forecasts for economic growth .
, Using a complex linkage between growth and unemployment developed by economist Arthur Okun in the early 1960s , , economists at UBS ( UBS ) show that real gross domestic product would have to fall roughly 6 % from peak to trough to yield a 10 % unemployment rate by the end of 2009 . ,
That would imply a recession twice as deep as the 3 % decline in GDP recorded in the 1981 - 82 downturn .
So why would a recession as steep as the one in 1981 - 82 result in a lower peak jobless rate in 2009 ?
First of all , , unemployment went into that recession at 7.5 % , , compared with 4.7 % just before the current downturn .
, Productivity growth plays a key role in the relationship between growth and unemployment because it can influence the starting point for joblessness .
An increase in productivity growth over the past decade has enabled the economy to grow faster without igniting inflation . , That allowed Federal Reserve policy to be more accommodative to growth , , letting the jobless rate move lower without triggering inflation worries and tighter policy .
, Reflecting that lower starting point , , the UBS economists note that a recession today as deep as the one in 1981 - 82 would imply a peak jobless rate of about 8.25 % .
The rise in unemployment has picked up in recent months as businesses have reacted to the plunge in consumer spending .
, Until late summer , , job losses had been mild because companies entered the recession having hired cautiously .
, Capital spending and inventory policies had also been conservative . ,
Now the economy ’s weakness has overwhelmed those moderating factors , , forcing steeper cuts .
That means the most severe losses in payrolls will be happening now and in the months ahead as companies slash costs and try to cushion their bottom lines .
, Still , , comparisons with the 1981 - 82 experience must be tempered by the growth of both payrolls and the labor force , , which includes workers with jobs and those looking for jobs . , For example , , payroll losses totaling 2.8 million back then , , a 3.1 % decline , , would be equivalent to a drop of 4.3 million jobs today .
, Through November , , payroll losses totaled 1.9 million , , and December data , , due on Jan. , 9 , , will most likely raise that number .
Layoffs , , as illustrated by new claims for unemployment insurance , , zoomed higher at the end of 2008 , , portending more big payroll declines and higher unemployment in coming months .
, December claims averaged 573 , ,000 per week , , a level not seen since the peak monthly rate of 667 , ,000 in 1982 . , However , , that comparison exaggerates the implication for the unemployment rate . , Adjusted for the 42 % growth in the labor force , , claims would still be less than their peak after the 1990 - 91 recession , , when the jobless rate topped out at 7.8 % . , Today ’s equivalent of the 1982 apex in claims would be about 1 million per week .
The current recession could easily end up as deep as the 1981 - 82 downturn in terms of the fall in GDP . , But given the massive policy efforts by the Federal Reserve , , along with fiscal stimulus that may equal more than 2.5 % of GDP in each of the next two years , , a drop - off in growth big enough to push the jobless rate to 10 % seems highly unlikely .
, Clearly , , this is a bad recession . , But not that bad .

Here is how you prepare for a global economic collapse
Every age has its peculiar folly and if Charles Mackay , the author of the 19th century classic , Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds were alive today he would surely see “ cannabinophobia ” as a popular delusion along with the “ tulipmania ” and “ witch hunts ” of earlier ages .
I believe that we are now at the cusp of this particular popular delusion which to date has been responsible for the arrest of over twelve million US citizens .
I also believe that future historians will look at this epoch and recognize it as another instance of the “ madness of crowds . ”
Many readers of this Web site have already arrived at this understanding , but for some of us enlightenment came later than we would have wished .
Consistent with the goal of my Uses of Marijuana Project of encouraging users to write about their involvement with cannabis , I thought I would share something of my cannabis enlightenment , a story that now spans a third of a century .
In every life there occur seminal events that modify the seemingly established trajectory of one ’s personal history .
For me , three of the four big ones were , in chronological order , the decision to go to medical school , the extraordinary good fortune of meeting the woman I married , and the gift of children .
The fourth was my improbable encounter with cannabis , an event that divided my life into two eras ; the before cannabis era , and the cannabis era ( my son David refers to these phases of my life as BC and AD for before cannabis and after dope ) .
My cannabis era began to unfold in 1967 .
As the senior author of a book on schizophrenia , I found myself with what I estimated would be two to three relatively free months before my co-authors would finish their chapters .
Because I had become concerned that so many young people were using the terribly dangerous drug marijuana , I decided to use the time to review the medical literature so that I could write a reasonably objective and scientifically sound paper on the harmfulness of this substance .
Young people were ignoring the warnings of the government , but perhaps some would seriously consider a well - documented review of the available data .
So I began my systematic review of the medical and scientific literature bearing on the toxicity — mental and physical — of marijuana .
It never occurred to me then that there were other dimensions of this drug that warranted exploration .
During my initial foray into this literature I discovered , to my astonishment , that I had to seriously question what I believed I knew about cannabis .
As I began to appreciate that what I thought I understood was largely based on myths , old and new , I realized how little my training in science and medicine had protected me against this misinformation .
I had become not just a victim of a disinformation campaign , but because I was a physician , one of its agents as well .
Believing that I should share my skepticism about the established understanding of marijuana , I wrote a long paper that was published in the now - defunct International Journal of Psychiatry ; a shorter version was published as the lead article in the December 1969 issue of Scientific American .
In these papers I questioned whether the almost ubiquitous belief that marijuana was an exceedingly harmful drug was supported by substantial data to be found in the scientific and medical literature .
While there was little reaction to the paper published in the psychiatric journal , there was much interest in the Scientific American article .
Within a week of the appearance of the article , I received a visit from the associate director of the Harvard University Press , who suggested that I consider writing a book on marijuana .
I found the idea both attractive and daunting .
The subject was worthy of a book - length exposition , and I would have a reason to deepen my exploration of this fascinating and harmful misunderstanding .
And there was another reason , perhaps the most compelling of all .
The one aspect of my work that interested my twelve - year old son Danny was my study of marijuana .
His illness began in July of 1967 , just about the time I had decided to learn about the dangers of marijuana .
He was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia , and his prognosis was , of course , grave .
He was both excited and pleased when I told him that I had decided to write a book on marijuana .
A few weeks later I learned that the Board of Syndics of the Harvard University Press had rejected the book proposal as too controversial .
Until that moment I was unaware of the existence of this board , which must approve every book published by the Press .
An image of the Rembrandt painting “ Syndics of the Cloth Guild ” came to mind : a group of serious - looking , longhaired men sitting around a table , exuding caution and conservatism .
I was disappointed but not surprised that they rejected this proposal ; it was the first instance of academic resistance to my work in this area .
I could have signed on immediately with a trade publisher that offered the prospect of selling more books .
But I believed that a conservative , prestigious press would lend more credibility to a book that promised to be quite controversial .
The director of the press was undaunted ; he believed that he could persuade the Syndics to reverse their decision .
And so he did .
It turned out to be a much bigger project than I had anticipated .
I found that I had more than the medical and scientific literature to review .
Because so much of the misinformation and myths about this drug had their origins in the gaudy writings of the French Romantic Literary Movement , I felt compelled to examine the works of Théophile Gautier , Charles Baudelaire , and other members of Le Club des Haschischins , as well as those of Bayard Taylor and Fitz Hugh Ludlow .
It was fascinating to learn that much of the mythology about cannabis that was being promulgated by the US government had its origins in these writings .
It is difficult to imagine that Harry Anslinger ( our first drug tsar ) was directly familiar with these 19th - century authors , but clearly some of their hyperbolic descriptions of the cannabis experience , largely products of effusive imagination under the influence of copious amounts of hashish , are echoed almost a century later in the “ teachings ” of Harry Anslinger .
I had come to understand that marijuana was not addicting in the usual , rather vague understanding of that word , but I certainly got hooked on learning about it .
I was fascinated by my growing understanding of how little I actually knew about this drug , and even more so by the many false beliefs I had held with such conviction .
It soon dawned on me that I , like most other Americans , had been brainwashed , that I was a part of this madness of the crowd .
And the more I learned about cannabis , the more it seemed to be capable of providing experiences which would be worth exploring personally sometime in the future .
In the meantime , I felt like an explorer sailing an inaccurately and inadequately mapped ocean .
Where earlier cartographers had found many shoals , I found few ; where others found barren and dangerous islands , I saw lands that looked increasingly interesting as I drew closer .
The clearer the view , the greater the temptation to land and make a direct exploration , but I reminded myself that the point of this trip was to chart the ledges and shoals , not to explore forbidden lands to look for riches .
Long before I decided to land , more than a year after the publication of Marihuana Reconsidered in 1971 , it had become inescapably clear that while marijuana was not harmless , its harmfulness lay not so much in any inherent psychopharmacological property of the drug but in the social and legal consequences of our firmly held misbeliefs .
After the publication of Marihuana Reconsidered I was often asked about my personal experience with cannabis .
Some questioners were skeptical when I replied that I had never used it : ” What , you wrote a book about marijuana and you never experienced it ! ”
The implication was that inexperience would invalidate my claim to expertise .
I would defensively respond , “ I have written a book on schizophrenia and I have never experienced that . ”
It was not until some years later that I realized that there was validity to this criticism of my lack of personal experience with cannabis .
Especially in the later phases of this research and writing , I had flirted with the idea of trying marijuana , not because I believed at that time that it would inform my work , but because it appeared to be such an interesting experience .
I decided against it out of fear that it would compromise my goal of producing as objective a statement as I could .
Of course the further I pursued the subject the more I realized how difficult , if not impossible , it would be to produce a truly neutral and objective statement .
But I was not about to add to this difficulty by personally exploring marijuana at this time even though the temptation to do so became greater as I learned more about it .
I had another reason for postponing personal experience with cannabis .
If the book were successful , I expected to be called as an expert witness before legislative committees and in courtrooms .
I correctly anticipated that some of my interrogators would want to know whether I had ever used cannabis , and I wanted to be able to deny it so as to preserve at least the appearance of objectivity .
In the beginning I did not believe this question unfair .
It seemed to me to be no different from other questions about my credentials .
But I soon learned that when it was asked , it was almost always put by a legislator , lawyer , judge , or media person who was hostile to the suggestion that cannabis might not be as harmful as he firmly believed .
It became increasingly clear that the question was asked , not in the spirit of learning more about the context of my understanding of this drug , but rather in the hope that I would answer affirmatively and that this would discredit my testimony .
More than a year after the publication of the book I was testifying before a legislative committee when a senator who had already revealed his hostility asked , “ Doctor , have you ever used marijuana ? ”
Perhaps because I was irritated by the hostility reflected in his previous questions and his sneering tone of voice , I replied , “ Senator , I will be glad to answer that question if you will first tell me whether if I answer your question affirmatively , you will consider me a more or less credible witness ? ”
The senator , visibly upset by my response , angrily told me that I was being impertinent and left the hearing room .
That was the moment that I decided that the time had come .
Later that week Betsy and I went to a party in Cambridge where we knew that some guests would be smoking marijuana .
Ever since a review of Marihuana Reconsidered had appeared on the front page of the New York Times Book Review ( under the banner , “ The best dope on pot so far ” ) people had been offering us marijuana , and we had been politely and often a little apologetically declining it .
Those guests who knew of our previously resolute abstemiousness were surprised when we decided to join them .
We were cautious , as cannabis - naive people should be , as we inhaled our first tokes ever .
Shortly afterward my first and only unpleasant cannabis experience began .
A lit joint was passed around a small circle and we took turns inhaling big , noisy puffs and holding them in for a few seconds .
One by one the others said they had had enough and waved off the passing joint ; they were high , or at least claimed to be .
I asked Betsy , “ Do you feel anything ? ”
“ Not a thing ! ”
“ Neither do I . ”
We were disappointed .
We had been looking forward to this initiation for several years .
I had come to expect so much from the experience , from the magical possibilities of this subtly altered state of consciousness — and now nothing !
I began to wonder ; was this all there was to it ?
Was my acceptance of the claims of cannabis aficionados just as naive as my earlier belief in the propaganda disseminated by the Harry Anslinger truth squad and its descendants ?
Could it be true that all I had accomplished in over three years of intensive research was to swing the pendulum of my gullibility from one extreme to the other ?
Soon my disappointment gave way to a palpable level of anxiety .
Was it possible that I had spent all this time studying what must be for some people an enormously persuasive placebo ?
Would not the author of a book that took as a basic premise that marijuana is a real drug be considered fraudulent ?
I tried to reassure myself .
I reminded myself that I had , after all , carefully explained to the reader that many if not most people do not get high the first time they use marijuana .
At that time I believed that the anxiety I experienced that night was generated by a precipitous loss of confidence in my newly arrived - at understanding of cannabis , an unshakable belief that after more than three years of hard work , I had gotten it wrong and as a consequence had misled a lot of people — certainly sufficient grounds for a good dose of anxiety .
It was not until much later , both chronologically and in my experience with “ stoned thinking ” , that I began to question that explanation .
It occurred to me only years later while I was smoking cannabis that I might have actually achieved a high that first night , an “ anxiety high , ” not the kind I had expected .
This was certainly not impossible ; a small percentage of people who use cannabis for the first time experience some degree of anxiety .
There are even a few people who always get anxious when they use marijuana .
Among the Rastafarians of Jamaica , these folks are considered slightly deviant but are understandably excused with the expression , “ He do n’t have a head for ganja ! ”
This was not a problem with my head , for a week or so later we smoked cannabis and again neither Betsy nor I noticed any change in our states of consciousness that would even remotely suggest that we were high .
Thankfully , however , I was not the least bit anxious this time — only disappointed again .
Finally , on our third attempt , we were able to reach the promised high .
Our awareness of having at last crossed the threshold arrived gradually .
The first thing I noticed , within a few minutes of smoking , was the music ; it was “ Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band . ”
This music was not unfamiliar to me , as it was a favorite of my children , who constantly filled the house with the sound of the Beatles , the Grateful Dead and other popular rock bands of the time .
They frequently urged me to get my “ head out of classical music and try listening to rock . ”
It was impossible not to listen to rock when they were growing up , but it was possible for me , as it was for many parents of my generation , not to hear it .
On that evening I did “ hear ” it .
It was for me a rhythmic implosion , a fascinating new musical experience !
It was the opening of new musical vistas , which I have with the help of my sons continued to explore to this very day .
A year later , I related this story to John Lennon and Yoko Ono , with whom I was having dinner .
( I was to appear the next day as an expert witness at the Immigration and Naturalization Service hearings that Attorney General John Mitchell had engineered as a way of getting them out of the country on marijuana charges after they became involved in anti-Vietnam War activities . )
I told John of this experience and how cannabis appeared to make it possible for me to “ hear ” his music for the first time in much the same way that Allen Ginsberg reported that he had “ seen ” Cézanne for the first time when he purposely smoked cannabis before setting out for the Museum of Modern Art .
John was quick to reply that I had experienced only one facet of what marijuana could do for music , that he thought it could be very helpful for composing and making music as well as listening to it .
In my next recollection of that evening , Betsy and I and another couple were standing in the kitchen in a circle , each of us in turn taking bites out of a Napoleon .
There was much hilarity as each bite forced the viscous material between the layers to move laterally and threaten to drip on the floor .
It seemed a riotous way to share a Napoleon .
But the most memorable part of the kitchen experience was the taste of the Napoleon .
None of us had ever , “ in our whole lives ” , eaten such an exquisite Napoleon !
“ Mary , where in the world did you find these Napoleons ? ” “ Oh , I ’ve had their Napoleons before and they never tasted like this ! ”
It was gradually dawning on me that something unusual was happening ; could it be that we were experiencing our first cannabis high ?
We drove home very cautiously .
In fact , one of the observations I made on the way home was how comfortable I , an habitual turnpike left - laner , was in the right - hand lane with all those cars zipping past me .
It seemed like a very long time before we arrived home .
Not that we were in a rush — the ride was very pleasant .
Time passed even more slowly between our arrival and our going to bed , but once we did , we knew with certainty that we had finally been able to achieve a marijuana high .
And that marked the beginning of the experiential facet of my cannabis era , a development that furthered my education about the many uses of this remarkable drug .
I was 44 years old in1972 when I experienced this first marijuana high .
Because I have found it both so useful and benign I have used it ever since .
I have used it as a recreational drug , as a medicine , and as an enhancer of some capacities .
Almost everyone knows something of its usefulness as a recreational substance , growing numbers of people are becoming familiar with its medical utility , but only practiced cannabis users appreciate some of the other ways in which it can be useful .
It has been so useful to me that I cannot help but wonder how much difference it would have made had I begun to use it at a younger age .
Because it has been so helpful in arriving at some important decisions and understandings , it is tempting to think that it might have helped me to avoid some “ before cannabis era ” bad decisions .
In fact , now , when I have an important problem to solve or decision to make , I invariably avail myself of the opportunity to think about it both stoned and straight .
I cannot possibly convey the breadth of things it helps me to appreciate , to think about , to gain new insights into .
But I would like to share several not too personal instances .
For example , let me tell you about the worst career choice I have ever made ; it was my decision to apply to the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute as a candidate for training in psychoanalysis .
I began this training , which was enormously costly in both time and money , in 1960 and graduated seven years later .
Although I developed some skepticism about certain facets of psychoanalytic theory during training , it was not sufficient to dull the enthusiasm with which I began treating patients psychoanalytically in 1967 ( coincidentally , the same year I began to study cannabis ) .
It was not until about the mid ’ 70s that my emerging skepticism about the therapeutic effectiveness of psychoanalysis began to get uncomfortable .
This discomfort was catalyzed by cannabis .
On those evenings when I smoke marijuana it provides , among other things , an invitation to review significant ideas , events and interactions of the day ; my work with patients is invariably on that agenda .
This cannabis review - of - the - day is almost always self - critical , often harshly so , and the parameters within which the critique occurs are inexplicably enlarged .
My psychotherapy patients , patients who sat opposite me and who could share eye contact and free verbal exchange , always appeared to be making better progress than my psychoanalytic patients .
I was generally satisfied with my work with the former , and invariably at first impatient and later unhappy with the lack of progress made by patients on the couch .
There is little doubt that it was the cumulative effect of these stoned self - critiques that finally , in 1980 , compelled me to make the decision not to accept any new psychoanalytic patients .
The subsequent decision to resign from the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute was very difficult , a little like deciding to get a divorce after more than a decade of marriage .
But I have no doubt that it was the only way I could deal with this growing discomfort and rectify what was now clearly seen as a mistake .
Some of my former psychoanalyst colleagues might believe , among other things , that I have merely traded my involvement in what I considered a macro- delusional system for immersion in an inverse micro version .
Such a possibility notwithstanding , I am indebted to cannabis for the help it provided me in achieving the clarity necessary to arrive at this most difficult decision .
Cannabis can also be used as a catalyst to the generation of new ideas .
Experienced cannabis users know that under its influence new ideas flow more readily than they do in the straight state .
They also understand that some are good and others are bad ideas ; sorting them out is best done while straight .
In the absence of an agenda , the ideas are generated randomly or as close or distant associations to conversation , reading , or some perceptual experience .
It is sometimes worthwhile to have a stoned go at trying to solve a particular problem .
An illustration comes to mind .
In 1980 , during my tenure as Chairperson of the Scientific Program Committee of the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) I “ invented ” and then edited the first three volumes of the Annual Review of Psychiatry , a large book which is still published yearly by the APA .
Mindful of how much money this annual publication was earning for the APA , the chief of our sub - department of psychiatry asked me to put my “ thinking - cap ” on and come up with a way for the Harvard Department of Psychiatry to supplement its shrinking budget .
Taking his request seriously , I smoked that night for the express purpose of trying to generate relevant ideas .
Within days , at a meeting in the Dean ’s office , it was agreed that the idea I arrived at that evening would be pursued — the publication of a monthly mental health letter .
The first edition of The Harvard Mental Health Letter appeared in July 1984 and it soon achieved considerable success as an esteemed mental health publication and a steady source of income to the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry .
Would the idea have come or come as easily in a straight state ?
Maybe .
All through the seemingly endless heated discourse on cannabis in this country over the last three decades , little has been said or written about its many uses .
The overwhelming preponderance of funding , research , writing , political activity , and legislation have been centered on the question of its harmfulness .
The 65 year old debate , which has relatively recently included discussion of its usefulness and safety as a medicine , has never been concerned with its non-medicinal uses ; it is always limited to the question of how harmful it is and how a society should deal with the harm it is alleged to cause .
It is estimated that 76 million Americans have used cannabis and more than 10 million use it regularly .
They use it in the face of risks that range from opprobrium to imprisonment .
From the time I began my studies of marijuana , 12 million citizens of this country have been arrested for marijuana offenses .
The number of annual marijuana arrests is increasing , and in 2000 over 734,000 people were arrested on marijuana charges , 88 percent of them for possession .
Because the government allows confiscation of property in drug cases , many have lost valued possessions ranging from automobiles to homes .
Most have to undertake expensive legal defenses and some have served or will serve time in prison .
Unless we are prepared to believe that all these people are driven by uncontrollable “ Reefer Madness ” craving , we must conclude that they find something in the experience attractive and useful .
And yet there is very little open exploration of these uses with the growing exception of its value as a medicine .
Even here , government officials want to mute the discussion out of a fear expressed by the chief of the Public Health Service when in 1992 he discontinued the only legal avenue to medicinal marijuana :
“ If it is perceived that the Public Health Service is going around giving marijuana to folks , there would be a perception that this stuff ca n’t be so bad … it gives a bad signal . ”
The government has , until very recently , refused to acknowledge that cannabis has any value , even medicinal , but there are millions of citizens who have discovered through their own experience that it has a large variety of uses they consider valuable and that the health costs are minimal .
This large population of marijuana users is a subculture , one that has been present in this country since the 1960s .
Three decades ago it was an open , vocal , active , and articulate culture on and off the campus .
Today it is silent and largely hidden because most users , understandably , do not want to stand up and be counted .
They have more than the law to fear .
Urine testing is now a fact of life in corporate America ; a positive test result can lead , at the very least , to a stint in a “ drug treatment ” program , and at most , to the loss of a job , career destruction , even imprisonment .
Users are very mindful of this minefield , and most find ways around it .
Even more pervasive and in some ways more pernicious is the stigmatization attached to cannabis use .
Young people often experience little of this , at least among their friends .
But as they grow older and move into increasingly responsible and visible positions they become much more guarded .
Many believe , correctly , that colleagues would regard them as deviant if they knew .
This stigmatization is abetted by the media , which have created and perpetrated a stereotyped image of “ potheads ” as young , hirsute , slovenly dressed ne ’er - do - wells or disreputable , irresponsible , and socially marginal hedonists who use marijuana only to hang out and party .
One reason for the fierce resistance to marijuana is the fear that it will somehow taint middle - class society with the “ pothead ” culture .
There is no denying that many , especially young people , use marijuana primarily for “ partying and hanging out ” in the same way that many more use beer .
And most non-users , until they become aware of its medical value , believe that smoking to party and hang out pretty much defines the limits of its usefulness .
This stereotype is powerful , and reactions ranging from puzzlement to outrage greet claims that this party drug could be useful as medicine or for any other purposes .
People who make claims about its usefulness run the risk of being derided as vestigial hippies .
Under these circumstances it is not surprising that most people who use cannabis do so behind drawn curtains , alone or with others who share some appreciation of its value .
It is unfortunate that those who , from personal experience , are aware of its usefulness are so reluctant to be public about it .
I believe it would be good for the country if more people in business , academic and professional worlds were known to be marijuana users .
The government has been able to pursue its policies of persecution and prosecution largely because of the widespread false belief that cannabis smokers are either irresponsible and socially marginal people or adolescents who “ experiment ” , learn their lesson , and abandon all use of the drug .
That lie is unfortunately perpetuated when those who know better remain silent .
It ’s time to let the truth come out .
Just as the gay and lesbian out - of - the - closet movement has done so much to decrease the level of homophobia in this country , when the many people of substance and accomplishment who use cannabis “ come out ” , it will contribute much to the diminution of cannabinophobia .
Not many well - known people are identified as users of cannabis .
A few politicians have been outed by their enemies ( one went so far as to claim that he did not inhale ) , and some would - be political appointments have failed because of a history of marijuana use .
Occasionally a screen star , musician or professional athlete is arrested for possession .
Aside from Allen Ginsberg , some popular musicians , and a few notables from the Beat and hippie movements , few people in the public eye have voluntarily acknowledged cannabis use .
Except for one well - known scientist , the physicist Richard Feynman , academics have been most cautious .
Feynman , by courageously acknowledging his ongoing use of marijuana , won the respect and appreciation of many and the enmity of others .
Fear of “ coming out ” is , of course , not without foundation .
As long as the present stereotyped understanding of marijuana use and its effects continues to prevail , anyone who acknowledges using it will risk being taken less seriously from then on .
It is thought that potheads could not possibly be considered mature , serious , responsible , and credible .
Yet only those who actually use cannabis can teach us how useful it is .
There was a time not so long ago when it was generally assumed that any use of marijuana was “ merely recreational . ”
This was certainly true at the time I wrote Marihuana Reconsidered .
The chapter on marijuana as medicine ( The Place of Cannabis and Medicine ) was concerned with past ( 19th and early 20th century ) and potential uses ; there was no overt and little covert use of cannabis as a medicine at that time .
Now , there are many thousands of patients who use cannabis medicinally .
And as the ranks of these patients grow , so does the number of people who observe for themselves how relatively benign this substance is .
Seventy - four percent of Americans presently believe that cannabis should be made available as a medicine ; very few people would have held this belief in 1971 .
Currently it is generally thought that there are two generic categories of marijuana use : recreational and medical .
But in fact many uses do not fit into these categories without stretching their boundaries to the point of distortion ; they fall into a third category , one that is more diverse and for that reason difficult to label .
It includes such disparate uses as the magnification of pleasure in a host of activities ranging from dining to sex , the increased ability to hear music and see works of art , and the ways in which it appears to catalyze new ideas , insights and creativity , to name a few .
Furthermore , at its edges , which are fuzzy , there is some conflation with both medicine and recreation .
Yet , the preponderance of these uses falls into this broad and distinctive third category that I call enhancement .
This is the class of uses which is generally the least appreciated or understood by non-cannabis users .
It is also the case that some people who use or who have used marijuana may not be aware of some if not most of the enhancement possibilities .
One category of cannabis utility that we have studied is its usefulness as a medicine .
Because there is not at this time a systematic clinical literature on the medicinal uses of cannabis , James B. Bakalar and I asked patients to share their experiences with cannabis as a medicine for our book , Marihuana , the Forbidden Medicine ( Yale University Press , 1993 , 1997 ) .
We supplemented these anecdotal patient accounts with our own clinical experience and what we could glean from the medical literature .
Anecdotal evidence is not as persuasive as that from double - blind placebo controlled studies , the more scientifically sound modern medical approach to the safety and efficacy of new therapeutics .
As the results of such studies become available we may be compelled to modify our estimate of the clinical usefulness of cannabis .
At this time , however , it is difficult to imagine that future studies will subtract much from the clinical experience - driven perception that cannabis is a remarkably versatile medicine with relatively little toxicity .
It is my intention to roughly follow the same format in the Uses of Marijuana Project ( www.marijuana-uses.com).
While I will attempt to illuminate the various uses of cannabis through literary accounts and by sharing some of my own experiences , the prime source of what I hope will be a fairly comprehensive understanding of the uses of this versatile drug will come from contemporary users .
Some will identify themselves ; others will prefer to remain anonymous for reasons that have already been noted .
Either way , I hope to present enough information about the witness to put his or her account into a meaningful context .
Unlike medicinal use , which will eventually be fitted with scientific costume , an understanding of those uses which fall into the category of enhancement will probably always be based on anecdotal accounts ; it is unlikely that marijuana ’s capacity for the enhancement of sexual pleasure , for example , will ever be the subject of a modern scientific ( double - blind placebo - controlled ) study .
However , if this ethnographic method is successful we should be able to provide a reasonably proximate picture of the varieties and value of cannabis use in contemporary society .
And in so doing , we cannabis users can make a significant contribution to the demise of cannabinophobia , one of our age ’s most damaging popular delusions .
In the meantime , Betsy and I are gradually being given the opportunity to explore another dimension of the ways in which cannabis can be valuable ; we are discovering its usefulness in the task of achieving reconciliation with the aging process , including coming to terms with the inevitable physical and emotional aches , deficits and losses .
Cannabis also enhances our appreciation of the time we have , now that we are both emeritus , to enjoy our children , grandchildren and friends , literature , music and travel , and our daily walks in the New England woods .
Of still more importance , it helps us to realize the wisdom of Robert Browning ’s words , “ Grow old along with me !
The best is yet to be … ”
In the wake of The New Yorker ’s recent “ 20 Under 40 ” list of gifted fiction writers who have not yet reached age 40 , the literary community has turned its attention to even younger emerging talent .
Here is that next generation :
Rachel Besculides ’s second collection of letters to Justin Bieber , “ No One Loves You Like I Do , ” was published in January .
Emma Bryant ’s biography of Jennifer Costawicz , “ Jennifer Costawicz Is Mean and Fat and Is Not My Friend Anymore , ” is available in paperback .
Matthew Chu ’s anthology of essays , “ Big Dogs Are Scary .
And Dragons , ” was published in March .
He lives in Michigan .
Joseph DiPasquale , author of the collection of light verse “ My Dad Is Stronger Than Your Dad , ” is working on his first novel .

Air Force Museum should get space shuttle , Ohio congressmen say
Why does the museum want a shuttle orbiter ?
Land that space shuttle ... right ... here
WASHINGTON , D.C. --
The birthplace of aviation wants to be the space shuttle 's retirement home .
The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton is campaigning to add one of three soon - to - be- mothballed NASA space shuttles to its collection of more than 400 aerospace vehicles and missiles .
Museum officials predict its arrival would draw an extra 1 million visitors annually to the facility , create 700 jobs and add $ 40 million to the state 's economy .
About 1.3 million people already visit the free museum at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base each year .
" Ohio 's proud flight heritage , our proximity to a majority of the U.S. population and the aviation tradition of the National Museum of the United States Air Force provide all the essential elements for a dignified display educating the nation and the world on the tremendous accomplishments of the United States space program , " Gov. Ted Strickland said in an April pitch to NASA administrator Charles Bolden .
Ohio Aerospace Institute President Mike
Heil says the proposed shuttle display would highlight the close relationship between the Air Force and NASA as well as the frequent collaborations between Wright - Patterson researchers and NASA Glenn Research Center .
" Bringing a space shuttle to the Air Force museum in Dayton is not only good for the Dayton region but good for the state of Ohio and good for Cleveland , " Heil said .
" The Air Force museum is an internationally famous museum that draws people from around the state , around the country and around the world . "
Every current member of Congress from Ohio , former astronaut and U.S. Sen .
John Glenn , and more than a dozen astronauts with Air Force and Ohio backgrounds have joined Strickland in lobbying NASA to secure one of the three shuttles .
They say the shuttle Atlantis would be most appropriate because of its frequent use in Air Force research .
The Atlantis returned from its final voyage Wednesday .
A letter that Air Force Secretary Michael Donley wrote to NASA touts the museum 's current attributes -- including Titan I and Titan II , Jupiter and Peacekeeper missiles -- in arguing it should also get a space shuttle .
" Visitors can also see a Mercury and Gemini spacecraft , as well as the command module from the Apollo 14 mission , " Donley 's letter says .
" Placing the space shuttle orbiter on display at the National Museum would give museum visitors an exciting look into this important part of our history . "
NASA spokesman Michael Curie said more than 20 museums from around the country have asked to adopt a space shuttle after the program ends in November .
NASA has already offered the Discovery to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington .
If Discovery goes there , an experimental shuttle called the Enterprise that 's now in its collection would be sent to another institution .
Endeavour is the remaining shuttle that is available .
Two other shuttles -- Challenger and Columbia -- were destroyed during missions .
Space shuttles have been used for a wide variety of chores , from performing scientific experiments to deploying and repairing communications satellites , to helping to assemble the space station , Curie says .
President George W. Bush announced the end of the program in 2004 , after Columbia disintegrated upon re-entering Earth 's atmosphere .
" The program has done an awful lot over the years to contribute to technological advancements and scientific discoveries , " Curie said .
According to Curie , NASA is likely to announce its decision early this summer , to give institutions enough time to raise the money required to properly display and transport the shuttles .
" We are trying to find the best locations for the orbiters where the American taxpayers who have paid for them have the best opportunity to see them , " Curie said .
NASA will pay to remove toxic substances from the shuttles before they go to museums , but Curie said each museum will have to spend an estimated $ 28.8 million to reassemble and relocate its shuttle after toxins are removed .
A shuttle is about the size of a DC - 9 aircraft , Curie says : 122 feet long , 78 feet wide , and 57 feet tall .
Dayton Development Coalition Vice President Michael Gessel said NASA 's selection process has been " highly competitive , " with facilities in New York , Texas , Florida , Washington and California making bids .
He said the Air Force Museum Foundation has started a major construction program that will add a 200,000 - square - foot building to the museum 's current 1 million square feet of exhibit space .
So far , the foundation has collected $ 17 million to spend on the building .
Addition of the space shuttle would jump - start fundraising , he predicted .
Gessel said locating an orbiter at the museum would allow its ownership to be retained by taxpayers and put it near the home of the Wright Brothers , within a southwest Ohio eight - county National Aviation Heritage area " recognized by Congress for its contributions to aviation and aerospace history and for the purpose of attracting tourists . "
" It would be a significant boost to the prestige of [ the Air Force museum ] and make the museum an even more important stop for aviation enthusiasts , " Gessel said .
TO THE TRANSCRIPTOME
" Getting the entire genome expression assay on a single chip has been a significant advancement , " says Greg Yap , senior marketing director for DNA analysis at Affymetrix .
Yet he notes that many scientists do n't want to limit their studies to protein - coding genes , which account for just 2 % of transcription ; they want to view transcription genome - wide .
" Everyone has heaved a sigh of relief that the whole human - genome expression arrays were available , but those are really gene - expression arrays , and what we have to look at is genome expression , the transcriptome , " says Yap .
" It turns out that much more of the genome is transcribed than was originally predicted through the standard bioinformatic methods , " he adds .
Affymetrix researchers are currently using a specialized GeneChip microarray to " tile " millions of DNA probes representative of the complete human genome .
The company recently published data that identifies transcription factor - binding sites across human chromosomes 21 and 22 .
Advances have also been made in SNP analysis .
SNPs represent the most common source of genetic variation , and the human genome is thought to contain over 10 million of them , about one every 300 bases .
Working through that many markers is practically impossible without a shortcut .
In April , Affymetrix announced the early - access availability of its GeneChip Mapping 100K Array Set , a two - chip product slated for summer release .
" This assay , for the first time , is enabling customers to try studies that they have always wanted to do but have never had the technologies to be able to do before , " says Yap .
" It was just not economical to look at hundreds of thousands of SNPs with existing technologies .
Our 100 K product will help get these experiments going , " he adds .
Illumina is also planning to release a 100,000 - SNP chip for beta testing by year 's end .

Scientists Explore Origins of ' Supervolcanoes ' on the Sea Floor
Ancient goliaths blamed for multiple mass extinctions
JOIDES Resolution departing from Yokohama , Japan , on the Shatsky Rise expedition .
April 9 , 2010
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .

" Supervolcanoes " have been blamed for multiple mass extinctions in Earth 's history , but the cause of their massive eruptions is unknown .
Despite their global impact , the eruptions ' origin and triggering mechanisms have remained unexplained .
New data obtained during a recent Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) expedition in the Pacific Ocean may provide clues to unlocking this mystery .
To explore the origins of these seafloor giants , scientists drilled into a large , 145 million - year - old underwater volcanic mountain chain off the coast of Japan .
IODP Expedition 324 : Shatsky Rise Formation took place onboard the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution from September 4 to November 4 , 2009 .
Preliminary results of the voyage are emerging .
" ' Supervolcanoes ' emitted large amounts of gases and particles into the atmosphere , and re-paved the ocean floor , " says Rodey Batiza , marine geosciences section head in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's Division of Ocean Sciences , which co-funded the research .
The result ?
" Loss of species , increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , and changes in ocean circulation , " says Batiza .
In fall 2009 , an international team of scientists participating in IODP Expedition 324 drilled five sites in the ocean floor .
They studied the origin of the 145 million - year - old Shatsky Rise volcanic mountain chain .
Located 1,500 kilometers ( 930 miles ) east of Japan , Shatsky Rise measures roughly the size of California .
This underwater mountain chain is one of the largest supervolcanoes in the world : the top of Shatsky Rise lies three and a half kilometers ( about two miles ) below the sea 's surface , while its base plunges to nearly six kilometers ( four miles ) beneath the surface .
Shatsky
Rise is composed of layers of hardened lava , with individual lava flows that are up to 23 meters ( 75 feet ) thick .
" Seafloor supervolcanoes are characterized by the eruption of enormous volumes of lava , " says William Sager of Texas A&M University , who led the expedition with co-chief scientist Takashi Sano of Japan 's National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo .
" Studying their formation is critical to understanding the processes of volcanism , and the movement of material from Earth 's interior to its surface . "
About a dozen supervolcanoes exist on Earth ; some are on land , while others lie at the bottom of the ocean .
Those found on the seafloor are often referred to as large oceanic plateaus .
Current scientific thinking suggests that these supervolcanoes were caused by eruptions over a period of a few million years or less - - a rapid pace in geologic time .
Each of these supervolcanoes produced several million cubic kilometers of lava -- about three hundred times the volume of all the Great Lakes combined -- dwarfing the volume of lava produced by the largest present - day volcanoes in places like Hawaii .
Since the 1960s , geologists have debated the formation and origin of these large oceanic plateaus .
The mystery lies in the origin of the magma , molten rock that forms within the Earth .
A magma source rising from deep within the Earth has a different chemical composition than magma that forms just below Earth 's crust .
Some large oceanic plateaus show signs of a deep - mantle origin .
Others exhibit chemical signatures indicative of magma from a much shallower depth .
The IODP Shatsky Rise expedition focused on deciphering the relationship between supervolcano formation and the boundaries of tectonic plates , crucial to understanding what triggers supervolcano formation .
A widely - accepted explanation for oceanic plateaus is that they form when magma in the form of a " plume head " rises from deep within the Earth to the surface .
An alternative theory suggests that large oceanic plateaus can originate at the intersection of three tectonic plates , known as a " triple junction . "
Shatsky
Rise could play a key role in this debate , because it formed at a triple junction .
However , it also displays characteristics that could be explained by the plume head model .
" Shatsky Rise is one of the best places in the world to study the origin of supervolcanoes , " says Sager .
" What makes Shatsky Rise unique is that it's the only supervolcano to have formed during a time when Earth 's magnetic field reversed frequently . "
This process creates " magnetic stripe " patterns in the seafloor .
" We can use these magnetic stripes to decipher the timing of the eruption , " says Sager , " and the spatial relationship of Shatsky Rise to the surrounding tectonic plates and triple junctions . "
Sediments and microfossils collected during the expedition indicate that parts of the Shatsky Rise plateau were at one time at or above sea level , and formed an archipelago during the early Cretaceous period ( about 145 million years ago ) .
Shipboard lab studies show that much of the lava erupted rapidly , and that Shatsky Rise formed at or near the equator .
As analyses continue , data collected during this expedition will help scientists resolve the 50 year - old debate about the origin and nature of large oceanic plateaus .

JOHANNESBURG —
As resilient as the United States soccer team was again , falling behind and then catching up , Friday ’s 2 - 2 draw with Slovenia at the World Cup brought mixed feelings : satisfaction with a fierce comeback and disappointment that something greater had been earned but not awarded .
The Americans frantically charged back from a 2 - 0 deficit at halftime and seemed to go ahead , 3 - 2 , in the 85th minute on a goal that was nullified by a controversial and unexplained foul call from the referee , Koman Coulibaly of Mali .
“ I ’m a little gutted , ” midfielder Landon Donovan said in a television interview before leaving the field at Ellis Park .
“ I do n’t know how they stole that third goal from us .
You ca n’t take away a good goal from a team at the World Cup .
That ’s disappointing . ”
Still , it was a game the United States ( 0 - 0 - 2 ) could not afford to lose , and it did not .
With England ’s surprising 0 - 0 tie with Algeria later Friday , the Americans can reach the second round with a victory Wednesday over Algeria ; a tie and an England loss to Slovenia ; or a tie and an England tie as long as the Americans maintain their goal - scoring edge over the English .

The baby is being cared for at the Royal Derby Hospital
A newborn boy has been found abandoned in a bag outside a pub in a Derbyshire village .
Police said they were concerned for the welfare of the child 's mother and are trying to trace her .
The boy was discovered by pub staff on Wednesday night outside the Hawk and Buckle on Main Street , Etwall .
He was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital , where doctors estimated he was one day old .
Staff at the hospital have named him Jack .
A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police said : " Police are urgently trying to trace the baby 's mother as they are concerned for her welfare .
" Officers want to stress that anyone providing information can do so in confidence . "
Retired Navy officer John Finn , who received the Medal of Honor for his bravery during the Japanese attack on military installations in Hawaii that plunged the United States into World War II , died Thursday at the Veterans Home of California in Chula Vista .
At 100 , Finn was the oldest surviving recipient of the nation ’s highest medal for valor and the only recipient still alive among those who received the medal for actions during the attack of Dec. 7 , 1941 .
As his health declined , Finn had moved recently to the veterans facility from his longtime home in Live Oak Springs in rural eastern San Diego County .
Although he was a guest of honor at numerous gatherings of veterans and Medal of Honor recipients — including at the White House , where he was greeted by President Obama —
Finn routinely declined to accept the accolade of hero .

“ I ca n’t believe this , ” Finn told the more than 500 people who gathered last year at a local diner to celebrate his birthday .
“ All I ever was was an old swab jockey ....
What I did I was being paid for . ”
Rousted from bed by the explosions that chaotic morning in Hawaii , Finn immediately manned a machine gun and began firing at the Japanese attack planes that swooped low over the naval air station at Kaneohe Bay on their way to their primary target , the U.S. planes and ships at Pearl Harbor .
“ I loved the Navy , ” he often told reporters , “ and that day I was just furious because the Japanese caught us napping and made us pay for it . ”
Wounded numerous times by bullets and shrapnel , Finn refused to be evacuated .
His leadership and courage gave heart to dazed sailors to begin fighting back against the new enemy .

Born July 23 , 1909 , in Los Angeles , John William Finn attended high school in Compton and enlisted in the Navy at age 17 .
Before being stationed at Kaneohe Bay , Finn had served in the Philippines , the Panama Canal Zone and China and aboard ships in the north Atlantic .
At Kaneohe Bay , he was a chief petty officer and an aviation ordnance chief assigned to maintain the weaponry on a PBY Catalina flying boat squadron .
When the attack began , Finn found a .50 - caliber machine gun in the armory and mounted it on an instruction platform , which provided him with no protection .
Despite his wounds , he kept firing and reloading for more than two hours .
“ It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention , ” according to the Medal of Honor citation .
“ Following first aid treatment , although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty , he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes . ”

During the war , Finn served as an instructor and aboard several ships , including aircraft carriers .
Promoted to the officer ranks , he left active duty in 1947 and joined the reserves .
He retired in 1956 as a lieutenant .
In retirement , he worked as a gunsmith , ran a salvage yard and raised horses and cattle .
He spoke often of the Navy as a good career choice for young men and women .
“ His story will continue inspiring generations to come while also reminding us all about the contributions and sacrifices of America ’s greatest generation , ” said Rep. Duncan D. Hunter ( R - Alpine ) , a longtime friend .
Finn was particularly important to aviation ordnance specialists : sailors whose job , while significant to projecting air power , is decidedly unglamorous .
Last year at the U.S. Navy facility in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain , aviation ordnance specialists held a ceremony in Finn ’s honor .

Survivors include his son , Joseph .
Finn ’s wife , Alice , died in 1998 .
Plans for a funeral are pending .

WASHINGTON — “ There are still pros and cons to be considered , ” Justice John Paul Stevens said in his Supreme Court chambers on Friday afternoon , reflecting on his reluctance to leave a job he loves after almost 35 years .
But his calculus seemed to be weighted toward departure , and he said his decision on the matter would come very soon .
“ I do have to fish or cut bait , just for my own personal peace of mind and also in fairness to the process , ” he said .
“ The president and the Senate need plenty of time to fill a vacancy . ”
Hints about Justice Stevens ’s possible departure started in September , when he confirmed that he had hired only a single law clerk , instead of the usual four , for the term that will start this fall .
In occasional public statements since then , Justice Stevens , the leader of the court ’s liberal wing , said he had not yet made up his mind .
But the White House is bracing for a summertime confirmation battle , the second of the Obama presidency .
Justice Stevens , who will turn 90 this month , said he did not like to give interviews “ because it saves an awful lot of time if you do n’t . ”
But he was courtly and candid in reviewing the trajectory of his tenure on the court and in summing up what he had learned about the role of the judge in American life .
This put me in mind of a stunned and disillusioned childhood of multimedia consumption in the 1970s : watching the adventures of that sexy quartet , Kirk , Spock , Scotty and Bones , as with eternal dynamism they pursued space adventures on TV .
And yet , up on the big screen , with each new movie … why did they look increasingly slow and dull and tired , often wearing new outfits which did n't look very good ?
Perhaps , with Sex and the City 4 , we will be treated to a heart - rending Death of Spock - type scene , in which Samantha is fired out of a Manhattan penthouse window in a sparkly coffin , having first transferred her " katra " to a demure assistant .
Anyway , Carrie and her best buds get it together for another big - screen go - around in this misjudged and quite incredibly boring sequel .
As ever , the stars are Sarah Jessica Parker , Kim Cattrall , Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon as columnist - turned - bestselling - author Carrie , heroically lascivious PR Samantha , Park Avenue princess Charlotte and smart lawyer Miranda .
It is two years on from the last movie .
Charlotte and Miranda are happy , if stressed , moms ; Samantha is single and staving off the menopause with weird vitamins and Carrie is still married to smug Big ( Chris Noth ) , but the romance is leaking out of their relationship .
And iPhones , which so baffled Carrie in the last movie , are now ubiquitous .
The gang have lots of fun at a gay wedding , there are a couple of nice jokes and then … well , something absolutely awful happens .
Do they all get crushed by an oblong - shaped asteroid while they 're doing that empowered four - abreast march down the sidewalk ?
Do they get wiped out by swine flu ?
Do they have an epiphany and retreat to a nunnery in Lille ?
No .
They go to Abu Dhabi !
That 's right .
The big plot twist is that Samantha is offered a very unappetising all - expenses - paid junket in Abu Dhabi and gets to invite her three BFs .
Naturally you 'd expect the scenes in Abu Dhabi to last , ooh , maybe two , three minutes , tops – enough for some gags about deserts and camels and American outsiders clumsily misunderstanding Middle Eastern culture , and then surely we 're back to zingy Manhattan .
But oh no .
We are stuck in Abu Dhabi for almost the entire film .
Abu Dhabi .
In the United Arab Emirates .
That Abu Dhabi .
As 10 minutes turned into half an hour and then into an hour , and we were still in Abu Dhabi , with the foursome landed with having to gaze in wonderment and squeak with excitement at naff hotel fixtures and fittings , I sensed a claustrophobic panic growing at the screening I attended .
Like Martin
Sheen waking from his uneasy slumber in Apocalypse Now and thinking : " Shit , I 'm still in Saigon , " various members of the audience would emerge from their periodic reveries and mumble out loud : " Shit , Carrie and her friends and by that token we the audience are still in Abu Dhabi . "
I once watched Béla Tarr 's Sátántangó , the legendary , gloomy black - and - white Hungarian film that lasts for seven and a half hours .
Compared to the Abu Dhabi section of Sex And The City 2 , Sátántangó zips past like an episode of Spongebob Squarepants .
What is going on ?
Is writer - director Michael Patrick King a massive fan of Abu Dhabi ?
Is he an evangelist for Abu Dhabi as a rockin ' holiday destination ?
Or is he , conversely , consumed with a desire to satirise Abu Dhabi as an unsuitable place to visit ?
There is a strange scene on board the plane headed out there , when the crew of the ( fictional ) airline Afdal Air ostentatiously offer the ladies a welcoming glass of champagne — in exactly the way that the winning couple on the 1980s TV show Blind Date would invariably be offered an airborne glass of bubbly as a way of advertising the airline company who were bankrolling the prize .
Weirdly , the film is not shot in Abu Dhabi but Morocco .
It 's a puzzle .
Anyway , our heroines have lots of dull misadventures out in Abu Dhabi , which is presented as a modern Middle Eastern luxury hotel complex with burqas and tradition , but also nightclubs and fun and drinks and karaoke – no cigarettes , though .
Samantha meets a foxily grey - haired Danish architect who looks about as attractive as Harold Shipman , but nonetheless she has a romantic liaison with him on the beach , which gets her into hilarious trouble with the law .
And then Carrie runs into a very significant person in the souk .
Soon , assignations are being arranged and Charlotte warns Carrie that she is " playing with fire " .
Later , some burqa - clad ladies remove their veils to reveal that they are wearing New York - style fashions .
That strikes me as playing with fire rather more dangerously than Carrie 's flirtatious dinner - date .
Well , the way ahead could be Sex and the City : the Next Generation , at which each of the foursome 's assistants team up for younger - level adventures .
Or maybe some sort of prequel .
Candace Bushnell , author of the original column and book , has in fact already published a teen - lit tale of Carrie 's schooldays .
Or perhaps it 's time to call it a day .
After all , they 'll always have Abu Dhabi .

Some rumours have emerged that IBM is considering an OS / 2 comeback and I 'm filled with the same mixed feelings that always emerge whenever the subject is raised .
Would I want OS / 2 back on my desktop now ?
Not really .
Have these rumours got me a bit excited ?
Absolutely .
In fact , I 'm willing to take a guess about what the new OS / 2 might be .
I 'll go out on a limb and say that the chances of IBM recommitting to classic OS / 2 are close to zero .
Like a lot of great systems of the 1990s , such as the Amiga or NEXT , OS / 2 would look laughably out of date now next to , say , the latest KDE or Windows Vista .
A lot of its advantages , such as its industry leading DOS support , are irrelevant and most of its other cool features have been equalled or superseded in later systems .
In my opinion , ex-users tend to view the user interface through rose tinted glasses .
It was good , for the time , but I would n't want to give up niceties such as my modern file manager in KDE to return to what OS / 2 had .
A lot of the technology that underpinned OS / 2 , such as the memory management and hardware support , is now ancient and it would have to be rewritten to support modern hardware and applications .
Apart from that , the whole system is proprietary and legally encumbered .
Persuading people to develop for OS / 2 would be nearly impossible as it's not very compatible with anything else .
To put that into perspective , just think how difficult it can be convincing some mainstream developers that the Linux market is big enough to support .
However , I doubt that any of this is what the new OS / 2 is .
If IBM wants to get back into the world of desktop operating systems , I think that the most likely plan is for a custom Linux distribution , perhaps reviving the old OS / 2 name .
This is because even an organisation as big as IBM would balk at spending the resources needed to create an entire operating system from scratch , and upgrading the OS / 2 source code would probably be an even larger job .
However , it 's probably sick of deploying the operating system of one of it chief competitors on the machines of its clients .
IBM has done something like this before in form of IBM Lotus Symphony , an update of the DOS application suite , by re-branding and adding to Open Office .
This might be exciting news , depending on what you use Linux for and what choices IBM makes ( if any of this even exists outside of the feverish rantings of your humble scribe ) .
A standardised corporate Linux distribution with the backing of IBM might be welcomed by software development houses as it would help to work around one of Linux 's biggest failings in the view of commercial developers , the lack of a standardised platform target .
My biggest wish for this project would be that IBM keep everything open .
Big Blue can make its money from the support side of things .
If it does go ahead , in the manner that I 've outlined , who knows what cool technology IBM could develop to make Linux more of a Windows beater on the desktop ?
Keeping pressure on Microsoft can only be a good thing for the consumer , after all .
An exiting prospect , or yet another distribution to add to the pile ?
Let 's set the stage : third green .
Lefty 's one off the lead .
A gimme putt .
And that 's when God and / or nature conspire to deny him .
You know those little bastards .
Those maple seeds that " helicopter " when you drop them .
What are the fricking odds that one lands in the path of the ball , just as Mickelson begins his backswing ?
Some unemployed guy defeated a former legislator in South Carolina 's Democratic senate primary .
He had no money , no signs and no website .
Did he win because of his brilliant policies ?
Or because his last initial came first in the alphabet ?
Tonight , 32 year - old unemployed veteran Alvin Greene won a 16 - point victory over his seemingly much more qualified opponent , 64 year - old Vic Rawl , a former judge and legislator .
Greene did not fundraise at all , while Rawl had about $ 186,000 in cash , according to the AP .
Greene is such a nobody that the Huffington Post asks at the end of their article : " Do YOU know anything about Alvin Greene ?
Do you have any photos of him ?
Email us . "
Greene really does seem like some random dude .
Here 's what he told a reporter for the Columbia Freetimes , when they asked why he was spending so much of his own money to campaign against a popular incumbent , Republican senator Jim DeMint :
Asked if he thought it was a good investment to spend so much of his own money in a two - way Democratic primary to run against a popular Republican with millions in campaign cash , Greene replied : " Rather than just save the $ 10,000 and just go and buy gasoline with it , just take [ it ] and just be unemployed for [ an ] even longer period of time , I mean , that would n't make any sense , um , just , um , but , uh , yes , uh … lowering these gas prices … that will create jobs , too .
Anything that will lower the gasoline prices .
Offshore drilling , the energy package , all that . "
Oh , OK !
So how did he win ?
The chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic party speculated to the AP that " people who did n't know either candidate and voted alphabetically may help explain Greene 's win . "
Alvin Green :
An inspiration to random unemployed dudes everywhere .
FRANKFURT — French and German banks have lent nearly $ 1 trillion to the most troubled European countries and are more exposed to the debt crisis than the banks of any other countries , according to a new report that is likely to add pressure on institutions to detail their holdings .
French banks had lent $ 493 billion to Spain , Greece , Portugal and Ireland by the end of 2009 while German banks had lent $ 465 billion , according to the report by the Bank for International Settlements , an institution based in Basel , Switzerland , that acts as a clearing house for the world ’s central banks .
The report sheds light on where the risks from Spain and other troubled euro - zone countries are concentrated , but left open the question of which individual banks would be most endangered by declines in the prices of sovereign bonds or a surge in bad loans made to companies and individuals .
The B.I.S. did not identify individual institutions , in line with its confidentiality rules .
Voluntary disclosure by banks has been uneven .
Hypo Real Estate Holding , a real estate and public - sector lender based near Munich , has put its exposure to government debt from the four countries plus Italy at more than € 80 billion , or $ 97 billion .
Deutsche Bank , in Frankfurt , says it holds € 500 million in Greek government bonds and no Spanish or Portuguese sovereign debt .
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Trade Commission will investigate whether Apple Inc.'s business practices harm competition in the market for software used on mobile devices , people familiar with the situation said .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - The Trans - Alaska Pipeline , partly owned by BP , shut down on Tuesday after spilling several thousand barrels of crude oil into backup containers , drastically cutting supply down the main artery between refineries and Alaska ’s oilfields .
The accident comes at a difficult time for BP -- the largest single owner of the pipeline operator , holding 47 percent -- as it struggles to plug a gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well .
The shutdown followed a series of mishaps that resulted from a scheduled fire - command system test at Pump Station 9 , about 100 miles south of Fairbanks , said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co , the operator of the 800 - mile oil line .
The power outage triggered opening of relief valves , causing an unspecified volume of crude oil to overflow a storage tank into a secondary containment .
There were no injuries , but the approximately 40 people at the work site were evacuated , Alyeska spokeswoman Michele Egan said .
North Slope oil producers have cut their flow into the pipeline ’s Prudhoe Bay intake station to 16 percent of their normal rates , Egan said .
There is enough storage capacity to allow the line to be shut down for 48 hours as long as producers maintain the 16 percent flow rate , she said .
It is unclear how long the shutdown will last .
“ We ’re going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up , ” Egan said .
Supply problems in the pipeline potentially disrupt tanker shipments to refineries .
The volume of spilled oil is unknown .
“ We ’ve estimated the spill is several thousand barrels , ” she said .
All has been held within the secondary containment , which has capacity to hold 104,500 barrels , she said .
The amount spilled is “ nowhere near ” the containment area ’s capacity , she added .
Alyeska is a consortium owned by five oil companies .
Major owners are BP , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil .
Unocal and Koch hold minor shares .
The Trans - Alaska Pipeline , which runs from Prudhoe Bay to the tanker port of Valdez , normally ships about 667,000 barrels of oil daily .

VATICAN CITY 
Addressing the sexual abuse crisis from the seat of the Roman Catholic Church before thousands of white - robed priests , Pope Benedict XVI on Friday begged forgiveness , saying the church would do “ everything possible ” to prevent priests from abusing children .
“ We , too , insistently beg forgiveness from God and from the persons involved , while promising to do everything possible to ensure that such abuse will never occur again , ” Benedict told thousands of priests and the faithful gathered in St. Peter ’s Square for celebrations marking the end of the Vatican ’s Year of the Priest .
The pope did not outline specific actions that the church would take to combat abuse , as many had hoped  and as Benedict had pledged at an audience in April .
Nor did his remarks go much beyond what he had already said in a letter to Irish Catholics in March and in a private meeting with victims of sexual abuse on Malta in April .
But it was the first time that Benedict had asked forgiveness for the crisis from St. Peter ’s Square , the heart of the church itself , and on an occasion focused on priests .
Experienced Augusta Social Security disability attorneys Harrison and Lamar discuss the Social Security Administration ’s sequential evaluation process
The Social Security Administration ( SSA ) uses a five - step sequential evaluation process to decide if you are disabled and qualify for either of the two disability programs it operates — Social Security Insurance ( SSI ) or Social Security disability .
If SSA determines that you are either disabled or not disabled at any step in the sequential evaluation process , then the process is complete .
The sequential evaluation process is made up of the following five steps :
You are not engaged in “ substantial gainful activity ” ( SGA ) ; and Your impairment is both “ severe ” and medically determinable ; and Your impairment “ equals ” or meets one of the impairments located in the Social Security regulations referred to as the “ Listing of Impairments ; ” or You are unable to do your “ past relevant work ” ( PRW ) considering your “ residual functional capacity ” ( RFC ) ; and Considering your age , education , RFC , and work experience , you cannot make an adjustment to another job that is available in significant numbers .
Be careful when trying to understanding the terms marked by quotation marks and the letters used to abbreviate them .
These particular terms have precise legal meanings and these terms may not necessarily have the same meanings as they would in other situations .
Moreover , for SSA to determine that you are disabled you must fulfill the “ duration requirement , ” or your disability has to last for 12 full months .
To summarize , there are two main pathways for SSA to reach a finding of disability on a Social Security disability application or an SSI application :
Your disability must “ equal ” or qualify as an impairment noted in the Listing of Impairments — the sequential evaluation process ends at Step 3 .
You must meet every other qualification of the sequential evaluation process ending at Step 5 .
The following six items are ways in which SSA could find that you are not disabled .
You will not qualify as disabled if :
You are working at the SGA level as stated in Step 1 ;
You have no medically determinable impairment as stated in Step 2 ;
You have a medically determinable impairment , but it does not significantly limit your mental or physical ability to complete basic activities at work as stated in Step 2 ;
Your impairment does not meet the duration requirement of 12 full months ;
You are capable of performing past relevant work as stated in Step 4 ; and You are capable of performing other work as stated in Step 5 .

Despite the economy , donors opened their wallets to give more than $ 1 billion in the first four months of the relief effort in earthquake - devastated Haiti , a generous response for an international disaster .
The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University estimates that donors contributed $ 1.3 billion - about the same amount raised for the 2004 Asian tsunami - to 96 private charities like the American Red Cross , Habitat for Humanity and the Clinton - Bush Haiti Fund .
Though it is less than the $ 5.3 billion generated after Hurricane Katrina , the center 's executive director , Patrick Rooney , said the Haiti response was huge .
He said Haiti's proximity to the United States and extreme poverty may have tugged at American hearts .
" I think it 's a little surprising that response was as strong as it was , " Rooney said .
He said the economy did not influence giving , since most people donate small amounts that do n't require a reallocation of household budgets - the average gift was $ 50 .
About one - third of the total amount went to the American Red Cross , which raised $ 444 million , according to a list compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy .
The Red Cross collected some of its money by allowing people to text a $ 10 donation from their mobile phones .
Thousands of aid agencies are currently working in Haiti as 2 million Haitians are enduring the rainy season in makeshift camps and struggling to buy food and provisions .
But Rooney expects donations for Haiti to drop off precipitously .
They always do when media coverage fades and aid agencies shift from emergency operations like food drops and medical care to longer - term recovery measures .
" We 're a nation with a short attention span , " Rooney said .
" Three to six months after a disaster , donations approach zero . "
A team led by University of Arizona astronomer Joshua Eisner has observed in unprecedented detail the processes giving rise to stars and planets in nascent solar systems .
The discoveries , published in the Astrophysical Journal , provide a better understanding of the way hydrogen gas from the protoplanetary disk is incorporated into the star .
By coupling both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii with a specifically engineered instrument named ASTRA ( ASTrometric and phase - Referenced Astronomy ) , Eisner and his colleagues were able to peer deeply into protoplanetary disks -- swirling clouds of gas and dust that feed the growing star in its center and eventually coalesce into planets and asteroids to form a solar system .
The big challenge facing Eisner 's team lies in obtaining the extremely fine resolution necessary to observe the processes that happen at the boundary between the star and its surrounding disk -- 500 light years from Earth .
It 's like standing on a rooftop in Tucson trying to observe an ant nibbling on a grain of rice in New York 's Central Park .
" The angular resolution you can achieve with the Hubble Space Telescope is about 100 times too coarse to be able to see what is going on just outside of a nascent star not much bigger than our sun , " said Eisner , an assistant professor at UA 's Steward Observatory .
In other words , even a protoplanetary disk close enough to be considered in the neighborhood of our solar system would appear as a featureless blob .
Combining the light from the two Keck telescopes provides an angular resolution finer than Hubble's .
Eisner and his team used a technique called spectro- astrometry to boost resolution even more .
By measuring the light emanating from the protoplanetary disks at different wavelengths with both Keck telescope mirrors and manipulating it further with ASTRA , the researchers achieved the resolution needed to observe processes in the centers of the nascent solar systems .

Protoplanetary disks form in stellar nurseries when clouds of gas molecules and dust particles begin to collapse under the influence of gravity .
Initially rotating slowly , the cloud 's growing mass and gravity cause it to become more dense and more compact .
The preservation of rotational momentum speeds up the cloud as it shrinks , much like a figure skater spins faster as she tugs in her arms .
The centrifugal force flattens the cloud into a spinning disk of swirling gas and dust , eventually giving rise to planets orbiting their star in roughly the same plane .
Combining the Keck interferometer with the spectro- astrometry technique , Eisner and his collaborators were able to distinguish between the distributions of gas , mostly made up of hydrogen , and dust , thereby resolving the disk 's features .
" We were able to get really , really close to the star and look right at the interface between the gas - rich protoplanetary disk and the star , " said Eisner , who serves as project scientist on the ASTRA team .
Astronomers know that stars acquire mass by incorporating some of the hydrogen gas in the disk that surrounds them , in a process called accretion .

" We want to understand how material accretes onto the star , " Eisner said .
" This process has never been measured directly . "
Accretion can happen in one of two ways .
In one scenario , gas is swallowed as it washes up right to the fiery surface of the star .
In the second , much more violent scenario , the magnetic fields sweeping from the star push back the approaching gas and cause it to bunch up , creating a gap between the star and its surrounding disk .
Rather than lapping at the star 's surface , the hydrogen atoms travel along the magnetic field lines as if on a highway , becoming super - heated and ionized in this process .
" Once trapped in the star 's magnetic field , the gas is being funneled along the field lines arching out high above and below the disk 's plane , " Eisner explained .
" The material then crashes into the star 's polar regions at high velocities . "
In this inferno , which releases the energy of millions of Hiroshima - sized atomic bombs every second , some of the arching gas flow is ejected from the disk and spews out far into space as interstellar wind .
Eisner 's team pointed the telescopes at 15 protoplanetary disks with young stars varying in mass between one half and 10 times that of our sun .
This sample of disks , all located in our own galaxy , the Milky Way , represents by far the largest of its kind .
" We could successfully discern that in most cases , the gas converts some of its kinetic energy into light very close to the stars " he said , a tell - tale sign of the more violent accretion scenario .
" In other cases , we saw evidence of winds launched into space together with material accreting on the star , " Eisner added .
" We even found an example -- around a very high - mass star -- in which the disk may reach all the way to the stellar surface . "
The solar systems the astronomers chose for this study are still young , probably a few million years old .
" These disks will be around for a few million years more , " Eisner said .
" By that time , the first planets , gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn , may form , using up a lot of the disk material . "
More solid , rocky planets like the Earth , Venus or Mars , wo n't be around until much later .
" But the building blocks for those could be forming now , " he said , which is why this research is important for our understanding of how solar systems form , including those with potentially habitable planets like Earth .
" We are going to see if we can make similar measurements of organic molecules and water in protoplanetary disks , " he said .
" Those would be the ones potentially giving rise to planets with the conditions to harbor life . "

Dear Friend Hitler , thought to be Indian cinema 's first portrayal of the Nazi dictator , is set in the last days of the Third Reich
He is a stalwart of Indian cinema who once played Gandhi on the small screen , while she is a former Miss India best known for her romantic comedy roles .
Together , Anupam Kher and Neha Dhupia are to play Adolf Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun in a new Bollywood film set in the last days of the Third Reich .
According to reports , the curiously titled Dear Friend Hitler will centre on the relationships between the Nazi dictator and those who were close to him , including Braun , his long - term lover who he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker .
" It aims to take the viewer into close quarters with the enigmatic personality that Hitler was and give a glimpse into his insecurities , his charisma , his paranoia and his sheer genius , " a source told the Mumbai Mirror newspaper .
Kher , who was chosen by the film 's director , Rakesh Ranjan Kumar , for his apparent resemblance to Hitler , told reporters on Sunday that he was looking forward to the challenge .
" I already have an image , I am a known actor , so it will be doubly hard work for me to take away that image , " he said .
" He 's one of the most interesting characters of our times . "
Kumar said he considered Hitler the most successful loser of the 20th century and wanted to examine this interpretation .
" As a leader , he was successful .
Why did he lose as a human being , what were the problems , what were the issues , what were his intentions , this is what we want to show , " he said .
The aim is for the film to be an international release .
Perhaps controversially , Kumar also said he hoped to show Hitler 's " love for India " and how the Nazi leader indirectly contributed to independence in the subcontinent .
He said the movie would be neither a war story , nor a tale of love .
" The film will not show the love life of Adolf Hitler .
It will show [ the ]
Eva who had been rarely spoken about in history , " Kumar told Indian news agency IANS .
" Eva had been Hitler 's girlfriend since she was 17 years old .
The film shows how she comes into his life in his last days .
They got married 42 hours before he died ( 30 April 1945 ) . "
Hitler has been portrayed on the big screen many times , notably in the 2004 German - language film Downfall , which was nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar , and in the 1973 British film Hitler : The Last Ten Days , in which Alec Guinness played the dictator .
Dear Friend Hitler is believed to be the first Indian effort .
Design and the Automobile in American Life and Society Cars make cultural as well as personal statements — the designs of the cars we buy reveal a great deal about both our society and our selves .
When Buick discovered in the 1990s that the average age of its customers had risen to 68 , for example , it hired Tiger Woods as a spokesperson and designed a sports car christened the Bengal to appeal to successful young professionals .
Buick ’s choice of pitchman and car — and their subsequent decision not to bring it to market — tells us much about America before and after September 11 , 2001 .
In his first essay on the history of auto design , David Gartman shows that cars have only rarely and belatedly come to be treated seriously by scholars as aesthetic objects with cultural significance , and that this lack of attention has stemmed from scholarly prejudice against the car ’s practical function as a transportation device .
Then , in his second essay , Gartman examines more closely the tense relationship between engineers and designers in the auto industry , a relationship always shaped by cultural ideas about gender , with “ pretty boy ” designers having to establish their masculinity against the “ tough guy ” engineers .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - People in cities around the Mediterranean including Athens , Rome and Marseilles are likely to suffer most in Europe from ever more scorching heatwaves this century caused by climate change , scientists said on Sunday .
The number of heatwaves was likely to surge to almost 3 each summer from 2071 - 2100 in the Mediterranean region from just one every third year from 1961 - 1990 , it said .
Most other parts of Europe would suffer far less .
The number of Mediterranean summer days with temperatures above 105 Fahrenheit ( 40.6C ) , a threshold in the United States for public health warnings , would rise to about 16 a year from 1.6 in the same period .
Heat - related health problems would be felt most by people living near the coast or in low - lying river valleys , according to scientists in Switzerland and the United States writing in the journal Nature Geoscience about health and heat projections .
“ Some of the most densely populated European regions , such as the urban areas of Athens , Bucharest , Marseilles , Milan , Rome and Naples , would experience the severest changes in health indicators , ” they wrote .
About 40,000 people died in an extreme heatwave in Europe in 2003 .
But Erich Fischer , lead author of the study at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich , said it was uncertain how deadly future heatwaves would be .
Air pollution might aggravate health risks for people with respiratory or heart problems in hotter temperatures , he said .
And he said the study did not consider that cities can act as “ heat islands ” -- often warmer than surrounding countryside .
On the other hand , improved weather forecasts can help ensure that people at risk -- especially the elderly and the very young -- stay in the shade and drink more on hot days .
And air conditioning might become more efficient and widely used .
“ People living in Arizona show that you can adapt to heat , ” Fischer told Reuters .
In such hot climates , people avoid straining themselves outdoors at the hottest part of the day .
He said the study was the first to pinpoint areas of Europe where rising temperatures would coincide with rising humidity , high night - time temperatures and long - lasting heatwaves -- all factors that can aggravate health problems .
Global warming will mean more moisture in the air from the Mediterranean , for instance , making it harder for people to sweat away excess heat .
High night - time temperatures can make sleep harder .
“ We see the strongest increases in the number of these days with dangerous health conditions ... all along the coast of the Mediterranean and in low - altitude river basins , such as the Po or the Danube , ” he said .
The study defines a heatwave as at least 6 days in a row with temperatures among the hottest 10 percent of those recorded in the region for those dates .
That means that a heatwave in Greece is hotter than one in Scandinavia .
NEW ORLEANS 
A federal grand jury charged five police officers Friday in connection with the shooting death of a civilian in the days after Hurricane Katrina .
An 11 - count indictment against the officers revealed a sequence of events that led to the body of Henry Glover , 31 , being found burned in an abandoned car .
The killing occurred Sept. 2 , 2005 , four days into the flooding of the city , in the Algiers neighborhood on the west bank of the Mississippi River , according to the indictment .
David Warren , a police officer at the time , was charged with shooting Mr. Glover with an assault rifle .
Mr. Warren was arrested by federal agents on Friday after the indictment was returned .
Mr. Glover , who was bleeding to death , was picked up by William Tanner , a stranger , who said he drove him to an elementary school that was being used as temporary headquarters for a police special - operations unit , one that was later hailed as heroic for its hurricane rescue efforts .

The spokesman refused to comment not only on the arrest of Brodsky , but also on whether Israel has asked Poland not to extradite him to Germany , or whether the incident has caused tension between Jerusalem and Warsaw .
The Jerusalem Post
Der Spiegel
In Germany , meanwhile , a spokesman for the German federal prosecutor toldon Sunday that the prosecutor ’s office “ does not know ” if Israel “ intervened ” with Poland regarding the extradition of the alleged spy .
The spokesman said he read the news item about the Israeli government contacting Polish officials in thereport that broke the story .
When asked what the legal timeline was in connection with the extradition process , the German spokesman said that depended on “ many different factors . ”
He declined to give a time frame and said the legal options available to the suspect conform to EU guidelines .
The National
The UAE newspaperquoted on Sunday Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim , the Dubai Police chief , as saying Dubai would not seek the suspect ’s extradition from Germany .
“ This person has committed the crime in Germany and therefore it is only normal that he will be prosecuted there , ” he was quoted as saying .
“ For us , what is important [ is ] that he will receive his punishment irrespective of which country . ”
He added , however , that if Brodsky was involved in the assassination in Dubai , then his extradition would be sought .
“ The fact that German investigators could develop their own investigations is a clear indication of the strength of the information provided by us and that the pictures and other data collected are accurate , ” Tamim was quoted as saying .
The arrest of Brodsky is the latest fallout from the assassination of Mabhouh , for which Israel has never admitted responsibility .
Last month Australia expelled an Israeli diplomat over the passport forgery issue , and Britain did the same in March .
Twelve British , eight Irish , four Australian , two French and a German passport were allegedly used by the hit squad that killed Mabhouh .
Tourism Minister Stas Meseznikov told reporters before Sunday ’s cabinet meeting that he did not think the episode would spur a crisis with either Poland or Germany .
“ Poland is a big friend of Israel , as is Germany , and it needs to tell Germany that it will extradite him to Israel ; and if there is a complaint against him , we have a legal system that is well respected in the world , ” Meseznikov said .

The WA Greens Party is in disarray today after an acrimonious public falling out between two of its most prominent politicians .
The member for Fremantle Adele Carles has quit the party saying criticism from the party 's leader Giz Watson had been a significant factor in her decision .
On Friday afternoon Mr Carles launched an attack on Ms Watson accusing her of knifing her and forcing her to go public on her affair with former Treasurer Troy Buswell .
Ms Carles emailed the Greens saying she had resigned from the party and would sit in parliament as an independent .
She says Ms Watson had threatened to release details of the affair to the media if Ms Carles did n't come clean .
Ms Carles says Ms Watson forced her to expose her private life .
At a news conference in Perth on Friday afternoon Ms Carles was asked directly if the party had knifed her .
" I would say Giz Watson did by not admitting about the bungle she made about that Friday media conference that she was going to do , " she said .
Ms Watson rejects any suggestion she blackmailed Ms Carles into revealing her affair with Mr Buswell .
Ms Watson also denies she threatened the member for Fremantle .
" All those conversations were had with all our colleagues in the room and we have a very firm commitment , we had a very firm commitment to work with Adele , to do it together , " she said .
Last week , Ms Carles admitted to a four - month affair with former state treasurer Troy Buswell .
Ms Carles says because of pressure and bullying from the Greens , her private life has been exposed and she says Ms Watson has still continued to criticise her .
" You know , I would have thought that would have been enough punishment , that I 'm out there completely exposed , my whole public life is exposed here .
" That 's still not enough for Giz Watson .
She 's still been on the airwaves bagging me in public .
I can't understand that , I really do n't understand that .
And I can't work in a team where I do n't have the support of the leader . "
She says Ms Watson threatened to take the story of her affair with Troy Buswell to the media and that forced her to admit to it publicly .
" If anyone is going to say this I have to say this in my own words so that I can say it to the people of Fremantle that represented me , not Giz Watson as some school mistress telling the public about something naughty that I 'd done . "
But , Ms Watson says the story was going to be revealed anyway and she was attempting to help Ms Carles gain a measure of control .
" The combined thinking of the parliamentarians was if this story is going to be run , it would be better that Adele actually be given the opportunity to put it in her words . "
The co-convenors of the WA Greens , Dee O'Neill and Scott Ryan , say they are disappointed with Ms Carles ' decision but the party will respect it .
Mr Ryan said the deterioration of working relationships with Greens MP Giz Watson was behind the reason for her decision .
" She sees the relationship , particularly with Giz , having broken down and she does n't feel like she can function within the parliamentary team without Giz 's full support , " he said .
Ms Carles was the only Greens member in the Lower House but will now remain as an Independent .

Air travelers must act fast to properly celebrate the tenth anniversary of JetBlue .
The New York - based low - cost airline is selling one - way fares for ten dollars , on all of its remaining flights originating in the United States on either May 11 or May 12 .
But these tickets must be purchased by 11:59 p.m. , Eastern Daylight Time ( UTC - 04 ) tonight .
The only JetBlue flights not part of this sale are those originating at Bogotá International Airport in Colombia ( IATA : BOG ; ICAO : SKBO ) .
Travelers who take advantage of this sale are also entitled to one free checked bag , presumably per flight , although the sale page on the website is not clear on that .
The free checked bag must comply with size and weight rules .
Moreover , travel must be booked online at www.jetblue.com/deals/ten-years.
This offer is only good for “ newly - booked travel , ” meaning that travelers who have already bought a ticket to fly on JetBlue during one or both of those two dates are not able to get the difference between what they paid and the sale fare .
This price does not include additional fees such as passenger facility charges , September 11th security fees , and federal segment tax , which can add 20 to 30 dollars to the price each way .
Other terms and conditions than those mentioned here , apply .

They have good reason to worry .
Even though BP claims otherwise , we just do n't know for sure and you should n't just dump it anywhere ( although I suspect they will , anyway ) :
About 35,000 bags — or 250 tons — of oily trash have been carted away from this beach , said Lt. Patrick Hanley of the Coast Guard , who is stationed at Port Fourchon .
And as of Monday , more than 175,000 gallons of liquid waste — a combination of oil and water — had been sent to landfills , as had 11,276 cubic yards of solid waste , said Petty Officer Gail Dale , also of the Coast Guard , who works with at the command center in Houma .
Michael Condon , BP ’s environmental unit leader , said that tests have shown that the material is not hazardous , and can safely be stored in landfills around the region that accept oil industry debris .
The checklist and procedures involved , Mr. Condon said , are part of a process “ we do very well and have done for a long time . ”
But some local officials , environmental lawyers and residents who live near landfill sites are not convinced .
“ There ’s no way that is n’t toxic , ” said Gladstone Jones III , a New Orleans lawyer who has spent much of his career trying to get compensation for plaintiffs he says have been harmed by exposure to toxic waste .
In fact , waste from oil exploration and production falls into a regulatory no man ’s land , neither exactly benign nor toxic on its face .
The compounds in oil most dangerous to human health — like benzene , a carcinogen — are volatile and tend to dissipate when crude oil reaches the ocean surface , or soon thereafter .
But some toxicologists say it is impossible to know whether the toxic chemicals are entirely gone .

Richard Parry of Frontline News describes the changes in war reporting over the past 17 years , based on his own experiences and those of his friend , the photographer Robert King .
Sarajevo , 1993 : It 's 10 am in the Holiday Inn - Bosnia 's Mecca for journalists - and standing at the bar in his hicksville dungarees is Robert King .
He knocks back a tumbler of jungle juice , looks me in the eye and says with a Tennessee lilt , " I lived in Brooklyn for six years .
I thought I knew what a war was like .
But this place is crazy . "
In the intervening years we have definitely been through some crazy times .
This was Robert 's first war .
It was mine , too , as a freelance TV reporter with Frontline News .
He 'd just stepped off the plane intent on becoming a war photographer and winning a Pulitzer Prize .
I had similar goals and similar naivety .
Both of us in our early 20s , hopeful , ambitious , unjaded and looking for experience of the real world .

There are many books and films glorifying the noble reporter but few that have shown the hacks as we knew them in Yugoslavia , especially the freelancers at the bottom of the food chain .
The ones with little money or protection who scrambled around digging up stories that appeared later on the major networks , totally uncredited .
They drank more , partied harder , got shot more often and had the kind of black humour that could lift you out of the worst of times .
Miss Sarajevo Robert and I rented accommodation in Sarajevo and set about the task of getting stories and making money .
When the city was totally cut off by Serbs , during American airstrikes , we worked for innumerable networks running from pillar to post - donning different hats for each job , saving a tidy sum .
Robert King has also worked in Afghanistan
Then in fallow times we hung out with Miss Sarajevo and her friends in bombed - out pool halls , sharing Marlboro Reds ( common currency in the beleaguered city ) .
Looking back on it , I now realise we had huge freedom to cover stories .
Although it outranked all recent conflicts in terms of the attrition of journalists , few restrictions were imposed on us .
But it could be crazy .
One day the Croat - Muslim alliance in Mostar fell apart .
Robert and I headed for the nearby town of Jablanica .
We left our car with a friendly local , took a guide , packed our kit on to three donkeys , and started the four - hour accent .
We never got to Mostar .
Militiamen on the mountain said our papers were n't in order .
Escorted back down the hill , I was shown into a secluded , tumbledown HQ building and met a 12 - year boy wielding a handgun .
To my dismay , I soon realised he was in charge .
We were accused of spying and all manner of wrongdoings .
The boy spun the chamber of his gun several times and wanted to play Russian Roulette .
It took several hours and much convincing to let us go .
They dumped us back in Jablanica without our bulletproof jackets , our car or cameras .
And herein lies one of the freelance dilemmas : with cameras valuing £ 40,000 , with no insurance - what do we do ?
We waited .
Eleven days in this town under fire , full of refugees , trying to win friends in the mafia and hoping to be reunited with the tools of our trade .
Kidnaps
There were dangerous moments during our first years covering the Yugoslav wars but we were n't really targeted .
The first signs of change came in 1994 in Tuzla , when mujahideen ( probably foreign fighters ) murdered three aid workers .
A US soldier at an urban training facility in Kentucky But it was in Chechnya , where Robert and I went next , that aid workers and journalists became routine targets .
Kidnaps were lucrative for the gangs .
They helped fund the war , and the terror they inspired was a useful propaganda weapon .
So we had to be more cautious , more careful of where we went and with whom .
I caught up with Robert again in 2007 as he was heading for Baghdad .
Robert , unlike many of our colleagues who had either died , burned out or switched to safer work , was still a war snapper - a little more rounded , less naive , cynical perhaps but still the big - hearted , good - humoured character that I knew and loved .
The US forces had honed their skills in " working with the press " .
As embedded press you were looked after , protected , fed and watered by Uncle Sam , while the danger of being attacked or kidnapped was very high outside the wire .
Not surprisingly , many of us chose to cover the war in this way .
Of course , the same forces that look after you can also control what you record .
Of the few days we spent with the US 2 - 12 Cavalry we were stymied every time we tried to join missions to pick up wounded soldiers .
They could always find an excuse : " No space in the convoy , " or " not enough vehicles . "
At a time when the US government was trying to downplay the human cost - it made sense to restrict the movements of the media .
So we looked back at our days in Bosnia with great nostalgia .
The way news is gathered has changed radically .
It is a testament to Robert 's endurance that he is still out there trying make a buck and take the pictures he thinks the world should see .

Outstanding Toast !
Thank you oh so VERY MUCH !!!
You made my day a lot happier ... Uh oh , is there something wrong ?
First off , after you finish step 1 , you need to reboot the phone ( or at least I did cause nothing was happening while sitting in recovery ) .
Second , in step 3 , I got so far as the img and then I got errors .
I followed the instructions to the letter .
Hell , I even rebooted and tried step 3 again ad still have the same problems .
There were no errors up until this point .
Did I do something wrong ?
Nevermind for now .
I read a few pages into this post and found out the img from step 1 is different from the img in this topic .
Redownloading and trying again .

Nigeria 's president has suspended his nation 's football team from international competition for two years after a poor showing at the World Cup .
Special presidential adviser Ima Niboro told reporters the decision by Goodluck Jonathan will " enable Nigeria to reorganise its football " .
The Nigerian Football Federation is to be dissolved and an interim board appointed , the BBC understands .
Nigeria were knocked out in the group stages without winning a game .
Niboro said : " President Goodluck Jonathan has directed that Nigeria withdraws from international competition for two years to enable the country to put its house in order .
PIERS EDWARD'S BLOG
The Nigerian fans who 've long bemoaned their federation 's failures probably do n't know whether to laugh or cry ...
" This directive became necessary following Nigeria 's poor performance in the ongoing World Cup . "
The president also plans an audit of the country 's World Cup organising committee .
" If any financial misappropriation is discovered , all officials responsible will be held accountable , " Niboro added .
The NFF released a statement apologising to " all football - loving Nigerians " for the country 's early exit from South Africa .
" No previous board has qualified Nigeria for all major tournaments internationally , " the statement read , adding that officials wanted Swedish coach Lars Lagerbeck to remain at the helm .
Rotimi Amaechi , head of a special presidential task force on the World Cup campaign , said Nigeria would write to football 's world governing body Fifa to explain its decision .
" We went to the World Cup and found all sorts of problems and we felt we should sit back and look inward , " Amaechi told reporters .
Under Fifa rules , government interference with national teams is strictly forbidden .
" At the time of writing , we have no official information on this matter , " a Fifa statement read .
Fifa 's position regarding political interference in football is well known .
Our statutes do not allow for any political interference
Fifa statement " However , in general , Fifa 's position regarding political interference in football is well known .
Our statutes do not allow for any political interference . "
Nigeria risks their national and club teams , plus referees , being banned from all international competitions - and their officials would not be allowed to attend meetings or events .
Nigeria were set to begin their bid to qualify for the 2012 African Nations Cup finals in September against Madagascar .

A UN spokesman says assailants have vandalized a UN summer camp for children in Gaza .
It 's the second such attack in as many months .
Hamas has launched an investigation into the previous incident .
Elements in the Gaza Strip told
Ynet that under the current situation only Hamas armed personnel have the ability to carry out such attacks .
There was no claim of responsibility .
However , Islamic extremists have accused the main UN aid agency of corrupting Gaza 's youth with its summer program of games , sports and human rights lessons for some 250,000 children .
The UN's main competitor is the Islamic militant Hamas , which operates camps for some 100,000 children and offers lessons on Islam and military - style marching .
Local UN spokesman Adnan Abu Hasna says vandals broke into a camp site in central Gaza early Monday .
He says they burned down tents and damaged facilities , but gave no further details .

Image caption Ms Berenson 's affiliation with the MRTA has been disputed by her parents
Lori Berenson , an American citizen who has served 15 years in a Peruvian prison for aiding leftist rebels , has been freed on parole .
Ms Berenson , 40 , was arrested in 1995 for her alleged role in a plot to attack the Peruvian Congress .
A military court found her guilty of collaborating with the left - wing Tupac Amaru rebel group and sentenced her to life imprisonment , later reduced to 20 years in prison .
She has always denied the charges .
The judge ordered her to stay in Peru for five years in order to serve out the remaining years of her sentence on conditional release .
The daughter of university professors , Ms Berenson broke off her studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston to travel to Central and South America .
' Kidnap plot '
During her travels , she is believed to have made contact with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement , or MRTA , a Marxist rebel group active in Peru in the 1980s and 1990s .
Tupac Amaru guerrillas became notorious for taking more than 70 people hostage in the Japanese ambassador 's residence in Lima in 1996 and holding them for 126 days .
Ms Berenson was arrested after she gained access to the Peruvian Congress on false journalist credentials alongside the wife of MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa .
TIMELINE 1995 : Arrested
1996 : Military trial , jailed for life
2000 : Conviction overturned , civil retrial ordered
2001 : Convicted and sentenced to 20 years
2002 Supreme Court upholds sentence
2010 : Freed on parole
Military prosecutors accused her of gathering information for a rebel plot to kidnap members of Congress and exchange them for imprisoned rebel leaders .
Her original life sentence was reviewed by a civil court in 2001 .
She was convicted on the lesser charges of terrorist collaboration and her sentence reduced to 20 years .
In 2003 , Ms Berenson married fellow prisoner Anibal Apari , who was serving 13 years for his affiliation to the same rebel group .
She gave birth to their son a year ago .
Mr Apari is also her lawyer .
Her parents have been fighting for her release since her arrest and have always maintained her innocence .

Of all the measures in last week 's budget that undermined the government 's bare - faced claim to " fairness " , the paring of unemployment benefit has to be the meanest cut of all .
Jobseeker 's allowance , to which unknowable crowds of people will be condemned if George Osborne 's 25 % public expenditure cuts are implemented , is already a pittance , impossible to live on .
People who have lost their jobs are shocked , when forced to sign on , to discover they are expected to eat , pay their bills , clothe themselves and get around – including for job interviews – on just £ 64.45 a week if they are over 25 .
For those under 25 , weekly subsistence must be attained on just £ 51.85 .
Osborne 's announcement that the rate at which benefits rise will decrease , by linking them to the consumer price index ( CPI ) rather than , as currently , the retail prices index ( RPI ) , was actually set out by the Treasury under the heading " Fairness " .
On current figures , with the RPI at 5.1 % , and the CPI at 3.4 % , jobseeker 's allowance was due to rise next year , to £ 67.87 a week for the over 25s , and a princely £ 53.77 for those under 25 .
Instead , the figures will be , respectively , £ 67.22 and £ 53.25 .
The loss is 65 p a week for the over - 25s , and 52 p per week for the under 25s .
Those pennies all add up , as the government itself understands , calculating that this flick of the scythe across the benefit system will save it £ 1.17bn in 2011 - 12 , and almost £ 6bn by 2014 - 15 .
Over a year , somebody unemployed over 25 will lose £ 33.80 , while the under - 25s will each be £ 27.04 worse off .
Before the election , I wrote that this poverty level of unemployment benefit , and the cruelty of a system that allows people to earn just £ 5 in part - time work before additional earnings reduce the benefit pound for pound , was a scandal no party was prepared to address .
Donald Hirsch , author of a Joseph Rowntree Foundation report on the minimum needed for an acceptable standard of living – £ 13,900 last year , he found , way above jobseeker 's allowance penury – said : " Everybody knows you cannot survive on that level of benefit . "
I lamented that no party was prepared to raise unemployment benefit above the punitive , as governments , despite economic volatility and the cuts they themselves impose , continue to present jobless people as shirkers rather than desperately , temporarily , unfortunate .
Yet still , nobody predicted that this Conservative - Liberal Democrat government would actually cut such meagre benefits in real terms .
The difference between the indices is that the RPI includes house prices , the CPI does not .
The government 's rationale for this nasty cut is that most unemployed people do not own their own house .
So the change , according to the Treasury , " provides a fairer reflection of benefit claimants ' experiences " .
With this cut , and that almost sadistic misuse of the word " fair " , the always ludicrous claim by Osborne and David Cameron , sons , both , of multimillionaires , that " we are all in this together " , has irretrievably fallen away .
Joss Whedon's Serenity franchise is returning to comics this summer with a one - shot titled Float Out .
Written by comedian / actor Patton Oswalt and drawn by Patric Reynolds , the book consists of three shorts taking a look back at the life of pilot Hoban " Wash " Washburne .
" It 's a eulogy , I think .
Three of Wash 's friends , who all flew with him at one time or another , are about to christen a new ship but find themselves at a loss for words when they try to dedicate it to him , " Reynolds told Newsarama .
" After each story is shared , one common theme materialises - that Wash took care of his friends .
No matter how much he grated on them or how much danger he had to put them through , he always put them above anything else . "
The Serenity saga spans the television show Firefly , one feature - length movie and several comics series from Dark Horse .

The warming that was n’t
The official archivist of New Zealand ’s climate records , the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ( NIWA ) , offers top billing to its 147 - year - old national mean temperature series ( the “ NIWA Seven- station Series ” or NSS ) .
This series shows that New Zealand experienced a twentieth - century warming trend of 0.92°C .
The official temperature record is wrong .
The instrumental raw data correctly show that New Zealand average temperatures have remained remarkably steady at 12.6 °C +/- 0.5 °C for a century and a half .
NIWA ’s doctoring of that data is indefensible .
The NSS is the outcome of a subjective data series produced by a single Government scientist , whose work has never been peer - reviewed or subjected to proper quality checking .
It was smuggled into the official archive without any formal process .
It is undocumented and sans metadata , and it could not be defended in any court of law .
Yet the full line - up of NIWA climate scientists has gone to extraordinary lengths to support this falsified warming and to fiercely attack its critics .
For nearly 15 years , the 20th - century warming trend of 0.92 °C derived from the NSS has been at the centre of NIWA official advice to all tiers of New Zealand Government – Central , Regional and Local .
It informs the NIWA climate model .
It is used in sworn expert testimony in Environment Court hearings .
Its dramatic graph graces the front page of NIWA ’s printed brochures and its website .
Internationally , the NSS 0.92 °C trend is a foundation stone for the Australia - New Zealand Chapter in the IPCC ’s Third and Fourth Assessment Reports .
In 1994 , it was submitted to HadleyCRUT , so as to influence the vast expanses of the South Pacific in the calculation of globally - averaged temperatures .
The Minister of Research Science and Technology , the Hon Dr Wayne Mapp , has finally become alarmed at the murky provenance of the NSS .
The Government has directed and funded a 6 - month project to produce a new national temperature record , with published data and transparent processes .
The replacement record is to be the subject of a scientific paper , which is to be peer - reviewed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology .
Hon Rodney Hide , a climate sceptic who is a Minister in the current Government and leader of the junior coalition partner , the ACT Party , has called upon his ministerial colleagues to formally repudiate the NSS and to withdraw all publications and formal papers which are based on the spurious warming trend of 0.92°C .
The Government has not yet responded to this challenge .
New Zealand is a small country , with a strong tradition of open Government , and is not an easy place to keep secrets .
The acceptance of the NSS for so long offers evidence of the dictum : “ you can fool all of the people some of the time . . ”
But if that can happen in New Zealand , how much greater is the probability that similar shenanigans could be happening in larger , more complex , jurisdictions ?
BACKGROUND
The New Zealand Meteorological Service , with its forebears , has been measuring and recording our weather since 1861 .
In 1992 , it published a booklet containing a detailed history of all its weather stations , along with 140 years of climate data .
In that year , NIWA came into being and has now published most of the Met Service data online .
In 2007 , the then Prime Minister announced her party ’s intention that New Zealand should lead the world in fighting climate change , and aim to be the world ’s first carbon - neutral country by 2025 .
Earlier in 2007 , NIWA produced a web page , followed by a printed brochure , with a graph showing that New Zealand had already warmed by an amount far in excess of global averages .
The web page claimed a temperature increase of 1.1C during the 144 years of Met Service records , and a 0.92 °C trend during the 20th century .
These are remarkable claims .
They came out of the blue and do not accord with any written histories , or the personal impressions of our older generations .
They do n’t square with “ hottest day ” records held in provinces and city archives .
They were not accompanied by big changes in rainfall or winds or sea levels .
In these claims , NIWA is a very lonely orphan .
Global warming during the 20th Century was 0.6C , with a margin of error of +/-0.2C .
The Southern Hemisphere warming was less than half that level .
But New Zealand warming , according to NIWA , was almost twice the global average – and with no error margins mentioned .
Referring to the NIWA web page , one finds that this major warming trend is the product of a single study involving only 7 temperature stations – out of the 238 stations which currently report to NIWA .
In response to a request under the Official information Act , NIWA has disclosed that this study was undertaken as part of a student ’s thesis some 30 years ago .
NIWA has no record of how the NSS came to be in their computers .
The only reasonable inference is that the student himself , one Jim Salinger , must have added it when he became NIWA ’s Principal Scientist many years later .
How do we know the NSS is wrong ?
EXTERNAL REASONS
First , we know what New Zealand ’s average temperature was in 1867 .
The predecessor of the Royal Society of New Zealand ( The New Zealand Institute ) made a formal minute in 1868 of :
“ Tables , which form the most reliable data for judging of the Climate of New Zealand , are extracted
from the Reports of the Inspector of Meteorological Stations , for 1867 ” .
The mean annual temperature was 55.6 F – the equivalent of 13.1C .
Now consider this extract from NIWA ’s “ Climate Summary for 2005 ” :
The national average temperature of 13.1 °C made 2005 the fourth warmest year nationally since reliable records commenced in the 1860s .
No change whatever in 138 years !
In fact , if 2005 was warmer than most 21st century years , New Zealand has obviously experienced some cooling during the past century or so .
Secondly , the University of California Libraries has a booklet “ Climate and Meteorology of New Zealand ” prepared by Lt - Colonel DC Bates for the “ New Zealand Official Year Book 1920 ” ( also available on the web ) .
This sets out the mean temperature records for the seven- station series over the 56 - year period from 1863 to 1919 – showing the average over that period as being 12.67C .
The author , who was the Dominion Meteorologist , claims that “ Wellington , the Capital City , has a mean climate for the whole Dominion ” .
Wellingtonʼs mean temperature over the period 1863 - 1919 was 12.94C .
The NSS graph directly contradicts this official contemporary record .
Thirdly , the there are the Met Service records themselves .
Their data have been downloaded and graphed in a document by the New Zealand Science Coalition entitled “ Are We Feeling Warmer Yet ? ”
Some excerpts from that document :
“ Straight away you can see there ’s no slope — either up or down .
The temperatures are remarkably constant way back to the 1850s .
Of course , the temperature still varies from year to year , but the trend stays level — statistically insignificant at 0.06 °C per century since 1850 .
Putting these two graphs side by side , you can see huge differences .
What is going on ?
Why does NIWA ’s graph show strong warming , but graphing their own raw data looks completely different ?
Their graph shows warming , but the actual temperature readings show none whatsoever ! ”
It turned out that NIWA had undertaken some internal and undisclosed adjustments to the Met Service data :
“ About half the adjustments actually created a warming trend where none existed ; the other half greatly exaggerated existing warming .
All the adjustments increased or even created a warming trend , with only one ( Dunedin ) going the other way and slightly reducing the original trend .
The shocking truth is that the oldest readings have been cranked way down and later readings artificially lifted to give a false impression of warming .. ”
So the NIWA warming trend was revealed as entirely man-made , and all within NIWA ’s own office .
There was no external peer - review .
To this day there has n’t even been an internal review or any form of quantity control .
There is no documentation .
Since November , the ACT party has been trying to obtain details and / or justification for these extraordinary adjustments – but forty Parliamentary Questions later , we still do n’t have that information .
There is a fourth basis for knowing this SSS is wrong .
NIWA have said that they regularly send their station data to the compilers of the three international temperature series – HGCN , NASA and HadleyCRUT .
These three operate independently and make their own adjustments if they believe any station data is suspect or unrepresentative .
Although HadCRUT has followed some of NIWA ’s adjustments , none of the international series show New Zealand as having warmed substantially prior to 1975 .
In the case of HGCN , whose computer code is publicly available , there is no material New Zealand warming during the last 100 years , except for the increase arising when Campbell Is was dropped from the dataset .
The fifth reason for rejecting this NIWA series is that the Met Service itself had considered but rejected the option of adjusting its own records , at the very time that young Jim Salinger was a student .
Mr Jim Hessell , probably New Zealand ’s most senior meteorologist , found the raw data from many New Zealand stations to be so flawed as to be quite unreliable .
Writing in the New Zealand Journal of Science ( 1980 ) Mr Hessell concludes :
“ A systematic analysis of all New Zealand climatological stations with sufficient length of record reveals that no important change in annual mean temperatures since 1930 has been found at stations where the above factors [ shelter , screenage and urbanization ] are negligible .
Neighbour station comparisons support these findings . ”
When views differ , it is is customary to prefer the judgment of the experienced practitioner over that of the student .
It is certainly sensible to prefer a peer - reviewed paper published in a reputable journal ( which has never been challenged ) over that of an unpublished private document – especially where obvious conflicts of interest arise .
Sixthly , and finally , the notion that New Zealand would suffer global warming at twice the Global rate has been rejected by the Minister of Climate Change Issues himself .
In November , the Hon Dr Nick Smith assured Parliament ( and I quote from Hansard ) :
“ What Dr Wratt has consistently said is that , because New Zealand is surrounded by oceans , all the modelling indicates that the temperature impacts of climate change are most likely to be less for New Zealand than for other parts of the globe . ”
So the NSS claims New Zealand has warmed much more than the global average , while the NIWA climate chief cites the theory that our warming should be one - third less than the global average .
They ca n’t both be right .
If the NSS is right , then not only Nick Smith and David Wratt are wrong .
Mr Jim Hessell is wrong , the 1920 Dominion Meteorologist is wrong , the Royal Society is wrong , HGCN , NASA and HadCRUT are wrong , and the Met Service records are wrong .
So we have six very good external reasons why this SSS should be regarded as wrong , and formally repudiated by the Government .
INTERNAL REASONS – DOCUMENT
Let me turn to internal reasons why the SSS should go – first internal to the document itself , and then internal to NIWA .
The methodology used in the NIWA adjustments allowed the key inputs to be chosen subjectively , so one needs to look at outputs to judge their credibility .
“ By their fruits you shall know them ! ”
The outcomes of the NIWA adjustments are totally implausible :
As previously mentioned , the consequent warming trend is well above the global average for the century , and even further above the Southern Hemisphere average ;
Even greater discrepancies from global movements appear when the record is broken down to its 3 component periods : 1909 - 50,1950 - 75 and 1975 - 2009 ;
The third quarter of the 20th century was a cooling period all over the globe , but the NSS shows the fastest warming in New Zealand history ( 0.24C per decade ) .
According to the Schedule of Adjustments tabled by the Minister in February 2010 , the seven stations have been adjusted no less than 34 times .
In a normal unbiased series , one might expect that about half of these amendments would be favourable to a warming trend , and half would be unfavourable .
Pre-1950 , 21 movements were negative and only 5 positive ; post - 1950 there were 2 negative and 6 positive movements .
So , by number , 80 % of the NIWA ‘ corrections ’ favoured an upwards trend .
, 80 % of the NIWA ‘ corrections ’ favoured an upwards trend .
Pre -1950 the downward adjustments ( unweighted ) summed to 11.3C whilst 2.7C ( all in Dunedin ) went the other way .
So , by temperature , 80 % of the NIWA ‘ corrections ’ were trend - favourable .
, 80 % of the NIWA ‘ corrections ’ were trend - favourable .
Over the entire series , a total of 515 years were adjusted .
Of these , no less than 467 years contributed to an upward - sloping trend line .
So , by year , 90 % of the NIWA corrections leaned in the same direction .
The ratio of 9 out of 10 adjustments being ‘ helpful to the hypothesis ’ could surely not have occurred in the absence of bias .
These over - the - top outcomes reek of bias and data manipulation , robbing the series of any vestige of scientific plausibility .
INTERNAL REASONS – PROCESS
I will turn now to the internal workings of NIWA .
Consider the following four points :
The SSS is an official national temperature record .
S 17 of the Public Records Act 2005 requires NIWA to “ create and maintain full and accurate records of its affairs , in accordance with normal , prudent business practice ” ;
NIWA is accredited under ISO9002 , which requires that the steps in each process be fully documented .
When the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition made a formal request under the Official Information
Act for either paper or computer records relating to the construction of the SSS , they received NOTHING in response .
In answers to Parliamentary Questions , NIWA was unable to produce any internal records whatever .
Even when they referred to losses of computer data , it was somebody else ’s computer and happened 28 years ago .
How could NIWA defend this graph , or the causative adjustments , in the event of a challenge in any Court proceedings ?
It has no paper trail , and no supporting documents .
NIWA do n’t really know how it got there , and they ca n’t reproduce it or the reasoning behind it .
For that matter , how can they defend using the graph as the basis for advice in Parliamentary proceedings ?
NIWA has no record of any discussion or decision regarding adoption of the seven - station series .
It obviously existed by 1994 , because NIWA sent it to the UK Hadley Centre in that year .
But in 1997 , it is mentioned in a paper published by NIWA employees ( Zheng et al ) as being the property of Dr Salinger personally .
It then burst into the public arena in 2007 , first on NIWA ’s website and then in the printed brochure , at a time when the Climate Group ’s principal scientist was none other than Dr Salinger .
There is no record of Salinger declaring a conflict of interest , or excusing himself from any NIWA process for selecting a national temperature series or an iconic graph .
There is not even any record of a process or a decision .
It was just done .
If this view is correct , the SSS is irretrievably tainted by self - interest , personal bias and abuse of trust – and is wholly illegitimate .
It should never have been used on a government website in the first place and it should now be formally repudiated .
SALINGER
In the face of all these obstacles , why has NIWA persevered with the 30 - year - old Salinger methodology – which they never agreed to adopt in the first place ?
Could it be that Dr Salinger was so well - trusted by his peers and superiors that they could simply accept his bare assurance that all was well ?
Well , no .
He is n’t held in high regard by NIWA :
First , they fired him for his persistent refusal to accept direction , or to follow company policy , or to cease talking to the media .
He appealed to the Employment Court for reinstatement , but NIWA fought that hard for most of last year , and were ultimately successful .
Secondly , when the SSS was criticised in “ Are We Feeling Warmer Yet ” , Dr Wratt did not respond with a Salinger argument .
Instead , he invented a whole web page describing how the Wellington record had been adjusted for altitude changes , and had a Minister table that in the House .
Wratt ’s misleading conduct , which is a serious matter , seems to have been motivated by his distrust of the Salinger method .
Thirdly , NIWA published a new paper called “ The NIWA ‘ Seven - Station ’ Temperature Series ” on 3rd February , written by Dr Brett Mullan , which sets out details of 34 temperature adjustments .
These have been compared with their counterparts in the Salinger thesis and only one adjustment is the same !
This new Schedule of Adjustments does not even pretend to follow the 1981 Salinger precedent – but avoids disclosing that fact .
The NSS has not been retained out of respect for Salinger .
The only remaining explanation is that NIWA and the Climate Ministers are attempting to save face rather than confess that they have been running their policies on the basis of bogus data for many years .
CONCLUSION
Piecing together the provenance of the New Zealand historical temperature record has been no easy task .
Much of the detail is set out in the Climate Conversation blog .
It has involved a myriad of investigative methods but the most productive has been the placement of nearly 50 Parliamentary Questions for Written Answer , for which credit must go to John Boscawen MP .
The New Zealand mainstream media , all highly partisan on climate change matters , have evinced little interest in the scandal to date .
Science claims a special place in the trust of the public because of its unswerving adherence to certain objective methodologies , involving transparency , peer review , replicability and honest purpose .
NIWA has forfeited that trust in so many ways .

You Do n’t Want To Take Your Telstra 3G iPad Overseas …
We all know that the telcos rip us off when it comes to global roaming , but if you were hoping that the iPad ’s 3G Micro SIM might be a bit of an exception to the rule , think again .
We ’ve received some ( admittedly poor quality ) pics of the upcoming Telstra Micro SIM brochure and the pricing for international roaming is absurd .
As you can see from the pic , Telstra will give you a whopping 10 MB for $ 29 .
If 10 MB is n’t quite enough , you can get 60 MB for $ 160 .
Another interesting tidbit from the brochure includes the T&Cs stating that using your pre-paid microSIM for a device other than an iPad may lead to being charged standard pre-paid wireless data charges .

The latest defence surveillance can " pick out " potential insurgents in an image
The camera was already trained on the two insurgents before the people watching the monitors had even spotted them .
As they parked their vehicles and removed a large package from the back , it zoomed in and followed them .
The two men moved across a patch of vegetation that made them trickier to see , so the surveillance monitor automatically switched to thermal imaging and followed them closely as they tried to conceal themselves behind a building .
The suspicious pair were in fact actors .
This was an experiment .
But the imaging forms part of what the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) says will be used by soldiers within five years - a package of surveillance systems that can recognise insurgents or terrorists .
You can't tell who is an insurgent by what they look like , but you can track their behaviour Andrew Seedhouse , Dstl
This high resolution imaging with in - built software to detect and follow the fake insurgents as they planned their covert meeting , was one of the technologies tested by DSTL during what it described as a " cops and robbers " style trial .
DSTL , which develops and tests the latest technologies for the Ministry of Defence , had members of its staff " act out " insurgent - like behaviour , while developers and engineers took on the role of the " good guys " , pursuing and monitoring them .
" You can't tell who is an insurgent by what they look like , but you can track their behaviour , " explained Andrew Seedhouse , chief technologist for sensors and countermeasures at Dstl .
The surveillance equipment tested in the trial ranged from extremely high resolution digital cameras to radar and lasers .
The military twist was that these hi-tech surveillance techniques are being combined with software that can pick out unusual patterns in behaviour - such as two vehicles meeting in a concealed area .
The surveillance , DSTL says , will eventually help to " win the battle " against insurgency .
Eye in the sky
The technology comes from a large collaboration of companies and academic researchers , all of which DSTL brought together in this trial .
" It 's like having the ultimate CCTV system with super - sensors on the ground and flying round in the air , " said Dr Seedhouse .
Most of the equipment tested on the range will take several more years to perfect and be used to monitor real insurgency in the field .
Image caption A high resolution digital camera can be mounted on the nose of a helicopter
But Dr Seedhouse said that DSTL was looking for some " quick wins " that had performed well in the trials and could be used within as little as a few weeks .
One of these could be an incredibly high - resolution camera developed by Canadian company PV Labs .
Whereas most digital cameras are between eight and 15 megapixels , this camera has 128 .
Image caption
The camera captures a 4 km by 4 km field of view
President and CEO Ty Shattuck explained that the camera was fitted into a casement that could be mounted on the nose of a helicopter .
" It captures a 4 km by 4 km image .
Because it 's so large there 's very little chance that an area of interest will disappear from your field of view , " said Mr Shattuck .
" The system captures two frames per second meaning that if something happens - if a bomb goes off in a vehicle perhaps - we can rewind it and retrace where that vehicle came from "
Needle in a haystack
Some of the surveillance systems can see beyond the scope of cameras .
One technology that BAE Systems trialled , known as a " hyperspectral camera " , is able to analyse colour - to distinguish a camouflaged vehicle from the vegetation it is concealed within .
Image caption Hyperspectral imaging can pick out a green tank from green trees
Gary Bishop from BAE 's Advanced Technology Centre in Bristol told BBC News : " You see things with your eyes in three wavelengths , the hyperspectral camera gives you information in 10 . "
The system measures each wavelength of light being reflected by an object - it can see the specific type of green that is produced by chlorophyll in plants , and distinguish that from the green of paint or dye .
" It can tell a man - made object from vegetation , " said Mr Bishop .
" You can think of it as looking through a haystack to see the needle . "
Image caption " Polarimetric " imaging interprets objects by their shape
Another approach analyses the shapes of objects to pick out potential threats .
A tiny UK technology company called Eosphere has designed a system that uses differently polarised light waves - waves travelling in different directions - to identify objects by their geometry .
The company plans to combine this approach with software that would know the shape of a potential threat .
A rocket launcher , for example , is a metal tube and with a very characteristic geometry , so it would scatter light polarised in one direction more than another , and the system would highlight it .
Homing in
The detection of a potential threat is all about separating unusual from " normal " patterns of activity - spotting , for example , those two cars that appear to be heading for a covert meeting spot .
To tap in to this , developers are combining pattern recognition software with their imaging techniques to automatically " zoom in " on unusual behaviour .
Defence electronics company Selex Galileo used the DSTL trials to test a system that combines a type of radar with pattern recognition .
Iain Clark , chief engineer at the company , explained that this captured a wide view but was then able to zoom in on potential insurgents .
" So if it sees two cars parked where there is n't normally any activity , it will detect this anomalous behaviour , " he said .
" And if you 're still looking at [ those cars ] when it gets dark , you can switch to a thermal image . "
Mr Clark said the system was getting " very close to being fully automated " - choosing exactly what to zoom in on , and which type of imaging would produce the clearest picture .
" At the moment we 're aiming to semi-automate it , so that it separates the wheat from the chaff , " he said .
Image caption Laser imaging can be used to accurately measure the distance to targets
The same company has also developed an imaging system that can measure the exact distance and dimensions of a potential target .
" You ping a laser pulse off a target , " explained Mr Clark , " and because you can control the length of the laser pulse , you can actually look at slices out in space . "
BAE is working with Austrian company Airborne Technologies to tailor the equipment so it can be fitted to aircraft .
All of these systems combined , Dr Seedhouse said , use the insurgents ' activities against them .
He said : " We will get to the point where we can prevent them from hiding in the background noise and where they become a target . "

Microsoft and Red Hat , Linux and Windows are n't supposed to get along right ?
But they do , and apparently Microsoft and Red Hat are now getting along very well too .
During a Q&A session during Red Hat 's Analyst Day this week , Red Hat revealed that its relationship with Microsoft is n't as stormy as it once was .
" That relationship with Microsoft , believe it or not , is pretty strong .
It was pushed by our customer base , " Paul Cormier executive vice president and president , products and technologies at Red Hat said during the meeting .
" Our customer base came to us and say ' look we have two operating systems running the datacenter , RHEL and Windows and you guys need to work together ' so we got together . "

Is America too big ?
While visiting one of my favorite blogs , I ran across a post by John Carey at Conservative Hideout titled “ A Spoonful of Federalism ” which reminded me of a post that I had written awhile ago .
In “ A Spoonful of Federalism , ” John alluded to the fact that the federal government has been able to use the 17th amendment– which changed the way senators were chosen from being appointed by the state legislatures to being directly elected by the people– to diminish the power of the states and increase the power of the federal government .
In my post from last year– Is America too big ? –
I made the argument that America has been slowly changing from the republic that the founders envisioned , into a democracy – a form of government that the founders feared almost as much as monarchy , and that this was partly due to the 17th amendment .
Our premises are slightly different , but John ’s post made me revisit mine , and I have decided to re-post it today with a few slight revisions .
At the end of this post I have decided to include the video that John used in his post , it is Fred Thompson talking about classic federalism .
So without further ado :
Is America too big ?
That is a question that has lingered in my mind for about a year now .
When I ask the question I am not asking if America is too big in terms of influence around the world , and I am not asking if America is too powerful , but rather I am asking if America is too big physically , have we outgrown our government ?
I am talking about whether the federal government can properly and effectively govern a population of this size .
The country was much smaller when our form of government was instituted and surely while the founders probably believed that America would consist of most of North America before too long , could they have possibly understood how big America would turn out ?
Surely Thomas Jefferson understood that America would someday extend from sea to sea as he broke with his anti-federalist beliefs ( anti-federalist as redefined in a brilliant political move by Alexander Hamilton , James Monroe , John Jay , and other proponents of the constitution during the constitutional debates while trying to gain support for a national government– anti-nationalist would probably be more accurate , as Thomas Jefferson would probably be considered a federalist under the classic definition of federalism ) as president in order to more than double the size of the country with the Louisiana purchase .
An act that he believed exceeded his authority as president and he believed was unconstitutional , but an offer too good to pass up .
This is a topic that I find myself extremely conflicted on .
While I consider myself a constitutionalist and an originalist , I also consider myself a states rights advocate , these two ideals at times are at odds with each other .
I have thought about writing this post many times in the past and have actually started it twice only to abandon the post , but now I am going to attempt to write it once again .
There is one form of government that many of the founders feared almost as much as monarchy and that was democracy ( I will explain below ) , that is why our original form of government after the revolution was a confederacy of states with really no federal government to speak of .
When it became obvious to all that the confederacy was doomed to fail , it was also realized that a more powerful form of a central government was needed .
The founders believed that a democracy was a good form of government for small nations ( or states ) but not so good when it came to a nation of bigger proportions .
How could a large nation govern in the best interest of all its people across the nation ?
What might be considered a good idea for California residents may not be what is best for Texas residents , what is right for Wisconsin residents may not be what is best for New Hampshire residents and so on .
This is why the founders took great pains to set up a republic during the constitutional convention and not a democracy .
The founders feared a nation where 51 Americans out of every 100 could force their beliefs on the other 49 Americans .
They considered this a different form of tyranny– the tyranny of the majority – but tyranny nonetheless .
Many of the founders , Thomas Jefferson included , feared a strong central government .
The delegates to the constitutional convention went to great extents to limit the federal government and provide checks and balances .
The founders took great pains to ensure during the constitutional convention that the states would maintain influence .
Until the 17th amendment was ratified in 1913 , United States senators were chosen by the different states , not elected by the people .
While the representatives were chosen directly by the people to represent them , the senators were chosen by the states to represent the state ’s best interests .
Because the state officials were elected by the voters , and they subsequently chose the senators , the people indirectly elected the senators .
This gave the states a voice in congress , while the people ’s voice was heard from the representatives .
After the 17th amendment was ratified the people became more represented by the senators than did the individual states .
The people now directly elected the senators thereby weakening the influence that the individual states had , leading to a more nationalized form of government .
I wonder if we would have been better off if the 17th amendment had never been ratified .
It sometimes seems to me as if the 17th amendment may have done more to change the form of government from the republican model to the democratic model– a model that many founders feared – than anything else .
However , having the states choose the senators probably meant that the states would have too much influence over the people of their states .
Therefor , giving this power to the people under this premise could not have been a bad idea .
Again , I am conflicted , there must other reasons why the people have lost control of the government .
This brings me back around to my belief that the federal government has grown bigger than many of the founders had hoped , and even bigger than many of them had feared could happen .
From George Washington– whose opponents claimed had too much power and was trampling the constitution– to John Adams ; who signed the Alien and Sedition act , and jailed people for simply speaking out against the federal government ( a clear violation of the constitution ) ; to Abraham Lincoln , who expanded government control and jailed his opponents ; to Woodrow Wilson and FDR , both of whom grew the federal government and reached a level of government intervention never before seen or dreamed of by the founders ; to Teddy Roosevelt who went after private businesses , virtually every president has grown the influence of the federal government .
Both sides of the aisle , for different reasons , have seen fit to expand the government to fit their agenda .
Some of these presidents may have been justified and morally correct to do what they did , but in the end they expanded the influence of the federal government and diminished the rights of the individual states .
When is the last time that the government has actually gotten smaller ?
It seems that over the years , as the federal government has expanded , we have drifted away from a representative republican form of government , to more of a democracy .
This does n’t seem to have happened because of the constitution , but in spite of it .
That is how I am able to balance my two beliefs ; the first being my belief as a constitutional originalist and the second ; my belief in states rights .
It is n’t that the constitution has failed us as a founding document , it is that the federal government has failed us in following the constitution .
So , to answer my original question , has America become too big ?
I do n’t think that America as a country has become too big but rather America the government has become too big .
As the country grew , the answer was not to expand the role of the federal government , but rather to make sure that people were better represented at the local ( state ) level .
It is much easier to govern the people at a local level than a national level , the founders understood this , and we need to return to this .
If more power was returned to the local level , the people would have more power to control the government which is supposed to work for them .
This is what the founders intended , and this is what is vital to the American form of government , a republican form of government .
When the constitutional convention was over , a woman asked Benjamin Franklin what they had given us , he famously replied , ” a republic if you can keep it . ”
I am afraid that we have lost it .
Today ’s post is a “ guest ” post — the first for this blog .
It ’s written by Don Mead , new friend of mine who I met through this blog .
Getting to know Don and exchanging ideas about the Buddhism , I have come to appreciate Don ’s insights , his intellect , and his dry humor .
Don has studied and practiced Buddhism most of his life .
He has a very strong Tibetan and Zen background , and when I read his essay on the Ninth Zen Precept , I wanted to share it with others .
When I asked him about this , he said , sure , he felt he had something to share , “ but I am not looking for people to agree with me , but rather to think for themselves . ”
In that typical Zen spirit , I offer you this friend ’s essay .
I was greatly helped by it , and I hope you will be too .
The Ninth Zen Precept — I keep my mind calm and at peace .
I do not indulge in anger .
I am sadly aware that we tend to see in others what we refuse to acknowledge in ourselves .
Therefore what follows must be understood in that light .
It appears that throughout human history not one person has ever been angry without feeling that there was something or someone outside of the person who made the anger happen .
Of course , none of this is true .
Nonetheless , this feeling of justification allows the person to feel that somehow the pure justice of the situation allows one to indulge in the anger without being subject to the laws of cause and effect .
It is important to note that in Zen , anger is one of the Five Poisons , the other four being greed , ignorance , pride , and jealousy .
As such , anger is a great cause of unnecessary suffering to both the individual who indulges in it and others .
Is n’t it amazing that anyone could feel that they could drink poison without being affected by it , just because they felt that they were justified in doing so ?
No One Can Make Us Angry
So let ’s really get to the point .
No one or no -thing can make another person angry !
It simply just is not possible !
Perhaps , someone might serve as a catalyst to bring the anger that was already there to the surface .
Of course , when this happens , we should be grateful , for it gives us a chance to confront our own anger and hatred ( yes they do appear to go together ) head - on .
We need to understand that no matter how loving and kind that we may appear on the surface , there is bubbling underneath this “ poisonous ” anger that infects even our purest actions .
The Ninth Precept does not ask us to be free of anger , but rather urges us not to indulge in it .
I , myself , have witnessed folks who are still indulging in anger that is over 15 years old !
Now let us look for a moment at anger itself .
It seems that anger is really a desire to murder someone or something outside of one ’s self .
Now before you say that I am being a bit overboard here , let ’s look at the situation .
I am angry with someone — let ’s say you .
So I come to you and say something like , “ It is your fault that I am angry .
If only you did not do this or say that . ”
You see , my anger wants you to not be and do what you are being and doing , but rather wants you to be and do what pleases me .
In order words , my anger wants the “ you ” that exists to stop existing , and in its place I want you become and do something that pleases me .
Now I suppose that I could say something like , what pleases me is what is good for you .
But that excuse has been used so much over the course of human history that it appears that it should be worn out by now .
“ Ah , young lady , you are not who I think you should be , so we are going to burn you at the stake .
It ’s all for your own good , ya know . ”
And how many battered mates and children have heard the classic , “ I did n’t want to hit you , it just that you made me so mad ? ”
So from this point of view , we can say that the Ninth Precept is another facet of the First Precept — do not kill ; affirm life .
The Buddha ’s Great Insight
In the first moments following Lord Buddha ’s enlightenment , it is said that he saw that all living beings were no different than him , in that they were all endowed with Buddha Nature .
And His last words just before
His death were to remind us that we are the light itself , and that we should only trust ourselves and practice the Dharma .
If we can look beyond our anger and hatred of the world , we can clearly see that all living beings are not here to fulfill our desires .
They are here to become what they are — just like us .
If we are truly going to walk in the path of the Buddhas , we have to accept responsibility for ourselves .
No one makes me angry .
No one is responsible for my emotional well being .
Nobody has to change one atom of his or her being to please me .
No one owes me anything !
As I said , we are not here to fulfill each other ’s desires , but I do believe that we are here to love and care for each other .
We feed the hungry because the hungry need to be fed .
We love our children because they need to be loved .
We see what needs to be done and we do our best to do it .
But we do not blame others for our own weaknesses and character faults .
At the same time , the Ninth Precept seems to tell us that we need to find a way to weaken anger ’s hold on us .
We need to deal with anger in the same non-violent manner that we use to deal with ego , that is , boycott !
Starve the son of a bitch to death !
We train ourselves to avoid those subjects that feed our anger .
If a person ’s presence causes us to be angry , then we should , as best as we are able , for a while , avoid that person and if we are able , we might consider avoiding even the thought of that person .
The Great Test of Anger — Self - Righteousness
But , one might say , “ My anger is Vajra ( spiritual ) anger .
There is no hate in it .
My anger works for the good of all sentient beings . ”
Luckily for us , there is a very easy test to check if our anger is ego - centric or not .
If there is even the slightest bit of self - righteousness , then we , are 100 % in the wrong .
In fact , I would go so far to say that self - righteousness is the Ninth Precept ’s best friend .
It is so easy to recognize in ourselves that all excuses to indulge our anger are washed away .
But we need to examine ourselves honestly .
“ Do we , in fact , like the energy of anger ? ”
Another self question might also help .
Ask yourself , “ From the deepest darkest corner of my heart , what do I really want for the object of my anger ? ”
These are the type of questions that are so important , that there is absolutely no room for even the smallest amount of self - deception .
So from the bottom of my heart , to all who read this , be happy and healthy , and , of course , . . .
Be kind to yourself .

DESCRIBED here as “ the grand wizard of classic rock ” Black Sabbath ’s Ronnie James Dio has died this week at the age of 67 of stomach cancer – and it is doubtful whether anyone has taken greater delight in his passing than a born - again Christian nutcase who calls herself SisterSunnshine .
Never was a moniker less apt .
There ’s nothing at all sunny about this loathsome female ’s disposition .
In fact , if she were to bite into a lemon , the lemon would pull a face .
On learning of Dio ’s death , the grim , thin - lipped zealot made a video in a moving car – go figure – which she posted on YouTube .
In it she says :
I just got the news that Ronnie James Dio has just arrived in Hell
She adds :
He was lost , he was wicked .
He glorified evil , he glorified the Devil .
He glorified basically demonsâ€ ¦all kinds of evil wickedness .
One of the things was the sign of the Devil , the goat ’s horns and all that was one of his signs that he made frequently during his concerts , and all of his fans , you know , made during the concerts and everything like that .
Here ’s more of her garbage :
You know , I firmly believe that artists that make that kind of music and find that kind of fame basically sell their soul to Satan in return for that fameâ€
¦You buy that ticket on that train and your ticket gets punched eventually , and his ticket was punched today â€ ¦
If you ’re a fan of Ronnie James Dio , guess what ?
If you ’re worshipping him , you ’re worshipping the Devil .
And guess where he is todayâ€ ¦he ain’t in a happy place .

Good news for anyone that uses an Android ( or Linux ) cell phone , mobile device or PC .
Tuxera has released its long - awaited specification that makes the new SDXC memory cards compatible with Android or other Linux flavors .
SDXC includes at its heart Microsoft 's exFAT specification , a big win for Microsoft because every device manufacturer that wants to create SDXC cards -- or build technology that taps into them -- has to pay Microsoft royalties .
The TomTom / Microsoft case was , at its heart , about the issue of file technologies royalties ( not as much about Microsoft hammering on Linux -- though that was a bonus for Microsoft ) .
TomTom used a file system that Microsoft owned with patent claims , and Microsoft filed a rare patent infringement case to protect its file system turf .
( Microsoft is typically the victim of patent infringement suits , not the perpetrator ) .
While TomTom 's problems were about Microsoft 's previous FAT technology , not exFAT , SDXC was hung under the same cloud .
Indeed , Microsoft already announced a similar licensing agreement with Panasonic for exFAT , and the older technology FAT LFN , to cover its use of them in flash - enabled devices .
About a year ago , Tuxera stepped up to the plate to negotiate with Microsoft to create an SDXC specification for Android / Linux , and today that driver arrived .
This means that users of those operating systems can swap the latest memory cards from their cameras , music players and whatnot , and stick them into their Android PCs , phones or tablets and so on .
Tuxera already had a good relationship with Microsoft , so it was perhaps a natural fit that it be the one to step up and do this for Android / Linux device makers .
Now , it may pain the Linux development community to know that because the standard uses exFAT , Microsoft makes royalties on every SDXC device made .
This is certainly contrary to the free software movement 's way , but it is how business has been done in the computer industry for decades .
Standards bodies have a doctrine called Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing ( RAND ) .
Technology companies eagerly participate in standards bodies and contribute their proprietary technology to the standard , if they , in exchange , agree to RAND .
They must license the use of that technology to anyone that wants it to implement the standard .
( Interoperability is the point of standards , after all . )
And the company must agree to license the technology at an extremely low cost to all commers -- say , for example , a few pennies per device .
It adds up to a pretty penny for the technology owner , in this case , Microsoft .
So it is with exFat , Microsoft and SDXC .
Tuxera 's CEO , Mikko Valimaki , who answered a few questions via e-mail from me .
He would n't divulge how much his company paid to Microsoft to create an exFAT SDXC - compatible plan for Android , nor tell me how much hardware makers will be required to pay Microsoft , or even Tuxera .
Here 's the gist :
Me : Did Tuxera license exFAT from Microsoft ?
Mikko Valimaki : Yes .
In summer of 2009 , after one year of discussions .
The agreement covers access to the exFAT specifications , Microsoft ’s source code implementation of exFAT , and testing and verification tools .
Here is the announcement .
Me : Your announcement says that Tuxera ’s exFAT system supports SDXC … do users of SDXC in general and Tuxera ’s SDXC in particularly have to pay Microsoft a licensing fee ?
Mikko Valimaki : SDXC is the SD card standard , while exFAT is the file system within that standard .
Tuxera exFAT , in turn , is an exFAT file system implementation that enables devices to interface with SDXC cards .
Manufacturers that use the Tuxera exFAT system in mobile phones , digital cameras , and other devices require both an exFAT patent agreement from Microsoft and a licensing agreement from Tuxera .
In a few years there will be billions of SDXC cards all over the world ; all using the exFAT file system .
No option .
This is the standard .
Most embedded devices use Linux ( Google 's Android , Intel 's and Nokia 's MeeGo , Samsung 's Bada , etc. ) .
Linux adoption is growing , taking market share from most of the proprietary operating systems .
Basically , Tuxera has assumed a leadership role , through work with Microsoft and the SD Association , in handling billions of consumer electronics devices that will be using SDXC cards in the coming years .
Tuxera exFAT for Android and other Linux systems was a major first .
Me : Can you comment on what that fee is ?
( Typically , patented technology included in a standard has a low fee … a few pennies per implementation to a few dollars …)
MV : Microsoft offers a flexible Intellectual Property ( IP ) licensing program for their exFAT file system .
Please ask Microsoft for details .
Here 's the Tuxera 's press release in full , which offers a few more details ( and a lot more congratulatory speech ) on the Android exFAT driver .
Tuxera exFAT Now Available for Android and Linux First exFAT solution for embedded Linux based on Microsoft documentation Taipei , Taiwan [ COMPUTEX ] - June 1 , 2010 - Tuxera , the leading designer of Windows - compatible file systems for Linux , Mac , and other platforms , today announced the release of Tuxera exFAT for Android and other Linux systems .
Developed using technical documentation provided by Microsoft Corp. , Tuxera exFAT provides outstanding performance and stability , and meets the latest SDXC memory card standards .
" The wait is over .
I am thrilled to tell everyone we now have the world 's first exFAT implementation for Android .
Thanks to our latest innovations and strong relationship with Microsoft , we can guarantee blazingly fast performance for flash drives and energy efficient consumer electronics , " said Mikko Välimäki , Tuxera CEO .
" Tuxera 's exFAT for Android is not just the first to market , but it is also built on a very portable codebase that we will strive to make the de facto standard . "
Tuxera is now forming partnerships with leading hardware , device , and operating system manufacturers to meet the growing demand for high - definition video and other embedded applications .
" exFAT is a modern file system designed to handle very large files , and we are pleased to support Tuxera 's development of an exFAT file system implementation , " said David Kaefer , general manager of Intellectual Property Licensing at Microsoft .
" To provide necessary patent rights , Microsoft will offer a patent agreement that companies can sign if they are building a device that includes the Tuxera exFAT implementation . "
Tuxera is a member of the SD Association where it works together with exFAT host device and card manufacturers to enable a smooth transition from FAT to exFAT file system technology that lifts the device and file size limits for SD cards .
For example , with Tuxera exFAT new SDXC compatible devices can record normal - length , full - HD videos .
Tuxera exFAT has been successfully tested on Android and other versions of Linux .
To request an evaluation version of the product , please contact sales@tuxera.com .
A consumer download version will be released later .

“ Tactically naive ” is the common criticism for any African side which fails , generally regardless of the nature of their defeat or their manager ’s tactical acumen .
Ghana showed at the Africa Nations Cup earlier this year that they are anything but tactically naive .
As if to emphasize what a silly criticism it is , Ghana were then labelled boring and defensive for daring to set out in a fashion that might maximise their chances of victory .
It nearly was an overall victory – they were defeated in the final by an Egpyt side which did n’t qualify for this World Cup , but overall Ghana emerged from the tournament with their reputation enhanced more than any other side , especially after Michael Essien became injured against the Ivory Coast .
They will be forced to cope without him for this tournament too .
Captain and unquestionably the most talented player , Essien ’s absence is huge .
The positive is that central midfield is an area of the pitch Ghana are well - stocked in , and neither their formation or system will have to significantly change in response to his injury .
The starting XI
They will set out with a lone striker , Asamoah Gyan , a player better at running the channels than finding the net .
He is a good footballer who will cause sides problems , but his lack of goals are part of the reason Ghana are seen as slightly boring .
It does n’t help , either , that they often play with only one winger – generally on the right , where the small , tricky Andre Ayew ( the son of the legendary Abedi Pele ) will be stationed , providing the most direct attacking threat from midfield .
They could play Kwadwo Asamoah on the left to offer a threat from both sides , but it is more likely they will play an off - centre diamond of four physical central midfielders .
Inter ’s Sulley Muntari will start on the left - hand side , offering technical quality and plenty of running , but relatively little creativity for a player with a big attacking responsibility .
The pattern is repeated in the centre where Stephen Appiah plays more advanced than he has for much of his club career , fitting a pattern at this tournament of African central midfielders pushed forward into unorthodox playmaker roles .
Anthony Annan is a classic holding player in front of the defence , and the final central midfielder is a Boateng – Derek , not Kevin - Prince – who provides a box - to - box presence .
It ’s hard to imagine a European or South American side playing with four such similar central midfielders in one side , but Ghana start as the underdogs in a tough group , and will look to physically impose themselves in the centre of the pitch .
The back four are defensive - minded with the full - backs rarely getting themselves into attacking positions .
John Paintstil will hope to start on the left of the defence , though he faces competition from Lee Addy – a relative unknown , as the only outfield player who plays club football in his home country .
Conclusion
Ghana were more likely to make an impact on the world with their results rather than their playing style , but their place in a tough group and the loss of Essien makes it hard to see them progressing .
Nevertheless , Milovan Rajevac ’s side are well - organised and will be difficult to beat – the same could be said of their opening day opponents Serbia , and Group D could turn out to be very low - scoring .

( NewsTarget ) Constipation is not a very pleasant subject , but for many people it is an even more uncomfortable condition .
The most common symptoms of constipation are irregularity or difficulty in elimination of hard fecal matter .
With the use of a healthy diet and natural remedies , constipation can usually be beaten and avoided .
Here are some tips on naturally relieving and avoiding constipation .
One tried and true natural laxative is prune juice .
Start with one cup of prune juice and if you do not get the desired results , drink more .
The best form of prune juice is unfiltered juice which still contains much of the natural fiber .
You can also eat prunes and raisins which may do the trick as well .
Prunes and prune juice work faster on an empty stomach .
If you do n't like prunes , try dried figs .
Dried figs contain soluble and insoluble fiber , both of which flush out your intestines .
Five figs supply at least 20 percent of your daily fiber requirement , more than almost any other fruit .
Nibble on four or five figs at the first sign of constipation and drink at least one glass of water .
If needed , eat a couple more every three hours until you get results .
Bale fruit may be the best laxative of all fruits .
It cleans and tones the intestines and relieves constipation .
Slippery elm forms a slick mucilage that acts as a stool softener and helps make bowel movements easier .
The combination of the properties of the cellulose , sugar , and organic acid in grapes make them a laxative food .
One should take at least 350 gm of this fruit daily to achieve the desired results .
For maximum results , find seeded grapes and consume the entire grape , seeds and all .
Watermelons also have a laxative effect , especially when consumed in large quantities .
As an added benefit , watermelons help flush and prevent kidney stones .
Raw honey is a mild natural laxative .
You can supercharge it , and many other natural laxative remedies , by adding a couple of tablespoons of blackstrap molasses .
One home remedy for constipation can be made with tomato juice , carrot juice and sauerkraut juice .
Mix one cup tomato or vegetable juice , 1/4 cup carrot juice and 1/2 cup sauerkraut juice .
Pour this over ice .
You may add pepper sauce ( such as sauces made from cayenne pepper ) for a spicier drink .
Other Tips and Suggestions :* Increase your fiber intake by switching from refined foods to less - refined foods whenever possible .
One excellent grain choice is barley .*
Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables .
Apples , ripe bananas , oranges , guava , pears and rhubarb all contain plenty of fiber and are natural laxatives .
Likewise , beans , peas , cabbage and spinach are vegetables that help prevent and relieve constipation . *
Exercise boosts your fitness level and promotes regularity .
When you are active , so are your bowels -- and the more sedentary you are , the more slowly your bowels move . *
Many prescription and over - the - counter medications can cause constipation .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medications could be causing your constipation *
Consuming at least eight glasses of water a day not only improves your general health , but also helps moisten the intestines so that the bowels move easily . *
Coffee often causes one to have a bowel movement .*
One tablespoon of olive oil in the morning will stimulate digestion and lubricate mucous membranes .*
Constipation in toddlers , infants and older children may be relieved by giving bran cereal .

Rich Hickey is working on primitive support in the prim branch .
As of now , one can write :
( defn ^:static fib ^long [ ^long n ] ( if ( >= ( long 1 ) n ) ( long 1 ) ( + ( fib ( dec n ) ) ( fib ( - n ( long 2 ) ) ) ) ) )
and computes ( fib 38 ) on my laptop in 650 ms where my ( or even Rich ’s ) best attempt took about 2s !
If I tweak the above code to use unchecked ops ( regular arithmetic ops on primitive types in Clojure throw an exception on overflow , unchecked ones do n’t ) , the performance comes real real close (< 5 % ) to the equivalent Java code .
What ’s this ^:static thing ?
Primitive ( double and long only : they subsume any other type ) args and return values are only allowed on statics ( note that the return type hint is put on the arglist so as to allow different hints for different arities ) .
Statics are still fns in vars but they are backed by a static method and , when called by name , a direct static method call is emitted rather than going through the var and the IFn interface — as such static calls replace direct binding .
( my - static 42 ) ; direct call ( apply my - static 42 nil ) ; regular call through the var
About the syntax : ^:keyword is a new reader shorthand for ^{: keyword true} ( and keep in mind that in Clojure 1.2 ^ is the new #^ ) , and metadata are merged : ^:static ^long ^{:doc " docstring " } x is now equivalent to ^{:static true : tag long : doc " docstring " } x .
Interesting times … as usual in the Clojure community .
Thanks Rich !
This will be a bit personal .
Some explanation of this website ’s recent change in title seems warranted , however it would be impossible to do so without providing some personal and historical context .
For the first year , this content was created for a site called GameDevLessons .
The site is now , as you have probably noticed , called HobbyGameDev :
GameDevLessons – “ Lessons ” + “ Hobby ” = HobbyGameDev
Why the Change ?
I removed the “ Lessons ” part because , although there is content here to help people get started , that is only a small part of what I write about .
The other 60 - 80 % of my writing is project retrospectives , game design philosophy , interviews , motivation / compromise strategies , on the cultural and intellectual value of videogames , and so on .
People coming here looking for lessons were finding that only a fraction of the content met their expectations .
People that might well have found value in the other writing here were n’t coming , because the name was implying something that they were n’t looking for .
How “ Lessons ” Got There
GameDevLessons was originally envisioned as a site to support giving private lessons in videogame development .
That did n’t scale well – I spent more time trying to find qualified , paying clients than actually teaching – so I instead started adapting my lesson plans , strategies , and example source code into 10 - 20 pages of online content each month .
This reached considerably more people , quickly in the thousands instead of in the dozens , then the tens of thousands , then …
This gave every reader total flexibility to advance at their own pace , dig into outside material when necessary , and experiment at their whim , with my content playing a supporting role instead of trying to serve as a core driver .
This also this enabled me to focus on explaining videogame development instead of getting tied up in the search for students .
And I could focus exclusively on game development , instead of answering questions about microtransactions , advertising dollars , in - app - purchases , and other things that I do not know very well , and in reply to which my answer was generally either “ I do n’t know , ” or “ I do n’t care . ”
Everyone wins !
I was gleefully fulfilling my purpose .
I just made $ 0 doing it .
GameDevLessons was originally a site to support giving private lessons , somewhat like piano lessons , but about videogame making , and taking place via Skype / PayPal .
That failed .
So , I instead covered my costs by developing videogames .
My time dabbling in corporate game development as a technical game designer left it pretty clear that I would n’t be happy going back to that sort of environment .
Good people , good games , but big projects move like glaciers and demand specialization – I ’m restless and insist on having my hands in everything , so I turned professional indie .
Alas , that ’s not as freeing as it sounds .
200,000 Managers
Inherently , part of the challenge with big company videogame development ( as it seemed in my narrow time at EA ) is Internal Customers – designing something to satisfy a manager within the company ( executive producer , lead designer , director , etc. ) , and just hoping that the Internal Customer ’s sense of value is closely tuned and calibrated to match those of the end users .
Unless your end user is making six figures , or your executive producer is a teenager , there ’s a decent chance that this is n’t the case .
Although NY publisher Sonic Boom did offer helpful feedback and support for the games that I developed for them , they were great about leaving me with enough latitude and creative direction so as to avoid the challenges of Internal Customers .
This gave me a chance to focus on making things for players instead .
Developing videogames directly for the players presents a different sort of challenge , though .
What I learned in the process was that just as Internal Managers can formally become Internal Customers , what are literally the External Customers – the players – tend to informally become External Managers .
And there are a lot of them .
Hundreds of thousands of them .
If you ’re really ( un ? ) lucky , there are millions of them .
Just like internal managers , they all ask for contradictory things , and if you do n’t try to make them all happy they can cause you trouble .
Did I mention there are a lot of them ?
This .
Times 200,000 .
If you ’re lucky .
Hobby Game Development
I introduced the word “ hobby ” to the site ’s title because , even though videogame making was how I stayed ahead of rent , that was n’t where I started , and it was n’t what made me happiest or most productive .
I started as a hobbyist .
I made ~4 games / year for 10 years ( plus 7 months making 200 + experimental gameplay projects ) before there was money attached to any of them .
I loved making those games .
With the lone exception of Alice in Bomberland ( published by Sonic Boom ) , my favorite projects have been those that I made for free , working with no budget , paying no attention to demographics or monetization strategies or customer expectations .
The projects where I woke up excited one morning , had something blurry in mind that I could n’t wait to bring shape to , and blasted together over the next few days , weeks , or even months on end of sleepless nights .
Since commercializing my efforts – and despite giving those my very best effort and attention – I have not been as happy with the work that came from the process .
Players responded well to Topple ( published by ngmoco ) and iZombie : Death March ( published by Sonic Boom ) , although I prefer playing Burn 2 or Battleship 88 .
Had commercial videogame development been where I started , I fear it would have poisoned my work .
It throws me off .
It messes up my mojo .
It disturbs my force .
There are people that can do their best work when money is involved – certainly to succeed in doing so enables a different level of marketing for visibility ( here it succeeded for Topple ) , and funding for collaborative art support ( here it succeeded for Alice in Bomberland and iZombie Death March ) .
And yet , doing those projects made me feel drained , not invigorated .
Frustrated , somehow , more than proud , even when the resulting work came out well .
I worry what the long - term effect might be on my work if I continue to rely on commercial game making .
I realize now that my best game making may always be what I do on the side for free .
Celebrating and Evangelizing the Hobby
I choose to celebrate these hobby projects , to encourage others to develop hobby projects , to focus first and foremost on what is being made .
Rather than worrying about the commercial success ( or lack ) of it , see the freedom as a blessing : to not yet have had such a massive success as to be wary of taking risks on the next project , to not yet have worked yourself into a corner of needing to make changes you disagree with on account of internal or external customers asking for them , to really and truly be free to do whatever you wish with your ideas and your projects .
There ’s a very special level of freedom in what we do for free .
Because even if one of the games takes off commercially , even if one of them winds up pulling you briefly into the spotlight , you may just find yourself scrambling on the side to still have an outlet where the work can purely be yours , and not 7/8 - ths whatever past customers are demanding , nor 7/8 - ths what must be accounted for in the company ’s interests .
feelforit is my favorite iPhone project that I ’ve made , and Transcend is my favorite iPad project that I ’ve made ( no iPad ?
Curious what Transcend is ?
Full play through video / or try my full in - browser port ) .
I ’m even more excited for the upcoming release of Tumult [ update from the future : now also available free in - browser ] .
Each of those projects took me less than a week to develop , and did n’t cost a penny .

Text from Thoreau ’s Walden .
On Pricing
I ’m not anti-money , although I realize it may sound like that .
I ’m just increasingly anti-designing - around - money .
Burnit followed the same tiny schedule , lack of budget , and reckless disregard for customer expectations as those previously listed projects , and after I left it free for nearly a year to wind up in many people ’s hands I experimented with putting a price on it .
It ’s doing alright – and meanwhile , I feel better about making money from what I thought was worth making , rather than making what I thought was worth money .
Likewise , from time to time , I experiment with pricing on my various other app store entries ( the self - published ones are the crazy looking ones ) .
None of my hobby projects were designed to make money – that much is clear from how odd they are – and though I struggle about placing any restrictions on who can play with my hobby apps , I have to remind myself that I am always giving so much else away .
In light of my writing , my experimental gameplay projects , my PC freeware , and the countless copies that I give away free of every iPhone project , asking a fair cost for a few of my better received work does n’t seems too crazy .
The other consideration in this regard is that people treat and think about things differently when they pay for them – I ’ve read every book that I ’ve purchased at full price , but I confess that I have finished very few of the books that I ’ve come upon for free or in $ 1 street sales .
I think that part of the reason the general public never paid much attention to great freeware games is because there ’s an assumption among them that what is free must be worthless , or at least ought to be given lower priority in their lives than what they spent money on .
I wonder how much more attention and focus someone gives an app that they spend a few dollars on , compared to one that they download in a 20 app free download spree ?
If I get only a trickle of downloads with a price on it , but that trickle of downloads translates to people actually playing with it , then I greatly prefer that scenario over the one in which of hundreds more download it daily , only to let it gather cyber dust , played once then buried pages deep on their phone never to be thought about again .
Paying the Bills
“ For myself I found that the occupation of a day - laborer was the most independent of any …
The laborer ’s day ends with the going down of the sun , and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit , independent of his labor ; but his employer , who speculates from month to month , has no respite from one end of the year to the other . ”
- Henry David Thoreau
Walden
There ’s not much real money in this approach , because my self - published experimental hobby projects do n’t look anything like what my 200,000 + external managers ask for .
These do n’t shine from months of polish .
A bunch of them are n’t even games in the traditional sense , just real - time interactive thingies , perhaps “ videogames ” but certainly not “ games ” by any definition – I was likely , in part , rebelling against the literal concepts and structured rules that modern gamers have come to assume and expect .
A lot of them are bottom - up design to the extreme , raw and abstract , even though the market for that style of gameplay ( outside of puzzle games ) mostly dried up decades ago .
For my hobby projects , I ’m ok with that .
Even proud of it .
Whenever I write idealistic articles , or about caring for meaning , etc. there has been a sense that until it ’s where most of the money is , people wo n’t do it .
Pro-Tip : most of the “ gaming ” money is in the gambling industry , anyway .
Reminder : so long as projects can be made for $ 0 – and it has never in history been easier to make such incredible things in such short periods of time without spending any money – our creative work does not need to be constrained by what we can turn into a business .
Although I ’m still considering a small game contract or two on the side , as a career move I ’m in a multi- year process of transitioning out of professional videogame development into research and teaching .
Whatever work I ’m doing , I ’ll still be making videogames as a hobby .
Look forward to even more absurdity , diversity in purpose , variation in style , and risk taking than I was able to do when videogame creation was my profession .
Frrreeeeeeeeeeeddddooommmm
Hobby videogame development is free .
Free to do , free from external pressures , and often ( though not always ) free to share .
Professional full - time developers – their employers willing – can do it on the side .
Anyone anywhere can do it on the side .
It ’s about making something worth making , to be played because it ’s worth playing , bringing new things into existence because we want them to exist .
If there ’s a smaller audience for it – whether a circle of friends , a dozen people across the globe with peculiar tastes , or even just the project ’s author – is no matter , and to trouble the mind with such questions is to lose sight on what ’s important about videogame development as a hobby .
The less I worry , the faster I work , and the happier I am with the results .
Architecture and Pillowforts
Commercial videogame development is architecture .
Hobby videogame development is making pillowforts from anything in reach .
If you ’re spending money on making your pillowforts , or stressing out over how to make money from your pillowforts , you ’re doing it wrong .

Workers at a center for distressed children provoked seven developmentally disabled girls into a fight of biting and bruising , while they laughed , cheered and promised the winners a precious prize : after - school snacks .
Four of the girls were injured , according to records obtained by The Texas Tribune and the Houston Chronicle .
State officials learned of the incident at Daystar Residential Inc. in Manvel the day after it occurred , when a Daystar employee doing health checks found bite marks , scrapes and bruises on the girls ’ bodies .
The fight was one of more than 250 incidents of confirmed abuse and mistreatment in residential treatment centers over the last two years , based on the Chronicle / Tribune review of state records .
But unlike last year ’s scandal at the Corpus Christi State School , where staffers were found to have forced mentally disabled adults to fight one another , there were no impassioned calls for reform .
No criminal indictments sought against the perpetrators .
And no lawmakers publicly grilling a state agency about how it could have happened .
Instead , the two staffers at Daystar , a child residential treatment center located 30 minutes south of Houston , were quietly fired after the fight in 2008 .
To this day , the names of the pair — a dorm supervisor and another female worker — are kept secret by the Department of Family and Protective Services , even though the center , contracted by the state to provide care , has received $ 16 million in taxpayer money since 2006 .
“ Why I ’m outraged is , the department hid this from us , ” said state Rep. Patrick Rose , D - Dripping Springs .
“ This is another example of us having to find out about systemic failures through the press , as opposed to pro-actively from the department . …
We could ’ve fixed this problem last session when we were addressing a very similar issue . ”
Residential treatment center records reviewed by the Chronicle and the Tribune show state investigators confirmed hundreds of violations from mid-2008 through April of this year — at least 250 of them involving abuse , neglect and mistreatment .
All of those centers remain in operation today .
Workers choked and punched kids to get them to behave .
Children who were supposed to be supervised attempted suicide .
Kids were threatened with corporal punishment and forced to strip down to their underwear so they would n’t run away .
In some cases , residents engaged in sexual acts with peers , with staff members and , in one case , with a staffer ’s relative .
In the past five years , six facilities — three of them in Houston — have been shut down or denied a license renewal .
But it ’s unclear exactly what triggers the closures ; other facilities remain open or face no sanctions despite suicide attempts and other serious abuse incidents .
In the staged fight at Daystar in April 2008 , state inspection records show the two employees gathered the seven “ developmentally delayed ” girls , ranging in age from 12 to 17 , and forced them to fight .
DFPS investigated , confirmed the abuse and cited Daystar over several deficiencies — but did n’t put the facility on suspension or probation .
Daystar attorney John Carsey said the state ’s conclusions are “ misleading and frankly incorrect . ”
He said the company fired two female employees who failed to intervene in a shoving match between two girls — not seven — that resulted in some hair - pulling and nothing more .
“ Nobody got hurt , ” said Carsey , who declined to provide copies of the company ’s internal investigation .
DFPS stands by its findings .
“ We are very disappointed in Daystar ’s characterization of this very serious incident , and their criticism of our investigation , ” said Sasha Rasco , DFPS ’ assistant commissioner of child care licensing .
“ These employees staged a fight between these children , and cheered as the fight occurred .
A medical examination found four of the girls were injured . ”
DFPS did not revisit the fight club incident — or report it up the chain — in early 2009 , when police stumbled onto cell phone videos of workers at the Corpus Christi State School forcing profoundly disabled residents to fight each other .
“ Nobody ever came up from [ DFPS ] and told us , ” said Jay Kimbrough , who was Gov. Rick Perry ’s chief of staff when the Corpus Christi fight club news broke .
“ And ' fight club ' was a magic phrase , a defined term at that point . ”
The Corpus Christi fights , staged the same spring the Daystar incident occurred , brought inflamed criticism from those in the disability community , prompted Perry to place a moratorium on state school admissions , and led to the conviction of six workers on charges of injury to a disabled person .
The state poured money into the Department of Aging and Disability Services , which oversees state schools , to install security cameras and other safety measures .
DFPS “ should ’ve stepped up and said , ‘ This is bad , this is evil , and we are holding everyone accountable , ’ ” said Jeff Garrison - Tate , whose nonprofit Community Now ! works for people with disabilities .
“ You think , ‘ How could it get worse than the Corpus Christi fight club ? ’
Only in Texas could it get worse . ”
Since 2006 , residential treatment centers have received more than $ 300 million to care for the most troubled or disabled children taken into foster care .
Children placed at a residential treatment center are there because basic care for them is not enough .
They are likely to bear deeper emotional scars , and some , in social worker parlance , “ act out , sexually . ”
Others have turned to alcoholism or drug addition .
Some struggle with depression or developmental disabilities .
“ Each child in one of these facilities is troubled , typically with serious emotional disturbance and / or mental health issues , ” explained DFPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins .
“ These centers are designed to provide treatment for them . ”
The state contracts with about 80 residential treatment centers , nearly half of which are in the Houston area .
The state workers at the Corpus Christi State School were arrested and later convicted of felonies .
DFPS officials say they referred the Daystar matter to local law enforcement .
But both the Manvel Police Department and the Brazoria County Sheriff ’s Office say they never received any notification .
DFPS refused to release the report it filed with law enforcement and said it could n't prove notification was sent ; the agency deletes all faxed records after 30 days .
The Chronicle / Tribune review of state inspection reports and other records revealed dozens of incidents of serious abuse and neglect , including physical beatings , and failing to report attempted suicides and allegations of sexual assault .
Unmonitored youth escaped , stole vehicles and started fires .
Staff failed to report sexual contact among young kids , and provided others with alcohol and illegal drugs .
Workers punished kids with dangerous physical restraints or long periods of confinement — sometimes without their clothes .
Among the incidents :
* At the Brookhaven facility in McLennan County , a child who was supposed to be monitored at all times left the room and attempted to hang himself with his shoelaces .
A second child swallowed 30 psychotropic pills .
Within months of those incidents , a staffer choked a child and struck him with a milk crate .
* At Houston ’s Serenity residential treatment center , staffers forced residents to strip down to their boxers and take off their shoes to prevent them from running away .
* At the Avalon Center in Eddy , staff did n’t intervene when a young girl ran into the highway and yelled for oncoming traffic to hit her .
* A staffer slammed a door on a resident ’s head at the Guardian Angels residential treatment center in Houston .
DFPS insists that disciplinary actions do not have to take the form of license suspensions to improve care .
In the incidents above , Crimmins said three firings resulted and center policies were changed .
DFPS officials do say , however , there should have been a more elaborate investigation into the Daystar incident .
“ We should have conducted more follow - up , with interviews of the children and other Daystar employees to make sure that this was an isolated incident , and to make sure that there was nothing in the prior performance of the two employees that might have indicated problems , ” Crimmins said .
The fired Daystar employees ’ names were added to Texas ’ abuse / neglect registry , which means they should n’t be hired to work in direct care again .
“ We believe this operation acted appropriately in response to this incident , ” Crimmins said .
“ It is not a perfect system , but our goal is constant improvement , and to make these operations as safe as possible . "
Rose , who chairs the House Human Services Committee , said he intends to make some safeguards mandatory , including forcing RTCs to pay for FBI background checks for all employees , and ordering state investigators to conduct surprise inspections within 30 days of an abuse incident .
“ My office , our committee , will work to move the department in this direction immediately , ” Rose said .
“ Unless we ’re made aware of the problems , we ’re left responding to them , as opposed to fixing them .
Here , clearly , the department did a poor job of reporting systemic failure to the Legislature . ”

VANCOUVER -
The night before a violent confrontation between Israeli soldiers and activists headed for the blockaded Gaza Strip was a tense and sleepless one , says a Canadian activist who was on board .
Rifat Audeh , one of three Canadians detained during the raid off the Gaza coast , told The Canadian Press that they 'd heard reports Israeli forces might try and “ attack ” the convoy .
Nine people died in the confrontation .
The 37 - year - old resident of St. Catharines , Ont. , said he was near the cabin of the Mavi Marmara early Monday morning when he heard the first shots ring out .
“ They started shooting at the ship itself for no reason whatsoever , ” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday from Amman , Jordan , where he arrived after being released by Israeli authorities .
“ We 're a humanitarian ship , we were unarmed , we 're all civilians , we had no weapons onboard . ”
He described a scene of chaos , as activists raced back and forth to help dozens of wounded .
Audeh said he watched helplessly as a man standing six or seven metres away from him died after a bullet ripped through his neck .
“ Had I tried to move towards him , I definitely would have been shot , ” he said .
Audeh said the nightmare did n't end when the bullets stopped flying .
In Israeli custody , he said he and a number of activists were beaten , and were prevented from communicating with the outside world or even using the bathroom .
“ We were just heading in there ( to the Gaza Strip ) , we wanted to deliver these supplies , ” he said .
“ No one in the world really knows why Israel did what they did . ”
Video released of the incident by the Israeli government appears to show some activists acting violently towards soldiers .
Israeli officials have said the footage proves its soldiers acted in self - defence , but Audeh disagreed .
He pointed out that the raid occurred outside Israel 's territorial waters .
“ It was an act of piracy , ” he said .
“ A while ” after the first shots rang out , Audeh said , the captain came on over the loudspeaker and urged those who could return to the cabin area to do so .
He did .
“ I was beaten by the soldiers .
They tied my hands behind my back , put a blindfold on me , threw me on the ground , ” he said .
“ I thought they were actually going to break my arms and legs while they were doing this because it was very violent . ”
When they were finally taken off the ship , the day after the altercation , he said the detainees were stripped of their passports and personal belongings , including cameras .
“ They confiscated everything and then they took us to jail after that , ” he said .
“ They cut us off from the outside world .
We could n't call a lawyer , our families , we could n't call anybody .
Nobody knew whether we were dead or alive until we were finally released ( Tuesday ) . ”

Audeh made his way to Jordan , where he 's staying with his parents who call Amman home .
He said he does n't know when he 'll return to Canada .
If another convoy leaves for Gaza , he intends to be on it .
All of the nearly 700 activists , including the two other Canadians , were expected to be deported from Israel by the end of Wednesday , the Israeli government said .
Audeh identified the other Canadians as Kevin Neish , of Victoria , and Farooq Burney .
Audeh said he actually had a brief chat with both his fellow Canadians .
“ We were happy to find each other on the ship , ” he said .
The Department of Foreign Affairs has not named any of the Canadians , citing privacy laws .
Foreign Affairs did say Wednesday the other two Canadians have been transported to the airport by Israeli authorities and will make their way to Turkey , before travelling to their final destinations .
Neish 's brother Steve said Wednesday his sibling was waiting for a flight out of Israel Wednesday afternoon .
It was unclear when exactly he 'd arrive back in Victoria .
Burney is the director of Qatar - based Al - Fakhoora , a group dedicated to promoting freedom of learning for students in Gaza and the West Bank .
Al - Fakhoora posted a statement on its website saying Burney intended to deliver computers to university students in Gaza .
It said he is now en route to Istanbul and will shortly return to Qatar .
“ We are all relieved to hear the news that our director , Farooq , is safe and will soon be back in Doha , ” Al - Fakhoora chair Jacqueline O'Rourke said .
“ It has been an extremely worrying few days for us and Farooq 's family , with no news . ”

Multitasking
Fast app switching :
You know how you can leave off in Mail halfway through writing a response and go back to exactly where you were ?
Well that happens everywhere now .
When you leave the app , you go back in exactly the same place .
And it happens quickly .
Fast app switching is essentially like toggling between " paused " applications .
This combined with Apple 's new app switcher ( double tap the home button to bring up your most recently used apps ) destroys that annoying iPhone feeling of going in and out and in and out .
It just does n't exist anymore , provided all your apps are up to date , which is going to take some time .
It 's amazing how much this single feature counts -- it 's definitely one of the prime movers here , and it 's so simple it 's stupid .
We would have liked to see options for " favorite " apps or some way to prioritize what you 're switching to , but once you get used to this system -- which just puts whatever you 've used most recently to the far left -- it makes some sense .

Task completion : Basically , task completion lets an app do its thing even if you leave it .
So if you 're uploading or downloading a picture in Evernote or Dropbox , or saving an article in the New York Times app , even if you navigate away , the job is done when you get back to the app .
This accounts for a lot of what we think of as multitasking .
Most of your apps are just idling -- it 's only when you interact with them that it counts .
We do n't know the boundaries for this API , though it seems to leave a lot of room for creative use .
We know it 's not just big jobs , it 's little ones too -- Colloquy uses this feature to keep you connected to your IRC host .
To be honest , that kind of behavior is one thing we thought we would n't see in iOS 4 , and here it is .
Hopefully Twitter app devs and other instant messaging clients will utilize the API in a similar manner .

Background audio and VoIP : These two are straightforward .
The first allows for music playing apps to keep their stream running in the background ( and even gives them little widget controls in the app switcher ) , and the second allows VoIP connections to stay active .
That means you can stay on a Skype call and go check your mail , but it also means that the VoIP connection will be aware of incoming calls when you 're not actively using an app .
Additionally , this API can be used to allow for recording even if you exit an app , as demonstrated effectively in the new version of Evernote .

Background GPS : Basically , GPS apps can keep running in the background ... for obvious reasons .
This one will drain your battery if you 're not docked -- but who 's using a GPS app and not plugging that thing in ?
Okay , we might be a little guilty of that .
Regardless , this will keep your navigation software afloat if you have to take a call , and apparently will let GPS - centric apps like FourSquare check in even if you 're not running it in the foreground .

Wrap-up
As far as video goes , we were definitely impressed by the 720 p capture , though there are stability issues with the lens and the all - too - familiar " jellyvision " CMOS issues that tend to rear their head if you 're not holding the phone very steady .
Still , we can't see carrying around a Flip HD instead of just keeping this in our pocket ( though as we said , we 'd like to see a higher storage capacity ) .
Everything we shot looked crisp and mostly artifact - free , and we did n't see any hiccups in the 30 FPS rate Apple claims , even in lower light .
Adding iMovie to the mix for on - the - fly editing is a nice touch too ( more on that in the software section ) .
The video below was shot and edited completely in - phone , so enjoy -- and here 's the raw output to download Around front , the VGA camera is ... well , a VGA camera .
It actually does a fine job of capturing your face during video calls , and worked surprisingly well in low light , but it 's not going to win any prizes for being the most advanced shooter on a handset .
It does provide for some interesting angle options when it comes to video shooting , and we expect a lot of people will be taking advantage of the weirdly video game - like perspective .
All in all , it looks good , but it 's pretty utilitarian .
We 've never had a particular problem with the speaker or earpiece on previous iPhones ( well , the speakerphone has never been loud enough for our taste ) , but it 's obvious that Apple has done some work on getting both call quality and speakerphone quality up .
Beyond making the phone considerably and consistently louder in both places , the clarity of the iPhone 4 is noticeably improved from the previous generation .
If you read our review , then you know that we thought Motorola 's original Droid had some of the best sounding components we 've heard on a phone , and the new iPhone definitely gives them a run for the money .
The first time we took a call on the device we were walking down New York 's extremely noisy Fifth Avenue , and right away it was obvious that the secondary , noise - canceling mic was doing some heavy lifting , at least on the other end of the line .
Even though sirens were wailing behind us and we were surrounded by chatty shoppers , it was easy to hear our party on the other end , and they could hear us perfectly ( unless we were lied to ) .
There 's clearly a difference between the sound in the earpiece on the new phone versus the 3GS , and it ranks highly against newer competition like the EVO .
As far as the speakerphone goes , it gets loud without distorting or producing cutting midrange , a problem we 've noticed on quite a few recent phones .
We 'd liken the iPhone 4 in quality to something along the lines of the BlackBerry Bold -- a bearable tone even when it gets hot .
As with the other revisions to Apple 's phone line , the hardware is only half of the story .
Along with the iPhone 4 comes iOS 4 , the re-branded iPhone OS which boasts loads of new features , most notably a very Apple - ized version of smartphone multitasking , a video calling feature dubbed FaceTime , folders so you can organize your apps , enhanced Mail , and lots of other nips and tucks -- both big and small -- that refine the company 's growing operating system .
Additionally , Apple has ported the iPad 's iBooks to the smaller screen , and has created a new version of its popular iMovie just for the iPhone 4 .
Overall , the OS is still very much the same as it's always been , but there are some big changes here that bear investigation .
This is a big one , and more than just a little controversial .
Since the dawn of apps for the iPhone ( remember , way back in 2008 ? ) , people have been up in arms about the lack of third - party backgrounding for applications .
Sure , you could keep Mail , Safari , iPod , and a few other Apple programs cranking while you used your phone , but those privileges were strictly off limits for third - party devs working on the device .
It 's arguable that one of the driving forces behind the jailbreaking movement was a desire for this feature -- something a phone as powerful as the iPhone was clearly capable of .
Apple 's argument has always been that multitasking causes an undue amount of battery drain from phones , and had to be approached with caution , lest we all end up with juiceless phones at high noon .
Recently , however , that tune has changed .
Apple has -- in true Apple fashion -- " figured out " how to " do multitasking right " -- namely , the company is n't allowing full backgrounding as much as it's allowing a handful of APIs that mimic backgrounding .
Things like holding onto a GPS signal , letting music play in the background , staying connected to VoIP calls ( or receiving them ) , and fast switching ( basically a way for you to return quickly to exactly where you left off in an app ) .
So , does Apple pull it off ?
Can this scarce handful of APIs makeup for true backgrounding ?
In a word : yep .
Here 's the thing -- this may not be " true " multitasking for a lot of us , but it amounts to multitasking for most of us .
That is , it looks , feels , and acts like multitasking , so it 's pretty tough to complain about it .
In fact : we 're not going to complain about it , especially given the fact that some of our favorite apps -- the IRC client Colloquy being one of them -- do just about exactly what we need them to do , all according to Apple 's rules and regulations .
Previous to the new OS , we 'd been jailbreaking our phone just to keep an IRC session running in the background .
Now , utilizing some of those new APIs , the Colloquy developers have created an elegant and useful solution that pleases both users and the Cupertino Cops .
The point is : it works , it does so bug free , and without a major drain on battery life ( quite the contrary ... more on that in a moment ) .
We 're not saying we liked waiting for this kind of thing to come around , and yes , we 'd prefer something more open and flexible -- but this works , and works well .
So how is Apple making this magic happen ?
Here 's a breakdown of just exactly what multitasking really means ( and feels like ) on the new iPhone ( and the 3GS ) : Apple combines these heavy hitters with more familiar tricks , like push notifications , to excellent effect .
We know that the hardcore users will cry foul because a lot of this does n't amount to " true " multitasking , but we also know that often solutions to problems come in different colors .
Apple found a way in iOS 4 to solve a pretty good amount of its major problems in this department , and so far what we 've seen is very promising .
If it 's only going to get better from here , we do n't mind coming along for the ride .
But it better only get better , Apple .
If you did n't know anything about video calling , Apple would definitely have you convinced that they just up and invented the concept based on never - aired Jetsons footage judged too futuristic for TV .
Of course , the truth is that in lots of other places ( and even in the US to an extent ) , smartphone video calling is n't exactly a new thing .
In fact , in much of Europe and Asia , this technology is old hat .
But Apple is n't going to let a little thing like facts get in the way of a good marketing play , and in their ( slight ) defense , no one 's effectively brought video calling to the masses just yet .
( One of our European editors says that he 's gone ten years without seeing anyone make a video call in his neck of the woods . )
While this may be an unscientific perspective , it suggests that it 's not enough to just have the tech -- the feature needs to be sold to people .
So has Apple done it ?
Maybe , and maybe not .
We 're certainly impressed by the concept and Apple 's willingness to open up their " FaceTime standard " to anyone who wants to get in on the party .
That means that developers on any platform -- provided they can meet all the necessary requirements -- can create applications that talk via the protocol ( or set of protocols , really ) .
We 're also impressed with the tech itself , which feels polished and slick out of the gate .
But right now , there 's only one way to do FaceTime calls , and that 's via the iPhone 4 ... and only over WiFi , which means that the opportunity to make these calls is pretty limited for now .
Additionally , in our testing , we found that you really need to have a good , strong , nearby WiFi signal to hang onto a connection .
More than once we had video freeze on us , and we had one fully dropped call because someone went out of the WiFi range , but hey ... you need to be in range for even the most basic tasks , so we can't fault Apple too much for that .
It does seem clear that the iPhone video chats are moving quite a few bits around , however .
What 's nice about FaceTime is that unlike Qik or other third - party options for something like the EVO , there 's no setup here and it's completely integrated into the dialer of the phone -- meaning the only hangup is whether or not you have decent WiFi .
But what is it like ?
Well in truth , it 's actually a teensy bit amazing .
Yes , we 're a little numb to the PR speak about how game changing it is , but there 's still something deeply sci- fi about dialing up a friend and being able to hold this thing in your hand and have a video chat .
We did a call with Apple 's Greg Joswiak while he was in Paris ( see the image above ) , and when he walked outside and flipped the camera to show us the Eiffel Tower , it was a legitimately weird experience -- a " you are there " moment .
As you can see in the call below with USA Today 's Ed Baig ( his take on the iPhone 4 is right here ) , it 's a pretty new way to talk to someone , at least for us .
Having a random face - to - face conversation with a kid about what he 's having for lunch is just the tip of the iceberg -- we can definitely see this feature coming into play in all sorts of ways in our lives .
Technically speaking , actually making calls is straightforward ; you can switch to a FaceTime chat while you 're already connected , or you 're given to option to launch right into a FaceTime connection .
We were a little surprised by the fact that you can only mute the audio on your calls ; if you want the video off , you need to cover the lens in the old fashioned way -- with your hands .
All said , it 's a fascinating inclusion , and we 've got a sneaking suspicion that Apple intends to do more than just basic calls with this .
Obviously the addition of conference FaceTime sessions would be huge , and we 're also looking forward to using the function on a 3G network -- it 's nice to have a chat from your house , but what would really be great is taking these kinds of conversations out into the wide world .
We think that coupled with active development for clients on lots of platforms ( not just the iPhone ) will make FaceTime much more interesting -- it 's a curiosity right now , but it could be something else entirely with a little time and elbow grease .
What can you really say about folders ?
Basically : it 's about time .
We 're happy that Apple has seen the light and included something like this in iOS 4 , and the implementation is elegant enough , but it would have been nice to store more than 12 items at a time .
As it stands , if you have a lot of one kind of app , you 're going to end up with a group of folders in the same category .
We have a second " Games " folder , but some of you out there will have more like six or seven of those .
That helps the problem , but does n't solve it completely .
We get why Apple made this decision -- likely a desire to keep it simple -- but it would be nice to be able to make the room if you wanted it .
For a lot of us , the new tweaks to the iPhone 's Mail app have seriously been a long time coming .
Among the major improvements in iOS 4 are a unified inbox and threaded messaging ( finally ! ) -- both of which have made dealing with email on the iPhone a considerably more enjoyable experience .
We still think that the mail client is lacking in comparison to Gmail , but that has more to do with our addiction to Gmail than anything else , we suspect .
Overall , Mail feels much more complete now , and Apple has solved the same problem in Mail that it had with app switching -- that feeling of constantly jumping into and out of your inboxes .
This is n't a barnstormer , but it 's a nice inclusion .
If you 've used iBooks for the iPad , the experience is about the same ... just smaller .
There 's not a ton to say about it , except that in addition to lots of other great book apps on the iPhone , Apple has now given you its own .
We still do n't think it stacks up to Amazon or Barnes & Noble in terms of selection , though the presentation is better in many ways , and it will sync your notes and bookmarks across platforms .
iMovie , on the other hand , is something new entirely .
We can't say we did n't see this one coming since Apple just added video recording and editing to its arsenal with the introduction of iPhone OS 3 and the 3GS -- but this takes things one step further .
The $ 4.99 app gives you access to more advanced features , like a ( very ) limited selection of transitions between clips , the option to add audio to your videos , plus a handful of themes and titling effects .
We found it to be extremely capable for fast edits , though everything is pretty sandboxed here , so while you do have the most basic editing tools , things like splitting a clip can be a little bit of a hassle .
Since you can only edit the beginning and end of a snippet , if you want to split something into multiple parts you have to drag the clip into your edit repeatedly and then scale the start and finish points for each one .
It can be a pain if you 're doing lots of jump cuts -- though we do n't expect everyone to be making the next Casino on this thing ... though , someone probably will , right ?
For a few bucks , it 's definitely worth having , and we expect that after a few people start using the thing , Apple might be prompted to add a few more options .
It 's not all wine and roses as far as we 're concerned .
While Apple has made huge strides in many areas here , this would n't be an Engadget review if we did n't have our nitpicks .
In particular , we still cannot understand or accept the company 's approach to notifications .
We 're at version 4 of this OS , and we 're still plagued by these intrusive , productivity - freezing alerts .
If you 're as busy as we are , then you know what it 's like to get invite after invite for your calendar , text messages , and push notifications that just stall the phone out .
While every other modern OS - maker has figured out an elegant way to deal with notifications ( including the forthcoming Windows Phone 7 ) , Apple clings to this broken system .
Why ?
We can't really say .
We find it hard to believe that there are n't folks in Cupertino who feel the way we do -- in fact , we 're sure of it .
Maybe that explains the hiring of Palm's " notification guru " Rich Dellinger .
We sure hope !
The other thing that 's driving us crazy is the lack of widgets .
Apple almost gets there with its new extensible music player controls , but there are still no good solutions for glanceable information on the iPhone .
We 'll admit that it 's better now that fast app switching is in play , but we 'd still like that weather icon to actually show us the temperature where we live .
Is that too much to ask ?
The competition seems to have this one licked -- we 'd really like to see Apple take a stab at it .
It would n't be a new iPhone without some accessories , but Apple has kept it tidy .
The company is offering a new dock , of course , for twenty - nine of your US dollars ( that 's $ 29 ) , and a selection of colorful " bumpers " that protect the phone for the same price .
We 've got a few bumpers in - house , and while we 're not really big fans of the way they look or feel , they do seem to protect the phone pretty well .
On that note , we 've actually seen the iPhone 4 tossed with and without a bumper across a room ( one hit a wall ) with no issue , and we dropped ours pretty hard from about two feet up onto tile with nary a scratch .
This is a big one for many people , and we have some fairly surprising news to report .
The battery life on the iPhone 4 has been outstanding thus far , exceeding our expectations for longevity during testing .
We 've only had a short time to use the phone , but in the week or so we 've been carrying the device as our main phone , we 've had pretty amazing results under normal to heavy use .
In fact , we managed to squeeze more than 38 hours -- yes , 38 hours -- of life out of a single charge using the phone as we normally would .
We 're talking calls , some gaming , lots of push email and calendar invites , playing music over Bluetooth in the car , and just general testing ( like downloading new apps , rearranging icons , tweaking settings ) .
We went from 10:30 AM on a Saturday morning till 1:00 AM on Monday without needing to charge the phone .
Of course , it switched itself off just after the clock struck 1 , but it was thrilling -- like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer and the car salesman see how far they can get in a car with the tank on E. Sitcom references aside , the battery life seems markedly improved in the iPhone 4 , and why not ?
It 's got a much larger battery coupled with that iPad- powering A4 , which has already shown that it can sip rather than gulp power .
Once the rest of the team has their iPhones in hand , we 'll do some hardcore battery life testing and see what we come up with , but we think under pretty active use , the iPhone 4 blows Apple 's previous generation phone out of the water , and makes a lot of the competition look downright needy .
We 're not going to beat around the bush -- in our approximation , the iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market right now .
The combination of gorgeous new hardware , that amazing display , upgraded cameras , and major improvements to the operating system make this an extremely formidable package .
Yes , there are still pain points that we want to see Apple fix , and yes , there are some amazing alternatives to the iPhone 4 out there .
But when it comes to the total package -- fit and finish in both software and hardware , performance , app selection , and all of the little details that make a device like this what it is -- we think it 's the cream of the current crop .
We wo n't argue that a lot of this is a matter of taste -- some people will just prefer the way Android or Symbian works to the iPhone , and others will be on the lookout for a hardware keyboard or a particular asset that the iPhone 4 lacks -- but in terms of the total picture , it 's tough to deny that Apple has moved one step past the competition with this phone .
Of course , in the hyper - accelerated smartphone market where the Next Big Thing seems to always be just around the corner , it 's anyone 's guess how long they keep that edge .

ALBANY —
Two years ago , Shahking Gomez was unemployed when his job search led him to the Soundview HealthCare Network , a group of nonprofit health clinics in the Bronx operated by the State Senate majority leader , Pedro Espada Jr .
Mr. Gomez said he was promised a job as a janitor as long as he completed a short training program .
What he said he spent two weeks doing was working all day : sweeping , mopping , cleaning the front sidewalk of a clinic and disposing of medical waste .
“ There was no training whatsoever , ” said Mr. Gomez , 30 , who lives in the Bronx .
“ They just handed me a mop and bucket and told me to get to work .
After the two weeks they gave me a personal check for $ 200 and a certificate of completion , and then they basically sent me on my way .
They told me there was no permanent work . ”
Mr. Gomez was not the only one who was duped by Mr. Espada ’s clinics , Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said .
On Wednesday , Mr. Cuomo ’s office filed a civil suit against Soundview , Mr. Espada and Mr. Espada ’s son Pedro G. Espada , accusing them of setting up a sham training program as a way to grossly underpay janitors — some as little as $ 1.70 an hour .
( CNN ) --
The Somali government Tuesday condemned weekend killings , allegedly committed by extremist groups , of Somalis who were watching a World Cup soccer match .
" The Somali people , like everyone else in Africa , should be able to watch the tournament without fear of loss of life , " the Somali Ministry of Information said .
" The recent killings by Al Shabab and Hisbul Islam highlight yet again their barbarism , brutality and intolerance of Somali culture and values . "
Gunmen believed to be from radical Islamist groups shot two people dead and detained 10 others when raiding a house where people were watching a World Cup match Saturday night , according to eyewitnesses .
The incident happened in Suqa Holaha , a neighborhood in northeast Mogadishu , Somalia , the witnesses said .
The killings are " the latest in a long line of un-Somali and un-Islamic activities , " according to the Somali government , which compared the World Cup watcher deaths to recent looting and intimidation incidents allegedly committed by Islamic radicals against a Mogadishu radio station broadcasting the World Cup event .
A member of one group later said the watching of the World Cup is anti-Islamic .
One witness , Aisha Abdi , said the militants " stormed into the house " and fired at the World Cup watchers , killing two .
Leaving the two bodies in the home , the militants rounded up the other fans , Abdi said .
Abdi blamed the Islamist group al - Sgabaab , but there was no claim of responsibility from that group or the group Hizbul Islam .
Somali Islamists rarely claim responsibility , instead issuing warnings over such issues and carrying out punishments for those who defy them .
" Football is an inheritance from the primitive infidels , and we can never accept people to watch it and we are directing a final warning to those who want to watch it , " said Sheikh Mohamed Abdi Aros , a spokesman for Hizbul Islam .
Hizbul Islam reportedly has detained at least 30 World Cup fans in Afgoye , an agricultural town which is about 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Mogadishu .
Residents said the militants raided houses on Afgoye where people were watching the matches .
" My friends and I were watching the Argentina and Nigeria game of the World Cup at my house " when they heard gunfire , said Afgoye resident Ibrahim Ade .
" We turned off the TV and came out and we saw at least 30 people lined up by Hizbul Islam militias because of watching the same World Cup game . "
He said it is risky to watch the matches in Islamist - controlled areas .
" It is very clear that the Islamist groups can ban anything at their wish , " said Abdi Ismail , another fan who fled into a part of Mogadishu under control of the acting Somali government .
But he said such bans are not based on Islam , as there are no verses which prohibit watching sports .

Dem lawmaker : Prosecute US members of Gaza flotilla
Passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara , the ship raided by Israel Monday , claim they found what they say is a list of people the Israeli military intended to target during their raid , a news report out of Great Britain states .
In an interview with the UK’s Independent on Sunday , Al Jazeera reporter Jamal Elshayyal said passengers who rummaged through Israeli solders ’ belongings during the raid found a list of names , accompanied with pictures , of people aboard the flotilla that aimed to break Israel ’s blockade of Gaza .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Independent ‘s Catrina Stewart reports :
[ T ]he protesters rummaged through captured soldiers ’ belongings and claimed to unearth a document that they allege is a list of people Israel intended to assassinate .
The booklet , written in Hebrew and in English , contained some photographs of passengers on the Marmara , including the leader of IHH , the Turkish charity that provided two of the ships , an 88 - year - old priest and Ra’ad Salah , head of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel , Mr Elshayyal said .
A military spokesman , Lt Col Avital Leibowitz , insisted soldiers acted in self - defense and that she “ was not aware ” of any list .
The allegations appear to directly contradict the Israeli government ’s claim that its Marines arrived aboard the Mavi Marmara unprepared for violence , and were taken by surprise by angry activists .
The passengers ’ claim of an “ assassination list ” has not been corroborated .
The Israeli government ’s claims that the Gaza flotilla had links to al Qaeda and Hamas stem largely from the involvement of IHH , a Turkey - based Islamic charity organization that operates in many countries in the Muslim world .
Israel has accused the group of having links to terrorist organizations , and the group has been banned in Israel since 2008 .
The US does not list IHH as a terrorist organization .

The Independent ‘s Stewart suggests that a recent autopsy report — showing that the flotilla members killed in the raid were shot repeatedly and at close range — strengthens the argument that they may have been targeted for assassination .
An autopsy report from the Turkish council of forensic medicine , obtained by the UK ’s Guardian Friday , showed that the nine dead had been shot a total of 30 times , “ many fired at close range . ”
According to the autopsy report , US citizen Fulkan Dogan was shot five times from less than three feet away .
Dogan , a 19 - year - old native of Troy , NY , was a dual US and Turkish citizen who was living in Turkey at the time of his death .

Another person killed in the raid was a “ journalist taking photos , ” the Independent reports , quoting passenger Hassan Ghani , who said the person “ was shot … between the eyebrows , which indicates that it was not an attack that took place from self - defense . ”
DEMOCRATIC HOUSE REP : JAIL US CITIZENS WHO WERE PART OF FLOTILLA
ADVERTISEMENT
A Democratic member of the US House of Representatives says he wants to see US citizens aboard the Gaza flotilla prosecuted for providing aid to terrorists .
In a conference call organized by The Israel Project , Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) told reporters that activists participating in the flotilla were aiding Hamas and therefore breaking US law .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 makes it absolutely illegal for any American to give food , money , school supplies , paper clips , concrete or weapons to Hamas or any of its officials , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sherman said , as quoted at Jim Lobe ’s foreign policy blog .
“ And so I will be asking the Attorney General to prosecute any American involved in what was clearly an effort to give items of value to a terrorist organization .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ADVERTISEMENT
TalkingPointsMemo’s M.J. Rosenberg , a frequent writer on Middle East issues , describes Sherman as “ the most pro-Likud Democratic member of Congress , ” referring to Israel ’s most prominent conservative political party .
“ But this is crazy even for Sherman . ”
Sherman ’s declaration has taken heat from conservative commentators as well .
Writing at The American Conservative , Kelley Vlahos declares that “ the overall reaction to the abuse of our citizens has been strangely muted and flaccid Ã¢â‚¬â€ whether at the White House , Capitol Hill or in the corporate media . ”
Writes Vlahos : “ Instead of demanding an accounting Ã¢â‚¬â€  you know , like Turkey is doing for its own citizens Ã¢â‚¬â€  we have elected leaders trying to put Americans on that flotilla in jail . ”
The lack of accountability is confirmed in the government 's own reports and testimony dating to the early 20th century .
Conclusions of " fraud , " " corruption , " " institutional incompetence , " " deficiencies in accounting , " " the accounts lack credibility , " " multifaceted monster , " " organizational nightmare , " " dismal history of inaction , " " criminal negligence , " and " sorry history of department mismanagement , " are found regularly between 1915 and the present .
Congress ordered an accounting in 1994 but interior secretaries in both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations were held in civil contempt for not forking over records .
District Judge Royce Lamberth , a Texas Republican nominated by President Reagan who oversaw the case for a decade , called the whole matter " government irresponsibility in its purest form . "
I sat in Lamberth 's courtroom in 1999 when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt both lost his cool and conceded that the government could n't provide accurate cash balances of most accounts and that " the fiduciary obligation of the United States is not being fulfilled . "
But the dispute would not end , as the Clinton and Bush administrations fought unceasing adverse rulings in a case inspiring 3,600 separate court filings and 80 published decisions .
No single case , including the antitrust action against Microsoft , has been as heavily litigated and defended by the government , say lawyers .
The government 's chief nemesis has been Elouise Cobell , a member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana , the accountant - turned - banker who in 1987 started Blackfeet National Bank , the first national bank on a reservation .
With a very small team of attorneys led by a Washington banking specialist , Dennis Gingold , her suit has inspired 3,600 court filings and 80 published decisions .
Not even the antirust action against Microsoft was as heavily litigated by the government .
The historic resistance melded with an unsympathetic appeals court often overruling the dispute 's two trial judges .
It ordered removal of Lamberth , now the district court 's chief judge , due to harsh language toward the government .
Last year , it threw out a ruling by District Judge James Robertson , Lamberth 's successor , that the Indians were owed $ 476 million , a pittance compared to the reduced , $ 48 billion they were seeking by then .
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain both urged settlement during the 2008 campaign .
A resolute Judge Robertson then hauled Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and plaintiffs into his chambers last year .
He made clear to one and all that , in light of the latest appeals court ruling , both sides had the choice between spending maybe another 10 years in court or trying to finally settle .
The initial atmosphere was not necessarily conducive to harmony .
Career government employees in the Interior , Justice and Treasury departments felt burned after years of being belittled by both the plaintiffs and Judge Lamberth .
Meanwhile , the plaintiffs had minimal trust in the government .
But political appointees in the Obama administration , including Salazar and Attorney General Eric Holder , took their cue from President Obama 's own support of a settlement .
Dozens of meetings ensued , with the many prickly issues including how far back in time one would go to try to determine who should benefit .
Even if fifty million people say a foolish thing , it is still a foolish thing . ” – Anatole France

America 's Loose Nukes in Israel
By Grant Smith
Anti-War , Al - Jazeerah , ccun.org , April 20 , 2010
Israel decided this week to send Minister for Intelligence Affairs Dan Meridor to the Nuclear Security summit .
This U.S. bid to secure vulnerable nuclear stockpiles against non-state actors is both closely watched and furiously spun .
Israel avoided exposing Prime Minister Netanyahu to embarrassing scrutiny of Israel ’s clandestine nuclear weapons arsenal .
For this reason , trumpets the New York Times , Israel sent a lower - level delegation .
But Israel has long responded defiantly to threats of robust U.S. oversight .
A long - running investigation into how weapons - grade uranium went missing from Pennsylvania illustrates why America has been incapable of securing its own nuclear materials and know - how from insider threats .
The future of that uranium may determine the success or failure of the Obama administration ’s non-proliferation effort .
David Lowenthal was a member of the underground Haganah – a precursor to the Israel Defense Forces – and fought during Israel ’s 1948 war under Meir Amit , who later became head of Israeli intelligence .
Lowenthal was a close friend of David Ben-Gurion , the first prime minister of Israel .
In the mid-1940s while leading the Jewish Agency , Ben-Gurion launched a massive clandestine conventional arms financing , theft , and smuggling network [ .pdf ] in the United States diverting to Palestine small arms , heavy machine guns , munitions - making equipment , aircraft , ships , and tanks destined for American scrap yards after World War II .
On the nuclear front , Lowenthal financed the purchase of the Apollo Steel Company facility in Pennsylvania for $ 450,000 .
Founder and President Dr. Zalman M. Shapiro , a genius inventor and head of a local Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) chapter , incorporated the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ( NUMEC ) at Apollo in 1956 .
Lowenthal capitalized NUMEC through a stock offering in 1957 and business took off – propelled by the critical knowledge of highly talented scientists .
NUMEC co-founder Dr. Leonard P. Pepkowitz previously worked on the clandestine Manhattan Project in 1944 producing America ’s first atomic bombs .
Pepkowitz later led analytical chemistry research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
NUMEC regularly received large quantities of highly enriched uranium and plutonium from industry giants Westinghouse and the U.S. Navy for reprocessing into nuclear submarine fuel and other specialty uses .
Shapiro was meticulous in his stewardship of the company ’s financial resources , carefully shopping around for banks willing to accommodate the complex demands of the fast growing NUMEC .
In the early 1960s , the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) began documenting suspicious lapses in NUMEC ’s security , inexplicably lax record - keeping , and the ongoing presence of large numbers of Israelis at the plant .
In 1962 the AEC considered suspending " classified weapons work " at NUMEC .
In 1965 an AEC audit found that NUMEC could no longer account for 220 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
In 1966 the FBI opened an investigation – code - named Project DIVERT – and began monitoring NUMEC ’s management and Israeli visitors .
On Sept. 10 , 1968 , four Israelis visited NUMEC to " discuss thermoelectric devices with Shapiro , " according to correspondence seeking official AEC consent for the visit from NUMEC ’s security manager .
Among the approved visitors was Rafi Eitan .
After Eitan ’s visit , 587 pounds of highly enriched uranium was classified as missing .
Former Deputy of the CIA ’s Directorate of Science and Technology Carl Duckett said the agency came to the conclusion by 1968 that “ NUMEC material had been diverted by the Israelis and used in fabricating weapons . ”
An eyewitness gave testimony to the FBI about one late evening in 1965 when he encountered several NUMEC employees loading a flatbed truck with nuclear materials .
It was unusual that material was shipping so late at night .
Moreover , these particular employees ( names were censored from the 2,654 pages of FBI documents released under the Freedom of Information Act ) " never loaded trucks themselves . "
The eyewitness was " sure this was high - enriched uranium products due to size and shape of the container and the labeling . "
An armed guard ordered the witness away ; he was later threatened to never reveal what he had seen on the loading dock .
The FBI , CIA , Congress , the GAO , and the AEC spent fruitless decades investigating the diversion .
The FBI insisted on nuclear forensics to determine whether radioactivity in soil samples collected outside Dimona in Israel had any telltale NUMEC signature .
But not until U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Pollard was arrested spying for Israel in 1985 was Rafi Eitan ’s importance fully understood .
In 1986 investigators discovered the Eitan who entered NUMEC in 1968 had the same birth date – 11/23/1926 – as the spy handling Pollard .
According to Anthony Cordesman , “ There is no conceivable reason for Eitan to have gone [ to the Apollo plant ] but for the nuclear material . ”
Eitan has since been forced out of the cold as one of Israel ’s top economic espionage agents for Israel ’s secretive LAKAM , involved in multiple operations against U.S. targets .
The Israel lobby ’s role , never deeply explored by the Pollard investigators , was perceptible in the background .
An operative of a U.S. - Israel business foundation provided the Washington , D.C. , safe house where documents stolen by Pollard were duplicated and secreted away to Israel .
But Pollard ’s subsequent life sentence in prison is the exception to the rule – crimes for Israel ( even nuclear diversion ) are n’t punished by America .
In a now familiar pattern , the investigation of NUMEC uranium diversion waxed and waned into the 1990s .
DIVERT was soon transformed into a futile investigation into whether Zalman Shapiro had foreknowledge or personal involvement in the caper and ways officials in agencies from the State Department to the AEC thwarted warranted law enforcement and accountability for Israel .
To date , all of the uranium - diversion masterminds , financiers , and beneficiaries have escaped criminal prosecution , even as U.S. taxpayers fund a nuclear waste cleanup at the ( now defunct ) NUMEC Apollo facility .
That the U.S. is a sieve for Israeli nuclear espionage is well documented .
In 1988 the GAO determined that Department of Energy nuclear laboratories were far too open to foreign visits from " countries identified as sensitive by DOE because they are a security and / or proliferation risk , such as Pakistan and Israel . "
The lessons of Eitan went unheeded .
The report found that " Of 637 visitors from countries such as India , Israel , and Pakistan , the DOE required background checks for only 77 . "
In addition to amassing critical knowledge , other nuclear technologies known to have been diverted from the U.S. to Israel include dual - use triggering technologies , klystrons , and krytons .
It never had to be this way .
In the early 1960s , just as the problems at NUMEC began , President John F. Kennedy unleashed a robust non-proliferation and law enforcement pincer maneuver .
He demanded U.S. inspections of Israel ’s Dimona weapons plant in order to prevent Israel from going nuclear .
Kennedy simultaneously ordered Israel ’s American lobby to register as foreign agents to bring their undeclared activities out into the open .
But Israel and its U.S. lobby ultimately prevailed on both counts .
In formally pressing Israel to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while pushing for a settlement freeze and peace negotiations , the Obama administration is retracing JFK ’s final footsteps .
Israel ’s lobby still has its own sovereign policy priorities .
As Zalman Shapiro and lobby elites such as neoconservative gadfly Frank Gaffney gathered at ZOA events on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , pivoting the U.S. military from Iraq toward Syria and Iran was a top priority .
The lobby also worked day and night to keep America ’s front ( and back ) doors open for massive aid transfers and trade preferences , buffing up its own image by plucking operatives from the harsh clutches of law enforcement – even winning presidential pardons to erase or exalt other unfortunate historic events that called into question the U.S. - Israel " special relationship . "
Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh noted that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ’s ( AIPAC ) entire executive committee ( the Conference of Presidents ) favors releasing Jonathan Pollard on the grounds that " his crimes did not amount to high treason against the United States , because Israel was then and remains a close ally . "
These unspoken , forced policies directly pit Israeli prerogatives against American national security , governance , and rule of law – they are often only won only through illegal means .
As Israel ratchets up its own " project divert " effort to compel others to confront NPT signatory Iran ( while derailing meaningful Israeli - Palestinian negotiations ) , the rest of the world showed true commitment to non-proliferation by sending top diplomats to America ’s summit .
Israel simply sent in another spy .
This is why the U.S. must demand more than Israel ’s entry into the NPT .
Only by recovering all purloined nuclear materials can Obama win confidence in America ’s own commitment to controlling loose nukes .

Welcome to the second half of " Double Apron Day " !
This is something I thought up ( probably along with countless others ! ) the other day , and I had so much fun making them !
A t-shirt apron !
No matter what you 're style ( or your mom 's ! ) - there is a t- shirt for it .
Which means there can be an apron for it , too !
For three years , the United States Department of Agriculture has been considering whether to make it illegal to sell ground beef tainted with the six lesser - known E. coli strains , which would give them the same outlaw status as their more famous cousin .
The meat industry has resisted the idea , arguing that it takes other steps to keep E. coli out of the beef supply and that no outbreak involving the rarer strains has been definitively tied to beef .
The severity of the April outbreak is spurring a reassessment .
“ This is something that we really have to look at , ” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand , Democrat of New York , who plans to introduce a bill that would pre-empt the Agriculture Department by declaring a broad range of disease - causing E. coli to be illegal in ground beef and requiring the meat industry to begin testing for the microbes .
“ How many people do we have to see die or become seriously ill because of food poisoning ? ”
The issue will be one of the first faced by President Obama ’s nominee to head the department ’s food safety division , Dr. Elisabeth Hagen , who is scheduled to testify Thursday in her Senate confirmation hearing .
Part of the problem is that so little is known about the rarer E. coli strains , which have been called the “ big six ” by public health experts .
( The term refers to the fact that , after the O157 strain , these six strains are the most virulent of a group of related E. coli . )
Few food companies test their products for the six strains , many doctors do not look for them and only about 5 percent of medical labs are equipped to diagnose them in sick patients .
A physiological quirk of E. coli O157 makes it easy to test for in the lab , and many types of food are screened for it .
The other E. coli strains are much harder to identify and testing can be time - consuming .
The Agriculture Department has been working to develop tests that could be used in meat plants to rapidly detect the pathogens .
A bird is mired in oil on the beach at East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast on Thursday , June 3 , 2010 .
Oil from the Deepwater Horizon has affected wildlife throughout the Gulf of Mexico .
( AP Photo / Charlie Riedel )
( AP ) --
They are the ghastly images of a summer fouled before it started .
Squawking seagulls and majestic brown pelicans coated in oil .
Click .
Gunk dripping from their beaks .
Click .
Big eyes wide open .
Click .
Even the professionals want to turn away .
They can't .
" They get me .
It 's just inherently sad , " said Nils Warnock , a wildlife recovery specialist .
" You see this bird totally covered in oil and all you can see are those eyes looking at you blinking .
You 'd have to be pretty tough not to be affected by that image . "
Warnock did n't see the birds in person .
He 's in California , but the pictures still hit him in the gut .
Warnock has been rescuing birds in oil slicks since 1985 and he still chokes up when talking about photos of birds he has n't seen in person .
Now put yourself in Melanie Driscoll 's shoes .
She does n't just see the pictures .
She sees the birds close - up through her bird conservation work for the National Audubon Society across Louisiana .
The pleading eyes get her , too .
Driscoll has to shut down her emotions while helping coordinate the rescue of the birds .
But the feelings sneak back at night , keeping her awake , making her see oily blackness creeping across her cats and even across the moon when she looks up .
When environmental groups try to tug at the public 's heart and wallet , they focus on what biologists call " charismatic megafauna . "
It 's the feathered or furry helpless critter that you can relate to .
It 's not the oiled hermit crab - an image joked about as not very touching by Jon Stewart on " The Daily Show " Thursday night .
It 's got to have eyes that melt your heart .
And that 's what 's all over the nation 's front pages now .
" The pelican has really become the poster child for this that people are really focusing on , " Driscoll said .
" The bird is the symbol .
They are visible .
They are charismatic . "
Up in Alaska , where it has been 21 years since the Exxon Valdez spill , residents watching the images of oiled birds are turning off their TV sets because it is just too hard to see , said Nancy Bird .
She is director of the Prince William Sound Science Center , which still monitors the effects of the 1989 spill .
" I just wish that somebody would put them out of their misery very quickly , " she said .
" Watching an animal like that die a slow death is pretty disturbing . "
The birds seem frozen in oil .
The image is apt .
Birds that get oiled can die from being too cold , or too hot , because the crude oil interferes with the natural oils that make them waterproof .
That means their sensitive skin is exposed to extremes in temperature .
Even in the relatively mild Gulf waters , they can " die from hypothermia , " said Ken Rosenberg , director of conservation science at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology .
They can also drown .
The brown pelican , the state symbol of Louisiana , is now also the symbol of death - not just for the birds in the pictures , but for the likely thousands unseen .
" If you 're seeing oiled birds , we can assume that there 's a lot of death going on , " Rosenberg said .
" They literally are an indicator of what 's going on in the entire ecosystem . "
Some species of birds , especially those that lurk hidden in marshes - such as the clapper rail , seaside sparrow and mottled duck - will not be photographed coated with oil .
They 'll just disappear sight unseen , Driscoll said .
" Those birds wo n't get their eulogy , " Driscoll said .
" They 'll just disappear .
It 's an unseen tragedy . "

As Ezra Klein ’s research desk explains , most studies show that rich people do n’t flee higher - tax states for lower - tax ones and “ the revenue generated by state tax increases on high earners overwhelms that lost from taxpayers ’ leaving . ”
( Brad DeLong and Matthew Yglesias also discuss this issue here and here . )
In fact , raising taxes on the highest - income households — a group that ’s enjoyed the greatest rise in incomes and the greatest decline in taxes in recent decades — is a sensible and effective way for states to help offset the huge drop in revenues during the recession .
Tax rates just are n’t a big part of most people ’s decisions about where to live — though that does n’t stop some opponents of raising taxes on the wealthy from stringing together a few anecdotes in hopes that the rest of us will believe millionaires are in full flight from states that have called on them to pay their fair share .
When states increase income taxes on , say , people earning at least a million or half a million dollars a year , a few might leave .
But most stay .
And the state enjoys a significant gain in revenue to meet public needs , which are growing sharply in a devastating recession .
Perhaps the most definitive study , by Princeton University researchers , found that after New Jersey increased taxes on those making over $ 500,000 , it experienced a yearly revenue loss of about $ 38 million because of those who left — but a gain of more than $ 1 billion from those who stayed .
Several states have created new brackets for upper - income households during the recession .
My colleagues Liz McNichol and Andrew Nicholas and I found that if each of the 41 states with an income tax increased its rate by 1 percentage point on incomes above $ 500,000 ( which would affect about 1 percent of taxpayers ) , they would raise a combined $ 8 billion .
Those funds would help states avert some of the most damaging cuts they are making in education , health care , public safety , and other areas due to the huge shortfalls they are facing .
And that , in turn , would be good for wealthy residents as well as less - wealthy ones .
After all , millionaires benefit from decent public services too .

Tánaiste Mary Coughlan has said a motion of confidence in Taoiseach Brian Cowen will be debated in the Dáil next Tuesday .
The Dáil schedule is being cleared to allow for a six - hour debate on the motion .
After what 's expected to be a brief Order of Business at 2.30 pm , there will be four 30 - minute speaking slots , for the Government , Fine Gael , Labour and Sinn Féin .
The rest of the time will be divided into ten minute speaking slots , alternating between Government and Opposition , before the final speaker for the Government finishes the debate with a 15 - minute speech .
The vote will be called at 8.30 pm .
The development comes on foot of a no confidence motion being tabled by Fine Gael .
The party said two reports published yesterday on the banking crisis confirmed that Mr Cowen was the chief architect of the catastrophic policy failures that led to the country 's current economic crisis .
Earlier , Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said he deeply regrets some Government decisions that led to the banking crisis and admitted that wrong decisions were made .
Honohan report | Regling Watson report
Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland , he said that the economy became much too dependent on tax receipts from the likes of stamp duty and this created an asset bubble .
He pointed out that during the property boom , there was no appetite for a property tax , which could have curbed some of the activity .
He added that the mistakes were not highlighted by many at the time .
He said many of those who predicted the collapse of the property bubble did so at a very late stage .
The Minister said that nothing in yesterday 's report by international banking experts Klaus Regling and Max Watson surprised him and he said he has been living with the problems they highlighted for the past two years .
He admitted that report , and another by Central Bank Governor Patrick Honohan , made for frightening reading especially with regard to regulation of the banks .
He said that carelessness was combined with a culture of deference to banking management .
Mr Lenihan says the ' light touch ' regulation , which was used to attract foreign business here , was wrong .
The Minister said he appointed Financial Regulator Matthew Elderfield in an effort to right some of these decisions .
Mr Lenihan said that almost € 1bn has been received from the banks in relation to the Government guarantee .
Defending the guarantee , he said that it would be unthinkable not to honour senior debt .
He said guaranteeing subordinated debt has not cost the country any money and said there will be a more limited guarantee from September .
On Anglo Irish Bank , Mr Lenihan said that a detailed plan from the bank on its future has been submitted to the European Commission .
He said that he agrees with Prof Honohan when he says that the banking crisis is manageable .
The Finance Minister also said that Mr Regling drew up the terms of reference for the inquiry , but added that the Government is willing to listen to suggestions from the Opposition on these terms .

Greece 's bloated public sector employs the same share of the workforce -- 14.1 % -- as America's .
Some US states are much worse , giving public jobs to nearly 25 % of workers .
A new CEPR report analyzes just how bloated our public sector is .
Surprisingly -- as Economix points out -- the biggest public sectors are n't in liberal states like California .
They 're in states like Kansas , where people often rail against big government .
Jesse Bering is “ curious about the . . . immediate , subjective experiences of girls who are faced inexplicably with the fact that their uterine linings are literally falling out of their vaginas , ” he writes in his Scientific American column .
There ’s just one thing standing in the way of Bering gaining an intimate knowledge of a girl ’s first uterine - dumping : Feminism .
“ There ’s a smattering of empirical studies on girls ’ firsthand experiences with menses , most coming with a rather heavy - handed feminist slant , ” he writes .
Leave it to this dude “ research psychologist ” ( the kind who , for the record , refers to an elderly woman as a “ spirited old ape before me ” ) to cut through all of that bullshit to tell us what women really think of their first periods .
Bering ’s stunning conclusion : Vaginal blood brings either ( a ) shame or ( b ) nonchalant acceptance , depending upon which culture you are vaginally bleeding in !
Incidentally , feminists have also observed this phenomenon , but they are wrong and he is right , for some reason .
Bering explains it all :
This curious air of embarrassment , secrecy and shame surrounding menarche is a recurring theme in the empirical literature , and in fact this negative view of menstruation displays a surprising cross-cultural regularity .
Even in some African nations where the first menses is publicly celebrated and the girl is doted on with special attention and gifts ( perfumes , dresses , pajamas , towels ) , adolescent females are often deeply uncomfortable with their new biological state of affairs .
A Zambian woman interviewed by York University psychologist Ayse Uskul described how embarrassed she ’d been that her menstruation had become public and pointed out how she ’d in fact shied away from all the attention being showered on her by her relatives .
Such anecdotes would appear to pose some serious problems for traditional feminist theories , which tend to argue that Western negative attitudes toward everything from menstruation to vaginas at large are simply the result of cultural constructions .
“ How society officially views and treats menarche does not mean that the girl who is having her first menstruation will experience the event in the same positive way , ” says Uskul .
Communal ostracism of menstruating girls is also fairly common .
One woman from South East Asia said that she decided to become an atheist when she was told that she could n’t participate in any religious rituals or even enter the temple while having her period .
But there are also a handful of societies in which menarche is more or less shrugged off as just one of those things and public menstrual bleeding seems to stir up about as much awkwardness as a sneeze .
Among the Kayapo of the Amazon , for instance , there is no such thing as makeshift sanitary protection or hygienic napkins ; rather , the word there for menstruation is translated literally as “ stripe down the leg . ”
Let ’s slow this down for a second and follow Bering ’s reasoning here :
( a) Menstruation brings shame to women in a variety of cultures .
( b) Even in Zambia , where women are publicly celebrated with towels and stuff on the event of their first bleed , one Zambian woman was nevertheless embarrassed by the public attention to the inner workings of her vagina .
( c) The nuanced experience of this single Zambian woman — - who illustrates how both “ positive ” and “ negative ” cultural responses to menstruation turn women ’s bodies into public property —- apparently threatens to debunk all feminist work claiming that the shame associated with menstruation is culturally constructed .
(d) Uhhh , also , there are a few cultures where menstruation is neither punished nor celebrated and everyone is pretty much nonchalant about it , so I guess the feminists were right that reactions to menstruation actually may be culturally constructed , but I ’m not going to admit that because feminists annoy me .
Heh , women .
What do they know about this shit ?
Bering ’s column touches on some hugely interesting research on menstruation , even if he then uses it to bash feminists and conclude with this baseless attribution of menstruation shame to evolutionary forces : “ I ’ve often wondered if the tremendous reservation that most parents have in communicating with their children about sex has the ironic consequence of making their children more curious about it — a curiosity that translates into earlier and more frequent sexual activity , ” Bering writes .
“ And that makes me wonder if there were n’t ( and are n’t ) perhaps some natural selection pressures at work here , forces favoring parental modesty over candor in the sex education of children . ”
And it makes me wonder if there are n’t some natural selection forces favoring mansplaining over research in the field of evolutionary psychology .
Get Bering on it !

A highway - worthy airplane moves one step closer to production with a recent weight exemption approved by the Federal Aviation Administration .
The Transition Roadable Aircraft , developed by Massachusetts - based engineering firm Terrafugia , will be allowed a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds , the same allowance made for aircraft designed to operate on water .
Other planes in the class , called Light Sport Aircraft , are limited to a maximum takeoff weight of 1,320 pounds .
" The main reason for that additional weight is the additional safety features that the Transition has -- because it 's designed to be operated on the road -- that are n't found in other light aircraft , " said Anna Dietrich , Terrafugia 's chief operating officer .
A protective safety cage , airbags and an energy absorbing crumple zone are among the extra features .
Light sport aircraft are limited to carrying two people -- a pilot and a passenger .
The pilot must have a Sport Pilot certificate , which requires 20 hours of flight training .
" It 's a certification more appropriate to the size and complexity of these simple aircraft , " Dietrich said .
" There 's actually programs that you can do in about two weeks .
You can take a couple weeks off of work and come home a pilot , so it 's a very accessible , very exciting way of getting into aviation and giving yourself that additional freedom and flexibility , " Dietrich said .
Going from plane to car " takes about the same amount of time as putting down your convertible top , " and the transition takes place from inside the cockpit .
After landing , a cockpit - operated system folds up the wings , and the pilot can drive away .
Transition is designed for trips of up to about 450 miles and can travel about 100 miles per hour in the air and " highway speeds " on the ground of " 65 , 70 , [ miles per hour ] -- something like that , " Dietrich said .
" We 're really not pushing the performance as an automobile because it is really designed to be used as an airplane that has this additional capability , " she said .
" Functionally , it 's a lot closer to an airplane than it would be to your car . "
The price is more in line with aircraft as well ; Terrafugia anticipates the Transition will cost $ 194,000 .
The first delivery will occur in about 18 months , Dietrich said .
The Transition still has to receive FAA certification and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing before it goes into production .
The Transition completed more than 20 test flights last year .
Update : I think some people take this a bit too seriously :
It ’s a fun little experiment : nothing more , nothing less .
Sometimes you ’re just lazy .
Especially when it comes to typing .
And while the round brackets in a function call may not seem like a whole lot of overhead , they do get tiresome if you have to type them over and over again … especially if you do n’t think you need them since the function does n’t return anything and needs no arguments :
Something that ’s awfully common in object - oriented UI programming .
Surprisingly enough , this is n’t all that difficult to do in Javascript , since a lot of methods are called implicitly … toString is probably the most famous one , but there ’s also valueOf that does more or less the same but is called for numeric ( and some other ) casts .
The simplest way to call it is including a sign :
+myFunction ;
which effectively translates to
window.parseFloat(myFunction.valueOf ( ) ) ;
so all we need to do is provide a valueOf method that calls the function itself , like so :
Function.prototype.valueOf=function () {this.call ( this ) ; return 0 ;} ;
and suddenly the plus sing is all that ’s needed for our call .
Especially in an object oriented environment you ’ll have a lot of these calls , but you ’ll have to fix the scope since these methods would be called in the scope of the method itself :
Function.prototype.fix=function(s ) {var t=this ; return function ( ) { return t.apply (s, arguments ) ; } ; } ;
Using this method in the constructor to overwrite each method with a fixed - scope wrapper solves this :
var Foo=function ( ) { this.myMethod=this.myMethod.fix( this ) ; } ;
or a bit more automated :
var Foo=function ( ) { for ( var i in this ) if ( typeof ( this [ i ] ) ==" function " ) this [ i ] =this [ i ]. fix ( this ) ; } ;
and finally we end up with this whole example ( after a bit of OOP refactoring ) :
var StandardClass=function ( ) {} ; StandardClass.prototype.initMethods=function ( ) { for ( var i in this ) if ( typeof ( this [ i ] ) ==" function " && this [i].dontWrap!==true ) this [ i ] =this [i ].fix ( this ) ; } ; StandardClass.prototype.initMethods.dontWrap=true ; Function.prototype.fix=function(s ) { var t=this ; return function ( ) { return t.apply (s, arguments ) ; } ; } ; Function.prototype.valueOf=function ( ) { this .call ( this ) ; return 0 ; } ; var Foo=function ( name ) { this.initMethods ( ) ; this.name=name ; } ; Foo.prototype=new StandardClass ; Foo.prototype.showName=function ( ) { alert ( this.name ) ; } ; Foo.prototype.showNameUpperCase=function ( ) { alert ( this.name.toUpperCase ( ) ) ; } ; var myFoo=new Foo(" Hello World " ) ; +myFoo.showName ; +myFoo.showNameUpperCase ;

Im the Guy They Thought Stole a Hypermotard During a Demo Ride
I decided to write this , because ( unbelievably to me – even last weekend at an Infineon track day ) there are still people who years later recognize me as the person that was arrested then released for supposedly stealing a Ducati Hypermotard during their demo ride at Alice ’s a few years ago :
On this weekend in 2008 , like many weekends , I stopped at the country store up at four corners for a snack and something to drink .
I was riding my Triumph Daytona .
Across the way , I see this gigantic red Ducati trailer up there with “ Hypermotard ” splashed across the sides and the bike in some cool pose ( I do n’t think it was Ruben Xaus doing the sliding thumbs up – but it was something serious like that ) .
I asked a fellow rider who happened to be parked next to me what was going on and he said , ‘ They ’re doing demo rides . ”
I distinctly remember thinking , ‘ You ’ve got to be kidding me !
I really want to try the Hypermotard … my local dealer does n’t give test rides …
I just happened to be at four corners when it ’s occurring …
I actually get to ride it on fun windy roads …
TODAY IS MY LUCKY DAY !!! ” ( famous last words , of course )
Now I may well be an idiot or moron as some in the gentle world of Barf postings suggested , but I say this episode does not evidence this .
I followed exactly the procedure that I had done many times for Triumph and Harley test rides : I gave them my driver ’s license information , signed their liability waiver and asked them when I should bring the bike back .
What is a ‘ group ride ’ and why should I have assumed that this was n’t a typical test ride ?
I have since been told that what Ducati offers is some weak excuse for a test ride where they line you up in a big group and slowly ride like a procession of posers on Italian motorbike jewelry in a parade .
Count me out of that .
Of course , my assumption that Ducati runs its test rides the same as Harley and Triumph would have been easily reversed and the limp Ducati test ride program fully revealed if any of the Ducati personnel had bothered to mention to me how they organize their demos .
By Ducati personnel , I ’m referring to the 15 year old kid and the woman manning their signup table who were fighting over the last potato chips in the pack rather than insuring the proper completion of liability forms for death or serious injury resulting from motorbike usage .
So I filled out the paperwork , showed them to the potato chip lady and waited for what was next .
And waited some more .
Finally , I asked her which bike was mine .
She gave me a bike number .
I asked her when I should bring it back .
She said 30 minutes .
I said to her , “ Oh , that ’s great , I ’ll make sure I get it back to you by then . ”
She looked at me with a blend of confusion and disinterest – mostly disinterest .
I walked over to the bikes .
I noted the bike that had the number she provided me .
I looked around for somebody who was going to do the usual rigmarole , ‘ Here ’s where the starter button is , here ’s how you actuate your turning signals … . ”
Nobody came to assist me .
Oh well , I thought , the key is in the ignition and I ’m sure I can figure the rest out .
I turned the key over into the on position – ‘ wow , this bike has a clock – this is going to be a piece of cake to get it back in time ’ , I thought .
Before I turned the starter this fateful thought occurred to me , ‘ So Ducati is giving anybody off the street with a basic motorcycle rating the keys to an expensive and fast bike that they have never ridden before , on roads that are demanding for those of us who ride them often and borderline dangerous for newbies , and putting a little kid and a lady in charge who are more interested in eating than running the program – they are CRAZY .
Oh well , it is an Italian motorcycle company ( I ’m Italian - American by the way ) , I guess they really are that disorganized . ’
I put on my helmet and started the bike .
I looked around one more time if somebody was going to help me – nothing – so I rode off .
During the ride , it is possible that I inadvertently came close to exceeding some of the rules of the road regarding speed .
As you know , the digital speedometer on the Hypermotard is quite small and hard to read in bright sunlight ;-)
When I reached the fire station on 84 , I saw a whole group of police cars at the side of the road and thought – wow , I ’d better pay attention , I ’d hate to be the guy who they ...
SIRENS … MEGAPHONE SHOUTING AT ME TO PULL OVER … TAKE YOUR HELMET OFF AND PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK !!!...
HANDCUFFS …STUFFED INTO THE BACK OF THE POLICE CAR
So now I ’m sitting in the back of this police car , in full leathers sweating my berries off due to the stifling heat and wrists aching from the handcuffs since my back protector is pushing my arms apart behind me .
For those of you who have not been arrested in your leathers , allow me to strongly not recommend it .
I ’m thinking , ‘ Jesus Christ , the police are n’t messing around with traffic tickets any more around here .
I need to find some new roads to ride . ’
And I was thinking this for quite a while because nobody in law enforcement came over to tell me why they arrested me .
Finally , two guys on Hypermotards pull up with some haste and jump off their bikes .
One of them , a tall blonde guy , appears to be shouting .
The police listen to him as he rants and raves .
A female officer walks over to the patrol vehicle where I ’m cuffed .
“ They say you stole that motorcycle , ” My first reaction was to laugh and think , ‘ this is great , not only am I not getting a traffic ticket , but once I quickly clear up this misunderstanding , I ’ll have a humorous story for my riding buddies . ’
I tell the police officer , “ That ’s funny , this is a just a big misunderstanding .
Tell him to check the paperwork at Alice ’s .
I filled out all the paperwork and they have my driver ’s license information .
My red Triumph Daytona is parked at the country store up there .
This is also so funny because I actually own a Ducati .
I brought my key to Ducati island at Laguna .
They probably have some record that I own one if they want to check . ”
Without expression , the female office walked back to the tall blonde guy .
He starts shouting again – I can hear that he ’s cussing a lot .
She walks back over to me .
“ They said there is no paperwork and that you stole their property and they want to press charges . ”
The mental image of the teenager and the woman fighting over a potato chip filled my mind ’s eye --- SHIT !
Whether I get arrested depends on the competence or honesty of those two clowns !
What if they lost my paperwork ?
What if they thought they lost it , but later found it and do n’t want to admit their mistake ??
How the heck do I prove I signed something when they do n’t give you a copy ???
In an attempt to exonerate myself , I described to the officer in extreme minutiae every facet of how I signed the paperwork and what the people at the Ducati table said – I even mentioned the potato chips .
The officers decided that at this point it might be best to have the tall blonde guy from Ducati and I discuss what had occurred .
Let me tell you , this guy from Ducati was a meathead of the first magnitude .
He ’s shouting and cussing up a storm .
He says ‘ You fucking stole the bike !
You did n’t sign shit !
You took the bike and rode away .
EVERYONE KNOWS IT ’S A GROUP RIDE .
We jumped on our bikes and could n’t catch you .
You are a fucking bike thief ! ”
Now what I really wanted to say was , “ You little bitch , you work for Ducati and you ca n’t keep up with a weekend rider like me ! ” and I think we can all agree , that would have been sweet line to deliver , but a rather Pyrrhic victory given the fact that multiple traffic cops were listening .
Instead , I said , “ Dude , what do you mean by a group ride ?
I ’ve done multiple demo rides with Triumphs and Harley .
You just sign the paperwork , give them your driver ’s license and return the bike in like 30 minutes .
So I signed your paperwork .
They told me the bike number .
They told me to return it in 30 minutes .
The key is sitting there in the bike ’s ignition .
There ’s nothing in front of the bike letting me know I should wait .
Nobody at Ducati is in the least bit helpful , even though I tried to find someone to help me .
I do n’t know why I should have thought anything other than it was a normal test ride .
Funny enough , I 'm actually a registered owner of a Ducati .
I have a 2002 Monster S4 .
Go ahead and look it up . ”
Unbelievably , the meathead is not satisfied .
We ’re toe - to - toe now and he starts cussing at me again ; I fire back with some scathing insults because now I ’m legitimately pissed .
The cops were having none of this and separate us by a quite a few feet .
It was clearly time to escalate this with nuclear tactics I try to reserve for arrogant customer service reps who blame you when the problem is their crappy piece of software : I told the meathead guy that I wanted to know his name and title and who he reports to at Ducati because somebody at Ducati should know what sort of incompetent idiot they have working for them .
My guess is the that this ultimately saved me from being the proud owner of a criminal record or at least large attorney fees .
The police officers walked us much further apart .
One of the police officers spoke with meathead individually , then came to me and said , “ He decided he wo n’t press charges . ”
I found that pretty insulting – to me , this meant that he was still maintaining I stole their bike .
AND when I mentioned to the police officers that if I can’t ride the bike back , then I had no way of getting back to my bike at Alice ’s , the meathead said something to the effect of “ fuck ‘em , let him walk . ”
Thanks Ducati .
One of the police officers ended up giving me a ride back in her car ( and without handcuffs ) , which was nice of her .
… In the end , I did n’t call and get the meathead in trouble with his boss and I did n’t endeavor to change Ducati corporate policy .
But I did buy a brand new red Hypermotard S. Proving two things : it ’s a super fun bike and I ’m just a sucker for motorcycles !

HANDCUFFS …STUFFED
INTO THE BACK OF THE POLICE CARSo now I ’m sitting in the back of this police car , in full leathers sweating my berries off due to the stifling heat and wrists aching from the handcuffs since my back protector is pushing my arms apart behind me .
For those of you who have not been arrested in your leathers , allow me to strongly not recommend it .
I ’m thinking , ‘ Jesus Christ , the police are n’t messing around with traffic tickets any more around here .
I need to find some new roads to ride . ’
And I was thinking this for quite a while because nobody in law enforcement came over to tell me why they arrested me .
Finally , two guys on Hypermotards pull up with some haste and jump off their bikes .
One of them , a tall blonde guy , appears to be shouting .
The police listen to him as he rants and raves .
A female officer walks over to the patrol vehicle where I ’m cuffed .
“ They say you stole that motorcycle , ” My first reaction was to laugh and think , ‘ this is great , not only am I not getting a traffic ticket , but once I quickly clear up this misunderstanding , I ’ll have a humorous story for my riding buddies .
’I tell the police officer , “ That ’s funny , this is a just a big misunderstanding .
Tell him to check the paperwork at Alice ’s .
I filled out all the paperwork and they have my driver ’s license information .
My red Triumph Daytona is parked at the country store up there .
This is also so funny because I actually own a Ducati .
I brought my key to Ducati island at Laguna .
They probably have some record that I own one if they want to check . ”
Without expression , the female office walked back to the tall blonde guy .
He starts shouting again – I can hear that he ’s cussing a lot .
She walks back over to me .
“ They said there is no paperwork and that you stole their property and they want to press charges .
” The mental image of the teenager and the woman fighting over a potato chip filled my mind ’s eye --- SHIT !
Whether I get arrested depends on the competence or honesty of those two clowns !
What if they lost my paperwork ?
What if they thought they lost it , but later found it and do n’t want to admit their mistake ??
How the heck do I prove I signed something when they do n’t give you a copy ???
In an attempt to exonerate myself , I described to the officer in extreme minutiae every facet of how I signed the paperwork and what the people at the Ducati table said – I even mentioned the potato chips .
The officers decided that at this point it might be best to have the tall blonde guy from Ducati and I discuss what had occurred .
Let me tell you , this guy from Ducati was a meathead of the first magnitude .
He ’s shouting and cussing up a storm .
He says ‘ You fucking stole the bike !
You did n’t sign shit !
You took the bike and rode away .
EVERYONE KNOWS IT ’S A GROUP RIDE .
We jumped on our bikes and could n’t catch you .
You are a fucking bike thief !
” Now what I really wanted to say was , “ You little bitch , you work for Ducati and you ca n’t keep up with a weekend rider like me ! ” and I think we can all agree , that would have been sweet line to deliver , but a rather Pyrrhic victory given the fact that multiple traffic cops were listening .
Instead , I said , “ Dude , what do you mean by a group ride ?
I ’ve done multiple demo rides with Triumphs and Harley .
You just sign the paperwork , give them your driver ’s license and return the bike in like 30 minutes .
So I signed your paperwork .
They told me the bike number .
They told me to return it in 30 minutes .
The key is sitting there in the bike ’s ignition .
There ’s nothing in front of the bike letting me know I should wait .
Nobody at Ducati is in the least bit helpful , even though I tried to find someone to help me .
I do n’t know why I should have thought anything other than it was a normal test ride .
Funny enough , I 'm actually a registered owner of a Ducati .
I have a 2002 Monster S4 .
Go ahead and look it up .
” Unbelievably , the meathead is not satisfied .
We ’re toe - to - toe now and he starts cussing at me again ; I fire back with some scathing insults because now I ’m legitimately pissed .
The cops were having none of this and separate us by a quite a few feet .
It was clearly time to escalate this with nuclear tactics I try to reserve for arrogant customer service reps who blame you when the problem is their crappy piece of software : I told the meathead guy that I wanted to know his name and title and who he reports to at Ducati because somebody at Ducati should know what sort of incompetent idiot they have working for them .
My guess is the that this ultimately saved me from being the proud owner of a criminal record or at least large attorney fees .
The police officers walked us much further apart .
One of the police officers spoke with meathead individually , then came to me and said , “ He decided he wo n’t press charges . ”
I found that pretty insulting – to me , this meant that he was still maintaining I stole their bike .
AND when I mentioned to the police officers that if I can’t ride the bike back , then I had no way of getting back to my bike at Alice ’s , the meathead said something to the effect of “ fuck ‘em , let him walk . ”
Thanks Ducati .
One of the police officers ended up giving me a ride back in her car ( and without handcuffs ) , which was nice of her . …
In the end , I did n’t call and get the meathead in trouble with his boss and I did n’t endeavor to change Ducati corporate policy .
But I did buy a brand new red Hypermotard S. Proving two things : it ’s a super fun bike and I ’m just a sucker for motorcycles !

Texas Rep. Gohmert endorses ' BP fund as Nazi enabling act ' argument
This is what I wrote Tuesday , linking to Thomas Sowell 's eye - popping column comparing the BP escrow fund to the enabling act that gave total control of Germany to the Nazis .
The gap between conservative intellectual leadership and Republican politicians on this issue is as wide as we 've ever seen it during the Obama era .
Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Tex . ) , hours later :
There 's a brilliant man named Thomas Sowell .
And , um , I did n't vote for Barack Obama in 2008 , but I sure would have voted for Thomas Sowell .
This man , well , his article says quite a lot .
His editorial , um , says here — and it's just been posted this week — but it says , " When Adolph Hitler was building up the Nazi movement in the 1920 's " — and I 'm quoting from Thomas Sowell in his editorial ...
And he went on to quote from the column , calling defenders of the fund " useful idiots . "
Gohmert is in as much danger of losing re-election as I am of spontaneously combusting * -- the Cook Political Report gives his 1st district of Texas an R +21 rating -- but for the record , here 's a Republican endorsing this argument that I thought was un-endorseable .
This comes via Political Correction , which captured the video :
* i.e. , low .
Sorry , Newsbusters !

You know ...
I love the Smurfs or as the French say les Schtroumpfs .
I even think that the flick with the Smurfs done in 3D animation that is coming out next summer is going to be HUGE .
Way bigger than three apples high .
VALENTINO ROSSI has said he is " not 100 % sure " he will stay with Yamaha MotoGP in 2011 - giving his biggest hint yet that he may go to Ducati .
The Italian is recuperating from a badly broken right leg , following his crash in practice at Mugello circuit , Italy .
" I am not 100 % sure if I will stay with Yamaha - it depends on what happens next year , " said the nine - time world champion .
" I could change bike , ride for Ducati and try to win the world championship with an Italian bike .
That would be a great motivation . "
Indeed it would .
And with Casey Stoner allegedly moving to Repsol Honda in 2011 there 's a red - hot seat just waiting for a certain Italian backside to grace it .

PA concerned about opening of the Rafah border

Abbas visits Erdogan in Istanbul
Hamas : PA depriving residents of the Gaza Strip of passports
The Palestinian Authority is concerned about Turkey ’s increased support for Hamas , a PA official in Ramallah said on Monday .
The official said that the PA leadership was “ unhappy ” with Turkey ’s policy toward Hamas , especially with regard to pressure to lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip unconditionally .
“ Turkey ’s policy is emboldening Hamas and undermining the Palestinian Authority , ” the official told The Jerusalem Post .
“ Of course we want to see the blockade lifted , but Hamas must also end its coup in the Gaza Strip and accept an Egyptian proposal for achieving reconciliation with Fatah .
” The PA is also concerned the reopening of the Rafah border crossing to Sinai would enable Hamas to tighten its grip on the Strip .
“ We wish to remind the Turkish and Egyptian governments that the border crossing was controlled by the Palestinian Authority before Hamas launched its coup in 2007 , ” the official added .
“ If the Rafah border crossing is going to be reopened , that should be done in coordination with us and not with Hamas .
” Azzam al - Ahmed , a top Fatah official in the West Bank , was quoted over the weekend as saying that he was opposed to the lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip until Hamas agreed to end the dispute with his faction .
Ahmed stressed that there was no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip because the PA government was sending aid through Israeli border crossings .
PA President Mahmoud Abbas , who visited Istanbul on Monday , was said to have relayed to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan his concern over the rapprochement between Turkey and Hamas , the official revealed .
Erdogan , according to the official , offered to mediate between the PA and Hamas - an offer that Abbas accepted .
Erdogan declared that ending the power struggle between the rival Palestinian parties “ is a must . ”
He claimed that Hamas had also welcomed a mediation role for Turkey .
Erdogan was speaking to reporters during a joint press conference with Syrian President Bashar Assad , who was also visiting Turkey .
“ Divisions should not continue under the current circumstances , ” Erdogan said .
“ I believe we can make peace between Hamas and Fatah . ” Meanwhile , the Hamas government accused the PA of depriving residents of the Gaza Strip of passports .
The government said the ban had been in effect since July 2008 , effectively preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from being able to travel abroad .
“ The Fatah government in Ramallah does not care about the suffering of the people in the Gaza Strip , who are already under siege , ” a spokesman for the Hamas - controlled Ministry of Interior said .
“ Every citizen is entitled to a passport , and no one has the right to deprive people of getting passports for whatever reason .
” Palestinian passports are normally printed in the West Bank .
Hamas said the PA was refusing , for “ security reasons , ” to send thousands of passports to residents of the Gaza Strip who needed to travel .
According to the Hamas government , many Palestinian academics and “ respected ” figures have been denied passports by the PA government for the same reason .
Parmi les thèmes apparaissant dans le titre , ce qui est le plus important dans mon esprit , et je présume dans le vôtre également , ce sont les défis pour aujourd ’hui ; ils sont en effet bien réels et à certains égards effrayants .
Certains défis concernent même la survie des espèces si l’on parle des armes nucléaires et des menaces pesant sur l’environnement , ces sujets traités lors des récentes conférences de Copenhague sur le climat et de New York sur le Traité de Non-Prolifération ( TNP ) , avec dans les deux cas des résultats qui ne sont guère favorables .
Parmi les autres défis importants , on trouve l’avenir de l ’Union européenne ( actuellement très incertain ) et le rôle des économies émergentes et leurs différentes configurations dans un monde qui se diversifie , avec l ’Organisation de coopération de Shanghai , les BRIC [ Brésil , Russie , Inde , Chine ] , l’Union des nations sud-américaines ( Unasur ) et d’autres .
A une autre échelle , la financiarisation de l’économie des Etats - Unis et des autres économies de premier ordre ( étroitement liée à la montée d’un système de production asiatique ) a eu un impact majeur sur nos sociétés et le système mondial .
Pour prendre un exemple , Martin Wolf , le très respecté commentateur du Financial Times , approuve la conclusion selon laquelle l’origine de la crise des dettes publiques mettant en danger la survie de la zone euro « est la débauche passée de larges segments du secteur privé , en particulier du secteur financier ».
Les marchés financiers , écrit-il , « ont financé l’orgie et maintenant , dans la panique , refusent de financer l’assainissement qui en découle .
A chaque étape , ils ont agi de façon procyclique » , transformant la crise en une catastrophe potentielle .
L’économiste John Talbott ajoute : «
Si quelqu ’un doit être blâmé pour ces crises , ce sont les banques qui ont trop prêté et ce sont donc elles qui devraient payer le prix fort de la restructuration .
» Néanmoins , en s’écartant des pratiques antérieures , le plan de sauvetage adopté par l’Europe reprend un système inventé au cours de la crise actuelle par la Réserve fédérale américaine [ FED ] et le ministère des finances , garantissant aux banques de s’en sortir indemnes .
Aux Etats - Unis , les effets à long terme pour le pays incluent une stagnation pour une majorité de la population et une croissance radicale des inégalités , avec des conséquences potentiellement explosives .
Le pouvoir politique des institutions financières bloque toute réglementation sérieuse , si bien que les crises financières régulières que nous avons connues ces trente dernières années deviendront donc probablement encore plus sévères .
Il n’est pas difficile de poursuivre : on ne manque pas de défis à relever .
Mais on ne peut les comprendre et s’y attaquer de manière sérieuse qu’en les inscrivant dans une perspective plus large .
A un niveau très général , il est utile de garder à l’esprit plusieurs principes de large portée et de grande signification .
Le premier est la maxime de Thucydide : «
Les forts font comme ils l’entendent , et les faibles souffrent comme il se doit .
» Cette maxime a un corollaire important : les systèmes de pouvoir comptent sur des spécialistes en gestion de doctrine , à qui il revient de montrer que ce que font les forts est noble et juste , et que si les faibles souffrent , c’est leur faute .
Il s’agit d’une tendance qui fait honte à l’histoire intellectuelle et qui remonte à ses plus anciennes origines .

Les contours persistants de l’ordre mondial reflètent cette maxime de très près .
Depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale , les Etats - Unis dominent le monde des affaires et continuent de le faire à bien des égards , malgré des changements importants .
Pendant la guerre , des hauts responsables ont compris qu’au bout du compte , les Etats - Unis détiendraient un pouvoir sans précédent dans le monde et ils ont soigneusement planifié l’organisation du monde de l’après - guerre .
Ils ont délimité une « vaste zone » dans laquelle les Etats - Unis détiendraient « un pouvoir incontesté » avec « une suprématie militaire et économique » tout en veillant à la « limitation de tout exercice de souveraineté » de la part des Etats qui pourraient interférer avec leurs intentions planétaires .
La vaste zone devait inclure au moins l’Extrême - Orient et l’ancien empire britannique , y compris les ressources énergétiques de l’Asie occidentale ; le contrôle de ces ressources apporterait « un contrôle important sur le monde » , fit remarquer plus tard un planificateur influent .
Alors que la Russie prenait le dessus sur les armées nazies après la bataille de Stalingrad , les objectifs de la vaste zone se sont étendus aussi loin que possible en Eurasie , au moins jusqu’à sa base économique en Europe de l’Ouest .
Il a toujours été entendu que l’Europe pourrait choisir de suivre une voie indépendante , peut - être la vision gaulliste d’une Europe de l’Atlantique à l’Oural .
L’Organisation du Traité de l’Atlantique Nord ( OTAN ) a été en partie destinée à contrer cette menace et le problème reste tout à fait d’actualité aujourd ’hui .
Les Etats - Unis ont continué à protéger avec zèle leur propre souveraineté , tout en rejetant les revendications de même ordre provenant d’autres pays .
Les Etats - Unis ont contribué à la création des juridictions internationales , mais n’ont accepté leur autorité qu’avec des réserves décisives : en particulier , les Etats - Unis ne seraient pas soumis aux traités internationaux , y compris la charte de l’ONU .
De la même façon , en signant la Convention sur le génocide 40 ans plus tard , les Etats - Unis se sont exemptés de son application .
Ces deux réserves ont été invoquées devant la Cour internationale de justice et la Cour a relaxé les Etats - Unis des accusations d’agression et de génocide pour ces motifs .
Une autre illustration est fournie par la doctrine Clinton prévoyant que les Etats - Unis se réservent un droit de « recours unilatéral à la force militaire » pour s’assurer « un accès sans restriction aux marchés clés , à l’approvisionnement en énergie et aux ressources stratégiques ». Clinton faisait écho à un thème familier .
Dans les premières années suivant la Seconde Guerre mondiale , le diplomate américain George Kennan a expliqué qu’en Amérique latine « la protection de nos matières premières » doit être une préoccupation majeure .
« Nos matières premières » , dont le hasard veut qu’elles se trouvent ailleurs , nous appartiennent de droit .
Telles sont les prérogatives de la puissance selon la maxime de Thucydide .
Une deuxième maxime importante a été formulée par Adam Smith .
Il observa que dans l’Angleterre de son époque « les principaux architectes » de la politique étaient les « marchands et les fabricants ».
Ceux - ci s’assuraient que leurs propres intérêts étaient bien servis sans tenir compte des effets « néfastes » sur les autres , y compris sur le peuple anglais , mais plus gravement encore sur ceux qui souffraient ailleurs de « l’injustice sauvage des Européens » , en particulier en Inde britannique ( qui fut sa principale préoccupation ) .
Dans les démocraties industrielles d’aujourd ’hui , les principaux architectes de la politique sont les institutions financières et les sociétés multinationales .
Une version actuelle de la maxime d’Adam Smith , dans une version plus sophistiquée , est la « théorie d’investissement de la politique » développée par l’économiste politique Thomas Ferguson , qui considère les élections comme des occasions pour des groupes d’investisseurs de s’allier afin de contrôler l’Etat .
Cette théorie permet de faire de très bonnes prédictions politiques sur une longue période .
Depuis les années 1970 , la part des institutions financières dans les bénéfices des entreprises a fortement augmenté , pour atteindre aujourd ’hui environ un tiers aux Etats - Unis .
Leur pouvoir politique a évolué de concert , menant au démantèlement de l’appareil de réglementation qui avait évité les crises financières depuis la Grande Dépression .
Ces institutions financières ont également fourni l’essentiel du soutien à Barack Obama , l’aidant à le porter à la victoire .
Elles s’attendaient à être récompensées , et elles l’ont été , avec un énorme plan de sauvetage , financé par les contribuables , visant à les sauver des conséquences de l’effondrement destructeur de l’économie dont elles portent la plus grande part de responsabilité .
L’un des thèmes principaux dans l’élaboration des politiques des puissants est ce que nous pourrions appeler le « principe de la Mafia » .
Le parrain ne tolère pas de « défi réussi ».
Même le plus petit acte de désobéissance est dangereux .
Il pourrait devenir un « virus » qui « répandra la contagion » , pour emprunter les mots de Henry Kissinger quand il préparait le renversement du gouvernement d’Allende .
En d’autres termes , le virus est un domino qui pourrait faire tomber toute la rangée .
Le principe a été maintes fois invoqué par les Etats - Unis pendant leur période de domination mondiale , et a bien sûr de nombreux antécédents .
Avec le public © Thierry Ngô
Les principes en vigueur dans l’élaboration d’une politique entrent parfois en conflit .
Cuba en est un exemple très instructif .
A une écrasante majorité , le monde s’oppose à l’embargo des Etats - Unis , conçu , comme nous le savons à partir des archives internes , pour punir la population de son incapacité à renverser un gouvernement désobéissant .
Pendant des décennies , la population étasunienne a également été favorable à la normalisation des relations .
Il n’est pas rare que les décideurs ne tiennent pas compte de l’opinion publique mondiale et nationale , mais ce qui est plus intéressant , dans ce cas , c’est que de puissants secteurs de l’économie privée sont également favorables à la normalisation , notamment l’agro - alimentaire , l ’industrie pharmaceutique et les entreprises du secteur énergétique .
La politique consistant à punir les Cubains persiste néanmoins , en violation de la maxime d’Adam Smith mais en accord avec le « principe de la Mafia » .
Les intérêts plus larges de l’Etat priment sur les intérêts commerciaux locaux .
Les mêmes personnes peuvent prendre des décisions différentes en fonction du rôle qu’elles jouent dans les institutions , dans d’autres cas également comme l’Iran d’aujourd ’hui avec des précédents intéressants remontant au renversement du régime parlementaire par les Etats - Unis et le Royaume - Uni [ en 1953 ] : des entreprises du secteur énergétique ont été contraintes par l’Etat à prendre 40 % de la concession britannique , en désaccord avec leurs préférences à court terme mais en accord avec la planification étatique plus large .
Dans le cas de Cuba , les archives et documents historiques sont riches et instructifs .
Quelques mois après que Cuba eut obtenu son indépendance ( en janvier 1959 ) , les Etats - Unis prirent des initiatives pour renverser le régime .
L’une des principales raisons avancées dans les documents internes à l’administration était le « défi réussi » que représentait Cuba pour les politiques étasuniennes ( remontant à la doctrine Monroe de 1823 ) ; il s’agissait là d’un intolérable affront et d’une menace de contagion .
La menace fut immédiatement reconnue par le gouvernement d’Eisenhower , mais plus explicitement par les « libéraux ( 1 ) » de l’équipe de Kennedy qui arriva au pouvoir deux ans plus tard .
Avant son entrée en fonction , le président John Fitzgerald Kennedy mit sur pied une mission pour l’Amérique latine , dirigée par l’historien de gauche Arthur Schlesinger .
Dans son rapport au nouveau président , Schlesinger ne manqua pas de prévenir que d’autres pays pourraient être infectés par la propagation « de l ’idée castriste de prendre en main ses propres affaires » , un danger particulièrement grave , ajoutait - il « quand la distribution des terres et des autres formes de richesse nationale favorise les classes possédantes … et que les pauvres et défavorisés , encouragés par l’exemple de la révolution cubaine , exigent alors des conditions de vie décentes ».
L’ensemble du système de domination pourrait se défaire si l ’idée de prendre en mains son destin devait étendre ses funestes tentacules .
Un vaccin contre le virus de la politique
Dans de telles circonstances , les prescriptions politiques sont sans ambiguïté : il est nécessaire de détruire le virus et de vacciner les victimes potentielles .
Ce traitement standard fut appliqué immédiatement : d’abord lors de l’invasion de la baie des Cochons [ en 1961 ] , et , après cet échec , une vaste campagne fut menée pour apporter « les terreurs de la terre » à Cuba , pour reprendre les mots utilisés par Schlesinger dans sa biographie du frère du président , Robert Kennedy , qui se vit assigner cette tâche comme mission prioritaire .
Cela n’a pas été une mince affaire , en dehors du fait que cela mena le monde à une menace de guerre nucléaire .
En attendant , la région fut protégée de l’infection par le fléau d’une répression sans précédent depuis l’époque des conquistadors .
Cette répression débuta par un coup d’Etat militaire au Brésil en 1964 , planifié par le gouvernement Kennedy qui installa les premiers d’une série d’Etats policiers répressifs comprenant le Chili , l’Uruguay , et les assassins argentins ( comptant parmi les chouchous du président Ronald Reagan ) .
Cette calamité s’étendit à l’Amérique centrale sous le gouvernement Reagan , développant la torture , les tueries en série et autres crimes .
Un fait passé pratiquement inaperçu en Occident a pourtant une grande importance : la vaccination des victimes potentielles consista dans une large mesure en une guerre contre l’Eglise , laissant derrière elle une liste sanglante de martyrs religieux .
En 1962 , lors de Vatican II , le Pape Jean XXIII fut à l’origine d’un effort historique pour réhabiliter le Christianisme des Evangiles qui avait été détruit au quatrième siècle , quand l’empereur Constantin avait fait du Christianisme la religion de l’Empire romain , convertissant « l’Eglise persécutée » en une « Eglise de la persécution » , pour reprendre les mots du distingué théologien Hans Küng .
S’inspirant de Vatican II , les évêques d’Amérique latine adoptèrent « l’option préférentielle pour les pauvres » , renouvelant avec le pacifisme radical des Evangiles .
Des prêtres , des religieuses et des laïcs apportèrent le message des Evangiles aux pauvres et aux persécutés en les encourageant à prendre leur destin en main et à travailler ensemble pour surmonter la misère de la survie sous la contrainte du pouvoir étasunien .
La réaction à cette grave hérésie que constituait la théologie de la libération fut immédiate .
Le coup d’Etat au Brésil en constitua la première étape .
La guerre contre les Evangiles a été consommée en novembre 1989 , quelques jours après la chute du mur de Berlin , quand six intellectuels latino - américains de premier plan , des prêtres jésuites , ont été assassinés par un bataillon d’élite du Salvador , fraîchement sorti de l’école spéciale de guerre « John F. Kennedy » [ John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School ] .
La responsabilité de l’écrasement des efforts faits pour faire renaître le Christianisme n’est pas masquée .
Cette école de formation à la guerre a depuis été renommée l’Ecole des Amériques [ School of the Americas ] .
Célèbre pour son entraînement des tueurs d’Amérique latine , elle annonce fièrement dans son message publicitaire que la théologie de la libération a été « vaincue avec l’aide de l’armée américaine » , avec un petit coup de main du Vatican qui utilisa des moyens plus doux : l’expulsion et l’autocensure .
Nous apprenons beaucoup sur nous - mêmes en comparant un événement qui a dominé l’actualité de novembre dernier [ 2009 ] , avec un non événement du même mois .
L’événement fut la célébration euphorique du vingtième anniversaire de l’émancipation de l’Europe de l’est de la tyrannie russe , saluée comme une victoire de la non-violence et de l’idéalisme , et il s’agit bien de cela .
Le non événement fut le silence qui entoura , dans le même temps , la consommation de la guerre haineuse qui écrasait la théologie de la libération et détruisait « les organisations populaires combattant pour défendre les droits humains les plus fondamentaux » , pour reprendre les mots prononcés par l’archevêque Oscar Romero , « la voix des sans voix » , quelques jours avant son assassinat par ceux - là mêmes qui menaient cette guerre .
La comparaison entre ce qui s’est passé dans les années 1980 au sein des sphères d’influence de la Russie et des Etats - Unis ( ainsi que les réactions que cela a suscité en Occident ) , est très éclairante , mais régulièrement expédiée aux oubliettes d’une histoire inacceptable .
Les guerres d’Indochine , qui comptent sans doute parmi les crimes les plus horribles de l’après - guerre , illustrent également le fonctionnement du « principe de la Mafia ».
Lorsque les Etats - Unis décidèrent de soutenir la guerre meurtrière de la France pour reconquérir son ancienne colonie , la préoccupation centrale était que l’indépendance du Vietnam ne puisse devenir un virus contaminant les autres pays , peut - être même l’Indochine riche en ressources et même enfin le Japon , ce que l’historien John Dower appela le « super domino ».
Le Japon pourrait devenir le centre industriel d’un continent asiatique indépendant , et ceci en établissant le Nouvel Ordre qu’il avait cherché à créer dans les années 1930 .
Les Etats - Unis n’étaient pas prêts à perdre la phase Pacifique de la Seconde Guerre mondiale même si Washington avait bien l’intention de fournir au Japon « une sorte d’empire vers le Sud » , quelque chose comme un Nouvel Ordre pour reprendre la phrase de George Kennan , mais maintenant au sein du système mondial dominé par les Etats - Unis , donc acceptable .
Là aussi , les moyens conventionnels pour faire face à un virus furent mis en œuvre avec une extrême brutalité .
Le virus fut supprimé en démolissant la résistance sud-vietnamienne , puis une grande partie de l’Indochine .
La région fut vaccinée en mettant en place dans les pays voisins de féroces dictatures militaires .
L’Indonésie fut protégée de la contamination par ce que le New York Times appela le « stupéfiant massacre de masse » de 1965 – un « rayon de lumière en Asie » claironna son correspondant de gauche , exprimant ainsi l’euphorie occidentale débridée pour , d’une part , le massacre de centaines de milliers de personnes ( la plupart des paysans sans terre ) et , d’autre part , la destruction du seul parti politique de masse tandis que le pays s’ouvrait à la libre exploitation occidentale , dont les crimes ont été comparés ( par la CIA ) à ceux de Hitler , Staline et Mao .
Le conseiller à la sécurité nationale de Kennedy et Johnson , McGeorge Bundy , fit observer rétrospectivement que la guerre du Vietnam aurait bien pu s’arrêter après que l’Indonésie avait été vaccinée en toute sécurité par cet opportun « stupéfiant massacre de masse ».
Révision de l’histoire
Après l’offensive du
Têt de janvier 1968 , la communauté des affaires étasuniennes conclut qu’il était inutile de prolonger la guerre qui alors nuisait à l’économie du pays .
Le gouvernement suivit à contrecœur .
Comme la politique du gouvernement évolua , l’opinion des élites changea également , et une histoire imaginaire fut inventée dans laquelle tout le monde était une « colombe » qui s’ignorait ( tellement bien cachée qu’on n’en trouvait aucune trace dans les archives ) .
Les équipes de Kennedy réécrivirent leurs premiers récits pour répondre aux nouvelles exigences .
Cette révision de l’histoire fut un succès complet , comme le fut le maintien de limites strictes sur des critiques acceptables A la fin de la guerre , les plus dissidents au sein du courant dominant jugèrent que la guerre était « une erreur » , qu’elle avait débuté par des « efforts maladroits pour faire le bien » , et que , finalement , elle nous coûtait trop cher ( selon Anthony Lewis ) .
Assez étonnamment , pour 70 % de la population peu éclairée , la guerre était « fondamentalement et moralement un mal » , et non « une erreur » .
Les critiques formulées par les élites concernant la guerre en Irak sont très similaires .
Obama , par exemple , est considéré comme un critique de principe de cette guerre parce qu’il l’a jugée comme étant une « erreur stratégique ».
Des critiques semblables de l’invasion russe en Afghanistan avaient paru dans la Pravda .
Nous ne les jugions pas « fondées sur des principes » , alors que c’est ce que devait penser la classe des commissaires d’alors .
Partout les réactions sont tout à fait conformes à la norme historique et aux mêmes principes .
Généralement , on convient que la guerre du Vietnam fut une défaite pour l’Amérique .
C’est exact si l’on prend en compte les objectifs maximaux : le Vietnam n’a pas été transformé en un pays comme les Philippines .
Si toutefois on prend en compte les objectifs principaux , la guerre fut plutôt une réussite .
Le virus a été détruit et la région vaccinée avec succès contre la contamination .
Les conséquences à long terme sont mitigées , mais le succès reste considérable .
Un titre récent du Financial Times en donne un exemple significatif : « Tokyo accepte la défaite de la base navale d’Okinawa ».
L’article indique que « le premier ministre japonais a reconnu hier une défaite concernant ses efforts pour déloger d’Okinawa une base maritime étasunienne dont la présence est controversée , tout en suggérant que le sud de l’île devait continuer à « porter ce fardeau » pour le bien de l’alliance entre Tokyo et Washington » , malgré l’écrasante opposition populaire .
Le Japon est le principal détenteur de la dette des Etats - Unis , mais il reste à l’abri au sein du système mondial .
C’est une des continuités qui mérite notre attention .
Observez en revanche la guerre en Irak .
Les Etats - Unis ont été contraints de céder pas à pas aux pressions populaires réclamant la démocratie et l’indépendance .
Il s’agit d’une grande victoire pour la résistance non-violente .
Les forces d’invasion pouvaient tuer les insurgés et détruire Falloujah , commettant d’horribles crimes de guerre , mais elles n’ont pas été capables de faire face à des centaines de milliers de manifestants exigeant des élections , et à plusieurs reprises Washington à dû faire marche arrière face au nationalisme irakien .
Récemment encore , en janvier 2008 , Washington tenait toujours fermement à ses principaux objectifs de guerre : le président a ainsi indiqué au Congrès qu’il ne tiendrait aucun compte d’une loi qui pourrait entraver l’engagement des Etats - Unis en vue d’établir des bases militaires « permettant le stationnement permanent des forces étasuniennes en Irak » ou « permettant aux Etats - Unis de contrôler les ressources en pétrole de l’Irak ».
Quelques mois plus tard , les Etats - Unis ont dû également abandonner ces objectifs .
Washington a été contraint d’accepter la défaite en Irak devant la résistance nationale irakienne .
Mais l’opposition à l’agression au sein du pays agresseur est un autre élément à prendre en compte .
C’est cette opposition qui a empêché les démocrates « libéraux » d’avoir recours à certaines mesures dont ils pouvaient disposer aux Etats - Unis dans les années 1960 .
Cela compte parmi les vraies réussites du militantisme politique des années 1960 et des traces qu’il a laissées , contribuant à civiliser la société étasunienne .
Cela s’est également produit ailleurs .
Un vainqueur : l’Iran
L’Irak a été pratiquement détruit et les Etats - Unis vaincus , mais il existe un gagnant : l’Iran .
Peu d’analystes sérieux contesteraient la conclusion du correspondant respecté du Financial Times au Moyen - Orient écrivant que l’invasion « a énormément accru l’influence de l’islamisme chiite iranien » ( David Gardner ) pour la plus grande déconvenue des Etats - Unis , de son client israélien et de son protectorat saoudien , celui- ci poursuivant une relation avec les Etats - Unis qui « durera jusqu ’au moment où le dernier baril de pétrole aura été extrait des réserves souterraines saoudiennes » , comme le fait remarquer l’universitaire Gilbert Achcar .
Les analystes en politique étrangère admettent que c’est l’Iran qui constitue la crise majeure actuelle , avec son programme nucléaire .
Aucune personne saine d’esprit ne souhaite que l’Iran , ou n’importe qui d’autre , développe des armes nucléaires .
Toutefois , c’est un peu trompeur de dire que l’Iran défie la « communauté internationale » en poursuivant , au mépris des ordres du Conseil de sécurité et de l’AIEA , son programme d’enrichissement nucléaire .
En fait , le monde est majoritairement opposé au très rude régime de sanctions que les Etats - Unis cherchent à durcir davantage .
L’opposition n’inclut pas seulement les dissidents iraniens , mais aussi les puissances régionales : la Turquie et la Ligue Arabe .
Cette opposition comprend également le Brésil , peut - être le pays le plus respecté de l’hémisphère sud , qui a vigoureusement appuyé le droit de l ’Iran à enrichir de l’uranium , en tant que signataire du TNP .
Il faut faire également un certain effort pour oublier que trois Etats nucléaires ont carrément refusé de signer le TNP : le Pakistan , l’Inde et Israël , tous trois alliés des Etats - Unis , dont les programmes nucléaires bénéficient toujours de l’assistance étasunienne .
En septembre dernier , le Conseil de Sécurité a adopté la résolution 1887 , qui , en dehors de sa condamnation de l ’Iran , a invité tous les Etats à signer le TNP et à résoudre leurs conflits en accord avec la Charte des Nations Unies , qui interdit la menace d’intervention par la force .
Deux Etats violent les termes de cette résolution : les Etats - Unis et Israël , qui insistent pour que « toutes les options soient ouvertes » , y compris les plus violentes .
L’Inde a répondu à la résolution 1887 en annonçant qu’elle peut maintenant fabriquer des armes nucléaires avec le même rendement que les superpuissances .
L’envoyé d’Obama a immédiatement informé l’Inde qu’elle n’est pas assujettie à cette résolution .
L’Inde et le Pakistan continuent de développer des armes nucléaires .
Les relations militaires entre les Etats - Unis , l’Inde et Israël sont même en train de se resserrer .
Bénéficiant des importations « à double usage [ civil et militaire NDT ] » en provenance des Etats - Unis ( et de France également ) , l’Inde passe maintenant aux techniques de destruction les plus avancées : celles - ci comprennent des plateformes d’armes laser dans l’espace et des satellites destructeurs , selon le commandant des forces aériennes .
Au même moment , l’AIEA a adopté une résolution demandant à Israël d’adhérer au TNP et de faciliter l’accès des inspections internationales .
En dépit des objections de l’Europe et des Etats - Unis , qui ont cherché à bloquer la résolution , celle - ci a tout de même été adoptée .
Comme dans le cas de l’Inde , Obama a immédiatement informé Israël qu’il n’était pas soumis à ces exigences , renouvelées encore ces dernières semaines .
Aux Etats - Unis , tout ceci est quasiment passé sous silence , comme en Europe je suppose , mais il est facile de voir pourquoi les accusations d’hypocrisie faites par le président iranien Mahmoud Ahmadinejad peuvent trouver un écho ailleurs .
Obama a également réagi à la résolution 1887 par d’autres moyens .
Le Pentagone a annoncé qu’il allait accélérer la livraison des armes les plus meurtrières disponibles , à l’exception des armes nucléaires .
Il s’agit de bombes de 13 tonnes conçues pour détruire des bunkers profondément cachés et protégés par 5 tonnes de béton armé .
Ce à quoi vont servir ces bombes n’est pas un secret .
La planification de ces « obus d’artillerie massive » a débuté dans les années Bush , mais a traîné en longueur jusqu’à la prise de fonction d’Obama ; il a alors immédiatement demandé que soient accélérés leur développement et leur déploiement .
Ensuite , Obama a envoyé ces armes aux îles Diego Garcia dans l’Océan indien ; il s’agit d’une base importante pour le bombardement du Moyen - Orient et de l’Asie centrale .
Il a aussi envoyé à Diego Garcia un bâtiment de soutien de sous - marins afin d’assister les sous - marins d’attaque rapide et lance - missiles qui opèrent dans les eaux du Moyen - Orient et d’Afrique de l’Ouest , selon l’annonce de la marine étasunienne , non confirmée .
Ce sont de nouvelles menaces contre l’Iran , en violation de la résolution 1887 et de la Charte des Nations Unies .
Il existe un contexte plus large .
Pour ceux qui se sont sérieusement engagés dans la non-prolifération , certaines mesures peuvent être entreprises .
L’une d’entre elles serait la création de zones sans armes nucléaires [ nuclear weapons - free zones , NWFZ ] .
L’Union africaine est parvenue récemment à un accord pour créer une zone de ce type , mais cet accord ne peut être mis en œuvre .
La Grande Bretagne et les Etats - Unis insistent pour que l’île Diego Garcia ne soit pas incluse , car les Etats - Unis l’utilisent pour stocker des armes et des sous - marins nucléaires .
Une zone sans armes nucléaires dans le Pacifique sud connaît les mêmes problèmes .
Au début , c’était la France qui bloquait car elle voulait utiliser ses îles pour des essais nucléaires , maintenant ce sont les Etats - Unis qui bloquent en insistant pour que ses îles du Pacifique bénéficient d’une dérogation .
Le cas le plus significatif se trouve bien sûr au Moyen - Orient où les tensions régionales pourraient être atténuées par la création d’une zone sans armes nucléaires .
C’est une question brûlante dans la région depuis un certain temps , et elle a été une nouvelle fois posée le mois dernier lors de la conférence conjointe des Nations unies et du TNP .
L’Egypte , qui préside le mouvement des non-alignés comptant 118 nations , a fait circuler un appel pour la création d’une zone sans armes nucléaires au Moyen - Orient , comme cela avait été convenu avec l’Occident ( y compris les Etats - Unis ) en 1995 lors de la conférence de révision du TNP .
Washington s’est officiellement engagé , mais insiste pour qu’Israël y fasse exception , et n’a pas laissé entendre que ces dispositions s’appliqueraient à eux-mêmes .
La secrétaire d’Etat Hillary Clinton a déclaré , lors de la conférence du TNP , que ce n’est pas encore le moment de créer une zone sans armes nucléaires au Moyen - Orient .
Washington a par ailleurs insisté pour que ne soient pas acceptées les propositions qui demandent à Israël de se soumettre au contrôle de l’AIEA ou qui invitent les signataires du TNP ( les Etats - Unis en particulier ) à rendre publiques les informations relatives « aux installations et aux activités nucléaires israéliennes , y compris l’information ayant trait aux précédents transferts de technologie nucléaire vers Israël » .
La technique pour se dérober est d’adopter la position d’Israël , demandant que toute proposition soit subordonnée à un règlement de paix total .
Si ce n’est qu’il est soumis à une interdiction effective de la part des Etats - Unis , il existe un accord quasi- unanime sur la façon de régler le conflit israélo - arabe , et cela depuis 1976 .
Il date du moment où des pays arabes de la région introduisirent une résolution au Conseil de sécurité , appelant à un accord pour une solution à deux Etats comprenant la frontière internationale et toutes les garanties prévues par la résolution 242 ( le document de base par accord commun ) .
Les Etats - Unis opposèrent leur veto à cette proposition de résolution en 1976 , et une nouvelle fois en 1980 .
Tout s’est poursuivi à l’identique .
Les principes de base sont soutenus par pratiquement le monde entier , y compris la Ligue arabe , l ’Organisation de la conférence islamique ( comprenant l’Iran ) et des acteurs concernés qui ne sont pas des Etats , dont le Hamas .
Un accord selon ces termes est bloqué par les Etats - Unis et Israël , qui sont à la tête du front du rejet depuis 35 ans , bien qu’il existe une exception décisive et très instructive .
Lors de son dernier mois à la présidence des Etats - Unis , en janvier 2001 , Bill Clinton a entamé des négociations israélo - palestiniennes à Taba , en Egypte qui sont presque parvenues à un accord ( selon les déclarations des participants ) avant qu’Israël ne mette fin aux négociations .
Il est important de rappeler que les Etats - Unis et le Royaume - Uni possèdent une responsabilité unique dans le processus de création d’une zone de non prolifération d’armes atomiques au Moyen - Orient .
Dans leur tentative de fournir en 2003 une mince couverture juridique à leur invasion de l’Irak , ils ont cité la résolution du Conseil de sécurité 687 ( de 1991 ) qui demandait à l ’Irak de mettre fin à son programme de développement d’armes de destruction massive .
Les Etats - Unis et le Royaume - Uni prétendaient que cela n’avait pas été fait .
Nous n’avons pas besoin de nous attarder sur ce prétexte mais notons que cette résolution engage ses signataires à créer une zone de non prolifération d’armes atomiques au Moyen - Orient .
La destruction de l’environnement
J’ai dit que la prolifération des armes nucléaires est l’un des deux défis qui mettent littéralement en danger la survie de notre espèce .
Cette question n’est pas prise en compte malgré l’impressionnante rhétorique déployée .
Il en va de même pour la deuxième menace : la destruction de l’environnement .
Ce qui se passe aux Etats - Unis est particulièrement important , comme toujours , mais est également très révélateur .
Le secteur des entreprises mène une campagne massive de propagande pour que l’opinion publique abandonne ses préoccupations concernant le changement climatique lié aux activités humaines , et avec le plus grand succès puisque cette conviction a baissé et réunit maintenant tout juste un tiers de la population .
Les responsables à qui revient cette tâche de propagande , visant à lutter contre cette conviction , savent aussi bien que nous que le « canular progressiste » est bien réel et que les perspectives sont peu réjouissantes ( 2 ) .
Ils s’acquittent en fait du rôle que les institutions leur ont assigné .
Dans une économie de marché , ces responsables doivent agir de façon à maximiser les gains à court terme .
S’ils ne le font pas , ils seront remplacés par d’autres , qui eux le feront .
D’ailleurs , selon le droit anglo - américain des sociétés , il s’agit d’une obligation juridique .
Ce qui signifie qu’ils ne doivent pas tenir compte des externalités ( l’impact d’une opération à l’extérieur de l’entreprise ) .
Dans ce cas , le sort de l’espèce humaine est une externalité qu’ils doivent écarter dans la mesure où l’économie de marché prévaut .
La logique est la même lorsque des directeurs de sociétés financières ne prennent pas en compte le risque systémique , tout en sachant qu’en agissant de la sorte ils provoqueront une crise financière .
Dans ce cas , leur comportement n’est pas irrationnel .
Ils savent qu’après l’effondrement du château de cartes qu’ils construisent , ils peuvent aller se mettre à l’abri de ce qu’ils appellent l’Etat nourricier , tout en serrant fort leur livres de Hayek , Friedman et Rand .
Il n’existe pas de tels recours lorsque les externalités liées à la destruction de l’environnement sont ignorées .
Il n’est pas facile toutefois de surmonter les nécessités institutionnelles .
Les deux grandes menaces pesant sur notre survie demeurent redoutables .
L’effacement des nations
Passons à un autre sujet , il y a en ce moment beaucoup de discussions agitées concernant un grand changement de pouvoir dans le monde .
Les spéculations vont bon train pour savoir si ( ou quand ) la Chine pourrait , avec l’Inde , remplacer les Etats - Unis comme puissance dominante mondiale .
Si cela devait arriver , cela signifierait que le système mondial redeviendrait proche de ce qu’il était avant les conquêtes européennes .
Les taux de croissance des PIB chinois et indien ont été , en effet , très spectaculaires ces derniers temps .
Mais il faut ajouter quelque chose .
L’indice de développement humain ( IDH ) des Nations unies indique que l’Inde occupe toujours une place proche du bas du classement : la 134ème , légèrement au - dessus du Cambodge , au - dessous du Laos et du Tadjikistan .
La Chine se place à la 92ème place , un peu au - dessus de la Jordanie , en dessous la République Dominicaine et l’Iran .
L’Inde et la Chine souffrent également d’inégalités très fortes , si bien que plus d’un milliard de leurs habitants se trouvent beaucoup plus bas dans ce classement .
En outre , une comptabilité précise irait au - delà des mesures faites actuellement en prenant en compte les coûts très sérieux que la Chine et l’Inde ne peuvent plus ignorer ; l’écologie , la diminution des ressources naturelles et bien d’autres choses encore .
Les spéculations sur le changement de pouvoir dans le monde négligent quelque chose que nous savons tous : les nations , n’occupant plus la même place dans le système interne de distribution du pouvoir , ne sont pas les vrais acteurs au sein des affaires internationales , un truisme porté à notre attention par cet incorrigible radical d’Adam Smith , comme nous en avons déjà parlé .
En gardant à l’esprit le truisme radical d’Adam Smith , on s’aperçoit qu’il existe en effet un changement de pouvoir dans le monde mais pas celui qui occupe le devant de la scène .
Il s’agit d’un déplacement allant de la main d’œuvre mondiale vers le capital transnational , ce déplacement s’étant nettement intensifié pendant les années de néolibéralisme .
Le coût en est très lourd , y compris pour les travailleurs étasuniens qui sont victimes de la financiarisation de l’économie et de la délocalisation de la production et qui ne parviennent à maintenir leurs revenus qu’en s’endettant et en créant des bulles de valeurs .
Les paysans indiens sont affamés et des millions de travailleurs chinois sont en lutte : la part du travail dans le revenu national y décroît plus rapidement que dans la plupart des autres pays .
La Chine joue un rôle de premier plan dans le changement réel du pouvoir mondial , elle est devenue en grande partie une usine d’assemblage au sein d’un système régional de production .
Martin Hart - Landsberg a traité cette question dans un ouvrage important ( 3 ) .
Le Japon , Taiwan et d’autres économies d’Asie exportent des pièces et des composants vers la Chine et lui fournissent également la plus grande partie de la technologie de pointe .
On s’est beaucoup préoccupé de la hausse du déficit commercial des Etats - Unis avec la Chine mais on a fait moins de cas du déficit commercial croissant des Etats - Unis avec le Japon et les autres pays d’Asie au moment où le système de production régional se met en place .
Le Wall Street Journal en conclut que si l’on comptait uniquement la valeur ajoutée des constructeurs chinois , le véritable déficit commercial entre les Etats - Unis et la Chine serait réduit dans une proportion de 30 % alors que le déficit commercial entre les Etats - Unis et le Japon augmenterait de 25 % .
Les constructeurs étasuniens suivent le même chemin en fournissant des pièces et des composants à la Chine , qui les assemble et les exporte en retour en grande partie vers les Etats - Unis .
Pour les institutions financières , les géants de la distribution , les propriétaires et les gestionnaires des industries manufacturières ainsi que pour les secteurs étroitement liés à ces centres de pouvoir , tout cela est merveilleux .
Mais ce n’est pas le cas pour la majorité des Américains dont les revenus stagnent depuis trente ans au milieu d’une concentration stupéfiante de richesse , de l’effondrement des systèmes d’aide et des infrastructures ; tout ceci conduisant à une situation intérieure des plus inquiétantes .
Nous observons des développements similaires en Europe et ailleurs .
La situation en Afghanistan
Enfin , on devrait dire quelques mots au sujet de l’Afghanistan .
Dans la première opération de la nouvelle stratégie d’Obama , les Marines étasuniens ont conquis Marjah , une petite ville faisant partie de la province du Helmand , le principal foyer de l’insurrection .
Le New York
Times signale que :
« Les Marines se sont heurtés à l’identité des talibans , une identité tellement dominante que l’on peut décrire ce mouvement comme un parti unique dont l’influence touche tout le monde dans la ville .
Nous devons reconsidérer notre définition du mot « ennemi » a déclaré Larry Nicholson , commandant de la brigade Marine expéditionnaire dans la province du Helmand .
« La plupart des gens ici se considèrent comme des talibans ...
Nous avons à réajuster notre manière de penser de façon à ne pas chasser les talibans de Marjah , c’est l’ennemi que nous essayons de chasser » , a -t - il déclaré . »
Les Marines sont confrontés à un problème qui a toujours harcelé les conquérants .
Il s’agit d’un problème bien connu des anciens Marines du Vietnam .
Le plus grand érudit du gouvernement d’alors se lamentait que l’ennemi était le « seul véritable parti politique possédant une assise populaire » et que tous les efforts faits pour se mesurer à lui sur le plan politique ressemblerait à un affrontement entre le menu fretin et une baleine .
C’est en utilisant notre avantage comparatif – la violence – que nous avons donc dû surmonter leur force politique .
D’autres ont connu des problèmes similaires , par exemple les Russes en Afghanistan dans les années 1980 : ils ont gagné toutes les batailles mais ont perdu la guerre .
Après le triomphe de Marjah , les forces dirigées par les Etats - Unis s’apprêtent à donner l’assaut sur la ville principale de Kandahar où , d’après les sondages de l’armée étasunienne , 95 % de la population s’oppose à l’opération militaire et 5 personnes sur 6 considèrent les talibans comme « nos frères afghans ».
Encore une fois , cela fait écho aux conquêtes antérieures .
Contrôle des cerveaux
Dans ces conditions , il n’est pas étonnant que les autorités soient préoccupées par le fait que le soutien intérieur puisse s’éroder davantage encore .
Une « fuite » récente émanant d’un rapport de la CIA , fait remarquer que « le peu d’informations livrées au public concernant la mission en Afghanistan a permis aux dirigeants allemands et français de ne pas tenir compte de l’opposition populaire et d’augmenter régulièrement leur contingent militaire pour la Force internationale d’assistance et de sécurité ( FIAS ) .
Berlin et Paris conservent respectivement le troisième et le quatrième rang en termes de forces militaires présentes au sein de la FIAS , malgré l’opposition de 80 % des Allemands et des Français à l’augmentation du déploiement des troupes au sein de la FIAS ( selon un sondage datant de l’automne dernier ) » .
Il est donc nécessaire « d’adapter le message » pour « prévenir ou du moins contenir d’éventuelles réactions violentes ».
Pour la France , la CIA recommande d’avoir recours à une propagande élaborée pour prendre en compte le « profond souci pour les civils et les réfugiés » et pour provoquer le sentiment de culpabilité des Français lié à leur abandon .
Le rapport recommande de mettre particulièrement en avant la question de l’éducation des filles qui peut devenir « un point de ralliement pour l’opinion publique française en grande partie laïque , et donner aux électeurs une raison de soutenir une cause nécessaire malgré les victimes ».
Les faits , comme d’habitude , n’ont pas la moindre importance .
On peut prendre par exemple les progrès de l’éducation des filles à Kaboul lors de l’occupation russe , ou le véritable impact des opérations militaires .
Le rapport de la CIA doit nous rappeler que les Etats possèdent un ennemi intérieur : leur propre population , qui doit être contrôlée quand elle s’oppose à la politique de l’état .
Ce problème se pose même dans les Etats totalitaires .
L’Allemagne nazie a ainsi dû disputer une guerre « des armes et du beurre » pour tenir le public en respect .
Dans les sociétés plus démocratiques , le recours à la force doit être remplacé par une propagande efficace dans la « bataille éternelle pour contrôler le cerveau des hommes » et pour « fabriquer un consentement » grâce à des « illusions nécessaires » et par une « simplification extrême , puissante émotionnellement ».
( Pour citer Reinhold Niebuhr , le philosophe préféré des chefs d’entreprise et d’Obama , vénéré par les personnalités de l’establishment pour des motifs intéressants mais que je vais devoir laisser de côté . )
La bataille pour contrôler l’ennemi intérieur est en ce moment tout à fait à propos , et devrait être une préoccupation de première importance pour ceux qui veulent faire face de manière constructive aux graves défis d’aujourd ’hui .
Safe - sex messages have not stopped .
If anything , they are harder - hitting .
A recent one features the leering face of a creepy middle - age man .
“ You would n’t let him sleep with your teenage daughter , ” it says .
“ Why are you sleeping with his ? ”
Another shows a frightened child saying , “ My mommy is sick because of the sexual network . ”
Many Africans , researchers say , are in one or more relationships that may include sex only infrequently but last for years .
Some are open , as in polygamy ; many are clandestine , as with old lovers , bosses or even , perhaps , an abusive uncle who can not be shaken off .
In such networks , infections spread rapidly .
Also , men here , like many men everywhere , complain about condoms .
The arrival of AIDS drugs let some go back to old habits .
“ When you are sick , you are tired , you are impotent , ” said George Bitti , 58 .
“ But when you are on the drugs for a certain period , you become strong , you regain your body .
And you start going again for sex . ”
But even before drugs arrived , powerful societal forces were arrayed against safe sex .
“ According to African culture , the man is the overlord , ” said Peace Atwongyeire , 42 , a handsome counselor whose face adorns local billboards saying she is not ashamed to be H.I.V.- positive .
“ You have to say yes . ”
Because a man buys a wife from her father for cows or cash , he “ owns ” her .
If she refuses sex or insists on a condom , he may beat her or throw her out of the house .
Also , condoms thwart pregnancy , and “ I prove my manhood by having children , ” said Mr. Bitti , a father of 14 .
“ That is how a girl proves she is a woman .
In Africa , you cannot tell anyone to stop having children .
They will even think , ‘ I would rather have AIDS and leave my children when I die .
At least I will have produced my three . ’ ”
In a hurry ?

The context
A while ago I found out about Sikuli , a very interesting project which allows people to script actions in GUIs based on screenshot excerpts .
The idea is that you basically take images representing portions of your screen , like a button , or a label , or an icon , and then create a script which can detect a position in the screen which resembles one of these images , and perform actions on them , such as clicking , or hovering .
I had never imagined something like this , and the idea got me really excited about the possibilities .
Imagine , for instance , what can be done in terms of testing .
Testing of GUIs is unfortunately not yet a trivial task nowadays .
We do have frameworks which are based on accessibility hooks , for instance , but these sometimes ca n’t be used because the hook is missing , or is even far off in terms of the context being tested ( imagine testing that a browser can open a specific flash site successfully , for instance ) .
So , Sikuli opened my eyes to the possibility of using image matching technology in a GUI automation context , and I really wanted to play with it .
In the days following the discovery , I fiddled a bit , communicated with the author , and even submitted some changes to make it work well in Ubuntu .
Then , the idea cooled down in my head , and I moved on with life .
Well … until two weeks ago .
Right before heading to the Ubuntu Developer Summit for the next Ubuntu release , the desire of automating GUIs appeared again in the context of the widely scoped Ubuntu - level testing suite .
Then , over the first few days last week , I was able to catch up with quite a few people which were interested in the concept of automating GUIs , with different purposes ( testing , design approval , etc ) , which of course was all I needed to actually push that old desire forward .
Trying to get Sikuli to work , though , was quite painful .
Even though I had sent patches upstream before , it looks like the build process is n’t working in Ubuntu again for other reasons ( it ’s not a polished build process , honestly ) , and even if I managed to make it work and contributed that to the upstream , in the end the path to integrate the Java - based tool in the Python - based testing framework which Ubuntu uses ( Mago ) was n’t entirely straightforward either .
Reinventing the wheel
So , the the itch was in place , and there was a reason to let the NIH syndrome take over a bit .
Plus , image processing is something I ’d like to get a foot in anyway , so it felt like a good chance to have a closer look and at the same time contribute a small bit to potential quality improvements of Ubuntu .
That ’s when Xpresser was born .
Xpresser is a clean room implementation of the concepts explored by Sikuli , in the form of a Python library which can be used standalone , or embedded into other programs and testing frameworks such as Mago .
The project is sponsored by Canonical , and licensed under the LGPL .
Internally , it makes use of opencv for the image matching , pyatspi for the event generation ( mouse clicks , etc ) , gtk for screen capturing and testing ( of itself ) , and numpy for matrix operations .
Clearly , the NIH syndrome , was n’t entirely active . :-)
As a side note , I have n’t played with numpy and gtk for some time , and I ’m always amazed by the quality of these modules .
Contribute code and ideas
Concluding this post , which is already longer than I expected , the basics of Xpresser are in place , so go ahead and play with it !
That said , there are quite a few low hanging fruits to get it to a point of being a really compelling GUI - driving library , so if you have any interest in the concept , I invite you to play with the code and submit contributions too .
If you want ideas of what else could be done , let ’s have a chat .
Image caption Seals use their super - sensitive whiskers to track movements in the water
Harbour seals may be able to detect fish up to 100 m ( 328 ft ) away using only their whiskers , say scientists .
Researchers used an artificial fish in their experiment , to create a " trail " in the water that a seal could detect .
The described how a trained seal , named Henry , was able to indicate , with a twitch of its head , whether the fish moved to the right or to the left .
The team described the study in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Image caption
The seal wore a mask and headphones for the experiment
The study was led by Wolf Hanke of the Marine Science Centre at the University of Rostock , Germany .
He explained how the seal wore a blindfold and headphones during the experiment to ensure that it could only pick up sensations from the water with its whiskers .
" The animals are actually enthusiastic to wear the mask because it means play time and [ food rewards ] , " explained Dr Hanke .
He and his colleagues carried out the experiment in an open - air pool in a zoo in Cologne .
" We had a small box in the pool to achieve calm water conditions , " he explained .
" The seal was trained to wait at a ball target and , when signalled , it entered the box . "
Inside the box , the scientists created a trail with their artificial fish , which was essentially a rubber fin on a stick that created a trail similar to the swimming motion of a real fish .
They operated the fin from outside the box , moving it from left to right or from right to left .
The seal responded to the movement by turning its head in the direction that the fin had moved .
Hunting by whisker
The seal was able sense and indicate the direction in which the fin travelled up to 35 seconds after the movement had stopped .
" A fish can cover tens and hundreds of metres in that time , so whiskers compare well with the performance of whales and dolphins by echolocation , " Dr Hanke explained .
He believes that seals may also be able to " analyse " the structure of a trail to " work out " more about its source .
He and his colleagues have already embarked on experiments using different shapes of fin to create different water disturbances .
" They seem to be able to discriminiate between different shapes , which might even mean they discriminate between different species of fish , " he told BBC News .
" And we had a surprising result from an experiment with one seal following another , " he said .
" The trail left by the first seal was two metres wide , and the second , following seal was able to stay right in the middle of it , so it seems they can analyse the internal structure of a trail . "
The researchers are now embarking on experiments using live fish , to see how closely seals are able to follow their complex trajectory .
The U.S. has launched criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill — the latest move by the Obama administration to show it is taking aggressive action amid bipartisan criticism of its response to the disaster .
" We have what we think is a sufficient basis for us to have begun a criminal investigation , " said U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Tuesday after meeting in New Orleans with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from the region .
Mr. Holder noted that 11 people died in the April 20 rig ...
BP ’s engineers can’t stop the gushing oil spill , but a young genius from Long Island says she found the solution in less time than it takes most people to finish a crossword puzzle .
Since the “ top kill , ” “ junk shot ” and “ top hat ” techniques failed to end the environmental nightmare , Alia Sabur — who started her engineering Ph.D. at age 14 — is pushing for a more radical idea .
The Northport native , who started reading before she could walk and who at 18 broke a 300 - year - old record to become the youngest - ever college professor , proposes surrounding a pipe with deflated automobile tires , inserting it into the leaking riser , and then inflating the wheels to form a seal .
HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE THE CRISIS ?
LEAVE YOUR SUGGESTIONS HERE
She calls the plan the “ seabed retread . ”
“ It ’s not completely out there , considering that tires are used for everything and they ’re expected to withstand a lot , ” Sabur , 21 , told The Post .
The idea came to her while watching television reports of the failed attempts to plug the hole last week , she said .
And she had it all worked out in a just a few minutes , sketching it out on paper .
“ I ca n’t believe that at this point , with all our technology , that something like this can happen and devastate an entire area , ” she said .
“ Even at the smallest estimate , it ’s still a lot of oil . ”
Since BP ’s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , more than 40 million gallons of crude have spilled into the Gulf .
Sabur , who is finishing her doctorate in engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia , said it frustrated her that none of BP ’s solutions seemed to have any success .
The oil company has tried to drop containment domes over the leaks , but one missed its mark and the other got clogged with an icy mix of methane gas and water .
It has also tried pumping mud , golf balls , tire scraps and other objects into the well to stop the flow .
“ I figured experts would know more about it than I did but their ideas did n’t work , ” she said .
“ So I started thinking about it . ”
The prodigy , who has received awards and fellowships from NASA and the Department of Defense , decided to take a different tack from BP ’s latest strategy , the “ lower marine riser package , ” in which the riser pipe is cut and a housing is placed over it to collect the oil .
“ This was a thought experiment , ” she said .
“ They tried covering it and now they ’re trying to block it , and it seems they are trying things that go on it or around it .
“ I started thinking of something that goes inside it . ”
The tires might not be able to fully inflate inside the pipe , but the resulting seal would be able to stem the flow of oil and redirect it into a new pipe , she said .
A valve in the pipe could be closed to block the oil or open to allow it to flow , presumably to a ship on the surface .
Sabur admitted that she ’s not certain the inflated tires would be enough to hold the new pipe in place .
“ But if it works , then it might be possible to then put something on top of it — to brace the inserted pipe — to do something more permanent , ” she said .
“ Obviously , I hope that what they ’re doing now works .
It ’s just absolutely terrible . ”
Even if her idea fails to stave off further catastrophe , Sabur has an amazing history .
At the age of 2 , she started reading novels , and at 11 she played the clarinet with the Rockland Symphony Orchestra .
She has n’t yet been able to get her idea to BP , but thinks they should consider it if other efforts fail .

I vividly remember taking a class on terrorism in college , in which the professor memorably pointed out , as we were knee deep in debate over The Troubles , " None of you are asking the obvious question :
Why the heck do the British want to stay in Northern Ireland ?
Guinness ? "
My family hails , a long time back , from bandit country in Northern Ireland , and the question was at first incomprehensible .
At the time , Northern Ireland seemed like the most valuable piece of real estate on the planet -- emotionally , at least .
And yet , my professor was right .
It was n't really adding much to the economic and political life of Great Britain except a big headache .
This is sort of the question I had this weekend , watching this gigantic new bailout effort unfold .
I understand the tactical and even the strategic value of each individual move .
But the goal of all of this eludes me .
Is the euro really so marvelous that it must be saved at all costs ?
How much do France , Germany , etc really get out of Greek euro membership ?
After all , it is n't Greek 's commitment to the euro , per se , that is driving its debt yields down this week .
It 's the apparently open - ended promise that the European Central Bank will monetize however much debt Greece cares to borrow , and that if this fails anyway , the other countries will bail Greece out .
Maybe this does n't matter so much for Greece , which is relatively small .
But monetizing the debt will have big consequences if you add Spain or Italy to the list of countries on ECB life support .
The fiscal cost of helping the bigger countries out will also , obviously , be horrendous .
Texting is more popular among girls than boys , the survey showed Texting has become the most popular form of communication among young people in the US , research indicates .
The study , by the Pew Internet and American Life Project , suggests that texting has eclipsed mobile phone calls among teenagers for the first time .
More than 30 % of teens send more than 100 texts a day , it shows .
Researchers say more payment plans offering unlimited texts have helped to create the surge in the US , which used to lag other parts of the world .
' Communication hub '
The study found that two - thirds of teenagers are now more likely to text their friends than call them on the phone .
Girls on average send or receive more texts than boys - 80 messages per day compared to 30 .
" Texting is now the central hub of communication in the lives of teens today , and it has really skyrocketed in the last 18 months , " said Amanda Lenhart , a co-author of the report .
" The widespread availability of unlimited texting plans has transformed communication patterns of American teens . "
" This is a shift in the location and style of teens ' communication with friends , not necessarily a radical change or expansion of it , " she added .
The study 's authors said teenagers preferred texting to phone calls because it could be carried out under the noses of parents , teachers or other authority figures .
" We have kind of hit a tipping point where teens now expect other teens to respond to text messaging and to be available , " Ms Lenhart said .
" There is definitely an element of text messaging that fits so seamlessly into their lives . "
However , the study found that phone calls are still teenagers ' preferred method for contacting their parents .

On Saturday night , the Wizards and all of MLS , returned from their two week hiatus during group play of the FIFA World Cup and began the second " half " ( more like two - thirds ) of the season .
The Wizards took on the New York Red Bulls Saturday night at Community America Ballpark failing to score a goal and ultimately losing 3 - 0 .
But , for now , as was kind of the theme in the previous post , more " getting to know " the team for anyone that may be just starting their soccer fandom .
A quick rundown of where the Wizards stand and how they got there , shall we ?
March 27 - Wizards : 4 -0 : DC United
With the large roster turnover from last season to this , no one really knew what to expect from the Wizards before the season started .
Things kicked off on a cold and rainy night in Kansas City with the Wizards taking rival United , and former Wizards manager turned United manager Curt Onalfo , behind the woodshed for a good old - fashioned beatin ' .
Winger Ryan Smith scored one goal and assisted on another from Kei Kamara , while Davy Arnaud blasted home a rocket from 20 yards out and Jack Jewsbury made it 4 - 0 on a well taken penalty kick .
There was little United resistance , which made for the perfect opener to the season .
Match highlights
April 10 - Wizards : 1 - 0 : Colorado Rapids
Each team came in unbeaten and looking to establish themselves as contenders in their respective conferences - Kansas City in the East and Colorado in the West .
In a game that saw few chances on goal Wizards keeper Jimmy Nielsen managed to snuff out Colorado 's best scoring opportunity of the game with his face , while Kamara scored his second goal of the season with a well taken snap header off a Smith free kick .
The Wizards had started 2 - 0 and soccer writers were starting to take notice .
The publicity came , but was it all a bit too soon ?
Match highlights
April 17 - Seattle Sounders : 1 - 0 : Wizards
For 91 minutes , the Wizards matched Seattle chance for chance and were absolutely deserving of the point in the standings for a tie .
Then , in the second minute of stoppage time in the second half , the KC backline flinched for only a second and Seattle capitalized with the winning goal by Michael Fucito .
The fact that the goal should have never occurred , due to the player throwing the ball in being allowed to run far more length down the sideline than a player should be , ( and was even acknowledged by MLS afterwards ) offered consolation to fans that the Wizards could play with anyone in the league and hold their own .
To add injury to insult , central defender Jimmy Conrad left the game in the first half with a calf strain that would keep him out the next two games .
Wizards ' goalless streak : 132 minutes and counting ( which will become a theme )
Match highlights
April 24 - Kansas City : 0 - 0 : LA Galaxy
In a game that saw the Wizards look like the better team for 90 minutes against the top team in the league , the highlight ( or lowlight if you 're a Wizards fan ) came in the 16th minute when Kamara made world headlines for all the wrong reasons .
In what quickly became the new ‘ miss of the century , ' Kei somehow managed to slip on the wet field , land on the ball - sitting on the goal line - and squirt it across with his upper arm .
He was rightfully called for handball and neither team built up much more pressure on goal the rest of the game .
Wizards ' goalless streak : 222 minutes and counting
Match highlights
May 1 - Houston Dynamo : 3 - 0 : Wizards
Conveniently taking place on " May Day , " the Wizards trip to Space Town came crashing down to earth in a heaping pile of sucktitude .
This season 's newly appointed captain Arnaud was sent off with a straight red after a questionable call on a questionable challenge against the Dynamo keeper .
Already playing down a goal before going down a man too , KC was able to put little pressure on Houston before the game was sealed up with a pair of second half goals to embarrass the Wizards .
Wizards ' goalless streak : 312 minutes and counting
Match highlights ( if you can call them that )
May 5 - DC United : 2 - 1 : Wizards
Later that week , in what would be the Wizards ' only ESPN network televised game of the season , against a team they had dismantled on opening night , KC continued to look lost in the opponent 's third of the field and the theme of silly defending gaffs continued .
As has been the case with the US national team in the World Cup , going down a goal or two early makes life difficult .
Two Danny Allsopp goals for United in the first half crippled KC 's hopes of ending 1 ) their three game winless streak , 2 ) their points - less on the road streak , or 3 ) their dreadful goalless streak until the 93rd minute , when Kamara got his third of the year on a meaningless goal coming off a Teal Bunbury cross , mercifully ending the streak at 404 minutes .
Zero points in the last four games , and a season that started so brightly was spiraling downward quickly .
Match highlights
May 15 - Wizards : 2 - 2 : Chicago Fire
Bad news on the injury front : holding midfielder Stephane Auvray has strained a knee ligament earlier in the week in practice and would require arthroscopic surgery .
He has yet to return to the field to date .
So , down a goal in the first half and then another three minutes after halftime and we were headed down the same ugly path that was the month of April .
Then , something changed .
Perhaps it was the soccer gods feeling as if they had given KC fans enough torture for the time being , or maybe it was the team finally playing closer to their potential .
Kamara fired home a second half brace ( soccer jargon for ‘ two goals ' ) and the Wizards were tied at two .
After the first , you knew a second was coming .
After the second , you knew a third was coming .
It nearly did when Josh Wolff fired a laser beam from the 18 yard box , just over the crossbar .
Either way , they had fought back from certain defeat and rescued a valuable home point .
This had to be the start to another positive run of results , right ?
Match highlights
May 23 - Wizards : 0 - 1 : Columbus Crew
Wrong .
To many , Columbus is known as " the most boring team in MLS . "
Not that they play " bad " soccer , but they do play " boring " soccer .
Their strategy - lots of extended periods of possession including lots of backwards passes - is unquestionably efficient ; it just leaves a lot left to be desired from a game .
All it took was a single slip up from the KC defense to leave one man unmarked on a corner kick for the Crew to bang home a header for the game 's only goal .
Match highlights
May 29 - Real Salt Lake : 4 - 1 : Wizards
Real Salt Lake are the defending MLS champions .
They are a very good team and deserve much credit for that .
But , there is no way the Wizards had any business being embarrassed in such fashion on this day .
A total lack of concentration and a severe lack of attention to the minor details doomed them from the start .
After the game with Chicago , regular leftback Roger Espinoza left the team for World Cup camp with his Honduran teammates .
In his place , coach Vermes switched regular rightback Michael Harrington into his spot on the other side of the field .
And on this day , Real took severe advantage of rightback replacement Jonathon Leathers .
Real winger Fabian Espindola ran circles around Leathers all day .
Though two of the four goals came after the 80th minute , the game was in little doubt most of the way .
Match highlights
June 5 - Toronto FC : 0 - 0 : Wizards
This was the kind of game that sets the sport of soccer back six steps in America .
Even as an avid soccer and Wizards fan , this was the quintessential , ugly , boring zero - zero soccer draw that people hate on so badly .
They had all the right in the world to talk after this one .
After recent struggles not only on the road , but at home too , a point is a point .
Especially on the road .
Match highlights
June 10 - Wizards : 2 -0 : Philadelphia Union
Expansion teams are for beating up on , right ?
They 're supposed to be an easy win when you look at the schedule .
So , why could n't the Wizards start the second half of the season against them , rather than to finish the first half ?
Regardless , the three " easy " points against the expansion Union were much needed .
Heading into the game , the Wizards found themselves sitting near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings , with only Philly below them .
It had been nine games since the Wizards had last won a game - the second game of their season , all the way back on April 10 .
Two full months without a league victory .
Amazingly , with all the draws they sprinkled in throughout the streak , the Kamara and Graham Zusi goals helped move the team into fifth place in the East and only three points out of the playoff race .
When Kei fired his missile from the corner of the 18 yard box in the first half for his sixth goal of the year , the Wizards also had their first lead in nine games .
Match highlights
As downright frustrating as they were at points this season , ( and it was really frustrating ) the Wizards could maybe finally be gelling at the right time of the season to put together a string of results and work their way up the standings .
One this is for sure , though - they 're going to be a team that nobody really wants to play .
And , I hope that you 'll come along for the ride .
I blogged about George Donnelly 's arrest and release last week outside a Allentown , PA , courthouse for videotaping FIJA activists handing out information , but he was released merely into house arrest , and faces a possible eight years in jail for allegedly assaulting one of the federal agents who accosted him .
This report from the " Photography Is Not A Crime " blog has some details , though Donnelly himself is not talking to the press about it right now :
He is specifically being accused of striking one of the officers .
Anybody who has seen the two previous videos where Donnelly was confronted by federal officers in front of a courthouse will find these charges hard to believe .
After all , Donnelly has a tendency to remain courteous even when getting threatened with violence .
Nevertheless , the federal government is charging him with assaulting , resisting , or impeding certain United States Government officers or employees , which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison .
The evidence , of course , lies in the videotape they confiscated from him .
We 'll be lucky if that ever makes the light of day .
A Victorian state MP is lobbying to have musician Yusuf Islam , formerly known as Cat Stevens , banned from Australia .
Islam is touring Australia next month but DLP upper house member Peter Kavanagh says the singer should be denied a visa because he claims he once supported a " fatwa " against author Salman Rushdie .
Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeini issued the religious decree calling for Muslims to kill Rushdie for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses in 1989 .
" Cat Stevens seemed to support those threats against Mr Rushdie , he now says he was joking , " Mr Kavanagh said .
" But I think , before he comes into Australia , he should be required to say that he does not support threats against people for the expression of their opinions .
" What he said was he was he was exercising his dry British sense of humour , " he added .
" It needs a clear repudiation of the threat .
What he said might be true but he has n't clearly repudiated a threat to kill on the basis of expressing an opinion .
" He has not said I do not support killing anybody for the expression of their beliefs .
I think that statement should be made otherwise , I think it 's contrary to everything that 's Australian and democratic . "
" I think it he's not prepared to do that then I think it would be better if he did n't come to Australia , and make millions of dollars that he will take out of the country in the next few weeks . "
Few days ago I started thinking about how I could re-purpose the keyboard of the dismantled piano I keep in the garden , so I thought to build a new instrument by combining it with some other parts I had laying around .
I ended up with this mechanical hybrid thing I thought to call " Bassoforte " ( bass + pianoforte ) .
The neck is from a broken electric bass , as a bridge I used a cabinet handle , the pickups are from a guitar , and the part
at the top where the strings are attached is a chimney cap , which works as resonator as well as percussive sound .
The track I created is a tribute to my Dad who is a big fan of Western comic books and " spaghetti western " films ,
and because of him I am too .
Below you can see the video and pictures with more detailed descriptions .
I hope you 'll like it .

" Spoilers ! "

Post theories pertaining to current / upcoming Doctor Who episodes here .
They should probably stay here until , say , a year after airing ?
WARNING ! THERE MAY BE UNMARKED SPOILERS !
Rassilon is the Big Bad
The Time Lords were doing fine during the Time War .
However , the Time War Götterdämmerung was planned specificially for the Ultimate Sanction .
The Time Lords can't simply lose to a bunch of saltshakers !
Everything , especially the destruction of Time Lord civilization under the Daleks , was Rassilon 's fault to force the Time Lords to accept the Ultimate Sanction .
Why did the Daleks , a bunch of saltshakers with plungers for arms and could not even move upstairs , destroy the superior Time Lord civilization to the point that Gallifrey has been reduced from Crystal Spires and Togas into a Crapsack World , a Landscape of Hell infested with horrifying Lovecraftian Eldritch Abominations of " Meanwhiles and Neverweres " ?
Somebody manipulated the Time Lords into deliberately losing .
Why not send a more competent Time Lord to kill Davros instead of that wimp the Doctor ?
Because it was necessary to make the Daleks be aware of the Time Lord civilization and declare a total war of extermination so that Gallifrey becomes said crapsack world .
' Genesis of the Daleks ?
Just as planned .
How did the pathetic saltshakers get hold of Time Travel tech ?
Somebody leaked it to them .
How did Davros grow from a cripple who does not even believe in aliens , into the reality - conquering hypergenius ?
Because someone conveniently left some Time Lord schematics for him .
The Daleks , despite their inferior flying saucers , managing to defeat Tardises which were literally made out of Alien Geometries ?
Somebody sabotaged the Tardises .
And while by all possibility the Time Lords should have been winning this war , who comes up with a Class Z Apocalypse plan that would put Davros ' reality bomb to shame ?
The Lord President Himself and the Founder of the Time Lord Civilization , Rassilon .
Advertisement :
That is why the Doctor was spot - on right about the Time Lords having become more evil than the Daleks .
If Rassilon was the true mastermind of the War , then why ?
Because of his final plan , the Ultimate Sanction , repeating what the Great Old Ones have done in the previous spacetime continuum to become Eldritch Abominations : to sacrifice all of Time itself , essentially delete fucking everything , so that the Time Lords would Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence as God .
To do what the Time Lords always had the ability to become : YHVH .
The progression of Time Lord civilization is reminiscent of the Technological Singularity .
Basically , our technology and science would accelerate to the point that we could do " Godlike " abilities .
But if our science becomes so Sufficiently Advanced that our smartphones could Magic anything , why still limit ourselves to frail , puny bodies prone to pain , death and disease ?
The logical solution , therefore , was to finally get rid of these fragile bags of meat and integrate ourselves into our technology to its full potential so that we may become Gods able to manipulate anything by our thought .
Ever since Rassilon and Omega brought the Eye of Harmony into Gallifrey , basically putting a Negative Space Wedgie in a can which could only be possible through using some irrational Magic , the Time Lords have began to enjoy a Renaissance of scientific enlightenment where they invented the Tardis , each a pan-dimensional Yog - Sothoth where You Cannot Grasp the True Form and therefore is disguised as a police box , whose explosion can unmake the entire fucking universe as The Pandorica Opens demonstrates .
Yet we have the Time Lords themselves in weak corporeal bodies that can be tortured for each and every regeneration , there are many scenes of the Doctor being locked up and helpless , and when a Time Lord misses his Tardis , he 's completely helpless .
If their technology was literally Reality Warper levels then why would they stick to frail bodies ?
Therefore , Rassilon has a good reason therefore to pursue the theorems that led to the Ultimate Sanction .
But why can't he ?
Because the majority do n't want to .
Advertisement :
Sacrificing the entirety of Time to achieve Godhood would offend the vast majority of Time Lords who believed in the Law of Non-Interference , and also tried to persecute Magic .
Even the only upgrade they received from their technology was the Regeneration gene .
The morality of the Time Lords would , of course , be represented by everyone 's favourite chap with a police box : The Doctor .
If the Doctor ever found out about the Ultimate Sanction , a massive rebellion will ensue .
That was why Rassilon and the Omniscient Council of Vagueness that continued his work really needed the Doctor constantly preoccupied on that Insignificant Little Blue Planet Earth .
The Doctor must be kept away from Gallifrey as much as possible through wacky adventures .
Keeping the Doctor on Earth , however , backfired .
The Doctor became more and more fond and compassionate of humanity to the point that most of his Companions were human and sometimes female .
This will set back the Ultimate Sanction by a long time .
However , they also had a new puppet up their sleeve .
To create ruthless monsters that will become so advanced that Gallifrey Itself shall fall .
The ones whose chief instinct in life is to EXTERMINATE all that is not them at every point in space and time .
The Daleks .
Here we come to the most critical pivot of the Ultimate Sanction plan : Genesis of the Daleks
Before Genesis the Daleks were among the wimpiest of the enemies of the Doctor .
They are limited to the static electricity provided by their city and they could not even climb stairs .
However , each and every Dalek was a Determinator to Exterminate and dominate all the universe , which was why the pro-Sanction Time Lords took so much interest in them .
Now , let us analyse Genesis .
In the first scene , the Doctor is sent on a mission to kill Davros and prevent the existence of the Daleks once and for all .
First , why the wimpy and weaponless Doctor instead of an elite assassin with lots of bombs , and second , this violated the Time Lord policy of non-interference .
Said Time Lord interfered because he was a rogue Time Lord , and second , the Doctor was chosen because of the morality he developed during his adventures with humanity .
The Doctor had the perfect chance to blow up the Dalek incubator , but responded that he has no right to take the life of a child just because he knows he will become a genocidal dictator .
Because of this pivotal mistake , the creation of the Daleks was only delayed not erased , and with a revived Davros in stasis and who also developed a new obsession to surpass the Time Lords in sheer awesomeness .... oops .
Now we have Davros stealing the Hand of Omega , Daleks that levitate , Dalek flying saucers by the infinitillions , Dalek time travel , Daleks with Emergency Temporal Shift to always teleport so that you can never kill them , Dalekanium living metal that regenerates from time - traveler touch , and finally , the Time War Ragnarok where Gods battled Gods .
Nice job , Doctor , the Daleks have ascended from laughingstocks to Machine - Gods that would make Unicron look like a junkyard .
And meanwhile , Rassilon smirks " All According to Plan " .
The complete catastrophe of the Time War and the legions of Eldritch Abominations with their Armies of Meanwhiles and Neverweres will traumatize the Time Lords so much that they have no choice but to use the Ultimate Sanction and become Gods ....
Well if it was n't for the Doctor making an Ass Pull with the Moment and the time - lock that sealed Rassilon with the abominations for all eternity .
But of course , the Time Lords being timelords have created backup plan after backup plan for this , which would explain why the Daleks always escaped somewhere else instead of being killed off once and for all .
Steven Moffat is in the employ of the psychiatry industry .
He 's trying to warn kids about how scary life can get whilst giving them hope .
The Eleventh Doctor is televised psychiatric treatment .
( Televised psychiatric medication is theoretically healthier than drugs because one 's knowledge of somebody else 's dream can be managed through their own dreams , while many drugs linger in the body after being administered .
Why else would someone want to continuously scare kids week after week ?
The job of the Eternal is to run away when the Doctor comes calling .
River Song would not allow Eleven to exterminate the Daleks ( as Human ! Ten did ) because Amy Pond sees the new Daleks ' value ( If the Time Lords re-program the Daleks to work for Gallifrey , they can prevent the extermination of the Time Lord race ) .
Daleks can be used for planetary defense .
This will end with the Doctor chasing down the Eternal armed with one of the Anti-Dalek guns , Amy in tow .
There will be Scooby - Dooby Doors and Benny Hill will be playing in the background .
It will be awesome .
It certainly makes the name " Eternal " make sense .
Daleks want to be around forever , designating one to make sure they will all be around forever when they have a habit of driving themselves to extinction seems more than prudent .
That was ( more or less ) supposed to be the point of the Cult of Skaro , too , in addition to their mandate of " think outside the box . "
I support this idea , only because I really want to see the Supreme say " ALL DALEKS TO BATTLE STATIONS " , watch the others preparing for a fight ... and the Eternal running away screaming .
Since he'd be specifically engineered for maximum cowardice , I expect some dialog like " RUN AWAY !
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE ! MOMMYYYY ! " .
Tell me you would n't want to see that .
If that 's the case , I bet the Stone Dalek was an Eternal .
Hence why it begged for mommy .
The new Daleks are divided into five castes : the Strategist , the Scientist , the Drone , the Eternal and the Supreme .
All the others seem relatively clear , but the Eternal 's job description is rather vague .
In fact , he is a living archive containing everything required to reconstruct the Dalek race from the scratch in a pinch .
Whenever the Doctor makes appearance , the rest send the Eternal packing so that even if they get defeated , the Dalek Empire lives on .
They showed some serious savviness in the Victory of the Daleks , so this kind of innovation would be very much in place .
The Doctor Who universe is a later version of the Eternal Sphere , and the Time Lords are 4 - D beings who live there as admins .
This would also explain why he remains so insistent that there is no such thing as magic , despite occasionally encountering supernatural abilities and demonic beings - he knows that they 're just using system code and from the " hell " Bonus Dungeon , respectively .
The Doctor felt that his colleagues were interfering too much in the history of the Eternal Sphere x.0 , with the Time War being the last straw , and the lock on the Time War is basically keeping the other admins locked out of the program .
For " The Big Bang " , the Doctor knew from the original Eternal Sphere program that a system restore was possible , with the help of the minds of Eternal Sphere residents , but he had to go outside the lock he put to keep the other Time Lords / admins out and he was n't sure if Amy 's memories would give him the link he needed to get back into the universe .
The theme tune is currently missing the bass / beat because the master is gone
There may be something to this , considering the beat came back in Series 8 - 10 , in which The Master returned .
It 's obvious that part of the theme tune and the drumming in the Master 's head is intentionally the same , so what if they actually ARE the same thing ?
during the intro ( since the very beginning of the original show ) we 'd always see the time vortex .
So it could of been the drumming was background noise in the Time Vortex simply being played along side the theme tune .
It was stronger in the intro for the 9th and 10th Doctor as it was getting closer to that point in his timeline ( after the Time War had ended and the Time Lords gone ) .
The Master will return in a new regeneration — played by David Tennant .
River probably has a picture ID for each of his reincarnations .
It would make sense given how she 's dating / married to the time traveler who also changes faces every so often .
It 's only good manners to give a full time history in case of accidental crossings .
True , but River only met him once as Ten , but from the way she acted it seemed like she had seen him in that body before .
She was surprised when he did n't recognize her .
" The Husbands Of River Song " confirms that River has photographs of all the Doctors prior to Twelve , including the ones who never met her .
Apparently she 's kept tabs on all of them so she can secretly go joyriding in the TARDIS when he leaves it unattended .
The Master somehow finds a way to manipulate the DNA and / or physical appearance of his next regeneration , and takes on the appearance of The Doctor ( pre-regeneration , because that 's what The Master knows ) .
He then masquerades as The Doctor , eventually meeting River Song in this form ( explaining how she recognized him in The Library , even though that was the only time Ten had ever met her . )
A Time Lord will be forced to regenerate in order to evade capture .
Hmmm , you might have something there .
It is often assumed that the reason River was imprisoned is that she killed the Doctor , right ?
Well , supposing he was about to be captured , but his persuers did n't know about the whole " regeneration " thing .
So River shoots him in front of witnesses , and then somehow has the body moved before he can regenerate .
Everyone assumes they just witnessed a murder , and she has to play along and plead guilty to protect him .
This is jossed , it was actually faked using the Teselecta , a robot duplicate .
Because it would be cool !
Prisoner Zero will return .
He seems to know far too much about the Doctor , the Pandorica and the Arc Words for the next season ( Silence will fall ! ) .
This suggests that their meeting in The Eleventh Hour was not the first from Prisoner Zero 's point of view , not unlike River Song 's backwards encounters with the Doctor .
It was never revealed why Prisoner Zero was imprisoned .
Given Moffat 's penchant for revisiting earlier stories ( especially in The Pandorica Opens ) , this may end up being something very important .
His designation of Zero suggests that he is the most dangerous prisoner the Atraxi have , and the fact that they were willing to destroy the Earth to kill him further suggests it .
It is possible that the Doctor will meet him again ( along with Amy ) , and he will commit whatever act or horrible crime he ends up locked away for .
Also , his number .
He has a low number like he was the first to be imprisoned where he was .
And as i recall , that was on the other side of the time cracks .
Someone so powerful that a race capable of Ret - Gone considered him enough of a threat to imprison him outside the universe ?
Sounds like prime Big Bad material to me .
He may be a key player in an alliance of Beasts Below .
( see WMG : The War is not over . )
The Doctor gave Missy her brooch on her daughter 's wedding
In " The Witch 's Familiar " Missy mentions that she received the dark star alloy brooch " when my daughter ... " before being cut off by an approaching dalek .
Out of his children , the Doctor canonically had at least one son , Susan 's father .
So it 's entirely possible that Missy 's daughter and the Doctor 's son got married and the brooch was given during the wedding as part of something akin to a parental gift exchange .
While this would also mean that Missy would be a grandparent of Susan too , that does actually make sense , as Susan did know them even as a child , well enough to know them as a " stickler for rules " and receive a toy from them .
The brooch being given by a then close friend on such a happy , important occasion as two of their children marrying , also helps explain why , despite haven gone though multiple regenerations , deaths and even a stint as the amnesiac human Yana for a while , it 's so precious that she 's still gone through the hassle of keeping it .
The War is not over .
This is a very interesting theory , but the only problem is that the star whale is good .
So why would it join a group that wants to destroy the universe ?
Lets say it runs of Dark Willow Logic .
It senses all the pain and suffering and wants to end it .
Unlike Dark Willow , who sensed the Earth 's pain and suffering , it feels the pain and suffering of the universe .
Using DWL , it decides to destroy it .
Jossed , Series 6 went in a very different direction .
Rather , it is just beginning .
The TARDIS explosion was caused by the TARDIS ' heart overloading from lack of use .
The War is between the forces of Order and Chaos .
On one side of the War are visible monsters who go to ruthless lengths to enforce order in the universe , such as the Daleks , Cybermen , and Atraxi .
On the other side of the War are invisible monsters who work to promote chaos in the universe , such as Prisoner Zero , Omega , and the Starwhale .
The TARDIS exploded because the Eleventh Doctor is an infinite power source .
Eleven is a massive power source because the TARDIS converts his artron energy into temporal energy and stores it in the TARDIS ' heart .
The monsters who like chaos ( who I shall henceforth call the Beast Below Alliance ) want to use the TARDIS ' pent up temporal energy to destroy the universe .
The Alliance promoting order ( who I shall henceforth call the Borg Alliance ) want to stop the TARDIS from exploding by stasis - locking Eleven by imprisoning him inside the Pandorica .
The Borg Alliance succeeds in stasis - locking Eleven and the TARDIS , but does so too late , so the TARDIS ends up burning up in a star - like explosion instead of completely exploding , and destroying the universe entirely .
Eleven was wrong when he said that the memory of the universe was contained within the Pandorica 's " restoration field " .
That " restoration field " was actually designed to spread the memory of the universe rather than create it .
Eleven has spent the entirety of Series 5 generating his own brat pack of Universe Clones ( or gametes ) , so he decides to end the first battle of the war with a compromise :
He shall destroy the current Whoniverse , and procreate a new one using the brat pack .
He erases his own existence in the process , and it is uncertain whether or not Amy will be able to remember him back into existence .
To Eleven , this is an acceptable risk to take , because he secretly wants to kill himself anyway .
Luckily , Amy does remember him back into existence .
This means that the Doctor 's previous incarnations were erased from time , and Eleven is Amy 's imaginary friend made real by Amy 's ability to imagine people and things into existence .
This means that Amy is now responsible for the existence of Eleven 's infinite power source .
The Seasons of Doctor Who are equivalent to deranged Shakespeare plays
During 2010 , the Eleventh Doctor played a Romeo and Juliet subplot while the Tenth Doctor decided whether or not to be born as Hamlet .
During 2011 , Romeo broke up with Juliet .
Doctors Eight through Fourteen serve complimentary functions
The Eighth Doctor and his ensemble suffer at 8 PM daily , the Ninth Doctor considers the implications of the damage caused by the Doctor and the Master in the Last Great Time War , the Tenth Doctor does his best to maintain his sanity after remembering the heartbreak he has experienced in his last few incarnations , the Eleventh Doctor barfs Theories of Everything at at least one imaginitive denizen of Real Life , the Twelfth Doctor attempts to cure the Eleventh Doctor 's mental imbalance , the Thirteenth Doctor suffers in silence , and the Fourteenth Doctor breaks up the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors , which cures the Twelfth Doctor 's mental imbalance .
The Eleventh Doctor wanted to be dreaded
Watching Series 5 may expose fans to the Time Vortex .
Schizophrenia may be the real - life counterpart of the Time Vortex .
Every near - human species from the Whoniverse , is a spiritual ethnicity of Real Life
That means the Reapers are still here , but are no longer angry .
Why ?
iPhones are now easier to use .
The Twelfth Doctor watched " A Christmas Carol "
Eleven and Twelve had a Battle Cursed with Awesomeness .
There will be an alien enemy called the Fnarg .
Perhaps the term " fnarg " refers to either a twist on the word " hark " ( sort of like Pinky 's proclamations in Pinky and the Brain , or a nonsense word to represent the Holy Grail the surface of the ocean , and cusps in general ) .
And their group / organization / tribe / whatever will be called the " Series Fnarg " .
Just to poke fun at the fans .
" How could a fellow Gallifreyean stoop so low ? " refers to ...
Any Bad Time - Lord
This teaser could just be a red herring ; it could simply be one of the Doctor 's lines where he laments about something evil another Time - Lord did .
( Top guesses being the Master or Rassilon . )
The Master
It has n't been so long since the Master 's last appearence , but he may always come back and taunt the Doctor .
Susan Foreman
One of the other teasers had the message " Susannah 's still alive " , giving a chance that maybe the Doctor 's granddaughter will finally return .
Susan was of course the name she went by ; but Susannah may be her full name , or perhaps she 's changed it over the years .
She snorted Nine and died of a Trope Overdose ...
Whoever built The Lodger ! Tardis In ' The Lodger ' we were introduced to a new TARDIS , one which has also been seen in the Season 6 teaser trailer .
To build such a machine you 'd need to have lots of knowledge of time - machines , and its plausible to think this person may have been a Gallifreyean whose own TARDIS was destroyed in the War .
Romana
The Rani Another old baddie .
Whatever she did must have been pretty bad , since the bar is already pretty low ( what they tried to do to win the Time War or pretty much anything an evil Time Lord has done in the past ) .
It may be whatever she did to keep from fighting in the Time War ( even The Master had the decency and courage to fight ) , followed by escaping the destruction of their race .
The Rani is also an Evilutionary Biologist with a penchant for experimenting on species .
Human Resources would be a good way to get The Doctor into shock of that sort .
In The Brilliant Book of Doctor Who there were a series of teasers , the above message being one of them .
This could refer to :
River Song is a Troper
Spoilers !
It had to be said .
The Silents will meet the Weeping Angels .
And it will be the best staring contest / peek - a - boo game in history !
If Omega shows up again , he will be played by Peter Davison
The Silents exist in Real Life
Earth is the second most invaded planet in the universe
Only the second - most invaded planet ?
What planet could possibly be invaded more ?
Um ... the one that was specifically called the most invaded planet in The God Complex ?
Apart from the 456 and Cell 115 , did Torchwood have that many invasions ?
Most of it was flotsam and jetsam .
Look at all of Doctor Who , Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures ... I rest my case .
Frobisher the Penguin will appear at some point in the future
We 've had a full on Canon Immigrant with Kate Stewart , and if anyone else from the expanded universe shows up , Frobisher would be a likely candidate due to his popularity , having featured in the comics , novels and Big Finish .
We have n't heard the last of the Shakri
Their motives were ill - explained , we only saw one of their propaganda AI 's rather than the Shakri themselves , and it's almost certain that the actual Shakri responsible are still alive , probably not having been on the ship that exploded ( so , they will likely try again , or try to take out the Doctor ) , and they have ties to Gallifrey .
They are definitely going to appear again , either in the season finale or next season .
Especially now their creator is the showrunner .
The Great Intelligence is possessing Shalka !
Doctor
He accidentally teleported into this universe and being weakened by the trip , the Great Intelligence was able to control him .
After getting unpossessed he 'll go mad from the revelation of the extinction of the Time Lords , and his own inability to return to his own universe , and eventually become the crazy Doctor who eventually regenerates into the Valeyard .
How would that be for Continuity Porn
The Doctor did not " save " River out of love , friendship or kindness .
He did it purely as a way to get around the prophecy of the Silence .
River claims that it took a long time , but she finally persuaded the Doctor to tell her his name .
In fact , the Doctor intended to , but not until right before she went to the Library .
Soon before then , he introduced her to the Paternoster Gang and showed them all how to have their temporal conference call .
He then took River to Darillion , told her his name , and gave her a Sonic Screwdriver with the neural relay in it , deliberately leading her to her death and the storage of her data ghost .
He used the Paternoster Gang as bait , knowing that when they realized they were being hunted they 'd contact River , and that River would get her ghost to Trenzalore where the First Question could be answered without giving anyone else access to his real name - this is why he refused to answer even with his friends ' lives at stake .
This done , he admits that leaving River as a half - alive remnant was not a kind thing to do and allows her to pass on .
At a much later date , he 'll leave the River Song grave secret entrance for his earlier self to use .
None of this is a particularly heroic thing to do , but if the Doctor 's real name can be used to access his greatest secret , one that he 's determined shall never be revealed , he may just go to these great lengths and cruel acts for what he sees as a greater good .
And it would n't be the first time that the Doctor has manipulated friends or companions in a cruel way .
Moffat 's successor will bring Amy and Rory back causing a Temporal Paradox using a villain ( possibly the Valeyard ) .
It 's hard to see Chibnall pull this , honestly .
And as Moffat stated would happen if another Temporal Paradox happened : New York will
Not all Time Lords can change gender when they regenerate .
And every Time Lord / Lady wants the one who can change gender when they regenerate
There will eventually be a companion called Annie .
Because we 've already had Sarah Jane , Clara and Martha , there 's only one more descendant left .
Ashildr and Clara are the same person
And possibly the first , according to her timeline .
Ashildr / Aashild is a dithematic Germanic name , like Oswald and Oswin ( although the latter two are usually male names ) .
They both use the same first element Ass - which means Divine .
Same hair color .
Immortality would explain the odd way not -Clara pops up at various timeline points ( eg in Victorian times , and in the distant future ) .
The main issue with this idea is it does n't really explain why the different Claras are unaware of one another .
Clara and Me will eventually forget the meaning of Clara 's tattoo .
The Time Lords come after her .
The Quantum Shade ( whatever it is ) comes after her ... perhaps through the Time Lords .
Tricked Out Time means the chronolock is eventually defeated ( but Clara becomes mortal again as a result ) .
And so they will never voluntarily return to the extraction chamber .
This opens up lots of possibilities ...
If / When Clara returns in a later series , she 'll be saved from permanent death by a Mire medical kit similar to Ashildr .
She 'll return to the moment of her death via quantum shade and still die ( thus fulfilling the fixed event in time ) , but Ashildr / the Doctor / someone will give her an adjusted Mire medical kit so that she 's brought back to life and becomes immortal .
We 've already seen this loophole happen with River killing the Eleventh Doctor / his Teselecta in series 6 , so it would n't be a stretch to do it again .
The Doctor is a Shobogan
The Shobogans were explicitly namedropped in Hell Bent , an episode where Gallifreyan outsiders seemed to treat the Doctor as one of their own .
One old woman among them was implied to be related to him .
For one reason or another , a Shobogan was accepted into the Time Lord academy but went rogue and stole a TARDIS .
The rest is here .
" Heather " will return for Bill .
This one 's actually confirmed !
Heather returns for Bill in the Series 10 finale .
Bill will be at the point of death , with nothing the Doctor or anyone else can do to save her .
But Heather will come out of nowhere at the last minute to make the same offer she did before , only this time Bill wo n't back down .
So she 'll survive in a fashion as part of a living liquid entity , forever .
The Doctor is a child of time itself .
As we have learned , the Doctor is not , strictly speaking , a Time Lord ( fun fact - this troper 's head cannon up to now had been " Rassilon has been a Evilutionary Biologist who genetically engineered Time Lords " - funny how you can guess some things ) but was found near some sort of spatial anomaly .
How about they were found there because they were born there , from the crack in space - time ?
That would explain both the immortality and the wanderlust , would n't it ?
The Holiday Stress Test !! , in Glamour Magazine
“ Scream until you pass out . ”
Bundespräsidenten - Debakel Merkels größte Pleite
Christian Wulff ist höchstens dritte
Wahl - und das ist ein riesiges Problem für Angela Merkel .
Egal , wie dieser Wahltag endet , diese Präsidentschaftskür hat nur einen wirklichen Sieger : Joachim Gauck .
Den Charismatiker , der zu einem neuen Vorbild für einen anderen Stil in der Politik geworden ist .
As attentive readers of our blog know , the Panic kitchen occasionally turns into a battleground as yours truly and our one and only Les Pozdena compete in a format similar to TV’s Iron Chef™ .
Our co-workers judge us – not very harshly , I must admit – on presentation , taste , and use of the sort - of - secret ingredient .
The last such event took place two weeks ago and it was both heartwarming and a little sad – you see , the battle format was put aside as we joined forces to tackle a challenge neither of us had any advantage in :
Vegan cooking .
The newest addition to our team , Mr. Garrett Moon , is vegan .
It would have been downright unfriendly of us to do anything except stretch our cooking muscles and come up with an interesting thing or five to welcome him with .
My offerings , prepared while wearing the Salt & Fat cook ’s jacket my pal Jim gifted me , are described below .
Ginger - scallion noodles
I based this on David Chang ’s recipe , which was itself based on a Noodletown dish .
There ’s no sense in reinventing it , but it ’s always helpful to hear how recipes work in the real world .
First note : fresh ramen noodles make a big difference .
If you ca n’t find them , go with fresh yakisoba .
I ’m sure there ’s an Asian market near you that makes or carries one or the other noodle .
( For this lunch we had to use yakisoba since ramen noodles contain egg ; I made this with ramen later and it was noticeably better . )
I topped the noodles with fried cauliflower , tossed in a sauce very similar to the fish - sauce vinaigrette Chang describes .
I substituted soy sauce for fish sauce and upped the garlic for extra pungency .
Either version of this is really great .
My presentation was simple – noodles , cauliflower , and pickled carrots .
I also skipped the puffed rice and the mint .
This was still a wicked flavorful dish , savory and full of kick .
Khao Man Tofu
The definitive recipe for this delicious Thai street food has already been written by Leela at She Simmers .
I have only two things to add to it :
I add some roasted peanuts to the sauce before chopping , Since boiled chicken skin is n’t very appetizing , I remove it ( in giant strips ) after cooking and fry it .
It makes an awesomely crunchy , salty topping for the rice .
Khao man gai ( “ rice fat chicken ” ) is easily made vegetarian or vegan ; most of the flavor is in the sauce .
For my version , I replaced the boiled chicken with a mix of sautéed tofu cutlets and seitan .
In the future , I ’ll try this with mushrooms , as the tofu was a bit boring .
It did n’t matter so much – everything else was delicious .
I cooked the rice in veggie stock ( with added vegetable oil ) .
My recommendation regarding stock is unchanged : make your own if possible , and if not , use Better Than Bouillon bases .
They taste better than Pacific , Imagine , or any other canned or boxed brand , and they ’re infinitely more convenient .
How often have you opened a big box of stock only to use half and throw the rest out a week later ?
This way , you make what you need at whatever strength will work best for the recipe .
The key to the sauce is yellow soybean paste .
Please note that this is NOT interchangeable with miso , and it ’s also not yellow .
( It ’s made from yellow soybeans . )
Look for something like this at your local Asian grocery store .
You might have to ask for it ; the bottle I got did n’t have a label in English .
Once you do find it , I ’m sure you ’ll like its über - savory taste and ridiculuous price tag ( $ 1.18 at Uwajimaya ) .
About that fried chicken skin… I replaced it with fried shallots .
They changed the flavor profile a little bit , but me , I ’ll take fried shallots on top of anything .
Few US
Thai places I ’ve visited serve khao man gai .
That ’s a shame – it ’s a very friendly and distinctive dish .
When in Portland , do n’t miss Nong ’s Khao Man Gai cart downtown .
Black garlic sorbet
More precisely , what I served was apricot sorbet with fried bananas and black garlic sauce .
Black garlic is a recent addition to US kitchens , a sweet and caramel -y thing completely unlike the pungent bulb we know .
Common garlic is fermented until the cloves turn soft and black ; the result is , to my tongue , like a combination of balsamic vinegar and Marmite .
If you ca n’t find it ( check Whole Foods or this website ) make the balsamic sauce without it ; do n’t substitute ordinary garlic .
1 qt apricot nectar ( I like the Looza brand )
( I like the Looza brand ) 3/ 4 cup sugar
a bit of lemon juice
1 1/2 tbsp port wine
This recipe requires an ice - cream maker .
I ’m very happy with Cuisinart ’s model .
There ’s nothing special you need to know about it except that the bowl should be chilled for at least 24 hours ; we just store ours in the freezer so it ’s always ready to go .
Pour the nectar into a large bowl and stir in the sugar until it dissolves fully .
Add a few squirts of lemon juice and the port ; stir and chill in the fridge .
It ’s crucial that everything ( except the electric part of the ice cream maker , of course ) be as cold as possible – the faster your desert chills , the smoother the texture .
Once the bowl and the juice are sufficiently cold , pour the juice into the maker as directed and take for a 20 - 25 minute spin .
Ice cream and sorbet will always look a bit soft at this point ; they need to go in an airtight container and in the freezer for another hour or two .
During that time , make the sauce :
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar ( Lucini is always a good bet )
( Lucini is always a good bet ) 1 tbsp port wine
1 tbsp brown sugar
3 - 4 cloves black garlic
Stir and heat all of these in a saucepan over low heat until the vinegar reduces by half .
Strain and set aside at room temperature .
Next , fry up some sliced baby bananas in a tiny bit of oil .
I slice mine the long way so they ’re easier to handle .
Fried bananas are great warm , but since sorbet does n’t melt as creamy as ice cream does , I let the bananas cool off a bit .
Top the sorbet with bananas and drizzle the syrup over it .
Taste the syrup to gauge how much you ’d like to use ; it ’s potent stuff , and also delicious over anything else you might accompany with a sweet sauce .
Les , my partner in this co-op - mode fight , presented the following menu :

Cream of asparagus soup

It ’s hard to believe we were working with any limitations at all !
Today I was given a beating on identi.ca about no longer being a supporter of free software .
Well , perhaps not .
@fabsh , who I ’d have considered a friend , said “ Although @sil used to be quite pro-Free Software ” , with the obvious implication that today , I am not .
Today , on Twitter , a non-free web service where most of my friends hang out , I mentioned that my dad had been to see the Queen today ; I asked for advice on where I should take my daughter on holiday and how I could find a decent website for that ; I complained about Doubletwist deciding that it was the most important media player on my Android phone ; and I mentioned that my house sale was going ahead .
Now , all my twitter messages also appear on identica .
On Twitter , I was offered a number of helpful suggestions about where to find cheap holidays ; I was asked why my dad went to see the Queen ; the Doubletwist forums people let me know that my annoyance was a bug which was about to be fixed , and I was asked a few questions about Shot of Jaq , a podcast I do with Jono Bacon .
On Identica , I was given a bollocking because I do n’t believe in free software .
A long time ago , Larry Wall gave a “ State of the Onion ” speech .
Larry is the guy behind Perl , the programming language , and every year he gave a talk about what he believes
Perl is all about and where it ’ll be going over the following twelve months .
Larry ’s not really a programmer ; he ’s a linguist who does a lot of programming .
So his view on what a computer language should be is uniquely interesting , and should be read .
Anyway , he spoke of freedom , and characterised the ends of the spectrum on the subject as “ Bill ” and “ Richard ” , those two being Bill Gates ( at the time head of Microsoft ) and Richard Stallman ( head of the Free Software Foundation ) : the idea here was that those two represented the ultimate expressions of their philosophies .
Richard Stallman was at the far extreme of belief in free software ; Bill Gates was at the other far end , decrying the very concept of freedom .
It was a throwaway joke , at the time ; a caricature for the purpose of a laugh in a presentation .
Now , free software is a subject close to my heart .
I work for Canonical , a company that builds an operating system composed of free software .
Within that company , I work on Ubuntu One , a cloud service .
We use CouchDB on your computer ( free software ) which replicates to CouchDB on our servers ( free software ) ; Tomboy , the note - taking software , on your computer ( free software ) , which syncs using the Snowy API ( an open API definition , defined by the very clever Tomboy team with a few suggestions from us ) and saves its data in CouchDB ( free software ) ; bookmark syncing from Firefox using an extension named Bindwood ( free software ) to CouchDB ( free software ) on your machine ; mobile contacts syncing through Funambol ( free software ) and storing the data in CouchDB ( free software ) ; and the Ubuntu One syncdaemon ( free software ) which syncs your files to our file sync server ( closed source ) .
In the identica thread mentioned above , I ’m characterised as someone who helps “ Canonical produce proprietary net services ” .
A long time ago ( longer than the Larry Wall thing , above ) , there was the “ one drop rule ” in the United States .
It basically classified you as “ black ” if you had any black ancestry at all .
This was a rule back in the days when having “ black blood ” was somehow a bad thing .
Fortunately , these days , it seems that such outdated and racist rules are no longer a part of the American psyche .
Unfortunately , the principle seems to have been picked up by a subset of the free software movement : if your software has any part which is not available to the public , the whole suite is tainted .
By working on it or with it or around it , you are not a supporter of free software .
The smallest part of your software which is not available for scrutiny is enough to tarnish everything else you do , and quite possibly everything else you ’ve ever done , as beyond the pale : unacceptable to the audeience , because it ’s non-free .
The parts that are free , even if they comprise the majority , are unrecognised .
I ’m pretty sad about this .
I ’d consider myself a supporter of free software .
I evangelise Ubuntu , my chosen GNU / Linux distribution , to as wide an audience as I can manage ; I help to build a software service which is composed of free software except for a couple of parts ; I ’m half of a podcast which talks about Linux software twice a week .
And yet I am vilified for being insufficiently dedicated to freedom .
Jo Shields ( @directhex ) , an immensely talented hacker and someone else I ’d consider a friend , who hacks on Banshee and has spent some time educating me about Mono , has been involved in an argument recently on reddit with someone who hates him because he likes Mono .
That argument has incuded his opposer declaring that GPL - non - compatible licences cannot be free software .
Again , I ’m pretty sad about this .
The actual definition of freedom seems to have been lost .
Instead , a developer has to prove their dedication .
That ’s not what I got into free software for , and it ’s not what I think free software ’s about .
Now , OK , maybe that ’s the approach that the freedom - loving community think is best ; the “ one drop rule ” applies to free software just as much as it used to apply to black ancestry .
Someone who builds a Linux distribution which includes a non-free wireless driver is just as steeped in blood and guilt as someone who ships an operating system which is mostly non-free , or someone who ships an operating system which is entirely non-free .
That ’s a perfectly legitimate point of view to take .
I just do n’t agree with it .
I do n’t want to spend my time finding reasons why people are against me .
I do n’t want to spend my time dividing everyone into those who are prepared to take a loyalty oath and those who have more important things to do .
And when someone asks me why I ’m no longer “ quite pro-Free Software ” , my response is always the same : I ’m still just as pro-Free Software .
I just do n’t want to be associated with the other people who are .
Lakers fans probably think their team is losing the NBA Finals because the referees are handing it to the Celtics .
Boston fans probably say their narrow 3 - 2 lead is shocking because the refs are constantly cheating their team .
The players , of course , have their own thoughts .
In the first five games of the Finals — which continue Tuesday with Game 6 in Los Angeles — the Celtics screamed , threw up their arms or spun around in disgust ( or all three ) after 48 % of the fouls they were called for , according to an analysis by The Count .
We looked at every foul in the series that was n't intentional , tracked the observable reactions and gave extra weight to the more blatant complaints .
The Lakers expressed displeasure about 36 % of the time , even though Kobe Bryant disputed half of his while Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce only bickered about one - third of theirs .
At least Mr. Bryant 's carping was usually sedate , consisting mainly of dirty looks and puzzled stares toward referees ( we did n't include the time he yelled at a teammate for being in the wrong place ) .
The Celtics ' Rasheed Wallace , an infamous hothead , was n't so calm — he whined about 65 % of his calls , usually jumping and running around the court in frustration .
Then there is Lakers ' center Andrew Bynum , the biggest player on the court .
He only took issue with 15 % of his calls , the lowest mark of any regular player in the series .
A lot has been happening around The X tracker recently .
First up , their recent open signup was a massive success with several thousand new users joining , bringing much needed activity into the site .
However , it ’s has n't all been smooth sailing for this tracker so far - they suffered a setback when their database got corrupted due to a server issue , ultimately resulting in the site being offline for more than just a few hours .
Good news is that both the web interface and the tracker are now back up , almost fully functional with all 21000 + torrents in tact .
The bad news – user accounts created after the 29th of April have all been deleted along with ratio statistics , forum posts , etc .
This means that if you were one of the several thousand members who signed up during
The recent X open signups , you need to re-create your account ( signups have been re-opened ) .
So what really happened ?
A detailed account of the events that transpired is posted on the site homepage .
Quoted below are some parts of the news article :
Attention Members
Due to some unforeseen reasons , our server had a mini meltdown of sorts and our database had gotten corrupted to the point that we could not recover it .
As a result of this , we are forced to roll back and use a slightly older backup than we would have liked to use and ALL accounts that were opened since 4/29 are lost .
There is slightly silverish lining to this story , it appears that pretty much most of the site code was untouched .
We know this comes at an awkward time as we were in the middle of open signups and moving forward from the " Beta " process .
However , this is a minor set back and we will continue to move forward , we do apologize for the inconvenience .
As an extra note : any torrents that you have downloaded during this time are also lost .
User Passkeys :
Although the site was down , we did take the opportunity to move forward and implement our PLANNED updated passkey system .
What this means is that we 've updated the code and optimized it greatly .
However , due to some of the changes in the code , all passkeys had to be reset as they no longer will be valid .
We have done this already on our end and ask that you update the information in your clients to reflect the new information , or they will no longer work properly .
Once again ;
We are really sorry for this .
We know just a simple " sorry " is far from good enough , so there will be " gifts " and lots of other fun stuff coming up soon .
Also this problem will most likely never happen again in the future .
When it comes to any website ( and not just torrent trackers ) , downtime is expected .
However , downtime and data loss makes life a lot harder for sites such as The X which are still in the growing phase .
As the news post quoted above says , let ’s hope this will never happen in the future .
In the meantime , signups have been re-opened .
If you are joining the site as a brand new user or if you are re-creating your user account which got lost in the ordeal , now ’s a good time to do it .

Tesla , the Palo Alto , CA electric car company , wowed the markets today when it went public , raising $ 229 million in the IPO and trading at $ 17 apiece , a buck more than the company ’s estimated upper range of $ 16 a share .
Despite the strong start in an otherwise weak IPO market , some analysts are cautious about a company that so far has just one very - expensive $ 100,000 niche product .
As Xconomy reported yesterday , though , Tesla and investors ( which include Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Daimler AG , ) are billing the company as a technology play — like an Apple or a Google — as opposed to a traditional auto manufacturing company .
However , as much as Tesla would like to connote an image of a sleek , clean , tech company , analysts say there is no escaping the fact that the car company will have to get into the greasy , dirty business of manufacturing cars .
And there are more than a few auto companies that have been doing it for a long time .
While optimistic investors believe the Model S , which is expected to be priced at $ 49,000 when it comes out in 2012 , will turn Tesla into a real auto company , the Silicon Valley carmaker will also have real competition from better - tested technology , says David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , MI .
“ I would say it is a very high risk for an investor , ” Cole says .
“ As they move down scale , they run into the products of a lot of folks .
“ Also , I ’m not sure gas prices are going to be high enough to stimulate interest in pure electric vehicles .
The battery technology is not good enough to replace the use of liquid fuels and IC [ internal combustion ] engines . ”
In early afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq market , the company was trading at about $ 18 a share under the ticker symbol TSLA .
So , for today , Tesla has rock - star status on Wall Street , even making some music of its own by ringing in the opening bell outside the Nasdaq building in Times Square .
Time will tell , though , if this Tesla will have as much staying power as the ’ 80s hair band of the same name , or , more optimistically , as original namesake Nikola Tesla — the father of commercial electricity .

As part of its new austerity package , any cash transactions over 5,000 euros ( $ 6,188 ) will be banned in an effort to crack down on tax evasion , a government source said on Monday , reports Reuters .
" Reducing the ceiling on cash transactions , which currently stands at 12,500 euros , forms part of the package of public sector hiring and wage reductions and spending cutbacks being prepared by Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti , the source said .
The limit will also apply to cashiers ' cheques . "
Yet another insolvent banking system comes to light , as all major transactions must occur within confines of Italy 's financial institutions .
We are confident this " simple " toggle will promptly fill Italy 's empty tax coffers .
Or not .
Reuters reports on what the Austerity package will likely look like via a draft it has obtained :
Italy 's austerity budget to be approved on Tuesday will cut public sector hiring and pay , temporarily block those set to retire and reduce funding to local government , according to a draft obtained by Reuters .
The budget draft says only 20 percent of those who leave the public sector in 2011 to 2013 will be replaced , and it cuts transfers to municipal and regional authorities by 2 billion euros in 2011 and 3.8 billion in 2012 .
Those who would have earned the right to retire in mid-2011 and at the end of 2011 , according to the so - called retirement " windows " , must remain at work for a further six months .
The budget , which aims to cut the deficit by around 13 billion euros in 2011 , also makes cuts in the politically sensitive area of health spending , trimmed by 0.4 billion euros next year and 1.1 billion in 2012 .
Spending by government ministries , including pay , is reduced by 8 - 10 percent per year in 2011 to 2013 .
Other policies in the draft are a 10 percent cut from 2011 in the pay of government ministers and a 10 percent cut in the pay of public sector employees earning more than 75,000 euros .
The austerity package is still being hotly debated within the government and all the measures could be subject to change before final approval .
The pay cuts for high earners is being resisted particularly fiercely by some ministers .
The government aims to cut the budget deficit from 5.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 2.7 percent in 2011 .

The Little People Don't Understand
As top Federal Reserve officials debated whether there was a housing bubble and what to do about it , then - Chairman Alan Greenspan argued that the dissent should be kept secret so that the Fed would n't lose control of the debate to people less well - informed than themselves .
" We run the risk , by laying out the pros and cons of a particular argument , of inducing people to join in on the debate , and in this regard it is possible to lose control of a process that only we fully understand , " Greenspan said , according to the transcripts of a March 2004 meeting .
Only he now says that he was the one who did n't fully understand :
" I have found a flaw " in free market theory , Greenspan said under intense questioning by Representative Henry Waxman , the Democratic chairman of the Government Oversight Committee of the House of Representatives .
" I do n't know how significant or permanent it is , " Greenspan added .
" But I have been very distressed by that fact . "
" I made a mistake in presuming that the self - interests of organizations , specifically banks and others , were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms , " Greenspan said .
Waxman pushed the former Fed chief , who left office in 2006 , to clarify his explanation .
" In other words , you found that your view of the world , your ideology , was not right , it was not working , " Waxman said .
" Absolutely , precisely , " Greenspan replied .
" You know , that 's precisely the reason I was shocked , because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . "
After listening to the BP executives pretty much say the same thing , can we now see the pattern of elite corruption and malfeasance ?
How about the Catholic Church ?
Or the CIA ?
It 's not like there are n't , in every case , people who dissent :
At the same meeting , a Federal Reserve bank president from Atlanta , Jack Guynn , warned that " a number of folks are expressing growing concern about potential overbuilding and worrisome speculation in the real estate markets , especially in Florida .
Entire condo projects and upscale residential lots are being pre-sold before any construction , with buyers freely admitting that they have no intention of occupying the units or building on the land but rather are counting on ' flipping ' the properties -- selling them quickly at higher prices . "
Had Guynn 's warning been heeded and the housing market cooled , the financial collapse of 2008 could have been avoided .
But his comment was kept secret until Friday , when the central bank released the transcripts of Federal Open Market Committee meetings for 2004 and Calculated Risk spotted it .
The transcripts for 2005 to the present are still secret .
In little - noticed statements to reporters over the last few weeks , Pelosi has alleged that the Bush administration knew well in advance of its intervention that the financial crisis would hit , and that Congress would need to authorize a historic and unpopular bailout - but that top officials , including then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , told her that they had been barred from briefing Congress about true extent of the crisis .
If accurate , the allegation could constitute a major indictment of the Bush administration , which may have worsened the crisis and resulting economic fallout by delaying the call for congressional action .
Pelosi says the admissions from Bush administration officials that they had kept Congress in the dark came in private conversations between her and those officials in person and by phone .
None of the other parties to those conversations would comment for this story .
Nor is it clear if the Administration 's alleged decision not to brief Congress earlier was a calculated strategy to avoid spooking the already shaky financial markets thus hastening the crisis or , as Pelosi suggests , a political calculation in advance of the 2008 presidential elections , or a combination of the two .

All five constitutional challenges to Arizona 's controversial new immigration enforcement law will be heard by one federal judge in Phoenix .
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton already was assigned two of the cases .
On Friday , she ordered the other three transferred to her .
The cases at least for now remain separate , but Bolton says it 's clearly in the " interest of judicial economy " to have one judge preside over all five .
She also notes that all five cases remain in early stages of consideration .
The Arizona law takes effect July 29 unless blocked by a court .
Its provisions include a requirement that police officers enforcing another law to question a person 's immigration status if there 's a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally .

Future updates can be found at the new address .
Last Updated : 14th June 2010 – a new version can be found here .
This guide is for Australians who are considering buying a smart phone powered by the Android operating system .
Read this if :
you ’re contemplating an iPhone but want to know what else is available
want to know what Android powered handsets you can buy in Australia
you want to know about any network specific issues ( e.g. Telstra , Optus , Vodafone etc )
You should buy an Android powered phone if you value the following features :
you want to choose from a variety of handset styles – sizes , colours , physical keyboards or not etc .
user replaceable batteries
expandable storage
you use a lot of Google services already ( Gmail , Maps , Picasa etc )
you want to break the iTunes shackles
you want more control and the ability to tinker / upgrade / tweak your phone
you want to tether your phone to your laptop ( via WiFi or USB ) without paying extra ( your laptop then uses the phone to access the internet )
you want a free mapping solution baked into the phone ( Google Maps )
Android is the operating system that runs mobile phones ( and other devices ) .
It ’s open source software originally created by Google and can be installed on phone handsets by manufacturers .
As with all software there are constant updates and new versions .
In the first quarter of 2010 Android phones outsold iPhones for the first time in the US – see this chart to see the trend for yourself .
The major versions to note are :
1.5 – also known as Cupcake
1.6 – also know as Donut
2.0
2.1 – also known as Eclair
2.2 – also known as Froyo
What phones are available in Australia ?

Can I buy a phone from overseas and use it in Australia ?
Yes most definitely !
There are a number of stores who sell ‘ grey imports ’ .
These are phones purchased in another country and then shipped to Australia .
They are unlocked so you can plug in your SIM and away you go .
The advantages are that you can select from a wider array of handsets because Australia seems to lag behind in the release of handsets .
Or maybe you want to get a phone like the HTC Desire but not with Telstra ( just saying ! ) .
Just remember to buy a GSM phone , not a CDMA one !
Things you need to be aware of :
warranty claims usually involve shipping the unit back to the original country ( some retailers offer Australian warranty though , so drill them if this is a worry for you ) .
if you root your phone to apply a custom ROM then your warranty is void anyway , so the above point is probably not too concerning for you 🙂
the power charger will usually come with an adapter so you can plug the foreign plugs into your Australian power - point .
The phones are chargeable via USB anyway so this is also probably not a major issue .
you will need to manually configure the network settings for your operator ( for Internet access , MMS etc ) – great list of APNs for Australia

But what about all the Apps available for the iPhone ?
Android has it ’s own app store called the Android Market .
There are more apps available for the iPhone but as the market share for Android grows the gap between the two will shrink .
Already major apps are being developed for both iPhone and Android phones ( sorry Windows phone owners ! ) .
There are around 50,000 apps in the Android Market ( apparently ) and around 203,000 for the iPhone .
Numbers are n’t everything though – you ’re not going to install more than a small fraction of those anyway 🙂
The Android Market is region specific
Not only is the Android Market region specific , but what you see in the Market is also controlled by what network provider you are with .
Yes , even if you ’re using WiFi to browse the Market , your phone sends some kind of network operator details ( and Android version number ) when the search is made .
Until a few months ago phones on the Optus network ( including Virgin ) could only see free Apps .
But I ’m worried about excessive data usage
Install the awesome NetCounter app .
It will keep track of your usage for both your 3G connection and WiFi .
You can set alerts when a limit is announced , you get pretty graphs and you can reset the counter when you want to .

What ’s For Sale In The “ American ” Section Of A German Grocery Store ?
I ’ve got to admit , whenever I ’m shopping in a grocery story and check out the various ethnic product sections it never occurred to me to think about what products might be featured in the “ American ” section of a foreign grocery store .
Now I know , thanks to this video shot by an American shopping in a German grocery store .
I mentioned during my Eating Well On $ 1 A Day Challenge that men do n't buy tampons and my succumbing to buying tampons for a jar of free peanut butter .
One of the comments on that post was from Julinda who said :
My sister is poor and frequently visits a food pantry .
She , like many other women , would appreciate your womanly products donation .
She has gone without the items she needs , which is sad in this day and age .
I try to help her when I can .
Thank you on behalf of the woman that will use it .
Safeway had Carefree pantiliners on sale for $ 0.99 this week and I had 39 coupons from inserts I had collected for $ 1.00 off 1 .
Even though I knew this and had read the words from Julinda 's comment , I had no plan on buying them .
Getting one package of tampons for a jar of peanut butter was completely different than walking up to the cash register with 39 packages of pantiliners .
I was embarrassed enough with one in my basket and so buying a bunch was n't even a consideration .
This afternoon I was talking with a group of friends and telling them my tampon for peanut butter story .
One friend asked if getting tampons and pantiliners for free was common .
I said I did n't know since I really did n't pay attention to when they went on sale , but mentioned the Safeway deal and how I could buy a bunch , but that would really be embarrassing .
She looked back at me and said in a stone serious face , “ How embarrassed do you think those women are that are unable to pay for sanitary items when their period comes each month ? ”
I was ashamed .
Yes , it would be slightly embarrassing for me to put 39 pantininer packages into a shopping cart and buy them , but it 's a pretty pitiful embarrassment compared to how women in that situation must feel .
And so this evening I went pantiliner shopping buying 39 packages worth $ 82.00 for $ 0.18 :
I do n't think I will ever be ashamed of buying tampons or pantiliners again …
The Agriculture Department will approve for broad use tomorrow a genetically modified soybean engineered to contain healthier oils , the opening salvo in a biotech oil fight between DuPont Co. and its rival , Monsanto Co .
The high - oleic soybean , developed by DuPont and pending deregulation since 2006 , is one of the first in a wave of bioengineered cash crops that are being altered for nutritional purposes .
Currently , nearly all biotech crops grown in the United States have been altered for resistance to weedkiller or insects , traits that are rarely felt by consumers or commercial businesses .
The USDA deregulation is the " final step " in the approval process for Dupont 's soybean , which has already been approved in Canada and Mexico , said Bridget Anderson , a spokeswoman for Pioneer Hi-Bred , DuPont 's biotech seed business .
The crop and its oil will continue commercial testing this year and should be ready for global use by 2012 , she added .
The USDA approval is also the first play in a coming oil war between DuPont and Monsanto .
Currently , Monsanto has two varieties of biotech soybeans pending approval with USDA that also seek to modify the nutritional value of soybean oil , promising to eliminate trans fats and produce oil with omega - 3 fatty acid -- fish oil -- for use in yogurt , granola bars and spreads .
The modified soybeans represent a move by DuPont and Monsanto to broaden the crop traits engineered in their seeds beyond simple properties like pest resistance to complex areas -- like nutritional value , drought tolerance and nitrogen fixation -- that are often influenced by multiple genes .
These long - promised traits previously found little purchase in the seed giant 's business plans .
It is " pretty exciting science , " said Rob Fraley , Monsanto 's chief technology officer .
Leveraging improvements in breeding and biotechnology , he said , seed giants like Monsanto " can start to take on some of the most complex physiological traits in terms of crop quality and health and nutrition . "
DuPont 's biotech soybean could be welcome news for soy farmers , who have seen food companies move away from standard soybean oil as they work to eliminate trans fats , which are linked to coronary health risks , from their ingredients .
It is a difficult shift .
The industry uses about 6 billion pounds of the oil each year , all of which contained trans fats .
The biotech soy will provide a stable oil alternative that can be used without hydrogenation , the process that creates trans fats , DuPont said .
The oil has already been tested successfully for snack food preparation for frying or spraying , according to DuPont .
Notably , the engineered soybeans have been created through a different process than most biotech crops on the market , which contain splices of bacterial genes to grant herbicide or pest resistance .
Instead , DuPont scientists " silenced " the expression of a gene in the fatty acid pathways of the soybean seeds .
Few commercial biotech crops have used gene silencing so far , with a virus - resistant papaya in Hawaii being a notable exception .
Widespread adoption of DuPont or Monsanto's next - generation soybeans , which would also include traits for weedkiller or pest resistance , would be unlikely to shift the soy crop further toward bioengineering , simply because there is little room for expansion :
More than 90 percent of the U.S. soybean crop is already genetically engineered .
Products produced with DuPont 's high - oleic soybeans are unlikely to hit the market until 2012 at the latest , as the company awaits import approval for the crops from the European Union and other important exports markets , the company said .

" No family member or friends or associates of any victim that was sexually abused has come forward to inform or report to me that he has been sexually abused by Father Tully , " said Bishop Giorgio Biguzzi of Makeni , who was bishop through all the years Tully was based in his northern diocese .
Tully would not comment about these accusations when approached by The Associated Press in New Jersey , where he now lives .
The Catholic Church says it never received any complaints about Tully 's behavior in Sierra Leone .
Asked if the sex had gone any further , tears welled in the teacher 's eyes and he turned away : " I do n't want to remember that .
After all these years , I still can't talk about it .
It makes me hot all over . "
" He would want us to play with his penis , to arouse him ; not even to just play with it but to put it in your mouth , " said the teacher , who asked to remain anonymous because he works at a Catholic school and fears he could be fired .
It was in these villages that Tully demanded oral sex , called " lollipopping " in the Krio dialect , the teacher said .
The shade and occasional breeze are the only relief from the unrelenting 100 - degree ( 38 - degree Celsius ) heat matched by 100 percent humidity that has men lifting their shirts to fan bellies and black skin glistening with sweat .
The only sound is the chirping of long - billed birds attracted to a nearby rice paddy .
" It simply means that the misbehavior of priests in Africa has not been exposed to the same glare of the media as in other parts of the world , " Tlhagale said .
Catholic Archbishop Buti Tlhagale of Johannesburg cautioned this month that the scandals in the church were not particular to the United States and Europe .
Tully 's story is an example of how the church transferred abusive priests from country to country , in a scandal now emerging worldwide .
But it also shows the deep reluctance to come out against a Catholic priest in many parts of Africa .
This faraway corner of West Africa -- with no electricity or piped water -- is where the Roman Catholic Church sent Tully , twice .
The teacher told The Associated Press that Tully abused him and other boys repeatedly during his first stint in Sierra Leone , from 1979 to 1985 .
After a conviction in the U.S. for giving minors alcohol and groping them , the church sent Tully back to Sierra Leone for a second stint from 1994 to 1998 .
A 40 - year - old schoolteacher now charges that the Rev. James Tully gave the palm wine to teenage boys to make them more susceptible to his advances .
MAKANKA , Sierra Leone — A rutted red dirt track leads to the " bar , " a couple of homemade wood benches in the shade of an old tree dripping with wild mangoes .
Within easy reach , there 's a yellow plastic jerry can of the fiery palm wine the American priest loved .
In the early 1990s , Tully also was accused of escorting three teenage boys to a baseball game in Franklin , Wisconsin , giving them alcohol and groping one of the youths .
Tully signed an affidavit that said , " " I am pleading no contest because I understand what I am charged with and believe I would be found guilty . "
" I had my own experience and I was horrified about it .
I 'm angry that the church has allowed a man to function in the church in this religious order for 30 years .
And that 's criminal , " Nash told the AP in a telephone interview from his home in western Massachusetts .
Tully left Sierra Leone for the United States in 1985 .
There , a seminarian in Milwaukee , William Nash , accused Tully of abusing him between 1986 and 1988 .
In 2005 , Nash received a $ 75,000 out - of - court settlement from the Xaverians , though Tully did not admit to any wrongdoing .
He said his cousin completed his education at the Catholic school in Kamakwie but was killed by rebels during the war .
The family did nothing , the policeman said , " because we were not sure whether we should believe the boy , and also the status of the man was high . "
He said Tully was the top- ranking Catholic in the area , and headmasters at Catholic schools there reported to him .
Tully had picked the cousin out as the brightest student in Kamakwie when he was about 14 , and told the family he would take care of his education if they let him come to Kamalo .
But after two years " ( my cousin ) ran away and came home .
He told us that the priest was always calling him to lie in his bed and urging him to caress him . "
That was a familiar sight in many villages , according to more than two dozen people interviewed by the AP .
Tully took boys with him on weekend trips to villages where he built up schools and churches , and stayed overnight so he could say Mass on Sundays .
His cousin lived there for two years with other boys who were receiving scholarships from Tully .
The compound was always filled with boys , sometimes playing soccer , and Tully rode around with them on the back of his pickup truck .
The officer , who asked not to be identified because he is Catholic and fears being shunned by the church , said his cousin and several other youngsters lived in the parish priest 's house in Kamalo , where Tully was based in the 1980s .
At least one boy refused to put up with it , according to a police officer from Kamakwei , a northern town near the border with Guinea .
He complained about the abuse to his uncle , who had helped bring him up after his father died .
" My uncle pleaded with me , asking me if I could n't ' cope ' with this thing since it was the only way for me to get an education . "
He was convicted of disorderly conduct in 1992 .
He was sentenced to two years ' probation and barred from unsupervised contact with juveniles .
Tully was transferred to the Institute of the Living in Hartford , Connecticut , which specializes in sexual disorders and has treated hundreds of priests .
There he received psychotherapy and made " very good progress , " according to a letter from the institute to the Wisconsin court .
" He has never denied responsibility for his sexual behavior and has come to realize the damage that this has inflicted on the others , " says the May 1992 letter .
The Rev. Carl Chudy , current U.S. superior of the Xaverian Missionaries order based in Wayne , New Jersey , said Tully 's therapist said he could return to Africa so long as he had supervised encounters with youth , therapy and ongoing support .
" I assume Sierra Leone agreed to this because when his probation was over , he left , " Chudy said .
Yet the church sent him back to Sierra Leone apparently without ever investigating his activities there .
And most of his work was with teenagers -- organizing soccer teams , drama clubs and choirs in scrabble - poor villages .
He left in 1998 , when he was evacuated during the nation 's brutal 10 - year civil war .
The Xaverians finally laicized Tully in February 2009 , after Nash , the Wisconsin seminarian , went on a mission to have him defrocked .
Chudy said the decision was Tully 's and was approved by the pope last year .
Chudy said there is a very strict policy in place today : " In the past obvious missteps were made due to what was known at the time .
We are quite committed to protecting young people from the few who have caused such great damage , " he said .
Rev. Carlo Girola , an official of the Xaverians ' general administration in Rome , said there were no accusations or suspicions regarding Tully 's first stay in Sierra Leone to make the Xaverians feel they had to investigate .
Girola said the regional supervisor in Sierra Leone , Father Piero Lazzarini , was informed about the " situation and conditions " imposed for Tully 's return to the country .
Lazzarini spoke of this to Father Luigi Brioni , the pastor in Magburaka where Tully was then sent .
According to Girola , Brioni " never informed Lazzarini of any incidents related to this problem . "
Some who worked with Tully for years in Sierra Leone praised his good works .
" I know him as someone who was always assisting children , paying their school fees , helping them get into college , " said Ahmed Polo Samura , a human rights activist and child protection officer in Kamakwie who knew Tully from the time he was an altar boy in church .
Mark Saidu , a farmer in Makali , said Tully converted him from Islam when he was 14 years old in 1984 and helped pay for his education at Catholic schools .
" Father Jim had lots and lots of friends .
He was a man who loved to socialize , " Saidu said .
" And he was popular around here because he would travel around with a generator and show films in the villages .
And with the soccer competitions , that could be the only entertainment people would have for months . "
Augustine Sorie Bangura is described by many as Tully 's greatest friend in Sierra Leone .
Bangura , 48 , said Tully encouraged him to write letters to the priest 's friends in the United States to garner donations that built the first health clinic to the village .
Before that , people had to walk 16 miles ( 26 kilometers ) to the hospital in Kamalo .
Bangura and many others spoke of Tully 's love of strong liquor , some said to the point of incoherent drunkenness .
" He would use palm wine to get people together to evangelize them , and he would also use palm wine to encourage the youths to join us in singing .
That man loved palm wine , " said choir master John Abdulai Kamara .
Some , though , say Tully 's use of palm wine was more sinister : " He would take us boys to go palm wine drinking and would always encourage us to drink , saying , ' It 's nice .
Have some more . '
You could say he lured us into drinking , and that stuff is so strong that just one sip can make your head spin , " said the teacher who told the AP Tully molested him .
The teacher said he has long been disillusioned with the Catholic Church .
" They shattered my dreams , " he said .
The man studied to become a monk and teacher with the Irish - based Christian Brothers order , but said he left when the head of the seminary tried to abuse him .
The teacher said that if victims of sexual abuse by priests were assured they would not be punished for telling the truth , " you would see many , many , many people coming forward . "

Image caption Mr Schmidt was talking at Google 's Zeitgeist conference
Google has downplayed privacy fears after it was revealed that its Street View cars had been harvesting data from private wi-fi networks .
The search giant 's boss said that he hoped no one would be prosecuted .
Eric Schmidt said that there was " no , harm , no foul " , after the firm admitted that it had been collecting snippets of web activity from people 's wi-fi .
A US group has called for a Federal " probe " , whilst European countries are considering taking action .
" Who was harmed ?
Name the person , " Mr Schmidt said at the company 's annual Zeitgeist conference in Watford , UK .
When I suggested that the privacy issue was something of a crisis for the whole internet industry , Mr Schmidt smiled and indicated that I was indulging in journalistic hyperbole Rory Cellan - Jones , Technology correspondent Read Rory 's thoughts in full
He admitted the incident had done more harm to the firm 's reputation than any single person .
In addition , he said , it was " highly unlikely " that any of the collected information was " useful " and that there appeared to " have been no use of that data "
" No one has taken it , done anything with it .
It has not been given to anyone , " he said .
Google co-founder Larry Page said that it was important to distinguish between " worry versus harm " when it came to privacy online .
' No excuse '
Last week , the search firm openly admitted that it had collected information people had sent over unencrypted wi-fi networks for the last three years .
The company was forced to make the admission after German authorities asked to audit data gathered by the firm 's Street View cars , which gather pictures around the world for use on Google maps .
In a blog post , Google said that the problem had been traced to 2006 when " an engineer working on an experimental wi- fi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast wi- fi data " .
Its inclusion in the street view cars was a " mistake " it said and had not been authorised .
But Mr Schmidt said he did not want to use the firm's " engineers as an excuse " .
" They work for us , " he said .
" If it is authorised then there is a reason for them to be doing it .
If it is unauthorised , it is not authorised . "
He said that the firm would not say whether the engineers responsible had left the company for " numerous legal reasons " .
" We have very high attention on this matter internally , " he said .
Under orders
The firm 's actions are under increasing scrutiny around the world .
A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner 's Office in the UK said that Google had been responsible for the " unnecessary and excessive collection and storage of personal data " .
It said it took the matter " seriously " but would not take any action on the matter .
We 're not going to delete it unless we 're ordered to Eric Schmidt , Google
Its German counterpart has asked to see the data before it proceeds .
" Google 's data should be deleted only once they have been subject to a review , so that we get a picture which additional data were captured , " a spokesperson for the country 's National Information Commissioner told BBC News .
The Financial Times has reported that German prosecutors and the Czech data protection agency have launched investigations into the issue .
In the US , advocacy group the Consumer Watchdog has written to the Federal Trade Commission urging it to investigate Google .
" Google has demonstrated a history of pushing the envelope and then apologising when its overreach is discovered , " said John M Simpson , of the group .
" Given its recent record of privacy abuses , there is absolutely no reason to trust anything the Internet giant claims about its data collection policies . "
Google has asked a third party to review the software that caused the problem and examine the gathered data .
But the Consumer Watchdog said this would be like " getting to pick and pay the referees in a championship basketball game " .
" The Commission must determine what Google knew and when Google knew it .
We urge you to launch an investigation immediately , " it said in a letter .
Google said it was contacting authorities in the 30 countries where it has Street View to determine what must be done with the data .
" We 're not going to delete it unless we 're ordered to , " said Mr Schmidt .
In a move that will boost support for open video on the mobile Web , Google has provided funding to TheorARM — a project that produces an ARM - optimized implementation of the Ogg Theora video codec .
Google 's support for the project could be a signal that the search giant is significantly warming up to open video .
Although HTML5 delivers open standards for Web video playback , browser vendors have not been able to reach a consensus on the codec .
Some parties favor Ogg Theora , a royalty - free codec that can be freely redistributed because it is thought to be unencumbered by patents .
Others favor H.264 , a codec that offers technically superior compression but is burdened with costly licensing fees .
Although Google 's Chrome Web browser has support for both codecs , the company has declined to provide Theora - compatible video streams on YouTube , which uses H.264 for its HTML5 video player .
During a discussion about codecs that took place last year on W3 C 's mailing list , a Google representative expressed extreme skepticism about Theora 's suitability for the Web and strongly indicated that Google would not consider reencoding YouTube 's massive video collection to accommodate users of Theora - only browsers .
Google 's newfound commitment to TheorARM might be a sign that the company is warming up to the possibility of more broadly supporting the royalty - free codec .
One of the chief criticisms of Theora is the lack of broad support on mobile devices — an area where Web video playback has become increasingly critical .
Significant technical challenges make it difficult to get acceptable Theora playback on ARM - based devices .
Developer Robin Watts , of Pink Noise Productions , has been working on a solution .
In the TheorARM documentation , he described some of the biggest hurdles .
" The standard Theora decoder , as supplied , currently contains no ARM code whatsoever .
Furthermore , it relies on various support libraries including libogg and libvorbis to do ogg bitstream handling and vorbis decoding .
Unfortunately , libvorbis relies on floating point operation , which makes it a non-starter on the ARM platform , " Watts wrote .
For his TheorARM project , Watts undertook a massive optimization effort in order to achieve good Theora performance on ARM .
This partly involved rewriting performance - sensitive sections of the decoder in native ARM code .
To deal with the floating point dependency in libvorbis , he built his own variant of Tremor , an integer - only Vorbis decoder .
Watts was initially releasing TheorARM under GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) , which precluded his improvements from being adopted by the upstream BSD - licensed Theora implementation .
( Watts may have chosen the GPL in order to sell commercial licenses to hardware vendors who wanted to use his decoder in their products under more permissive terms . )
Google 's funding has made it possible for Watts to relicense TheorARM and distribute it under the BSD license , which means that it can now be merged back into upstream Theora and freely integrated into proprietary applications .
By supporting Watts and funding his project , Google is making a significant contribution to open video .
The ARM - optimized Theora decoder implementation supplied by Watts could make it possible for Theora to gain broader support on mobile devices .
In a post that was published in Google 's open source blog , Watts discusses some of the implications of TheorARM and offers insight into Google 's reasons for supporting the project .
" We need a baseline to work from — one standard format that ( if all else fails ) everything can fall back to .
This does n't need to be the most complex format , or the most advertised format , or even the format with the most companies involved in its creation .
All it needs to do is to be available , everywhere , " he wrote .
" Theora was designed and is maintained with the overriding goal of avoiding patents .
No other codec can come even close to claiming to be as patent or royalty free as Theora can , whilst still holding a candle to the alternatives . "
Indeed , Theora 's lack of patent encumbrances makes it conducive to serving as a universal baseline codec .
Google 's financial support of TheorARM is obviously significant in the sense that it will enable broader adoption of the codec , but the message in the blog entry may be even more important .
By allowing Watts to promote Theora as a universal baseline for Web video in a statement in the official Google open source blog , the company is endorsing the idea of making Theora ubiquitous .
This represents a significant reversal from the search giant 's previous sentiments .
Although this move will be enthusiastically welcomed by open video advocates , its timing seems somewhat peculiar .
Google recently acquired video company On2 , the company that developed the original technology behind Theora .
On2's more recent codecs , specifically VP8 , are said to be fully competitive with H.264 .
Many people in the industry assumed that Google acquired On2 so that it could open VP8 and make it a royalty - free standard for open video .
The fact that Google still has n't confirmed that theory , and is now more broadly committed to Theora , remains puzzling .
I have to keep reminding people that I actually like shooters .
No , really .
I spent my wayward youth consuming those frantically paced and humorously blocky shooters of the mid-90's .
I 'm not complaining that shooters exist .
I 'm just frustrated at how homogeneous , bland , and uninspired they all are .
Generic main character .
Preposterous , yet lame , story .
Implausible chest - high walls .
And a constant smear of brown pixels that covers the spectrum from mud to rust .
I can't point to any single shooter and say , " I do n't like this game . "
They 're all fun .
It 's just that they all feel like they came off the same assembly line .
Pizza is good , but if every brand of pizza tasted the same , I think I 'd get sick of that , too .
Some people are suggesting that the upcoming Xcom game ( yes I 'm still on about that ) will have all this great base - building strategy , weapons research , and financial management between missions .
You know , I really hate you people for getting my hopes up like this .
I was content to just make fun of the idea and move on , but now you 've planted this image of something new and interesting in my head .
Now when they come out with : " Xcom : Generic Agent shoots alien dudes from behind chest - high walls in brown corridors " I 'll be crushed .
So , thanks for setting me up for that .

The Government of India came out forcefully against ACTA this week in an intervention at the World Trade Organization .
The India position , which may well reflect the views of other ACTA - excluded countries , demonstrates that ACTA is emerging as a contentious political issue that extends well beyond civil society and business groups concerned with the agreement .
Countries excluded from the ACTA process have to come to recognize the serious threat it represents both substantively as well as for the future of multilateral organizations .
This growing concern from countries such as India represents a major new pressure point on the ACTA discussions .
The notion that ACTA countries could negotiate an agreement that would ultimately be used to pressure non-ACTA countries to conform without attracting opposition from those very countries was always unrealistic .
If the April ACTA round of talks was marked by the mounting pressure for greater transparency , the late June ACTA round of talks will undoubtedly have developing country opposition as its core concern .
India 's intervention includes the following comments :
ACTA could short - change legal process , impede legitimate competition and shift the escalated costs of enforcing private commercial rights to governments , consumers and taxpayers .
They also represent a systemic threat to the rights of legitimate traders and producers of goods , and fundamental rights of due process of individuals .
Another systemic concern is that IPR negotiations in RTAs and plurilateral processes like ACTA completely bypass the existing multilateral processes .
A systemic impact Members should be aware of is that even if some Members are not a party to plurilateral initiatives like ACTA , they could still have to enforce ACTA provisions due to cross referencing .
The released ACTA text shows a general shift in the locus of enforcement which enhances the power of IPRs holders beyond reasonable measure .
The intervention also focused on the specific substantive concerns with the border measure provisions :
Let me now turn Members specific attention to ACTA provisions relating to transit which are now public knowledge .
We are aware that several provisions are still in square brackets , which actually means that their inclusion is well within the realm of possibility .
The ACTA text requires that countries provide procedures for the customs seizure of goods “ suspected ” of infringing trademarks , copyrights and other IPRs against goods “ in-transit ” .
According to the ACTA text , “ In - transit ” includes “ customs transit ” and “ transhipment ” .
Seizures would be allowed even where there is a mere “ prima facie ” case of IPR infringement .
In view of the recent seizures of generic drug consignments , provisions relating to ‘ in - transit ’ in all likelihood would create barriers to access to essential generic medicines , as well as access to critical climate change technologies .
These provisions could concretise the legal framework the European Union has already instituted through its Council Regulation 1383/2003 , which has been responsible for empowering customs and border officials to seize legitimate generic medicines exported by India to several developing countries , including LDCs .
Let me remind Members that the EU has so far not provided us any legally satisfactory solution to recurring drug seizures leaving us with no option but to request for consultations under the WTO DSM on 11th May .
Turning to how the draft ACTA provisions can constrain TRIPS flexibilities , let me give an example .
India 's right to exercise flexibilities , such as granting compulsory licenses , would be interfered with by the mandatory application of border measures to goods in transit .
Indian exporters could be constrained from shipping goods produced under its own exception to countries where there is no applicable IPRs protection because transit may be blocked by an intervening transit country ’s application of domestic IPRs .
Similarly , under the draft ACTA data exclusivity could be invoked by a transit country ’s customs authorities as a basis for seizing pharmaceutical products in transit , even if there is no data exclusivity in the exporting and importing countries .
This would obviously act as a significant constraint on exporting countries such as India .
The intervention concludes by emphasizing the need for multilateral approaches to addressing these issues and for greater involvement of the WTO .
Let me conclude by saying that these are not the concerns of India or the developing countries alone .
Politicians , civil society and IP experts in ACTA members countries , have expressed concern regarding the substance and modus operandi of ACTA negotiations .
It is a well known fact that 633 Members of European Parliament supported a Resolution in the European Parliament ( Mar 10 , 2010 ) deploring ACTA negotiations for bypassing the multilateral framework provided by the WTO and WIPO .
Several such MEPs have written to DG , WTO and DG , WIPO requesting an impact assessment of the extent to which ACTA , as proposed , exceeds obligations in the current IP instruments and excludes flexibilities and exceptions contained in them .
Even the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has recently raised serious questions concerning the data that has been relied on by proponents of the ACTA to support the effort .
IPR experts are increasingly challenging the concept of minimum standards concept and calling for setting maximum standards or ceilings so that there is ( i ) legal security and predictability about the boundaries of IP protection , ( ii ) protection of user ’s rights and ( iii ) free movement of goods , services and information .
While India is committed to dealing with IPR enforcement issues in line with its TRIPS obligations , the introduction of intrusive IPRs enforcement rules applicable to goods and services in international trade does not represent a reasonable or realistic response .
A response , if required , has to emerge from a multilateral and transparent process , as is available in the WTO TRIPS Council , and should fully conform to the objectives and principles ( Art 7 , 8 ) of TRIPS agreement and the balance of rights and obligations enshrined in the Agreement .
As goods and services of developing countries are becoming competitive with those of developed country producers , TRIPS plus measures , like the ACTA , seek to introduce a new set of " non-tariff " barriers to trade that will preponderantly hinder developing country exporters .
We urge developed country Members to keep these concerns in mind while dealing with IPR enforcement issues .
Agreements such as ACTA have the portents to completely upset the balance of rights and obligations of the TRIPS Agreement .
WTO cannot remain a silent observer to such a development .
It is important that the issue is deliberated in this Council in detail .
As the Taliban gunman hides from an approaching Apache attack helicopter , he may not care that the American aircraft is painted with chrome - free primer to reduce its environmental impact .
Nor may he be impressed that the next generation of pilotless surveillance drones will be part - powered by solar energy .
The US military is rushing to embrace sustainability .
Its primary motive is not ethical .
It is trying to keep pace with China in a strategic race to harness clean energy .
Any future conflict between superpowers will almost certainly feature eco-weapons and green tactics .
The oil - burning Americans are starting to realise how badly they are lagging behind .
This emerging race presents eco-minded campaigners and technologists with a dilemma - should they welcome the huge budgets being committed ?
Should they , perhaps , even take the military dollar , or should they campaign against the uses to which it is being put ?
China is already leaping ahead .
The Beijing government is doubling its spending on green tech every year .
Its budget is vast - at around $ 288 m a day , according to a US Senate hearing in February .
American commentators are beginning to warn how China sees this as a route to global primacy .
Robert F Kennedy
Jr , the environmental lawyer ( and nephew of John F Kennedy ) , warns on his blog : " The Chinese are treating the energy technology competition as if it were an arms race . . .
China will soon make us as dependent on Chinese green technology for the next century as we have been on Saudi oil . "
He concludes : " The arms race of the 21st century is already in progress . "
Major General Zeng Fanxiang , deputy head of the Arms - Building Study Centre of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) , declared in December : " Regarding weapons , we need to develop solar power , hydrogen , nuclear and other new energy resources . "
In a report posted on the Chinese ministry of national defence 's website , he also predicted that climate change could alter the way battles are fought and called on the military to become more fuel - efficient .
Sun and sea
In response , the Pentagon is investing in solar technology and funding a major ocean - energy project .
US military leaders hope that this surge will achieve energy security at home and abroad .
It may also help the civilian sector to catch up with Chinese technology , which is devastating a domestic manufacturing sector that was gearing up to create thousands of jobs for the ailing US economy .
In Britain , the promise of new green industries may be stifled at birth by Chinese dynamism .
Across the US , military bases are installing black - and - blue solar panels and other solar technology .
Last year ,
Hill air force base switched on the largest solar panel array in the state of Utah .
Green tech is also being harnessed to develop solar - powered battlefield radios , as well as tents with solar panels woven into their fabric to power military equipment .
Solar power and wind energy are , however , dependent on the weather and thus intermittent .
No modern military wants to wait for a good breeze .
So the US forces are being more ambitious .
At a naval base on the Indian Ocean atoll of Diego Garcia , scientists are developing a system called Otec ( ocean thermal energy conversion ) - a way to produce power using warm and cold seawater .
Warm water is sucked from the surface and cold water from far beneath .
The two streams are used to heat and cool a closed system containing a refrigerant - like ammonia that boils at room temperature .
The cold water condenses it into a thick liquid , which is piped to the turbine ; warm water then vaporises it into an expanding gas that turns the turbine 's blades .
Once this process is complete , cold water condenses the ammonia again .
During the 1970s energy crisis , the Carter administration funded research into Otec , but Reagan abolished it .
Trials have now started again .
President Obama understands its military potential .
He has also promised to end US " foreign oil dependency " , claiming that it can be used as a weapon that allows " unstable , undemocratic governments " overseas to wield " undue influence over America 's national security " .
His case has been bolstered by Somali pirates .
In late 2008 , the hijack of the Sirius Star , a VLCC ( very large crude carrier ) holding two million barrels of oil , exposed America 's vulnerability .
If a 60 - warship multinational force can't beat a group of brigands , imagine how easily China or a nuclear - armed Iran could block the west 's supplies .
The technological challenges of Otec are huge .
The projected cost of a plant that generates 100 - 200 megawatts - enough to power 50,000 homes - is $ 1.5 bn .
But the potential benefits are dizzying .
The oceans could be harnessed as an immense solar - energy store .
If the US navy can make it work , Otec could change the future of clean energy .
In April , the US navy declared that it will obtain half of its energy from alternative sources by 2020 .
It has been conducting flight trials of the Green Hornet , an F - 18 fighter aircraft powered by a blend of camelina - derived biofuel and conventional jet fuel .
It is the first aircraft to break the sound barrier on biofuel .
The navy secretary , Ray Mabus , also announced that the " Great Green Fleet " - a carrier strike group that will use no fossil fuels - would launch by 2016 .
The US army is auditing the greenhouse - gas emissions of each of its units .
" We recognised that we were big emitters as well as big fuel users , " said Jerry Hansen , the US army 's senior energy executive in December .
Once again , this is n't about protecting the environment so much as defending vulnerable supply lines .
“ The more the military thinks about green technology , the more it sees how it goes hand in hand with improving operational effectiveness , " Elizabeth Quintana , head of military information studies at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute , told me .
" Afghanistan is the principal driver for Nato nations .
Resupply convoys can be eight miles long and they in effect say : ' Please hit me with a roadside bomb . '
Up to 60 per cent of the convoys carry fuel and water .
If you reduce that need for supply , you save lives .
Forward - operating bases are increasingly using solar panels and wind turbines for sensors and radars .
It saves troops from being predictable targets when they regularly refuel generators . "
In February , the institute hosted an inter­national conference on military eco-efficiency .
Quintana believes that the world 's armed forces may prove the most efficient at speeding up green tech development :
" The military can turn things around much faster than other government departments .
Their get - things - done attitude may put them among the most forward - thinking organisations in this area . "
Conflicting interests
Ecological activists are wary of welcoming the military into their climate camp .
" There is an uncomfortable pragmatism with which we have to take these things , " says Doug Parr , policy director of Greenpeace .
" The military 's technological advances can't be condemned out of hand .
And it would be wrong to suppose that we could stop all military conflict .
But if our government is serious about achieving fuel security , there are other things we could do that would be more strategically effective .
“ If we want to reduce our dependence on imported energy , " Parr continues , " then lagging our roofs should be more of a national security issue than having a more sustainable army .
If we all had electric cars , we would not need warships patrolling our oil supply routes . "
Alex Randall , of the Centre for Alternative Technology , is also sceptical .
" The military is developing these technologies so that they can fight wars in a post - climate - change future .
Such conflicts are likely to be caused by a lack of natural resources . . .
We would rather that funds were concentrated on technologies and policies that prevent climate change , and which thus prevent conflicts from happening . "
The world 's armed forces are busily developing forms of green tech that will , no doubt , be devastating in their effects .
The emergence of " low- ecological - impact " weapons is a case in point .
British and American scientists are deve­loping reduced - toxin explosives and lead - free bullets that do n't poison battlegrounds .
The eco-war scenario goes further .
A PLA treatise called Unrestricted Warfare from 1999 proposed the use of ecological tactics such as creating man-made earthquakes or other natural disasters .
The prospect is revived in General Zeng 's report , which says : " Effective meteorological weapons could be a key to surprise in tomorrow 's information warfare . "
Nuclear weapons halted the game for war hawks , as they meant that any conflict between superpowers would wreck the planet .
Green tech has revived the possibility of a mass war in which the environment is n't destroyed .
Our worst nightmare may be the promise of a clean fight .
John Naish is an environmental campaigner and the author of " Enough : Breaking Free from the World of More " ( Hodder , £ 7.99 )
Yale University Philosopher , Greg Ganssle , recently came out with his book , A Reasonable God : Engaging the New Face of Atheism ( Baylor , 2009 ) .
We interviewed him about his book and the contribution of the book 's thesis for theism - atheism discussions .
When the new atheist books came out , I knew that many Christians would respond .
Some of the early responses , on the web and those Harris discusses in his Letter to a Christian Nation , seemed to be as shrill as the strongest rhetoric in the New Atheists ’ work themselves .
I recognized that this is not the sort of response we need .
I had both a philosophical concern and a pastoral concern .
Philosophically , we want to take arguments seriously , reconstruct them in their strongest and most clear form , and then provide a response .
Pastorally , we ( Christian philosophers ) must show how to engage with people and ideas we think are mistaken .
It is , in some sense , part of our role to help shape the way believers engage in public discourse .
Both of these concerns led me to take on the project .
Obviously atheism is not new .
What is new about these writers is a combination of the following : first , their arguments are not merely against the truth of theism .
They are also about the undesirability of being a theist .
Second , they write with a strong rhetorical and polemical style .
Third , they are not entering the academic discussion of the issues .
This combination is new .
Now it is not perfectly new .
We can think of Bertrand Russell as an example of an academic philosopher who discusses religion in this non-academic and polemical way .
But for the most part there is a new strategy or approach here .
This tone was very important to me .
First of all , as a Christian I know that my higher priority is to be charitable .
In an intellectual dispute this requires that we take a careful , reasoned approach , and that we look for places where those we are engaging are getting issues right .
We need to treat those we are challenging as our friends .
I think there is no other way for a faithful follower of Christ to proceed .
Second , as I mentioned before , there is a pastoral responsibility to show both how to engage these kinds of ideas and to show that we do not have to panic at challenges to our faith .
Third , it is simply what it means to be a human being .
To be honest , the most difficult part was working through the texts and locating and articulating the arguments .
Partly because this part of the process is exegetical , it is not as much fun as the actual writing .
Of course , this part of the project will be part of many writing projects .
It was here , though , that I almost quit .
I almost quit because I wondered if another response was even needed .
Many books were being published on the topic .
The writing itself went rather smoothly .
I wrote the last chapter first ( and it was published in Philosophia Christi as “ Dawkins ’ Best Argument : the Case against God in The God Delusion , ” Vol 10 .
No. 1 ( 2008 ) : 39 - 56 . )
I spent the summer of 2008 doing most of the rest of the writing .
As far as tone is concerned , it was not a struggle .
There is an advantage to working in a secular environment in that you are around very smart atheists all the time .
This helps you internalize the sort of posture and virtues required of a believer in the world .
The new atheists tend to think that religious belief is incompatible with science .
Dawkins is an exception in that he thinks that the God hypothesis is itself a scientific claim .
What he means , I argue , is that it is a claim that has truth value and that if it is true , there ought to be the kind of evidence that is available to scientific methodologies .
Since his arguments are largely philosophical , he does not think that scientific methodologies are the only ones that are appropriate for discerning the truth of the matter .
If the new atheists thought theology was a legitimate source of knowledge , they would not be atheists .
Each of the new atheists might be different in this respect .
The kinds of evidence they point to varies .
For example , Dennett is much less concerned with the truth of atheism than with the idea that religion must be studied scientifically .
By this he means that we must seek a Darwinian - type of explanation of religious belief and practice .
He engages arguments for and against religious belief mostly in his early book , Darwin ’s Dangerous Idea .
Dawkins does not , for example , press the problem of evil because he thinks that the claim that God is good is not essential to theism .
Harris does press it .
Hitchens and Dawkins argue that Darwinism provides strong evidence that God does not exist .
One thing we can learn is how difficult our job of communication is .
Many of the objections they raise to these arguments are based on misunderstandings of the arguments .
These misunderstandings involve both what we may call the classical versions ( in Aquinas Paley , etc ) and contemporary versions .
I think those atheists who concentrate in philosophy of religion , such as William Rowe Richard Gale and Graham Oppy , are much more nuanced because they work in these arguments .
Paul Draper is another example of a charitable and careful critic of theism , though he has tended to call himself an agnostic and not an atheist .
On the moral argument , they engage two points very well .
These are that we need to believe in God in order to act morally and that we need to believe in God in order to know what is right and wrong .
They correctly challenge both of these notions .
What they do not engage , is the very question at the center of most moral arguments .
This is the issue that the reality of objective moral obligations is better explained by theism than by atheistic theories of morality .
This was a puzzle to me .
Dawkins mentions that it is the only one still in use .
I think they recognize that the hunch is strong that features in the world require an explanation .
I tend to think they do a good job with the big picture of Paley ’s argument .
Darwinism does raise a significant challenge to this one .
They are less successful with the fine - tuning argument .
They are quick to embrace the many worlds conjecture , though they do not consider the challenges that raises .
It is as if the mere possibility that the conjecture is true undermines the whole argument .
I found this part interesting .
Both Dawkins and Dennett articulate some suggestions about how this kind of explanation might work .
Here , they are pretty careful to explain where they are being merely suggestive .
They do not claim more for their suggestions than they ought .
The other interesting part is that they do not draw any conclusions from their suggestions .
They do not say , “ Therefore , it is probable that God does not exist . ”
In fact , Dennett explicitly says the Darwinian analysis of religious belief and practice is perfectly compatible with theism .
I had to ask myself about the upshot of the Darwinian stories as articulated by these writers .
I concluded that there is some reason to think , though I cannot be sure about this , that both Dawkins and Dennett might mean these stories to function as a sort of Nietzschean genealogy .
In other words , these stories function to dislodge the readers ’ commitment to theism , not through an argument that theism is false .
Rather , the commitment is dislodged due to the presence of a plausible alternative story .
Dawkins argues that the world we encounter fits better with the atheistic world - view than it does with the theistic world - view .
Here Dawkins does some good work .
He does not exaggerate the strength of the argument and , as I argue in the book , it does have some force .
Dawkins reflects on the claim that biological life emerged and developed over a long time through Darwinism .
If atheism is true , then if there is biological life , it must develop over a long time through some kind of process that is naturalistic .
This is exactly what we find .
If theism is true , it might be that biological life emerges and develops in the same way , but there are many other possibilities .
God could bring it all into existence in one moment , or seven literal days .
The fact that what we find is exactly what is required within the atheist world - view raises the probability of atheism .
I argue that Dawkins is exactly right about how these probabilities work .
The fact that what we find is exactly what is required within atheism does confirm atheism .
There are two ways for theists to respond .
Here I am going off what I do in the book .
Theists can challenge the claim ( what Dawkins calls “ the fact ” ) that biological life actually emerged and developed through Darwinian means ( including , of course , a naturalistic story about the origin of life ) .
This approach is the one taken by those working in Intelligent Design theory .
I do not raise any of this in the book because it is entirely implausible to the new atheists .
To them , ID is just like young - earth creationism .
It seems hopeless .
It would not be wise to build a response to an argument that requires premises that seem hopeless to the very people you want to persuade .
My approach might be controversial among Christians but I think there is an important principle about persuasion and the mission of the apologist .
The other way to respond , is to begin closer to the things the new atheists already believe .
This is the approach I take .
I can grant that Dawkins ’ argument raises the probability of atheism .
It does so by concentrating on one feature in the world .
That is the development of biological life .
There are other features , however , that are also not too controversial that point in the other direction .
The four features I discuss are the fact that the universe is stable and ordered by natural laws , the fact that there are conscious beings , the fact that there is significant free agency ( libertarian freedom ) in the world , and the fact that there are objective moral obligations .
To be sure the last two are controversial , although each of the new atheists presupposes objective moral obligations when they press moral objections to the way religious people have acted through history .
The option to deny objective moral obligations is not open to them .
Libertarian freedom is more controversial , though many think it is a reality .
The structure of my response is important .
I do not take these four features and argue to the existence of God on their basis .
All I do is show that Dawkins ’ claim that the world points more clearly in the atheistic direction is false .
I do think there are good arguments for God ’s existence based on these features , but I do not need to develop them , since my goal is to respond to his argument .
This is a good question .
What I hope is that Christians begin to learn to respond more often with charity to challenges to our belief in God .
I do get disturbed when some of us take pot -shots .
I also hope that the public discussion of religious issues will include some of our more thoughtful representatives .
I believe that this trend can come about as we continue to do good work .
I 'd love to see this book used as a text in philosophy of religion and apologetics courses because of the tone I tried to set .
I think it could be a model .
I know at least two courses that are using it .

What was that ?
For a brief , heart - stopping period , stock markets plunged , currencies went crazy , bonds ran wild and investors ran for cover .
But by the end of the day U.S. stocks had recovered much of their losses , the Toronto Stock Exchange was basically flat losing 32.7 points to close at 11,842.43 , and the Canadian dollar , though pummeled , was still intact .
Experts were flustered , but puzzled by the wild action , though they generally pointed to the ongoing Greek debt crisis .
Rumors also circulated that the panicky sell - off had been triggered by a U.S. stock trader mistakenly put in a sell order for 15 billion shares of Procter & Gamble on the New York Stock Exchange , instead of 15 million .
Whether that ’s true or not , the stock dived to $ 40 from $ 60 within moments just before 2.30 p.m..
The Dow Jones Industrial Index also began a free - fall of about 1,000 points , or 10 per cent , in less than half an hour .
It did n’t stop with stock markets .
The U.S. dollar soared , which meant the Euro plunged along with the Canadian dollar .
After rising as high as 97 cents U.S , at one point the Canadian dollar was down almost 4 cents .
It finished the day at 95.03 cents U.S .
Pascal Gauthier of TD Economics pointed to the Greek debt crisis as a possible trigger for the turmoil .
Jean - Paul Trichet , who heads the European Central bank , said in Lisbon Thursday that the bank ’s governing council had not discussed the possibility of buying government bonds .
Many analysts have speculated it might do so , as a means of providing debt - crushed governments with financial support .
“ There might have been expectations that the bank might take some measures , though we were of the view that they would not , ” Gauthier speculated .
He warned that other days like this could loom ahead .
“ On the fiscal side , those economies that were fragile to begin with before the recession like Greece , Italy , Spain are going to be vulnerable , and markets are going to be nervous , ” he said .
“ This is going to stay with us .
This is n’t just a one - day thing .
Camilla Sutton , currency strategist at Scotiabank , said no one was attacking the Canadian dollar .
Instead , investors ran for the safety of U.S. investments .

“ This story is about the U.S. dollar , ” she said .
“ What we ’re seeing is a very strong , strong U.S. dollar , because very quickly people are closing out foreign positions and moving into the deepest capital markets in the world : The U.S. and the U.S. treasury market . ”
The Canadian dollar was simply trampled by the rush into the U.S. , she said .
May 12 , 2010  --
While the average earnings for women still lag behind those of men , they 're turning the tables in the most exclusive corporate club of all .
A new report from Bloomberg News , the leading provider of business news worldwide , shows that women who head the nation 's largest companies are earning substantially more than their male counterparts .
Their average annual pay over the last few years ?
Just over $ 14 million dollars .
" That means women earned 40 percent more than men in 2009 , " says Alexis Leondis of Bloomberg .
What 's more , in 2009 female CEOs got raises averaging nearly 30 percent , while male CEOs took pay cuts .
16 Women at the Top
Carol Bartz , the CEO of Yahoo ! has a pay package of $ 47.2 million .
Kraft CEO
Irene Rosenfeld 's take - home pay is $ 26.3 million .
And Indra Nooyi , the CEO of Pepsi Co. , earns $ 15.8 million a year .
Despite those huge salaries , there is a huge caveat :
There are still very few women who have made it to the corner office when compared to the number of men in those positions of corporate power .
Only 16 companies listed in the S&P 500 are run by women .
One reason female bosses did so much better than women at lower levels is that CEO pay is transparent , being made public and available to the press .
Some say no board would dare underpay a female CEO for fear of public backlash .
" There 's 16 women making money and that 's great , " says Marie Wilson of The White House Project , a women 's advocacy group .
" I 'm concerned about the vast majority of women who are now the majority of the workforce … it 's kind of like the 16 supercorporate women are doing well .
And that 's a good sign – but it 's not good enough . "
In fact , women workers as a whole earn just 79 as much as men , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
So Why Do Most Women Struggle ?
Although these 16 women CEOs have climbed to the top rung of the corporate ladder , most women still struggle to get a solid foothold .
Some studies have shown that women are far less aggressive in negotiations .
In one ABC News behavior lab experiment , volunteers were told they would be paid between $ 5 and $ 12 for their time participating in a study .
Everyone was offered the minimum , but the men and women differed wildly in their reactions to the payment .
More than half the men asked for more money , but only a third of the women bargained for more .
Women CEOs Earn More , But Not Their Assistants
But still , even the women who have broken through the glass ceiling say that much has to change culturally in the business for women to reach parity at all levels .
The hope is that the few who have made it to the top can start that change from the highest levels .
" If my job went out there with that kind of earning , I guess I 'd want to make a real commitment to seeing every woman in my company paid fairly , " says Wilson .
" If I 'm being paid like that I want all of you to be paid fairly . "
Sci -fi comedy Red Dwarf will return for two new series , it has been confirmed .

He said : " I can now announce we are going to be doing two more series of it starting in January next year ... I got the call today .
They said ' Craig , can you do it ? ' , I said ' I 'll sort it out ' .
So I will be able to do it in January . "
Meanwhile , Chris Barrie , who plays Arnold Rimmer , told the Coventry Telegraph : " There are plans afoot to have a tenth series .
" I find it very hard to call it a tenth series , because that obviously means we 're calling the Easter special from last year the ninth series .
But yes , certainly , I would say some more new Red Dwarf product .
There are plans afoot to get that into gear . "
He added : " I think of ' Back To Earth ' as a sort of 21 - year celebration , really , as a proper three - part special .
But yes , it would be nice to do , and hopefully we will , another six half hours .
" I do n't really know anything more than I 'm saying , believe me .
I do know plans are afoot , but that 's all I can say .
In terms of the direction of the show , I do n't really want to see it change that much .
I just want more strong storylines , probably in a half - hour format . "

German government 's issue of € 7bn in bonds could have failed if Bundesbank had not retained 22 % of debt issue
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
An auction of German government debt came close to failing today , while a sale of Portuguese bonds fared better .
Germany 's issue of five - year bonds attracted bids of just 1.1 times the amount on offer , compared with 1.5 times at the previous auction last month .
This was only achieved after the Bundesbank retained £ 1.55 bn , or 22 % , of the €7bn ( £ 5.45 bn ) issue of 2.25 % bonds on offer .
Had this chunk of the debt remained on the table , Germany would probably have failed to find buyers for all of it .
" Certainly were it not for the Bundesbank , this would technically be a failed auction as the cover ratio would be below 1.0 , " said Huw Worthington , strategist at Barclays Capital .
The bonds sold today had an average yield ( the interest paid to buyers ) of just 1.47 % .
Analysts said this low yield was partly to blame for the lacklustre demand .
Yields on German debt have fallen steadily following the " flight to quality " in recent weeks during the eurozone debt crisis , as the Bundesbank had no shortage of willing buyers for government debt .
Today , with stock markets rising , bond investors appeared to have lost their appetite for bunds , at least temporarily .
The German Finance Agency said the auction took place in " very volatile " market conditions , and insisted that demand for German sovereign debt across all maturities " remains unbroken " .
Portugal sold € 1bn of 2015 bonds at an average yield of 3.701 % , drawing demand of 1.8 times the amount on offer , similar to the last auction in February .
Analysts said the European Central Bank buying fringe eurozone government bonds , as part of a $ 1 trillion ( £ 696 bn ) rescue package to stem Greece 's debt crisis , also helped underpin the Portuguese auction .
" It seems clear that those issuers whose debt is actively being bought by the ECB are having no problem issuing debt , so a decent quantity of bids was to be expected , " said Peter Chatwell , strategist at Crédit Agricole .
The bond sales come at a difficult time for the market , which faces around € 15bn of supply this week with no redemptions of maturing bonds and little cash to pay for it .
Italy will sell up to € 1.5 bn eurozone inflation - protected bonds tomorrow , and up to € 9.5 bn of nominal bonds on Friday .
1. " The
Merchant Marine Act of 1920
is a United States Federal statute that regulates maritime commerce in U.S. waters and between U.S. ports .
Section 27 , also known as the Jones Act , requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried in U.S. - flag ships , constructed in the United States , owned by U.S. citizens , and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents .
The purpose of the law is to support provide protectionism for the U.S. merchant marine industry . "

David Warren
: "
We learned a simple thing this week : that the BP clean - up effort in the Gulf of Mexico is hampered by the Jones Act .
This is a piece of 1920s protectionist legislation , that requires all vessels working in U.S. waters to be American - built , and American - crewed .
So while , for instance , the U.S. Coast Guard can accept such help as three kilometres of containment boom from Canada , they can't accept , and therefore do n't ask for , the assistance of high - tech European vessels specifically designed for the task in hand . "
3 .
Howard Portnoy
: " In order to accept offers of help , which have come from Belgian , Dutch , and Norwegian firms that claim to possess some of the world ’s most advanced oil skimming ships , Obama would need to waive the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 ( also known as the Jones Act ) .
So why not simply waive the act ?
Other presidents have under similar circumstances .
George W. Bush waived the Jones Act following Hurricane Katrina , allowing foreign ships into Gulf waters to aid in the relief effort .
The explanation of Obama ’s reluctance to seek this remedy is his cozy relationship with labor unions .
Joseph Carafano of the Heritage Foundation is quoted as saying : “ The unions see it as … protecting jobs .
They hate when the Jones Act gets waived , and they pound on politicians when they do that .
So … are we giving in to unions and not doing everything we can , or is there some kind of impediment that we do n’t know about ? "

U.S. agriculture giant Monsanto Co. is donating $ 4 million worth of seeds to Haiti , the biotechnology manufacturer 's first major foray into the chronically hungry nation .
The corporation , based in Creve Coeur , Missouri , announced a pledge this week of 475 tons ( 431 metric tons ) of corn and vegetable seeds .
Some 130 tons ( 118 metric tons ) have been delivered and are on their way to farmers as of Friday .
" We looked at what would be well - suited to Haitian growing conditions , " said Elizabeth Vancil , the company 's development partnership director .
Farmers will have to buy the seeds at markets to avoid flooding the local economy with free goods , but Monsanto will not receive any revenue from the sales , Vancil said .
A spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development program distributing the seeds could not immediately provide more details .
The announcement raised concerns in Haiti that the donation would include genetically modified seeds , for which the country does not have a regulatory system .
Monsanto representatives said no such seeds will be included .
Instead they are sending hybrid seeds , which are produced by manually cross-pollinating plants .
The company said the seeds produce larger yields than non -hybrid seeds , but that with such a variety new seeds have to be purchased and planted every year .
The Monsanto representative in Haiti is Jean - Robert Estimé , who served as foreign minister under the Duvalier family 's 29 - year dictatorship . "
Monsanto had already donated money , but it was clear that a donation of our products - corn and vegetable seeds - could really make a difference in the lives of Haitians .
Nothing wrong , you might say ...
Nice gesture ...
However : " USAID could not provide details " ...: Monsanto on the road to sainthood ?
Hardly : Aha ..
So , the seeds come for free .
This year .
Even though the farmers will have to buy the seeds , but hey , good for the local economy .
The seeds produce a plant , which generates seeds , but not as good as the hybrid .
On their blog , Monsanto confirms they have not figured out yet how this will work out ...
Shall I make a wild guess ?
The price for Monsanto seeds will go up ?
Meanwhile , the traditional seed market will be destroyed ( a la India ) , and Monsanto will grow for its all - famous monopoly ?
I mean just a wild guess , of course .
One more country on the Monsanto map , a few more poor countries to go .
Global Research published this article clarifying the matter a tat further : ...
Ah , the Haitian connection , hey ?
Monsanto said on their blog Well , the link on their blog covering the " donation " showed $ 50,000 to the American Red Cross The Disaster Relief Fund , to prepare for future disasters .
So not tied to Haiti .

DETROIT --
While packing his gear Monday , Kirk Maltby realized it might have been his last time in the dressing room as a Detroit Red Wing .
" This could be my last official business with the Wings , '' Maltby said .
" It 's something that 's inevitable .
I 'm just going to prepare myself like I 'm going to be playing .
Hopefully , here .
If not , then somewhere else . ''
The unrestricted free agent , one of the team 's mainstays and a valuable grinder since 1996 , might not be re-signed .
At 37 , he feels he has some hockey in him but acknowledges it would be strange playing for another team .
" I 've been here for so long , I have roots here with my family , '' Maltby said .
" If I have an opportunity to go somewhere else and it is the right fit , it definitely would be weird to put another color on . ''
His longtime linemate and friend Kris Draper , who has one year remaining on his contract , waxed nostalgic .
" Mine and Malts ' career have been intertwined in this organization .
It seems like if they mention one name , they always mention the other , '' Draper said .
" I think both of us have been proud of what we 've been able to do in the Red Wings organization on and off the ice .
" If Malts is n't back , we 're not only losing a great hockey player but a great friend and teammate . ''
Draper knows all good things eventually come to an end .
" I know I 'm getting there , the same goes for Chris Osgood , and people are talking that Nicklas Lidstrom might retire , '' Draper said .
" A lot of guys who 've been around for a long time and have done a lot of good things and won Stanley Cups , we know the end is coming .
It 's tough , it 's emotional , but that 's the business of the game . ''
Maltby had season - ending shoulder surgery March 2 but said he 'll be ready for the start of training camp , wherever he might be .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told U.S. Jewish leaders on Wednesday that he would never deny Jews their right to the land of Israel , according to participants of the two - hour roundtable discussion .
Some 30 Jewish leaders from organizations such as AIPAC , the Anti-Defamation League , and the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations took part in the Washington meeting , which focused mainly on the indirect peace talks and violent incitements .

" I am sure some people do n't agree with him but the fact that everybody showed up was pretty encouraging , " one of the participants told Haaretz ..
The Palestinian president said during the discussion that he had in the past proposed creating a trilateral commission to monitor and punish incitement , but that Israel did not agree to it .
When asked what he could offer Israelis to show that he was serious about peace initiatives , Abbas reminded the participants that he had addressed the Israeli public in an interview on Channel 10 .
" Why would n't Bibi go to Palestinian TV and do the same ? " said the Palestinian president .
" I would never deny [ the ] Jewish right to the land of Israel , " Abbas then declared .
Later on Wednesday , Abbas told Charlie Rose in an interview on PBS that Israel must agree to ceding East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital as a necessary precondition for any peace settlement .
" East Jerusalem is occupied territory .
The entire world recognizes that including the United States of America , " Abbas told Rose .
" We cannot accept any solution that excludes East Jerusalem . "
During that interview , Abbas also lauded Barack Obama 's administration and its efforts to bring forth a two - state solution .
" This is the first time we hear from a U.S. administration talking about that the solution of a two - state solution is in the vital interest of the United States , " said Abbas .
" The two - state solution is no longer only a Palestinian interest or an Israeli interest or a Middle East interest , but it is also an American interest . "
Closures and lambdas really are a simple concept , but I continue to see definitions that are really confusing .
So what is a closure in C# ?
In this post I ’d like to give you a few examples that will clear everything up for you .
But first , let ’s start with the Wikipedia definition of a closure :
“ In computer science , a closure is a first - class function with free variables that are bound in the lexical environment . ”
All clear , right ?
Well , if it is for you , then great … you can stop reading .
But if not , and the next time this topic comes up you want to sound like Super Duper Computer Science Guy™ … then keep reading .
First Class Functions – Sir , Your Functions Are First Class
So first , what is a C# “ first - class function ” ?
A first class function simply means that it is a function which your language treats as a first class data type .
It means that you can assign a function to a variable , pass it around , and invoke it … just like a normal function .
In C# we can create a first class function using anonymous methods :
Func< string , string > my Func = delegate ( string var1 ) { return " some value " ; } ;
Or we can do it using a lambda function which is just a shorter syntax :
Func< string , string > my Func = var1 => " some value " ;
Both of those are functionally equivalent , and they just create a method that takes a string and returns a string .
We can call that method by invoking the variable just like we would any method :
string myVar = my Func ( " something " ) ;
This means that C# supports first class functions , yay !
Free Variables
And so now we have first - class functions with free variables …
And what , pray tell , is a free variable ?
A free variable just happens to be a variable which is referenced in a function which is not a parameter of the function or a local variable of the function .
Okay , so it might look like this :
var myVar = " this is good " ; Func < string , string > myFunc = delegate ( string var1 ) { return var1 + my Var ; } ;
Okay , so the anonymous delegate is referencing a variable that is in its enclosing scope .
That variable is n’t a parameter , and it is n’t a local variable .
So it is a free variable .
So what ?
It Has To Close Over It , Son
So , what happens in this case :
static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { var inc = GetAFunc( ) ; Console.WriteLine( inc ( 5 ) ) ; Console. WriteLine ( inc ( 6 ) ) ; } public static Func< int , int > GetAFunc ( ) { var myVar = 1 ; Func<int , int > inc = delegate ( int var1 ) { myVar = myVar + 1 ; return var1 + my Var ; } ; return inc ; }
Hmmm , stare at that for just a second .
When we call “ GetAFunc ” , we get a method back that increments a local variable inside of the method .
You see ?
“ myVar ” is a local variable , but when we return the “ inc ” method , it is bound inside of the delegate .
But do n’t local variables get created on the stack ?
Do n’t they go away when we finish executing the method ?
Normally yes .
But if we ran this code , this would be the result :
So , when we passed back the method , the variable now lives along with the method .
Outside of its original scope .
You see , it got incremented when we called the method twice .
Crazy !
But you know what is even more crazy ?
You just learned what a closure is !
You just bound some free variables in the lexical environment !
Do n’t you just feel super smart now ?
You see , it is oh so simple .
It is really all about variables getting referenced which might leave scope .
So you can say that these delegates are “ closed ” over these variables , which causes them to live outside of their lexical scope .
How Does It Work ?
Well , the next question I always ask is , how does it work .
And normally when people ask me this question I say “ very carefully ” , but that is only because I am annoying .
In reality this is implemented in a more straightforward manner than you might think .
What we are really doing here is binding up a method with some data and passing it around .
Geez , I sure do wish we had something like that in C# … oh wait , we do , it is called a class !
You see , the C# compiler detects when a delegate forms a closure which is passed out of the current scope and it promotes the delegate , and the associated local variables into a compiler generated class .
This way , it simply needs a bit of compiler trickery to pass around an instance of the compiler generated class , so each time we invoke the delegate we are actually calling the method on this class .
Once we are no longer holding a reference to this delegate , the class can be garbage collected and it all works exactly as it is supposed to !
Easy Peasy
Now , the C# compiler team would probably spit in my face for simplifying it this much , but at least at the conceptual level it is a fairly straightforward process .
My head hurts a little bit thinking of all of the complex interactions and edge cases that would accompany something like this though .

The most recent twist on the “ global warming has stopped ” meme is the citation of highly respected researchers in support of that incorrect , yet somehow persistent proposition .
Once again , the charge is being led by leading climate contrarian Patrick Michaels , ably assisted by Paul “ Chip ” Knappenberger .
Earlier this year , Michaels ’ World Climate Report cited two papers ( Easterling and Wehner , 2009 and Solomon et al 2010 ) as demonstration of mainstream acknowledgment that there has been “ no warming whatsoever over the past decade ” .
But a closer examination shows that Solomon et al were actually citing the earlier Easterling and Wehner , a paper itself deeply critical of skeptic “ cherrypicking ” of short - term trend start points .
Even worse , discussion of these two papers at World Climate Report contains some of the most egregious examples of quote mining and distortions of others ’ work I have ever seen .
To be sure , Solomon et al do acknowledge that warming in the 2000s has been less than projected by the IPCC model ensemble and shows flattening relative to the previous decade ( hardly controversial propositions ) .
But their analysis of smoothed observations and decadal model projections implicitly rejects the contrarian obsession with short - term trends , and points the way towards a more compelling characterization and comparative analysis of model projections and observations .
World Climate Report ( hereafter WCR ) does not provide author information .
However , most recent cited articles ( for example , at the Cato Institute ) give WCR chief editor Patrick Michaels and WCR administrator Paul “ Chip ” Knappenberger as joint authors .
Moreover the blog post in question , What ’s Happened to Global Warming , is completely consistent with Knappenberger ’s repeated claim that “ global warming has stopped ” , made recently at the Heartland Institute conference and elsewhere .
So until otherwise advised , it ’s reasonable to attribute the article to the pair .
( It ’s also worth noting the ties of these authors and World Climate Report to interests implacably opposed to the regulation of greenhouse gases , as documented at the SourceWatch links given above ) .
So , without further ado , here are Michaels and Knappenberger on Easterling and Whener ’s Is the Climate Warming or Cooling ( Geophysical Research Letters , 2010 ) ?
Easterling and Wehner begin their piece noting that “ Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most contentious scientific issues of our time .
Not surprisingly the issue has generated numerous blogs and websites with a wide range of views on the subject .
According to a number of these sources the climate is no longer warming , in fact , some claim the planet has been “ cooling ’’ since 1998 ” .
They immediately admit that “ It is true that if we fit a linear trend line to the annual global land - ocean surface air temperature ” “ for the period 1998 to 2008 there is no real trend ” .
Correct – the satellite - based , balloon - based , and thermometer - based global temperature records show no warming whatsoever over the past decade .
Claims that the Earth ’s temperature is rising at an unprecedented rate are clearly false – nothing could be further from reality .
[ Emphasis added ]
Now let ’s look again at that last quote from Easterling and Wehner , but this time with the rest of the paragraph that Michaels and Knappenberger do n’t want you to see :
It is true that if we fit a linear trend line to the annual global land - ocean surface air temperature … for the period 1998 to 2008 there is no real trend , even though global temperatures remain well above the long - term average .
The unusually strong 1997 –1998 El Nino contributed to unusual warmth in the global temperature for 1998 at the start of this period resulting in only a small , statistically insignificant positive trend .
However , if we fit a trend line to the same annual global land - ocean temperatures for the 1977–1985 period or the 1981 –1989 period we also get no trend , even though these periods are embedded in the 1975 – 2008 period showing a substantial overall warming .
Furthermore , if we drop 1998 and fit the trend to the period 1999 – 2008 we indeed get a strong , statistically significant positive trend .
It is easy to ‘‘ cherry pick ’’ a period to reinforce a point of view … [ Emphasis added ]
The trends for 2000 - 2009 are also positive in all three surface data series .
So even if one accepts the short - term linear trend as an appropriate metric , the claim that “ thermometer - based global temperature records show no warming whatsoever over the past decade ” is an outrageous lie .
No more , no less .
Next up is the February 2010 Science article from Solomon et al , Contributions of Stratospheric Water Vapor to Decadal Changes in the Rate of Global Warming .
Michaels and Knappenberger gleefully quote the opening paragraph :
…. However , the trend in global surface temperatures has been nearly flat since the late 1990s despite continuing increases in the forcing due to the sum of the well - mixed greenhouse gases ( CO2 , CH4 , halocarbons , and N2O ) , raising questions regarding the understanding of forced climate change , its drivers , the parameters that define natural internal variability , and how fully these terms are represented in climate models .
[ Emphasis added ]
Michaels and Knappenberger comment :
Admitting that the trend in global temperatures has been flat over the past decade will not win any awards for this team , so we once again applaud their honesty .
[ Emphasis added ]
Notice that “ nearly flat ” is now simply “ flat ” .
They might as well have replaced “ nearly ” with an ellipsis “ … ” .
That would have been so much simpler .
And , once again , Michaels and Knappenberger exploit confusion about exactly which period ( which “ past decade ” ) is being discussed .
But it gets better .
For there is the niggling matter of the citation for this sentence from Solomon et al , which turns out to be – wait for it – Easterling and Wehner !
But , as we have already seen , that paper points out that the trend “ since the late nineties ” depends very much on the selection of the start year .
1998-2008 gives a range of linear trend from 0.11C / decade ( NASA - GISS ) down to 0.02C / decade ( HadCRUT ) .
But if one starts in 1999 , NASA - GISS jumps to 0.19C / decade , while HadCRUT is at 0.11C / decade .
So it ’s even somewhat debatable whether this set of linear trends should be called “ nearly flat ” since the “ late nineties ” .
But what is not debatable is the dishonesty of Michaels and Knappenberger in citing Solomon et al as further support for the mendacious claim that surface temperatures have been categorically “ flat ” and that there has been “ no warming whatsoever over the past decade ” .
That ’s especially true when one considers the actual numbers .
2000 - 2009 saw linear trends of 0.12C / decade in NASA - GISS and 0.05C / decade in HadCRUT .
But that ’s only part of the story .
If one looks at decadal change in 2000 - 2009 relative to the previous period , both NOAA and HadCRUT were an average of 0.17C above the 90s , while NASA - GISS was a full 0.2C higher .
Not that the contrarian obsession with short term linear trends figure much in Solomon et al ; rather , they present a smoothed average of all three surface temperature data sets .
Although the citation of mainstream science research in support of these bogus claims is a recent phenomenon , the claims themselves are not new .
As summarized at SourceWatch , Michaels and Knappenberger had a previous go at this last year :
In March 2009 , Michaels , under the auspices of the Cato Institute , circulated a draft advertisement that stated : “ Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now …
The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior . ” [ Link ]
The ad statements were analyzed and criticized in detail at the RealClimate blog .
[ Link ]
In support of the statements , Chip Knappenberger of World Climate Report referred readers to recent testimony by Michaels to the House of Representatives Energy and Environment sub-committee .
[ Link ]
That too was responded to at length by Gavin Schmidt of RealClimate.org [ Link ]
The recent submission to Geophysical Research Letters of research by Michaels , Knappenberger and four others ( including the surprise addition of James Annan ) is bringing new attention to model - observation comparisons based on short - term linear trends .
( Knappenberger ’s controversial Heartland conference presentation can be viewed at the conference website [ PPT presentation and video ] ) .
There are two contextual aspects that should be discussed in assessing this initiative , which seeks to endow short - term trend analysis with some respectability .
First , it should be noted that up until recently short - term trends were rarely discussed in actual published climate science ; in fact , the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report goes out of its way to eschew such discussion , preferring to present projections in terms of decadal or longer averages .
For example , the medium term projection to 2030 are given in terms of a twenty - year average ( 2011 to 2030 ) relative to a twenty - year baseline ( 1980 - 1999 ) .
James Annan has noted that the Michaels et al analysis is in line with the approach of Easterling and Wehman , not to mention that of Gavin Schmidt at RealClimate .
But these initiatives were meant to rebut the overreaching claims in the blogosphere , as noted above , not as indicators of the way to the most compelling analysis .
They should certainly not be cited in support of the view that much can be concluded from a linear fit analysis of ten years of observational data .
But surely if the attempt is to be made to draw inferences from such short periods , there are other ways than simply looking at a ten - year ( or even shorter ) trend line .
An obvious flaw in such an analysis is that it ignores any consideration of the temperature record previous to the period being analyzed .
A glance at the following table of various linear trends ( in deg C per decade ) shows why this may give misleading results :
NASA NOAA HadCRU 1990 – 1999 0.181 0.228 0.244 2000 – 2009 0.122 0.068 0.054 1990 – 2009 0.188 0.167 0.167 2000s avg. increase
0.200 0.174 0.173
Clearly , there has been some “ flattening ” in the 2000s even if the assertion of “ no warming whatsoever ” is exposed for the canard that it is .
But it ’s equally clear that there are seeming contradictions in the data .
GISS actually shows a slightly higher trend over the two decades than for the 1990 - 99 decade - long trend .
HadCRUT ’s low ( but still positive trend ) in the 2000s is somewhat contradicted by a more moderate reduction in the two - decade trend to 2009 .
And as already noted , the fact that all three series show significant increases in the 2000s relative to the 1990s should also give pause .
I ’ll be returning to the implications of such considerations , and alternative analyses of decadal change , in subsequent posts .
In the mean time , here is last year ’s initial tentative effort at an approach using smoothing and decadal averages .
The treatment acknowledges that recent temperatures have been below projections , and at the same time avoids the miasma of interpreting rapidly fluctuating short - term trends .
At that time , I wrote :
So for 2000 - 2008 , the IPCC smoothed projection was an average of 0.33 deg +/- 0.13 deg ( 90 % confidence interval ) above the 1980 - 99 baseline .
Both NASA GISS ( 0.26 deg ) and HADCrut ( o.25 deg ) were within that range , albeit in the lower part .
It should be noted that the stated confidence interval seems fine for the smoothed observation curves , but probably understates the interval for the decadal average .
But the approach seems a promising one to explore – namely develop as a test statistic the average over a period of interest ( in this case , the convenient decadal projection period 2000 - 2009 ) , expressed as an increase relative to the immediately preceding baseline period .
But there is a second , more disturbing , element in all of this .
In his recent presentation at the Heartland climate conference and elsewhere , Paul Knappenberger repeatedly stretched his conclusions way beyond what could be reasonably inferred or interpreted from the actual analysis ( and , yes , I will go into this in detail in a future post ) .
And the categorical World Climate Report claim that there has been no warming “ whatsoever ” is a clear falsehood .
That yawning gap between informal commentary and published research ( whether one ’s own or of others ) is one of the defining hallmarks of “ skeptical ” climate science .
That ’s disgraceful enough , but it also indicates a possible willingness to stretch beyond acceptable limits even within the published research itself .
Consider the following early paper by Michaels and Knappenberger , along with Robert Balling and Robert Davis .
Observed warming in cold anticyclones was published in 2000 in the journal Climate Research .
( This was only one of many dubious articles edited by Chris de Freitas , whose tenure eventually resulted in the mass resignation of half the journal ’s editors in 2004 ) .
As noted in the abstract :
On a seasonally weighted basis , a relatively small area ( 12.8 % ) contributed over half of the annual warming , and in the winter 26 % of the area accounts for 78 % of the warming .
Our analysis demonstrates that this warming is almost exclusively confined to the dry , cold , anticyclones of Siberia and northwestern North America .
However , the conclusion goes well beyond anything reasonably supported by the analysis , and even invokes the meme of beneficial global warming :
Strong warming that is confined mainly to the Siberian and Canadian winter has a much different effect on society than a similarly large heating in mid-latitude urban and agricultural areas during the summer .
To us , this pattern of temperature change seems a logical ‘ discernible human influence ’ on the climate when the interplay between greenhouse changes and moisture content is considered .
Warming of this air mass type may , in fact , be benign or even beneficial , although the final valuation of global warming remains elusive .
So there is every reason to suppose that the latest Michaels et al submission may contain similarly exaggerated material in its background or conclusion .
The refusal by Michaels and Knappenberger , at least so far , to release a draft of the submitted article ( not even the abstract ) does little to quell such doubts .
While we ’re waiting , there will be plenty of other Michaels material to ponder , including his ravings at the Heartland conference .
And I ’ll also be posting a complete set of abstracts and links for nine of Michaels ’ articles at Climate Research ( all but one edited by Chris de Freitas ) .
The above quote is just the tip of the iceberg , unfortunately .
The CSS standard states that borders and padding should be applied on top of the specified width of an element .
As such , if I have a 200 px div , and apply 40 px worth of borders and padding , total , the width will then be 240 px .
This makes perfect sense ; however , Internet Explorer actually did things differently .
They adopted a model where the maximum width is what you specified .
The borders and padding are then factored into that width , reducing the content area .
As a result , the width of the element never exceeds the stated width of 200 px .
As we mostly work with extremely sensitive floated layouts , where even the addition of a 1 px border can break the design , I wonder : did Internet Explorer get it right ?

This means that , if you should decide that you want to mimic Internet Explorer ’s original interpretation of the box model , you can .
The default value for box - sizing is “ content - box . ”
This simply means that the width and height of an element do not include the borders and padding ( or margins ) .
By changing this value to “ border - box , ” the width and height values then include the borders and padding .
Because we ’ve declared box - sizing with a value of “ border - box , ” the final width of the #box element , styled above , will be 200 px .
Especially for floated layouts , this can save you a lot of headaches !
But with that said , I ’m still undecided .
What are your thoughts on Internet Explorer ’s interpretation of the box model ?
DOZENS of people in Queensland , New South Wales and Victoria all reported seeing a bright light moving in an erratic way in the sky early this morning , prompting speculation of a UFO .
One witness in Redcliffe in northern Brisbane told The Sunday Mail of a ball of light moving across the sky at about 5.50 am today .
" It was a perfect spiral of light , " the witness said .
" I realised soon it was not the moon but that it was shooting like a comet from the southern sky and off into the northwest . "
Another Brisbane resident said : " There was absolutely no sound in a perfectly clear , darkened sky before dawn . "
Police and search and rescue crews confirmed they had received calls from Brisbane , the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast about the UFO .
The weather bureau said there were no weather conditions which would explain the light .
A Defence spokeswoman also said she had no explanation .
In Victoria , a Herald Sun reader identified as Matt said he saw the light after fishing on Port Phillip Bay .
“ It was really weird , ” he said .
“ We tried to take photos with our phones but all you could see was black . "
The light was also seen in Sydney , Wollongong and Canberra , reports The Daily Telegraph .
A witness told the ABC she saw a light " racing across the sky " about 5.50 am .
She described the light as " like a lollipop swirl " that came from the west and was headed east out to sea .
" It was unreal , " she said .
" There was a cloud in the sky - just this light with a swirl in the middle . "
Another caller said : " It was a perfect spiral of light .
" I realised soon it was not the moon but that it was shooting like a comet from the southern sky and off into the northwest . ’’
However , astronomer Andrew Jacob , acting curator of the Sydney Observatory , said the UFO was most likely SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket .
The rocket was launched yesterday from Cape Canaveral - Saturday morning in Australia .
" It fits best , a rocket travelling overhead with something venting out of it , fuel venting out of the motor , " Dr Jacob told AFP .
" The rocket 's probably tumbling or spinning a little which creates a spiral effect , a little like water coming out of a hose when you spin it .
That 's the best explanation I have so far , probably the most likely one . "
He said the timing was right for the SpaceX rocket to have travelled over the Atlantic Ocean , Africa and the Indian Ocean and be in skies over Australia around 6 am .
Two gems when it comes to gadget - world details have been uncovered in terms of Sprint ’s HTC EVO 4G – price and date – plus a whole lot more .
On June 4th you ’ll be able to snag the HTC EVO 4G on Sprint for a mere $ 199 – that ’s ridiculously competitive considering its specs .
While we ’ve seen hands - on overviews of the device already , this was MY first time playing with the EVO and I ’ve got a few specific observations that , while seemingly obvious , are rather important and I ’d like to expound upon .
The EVO is FAST The EVO is HUGE The EVO is CHEAP The EVO is AWESOME
Let ’s Talk FAST
The HTC EVO 4G is named so for a reason – the focus is on Sprint ’s 4G network which promises to bring a new level of speed to your mobile endeavors .
From what I saw , it fully delivers on that promise .
On 3G networks , Android users on any major carrier are likely familiar with “ buffering ” if they ’ve done any significant YouTube watching .
And if you routinely press “ Menu > More > Watch In High Quality ” you DEFINITELY know what I ’m talking about .
With the 4G connection on which we demoed the EVO , loading HD videos was practically instantaneous .
In the presentation , they made a great comparison about 3G vs. 4G and the way we use the internet .
Back in the day , before the interwebz bloomed , it took FOREVER to load up pages on your dial - up network .
Waiting MINUTES was not beyond the norm .
Moving onto consumer cable connections totally changed the way we used the web .
That ’s a rather drastic and sweeping change and I ’m not suggesting the 3G to 4G is a similar evolution in scale , but it definitely represents a significant enough change that people WILL use their phones a bit differently ( in 4G areas of service obviously ) .
When you combine this with the open source platform of Android , unique hardware features like the front - facing camera , and developer innovation like that of Qik , we ’ll see applications like real - time video chat .
By the way , the EVO 4G does video chat with Qik and I think there is MUCH more where those type of apps came from , especially with 4G about to take hold .
How about the Hotspot feature ?
Yeah … like I said , more where that came from !
Mobile devices have come a long , long way in the past couple years but network speeds have more or less stood still .
Although wireless carriers have expanded their 3G footprint , building next - gen network infrastructure takes a ton of time and money – the stride is longer , steps are further , and with the next 4G foot about to land it looks like the mobile multimedia experience is about to start loping .
Did I mention how awesome Sprint TV was on the EVO 4G ?
Guess not … but it ’s definitely awesome .
The nice Sprint rep showed me some Hannah Montana when there was a Yankees game on I could have been watching , but hey – Disney was co-sponsoring the event so I forgave her .
While I am really excited about Sprint 4G , this excitement should be balanced with a spoonful of pudding that hopefully the proof is in .
My experience was in a controlled environment , at an event held by Sprint , where I ’m sure they took many measures to ensure the network functioned flawlessly .
( Even so , the Qik portion of the presentation faltered a bit )
I first tested Sprint 4G when it launched in Baltimore as XOHM ( years ago ) and was very impressed by the speeds .
But in certain situations or places it just could n’t get a great signal .
For this reason I ’m eager to see user reviews come out to get a more aggregate / unbias opinion .
I ’m guessing Sprint has made a ton of improvements to the network since then , and they were probably waiting until the network was reliable enough on which to launch such a high - profile phone .
But yeah … as far as I can tell , Sprint 4G on the EVO is fast and incredibly awesome .
Let ’s Talk HUGE
The EVO 4G has a 4.3 - inch screen and for the obvious reasons this is fantastic .
All that streaming video content displays gorgeously .
Typing on the EVO keyboard is spacious to say the least .
The entire visual experience is enjoyable no matter what you ’re doing : apps , games , web , videos , randomness , etc … so by default , the screen gets a big green confirmation check .
While bigger is n’t always better , the EVO 4G toes that line and makes you realize that there is definitely some type of boundary where a phone eventually becomes a MID / Tablet / XYZ .
In terms of pocketability / pursability , the phone is pretty slim and should do the trick .
In terms of feel in the hand , the weight or dimensions do n’t negatively shock you and its looks / feels relatively normal .
But once you start interacting with the device you may find your one - handed thumbable region of comfort is stretched a bit .
I do n’t have huge hands by any means , and for those that do , this will be more of a blessing than detraction .
And for those with average / small sized hands it may just mean a little getting familiar .
But if you do mostly one - handed navigation on your phone you MAY find swiping left / right or pulling the status bar from top to bottom a bit tiresome / tedious if your filanges can’t comfortably go the distance .
Just something to look out for and possibly a reason to check out the EVO in - store before making a purchase if you feel like you ’re small - handed or this could bother you .
On a more sweeping note , we always hear / think that bigger is better , and the EVO is definitely bigger and better , but it also pushes me to believe that 4.3 - inches should just about be the maximum size for the mainstream phone .
Anything bigger and you ’re starting to enter a different territory .
Let ’s Talk CHEAP
How the heck can this phone only be $ 199 on contract ?
Do you remember when the first ever Android Phone launched ?
It was the T - Mobile G1 and it cost $ 199 .
Compare the specs of these two phones and ask yourself , “ have we really come this far in this short of a time span ? ”
We sure have .
The mobile world is good for consumers these days and to have such a powerhouse device at such a low price is amazing to say the least .
Obviously Sprint is able to do this because they recoup the hardware cost with service plans – that ’s what a subsidized device is all about – but with both the EVO and Incredible being $ 199 I personally do n’t think customers have any right to complain about any service plan extras Sprint may charge for data and whatnot .
The phone hardware is awesome and coming at a rock bottom price .
The phone ’s network speeds are amazing and the investment to build that infrastructure has to be collected somehow , right ?
Customers will always find a reason to complain … even when they get stuff for free .
The bottom line is that the EVO 4G is n’t even fairly priced … it is favorably priced .
At least that ’s my opinion .
Let ’s Talk AWESOME
Much of what unlocks the power of the EVO 4G are things you wo n’t immediately notice .
The power of the processor , speed of the network , size of the screen , and other factors will simply combine to boost the performance of typical features you ’re already using .
In fact , they might work so flawlessly that you take them for granted and think , “ this is how it should have been in the first place . ”
But I guess that ’s what 4G is all about .
The EVO 4G does have some really interesting features thanks to both Sprint and HTC that I ’m eager to see put in play .
The front - facing camera , the kickstand , the FM radio that was so great on the Incredible , the Hotspot service , Sprint TV , the huge screen , the list goes on …
In many regards I think what will be so awesome about the HTC EVO 4G is , as I already kind of explained , what you do n’t notice .
Combine the hardware , the software , and the network and you get a mobile experience that simply put – gets out of the users way and gets to the point : the content , the apps , the games and the web are the focus .
Because of the 4G implications of this device we ’re hearing a LOT about Sprint , but lets not forget how brilliant HTC has been in the android department .
The HTC EVO 4G is another item to add to an already impressive Android resume .
Let ’s Talk Q&A
After the event I took a short video of a rep doing a “ hands - on ” while a few of us grilled him with some questions .
A bunch of my questions came at the request of folks from AndroidForums and by the way … if you have n’t hit up the HTC EVO 4G Forums there you ’re really missing out :
To recap some of what we touched on from those questions :
Unique apps leveraging front camera ?
I think only Qik and we ’ll have to wait - and - see on the rest
4G Rollout plans – see this phandroid post from last week
Simultaneous data / voice ?
Yes .
Hotspot +
Get calls ?
Yes , see above .
Do the touch / capacitive android buttons glow white on the ring around them when you press ?
No
Battery life on 4G ?
Consumes a bit more than 3G , consumes a TON if you ’re not in a 4G city and it constantly tries to get a signal .
You can toggle 4G off easily .
Android OS version – 2.1
Car dock ?
Yes
Car home ?
Yes
Other accessories ?
Yes … including custom cover that supports kickstand
Extended battery interfere with kickstand ?
Not at all … you should definitely be able to equip this with an extended battery
The HTC EVO 4G Event
The event was located in a pretty nifty space in Hell ’s Kitchen NYC ( 42nd and 10th whereabouts ) .
I got there a bit early and there were food , drinks and mingling .
Of course , I maneuvered my way around the crowd to find a drink or two , which Sprint named “ Sprintini ” and “ The 4G ” :
At 6 we were herded into an attached , retr0 looking theatre / room where the actual press conference portion of the event was held ( FULL footage coming soon ! )
Here are some pictures of that room after mostly everyone cleared out :
Afterwards we went back to the lounge area and were served more drinks and food while we got hands - on time with the EVO itself .
Some interesting pictures I have n’t seen posted elsewhere are of the EVO box :
And some HTC EVO 4G Cases that thoughtfully leave room for the kickstand :
Looking back , I wish I would have spent a little more time with the device .
I would have loved to demo some of the applications like Sprint TV and Qik in depth .
Instead I got one hands - on video , played with the device a little bit , and headed back to my hotel room to get the full video content up .
Probably would have been worth an extra hour considering converting / uploading takes FOREVER anyways .
So no… I did n’t get to see Prince of Persia .
It would have been nice , but as usual , bringing you folks the latest and greatest is priority # 1 .
Let ’s Talk One - Liners
The HTC EVO 4G looks it ’ll be the real deal top to bottom … and at $ 199 it truly is a deal .
Rick Santelli , the CNBC talking head who helped launch the Tea Party / John Bircher / Angry Conservative movement , was at it again on CNBC on Monday .
We credit his rant against homeowners as playing a major role in originating the Tea Partiers in our new book , Over The Cliff .
He 's like a lot of these free - market religious freaks who believe that tax cuts magically pay for themselves , even when Ronald Reagan proved that a fallacy .
For anyone to deny the First Commandment of Conservatism was too much for him to handle and he stormed off the set .
Think Progress :
Contributor Steve Liesman rebutted , asking Santelli , “ Unaffected how ?
Unaffected by being much higher if more teachers and policemen were laid off ? ”
Liesman also challenged the familiar conservative tax refrain , stating , “ In general , I would say the rule is this , is that lower taxes generally do not pay for themselves . ”
Liesman ’s points threw Santelli into a mental breakdown .
When prompted on whether tax cuts would truly help address the deficit , he and fellow right - wing economist Jeff Nielson launched into a childish tirade against government spending and the capital gains tax : LIESMAN :
Let me get this straight , all you guys wanna cut taxes en route to bringing down the deficit , SANTELLI : No I did n’t say anything about taxes Steve .
I want the government to stop spending !
Stop spending !
Stop spending !
Stop spending !
Stop spending !
That ’s what we want !
Stop spending !
NIELSON : And cut capital gains spending !
Cut capital gains .
Cut capital .. make it zero percent and see what happens . [... ]
LIESMAN : You know , you know I just — I just keep saying what the data show and the data show that the tax cuts do n’t pay for themselves .
By the way – SANTELLI : Oh you would n’t know data if it bit you on the nose .
NIELSON : Boo. SANTELLI : Go read some Austrian economist instead of the funny pages !
Liesman tried one more time to question how “ we are going to cut taxes and deficit spending at the same time . ”
Santelli yelled in reply : “ Go back to Russia where you understand the state and the citizen ” and walked off the set .
Santelli and Nielson are just flatly wrong on their stance on federal spending and taxes .
As Nobel - prize winning economist Paul Krugman recently noted , “ [ P ] enny - pinching at a time like this is n’t just cruel ; it endangers the nation ’s future ” and “ does n’t even do much to reduce our future debt burden , because stinting on spending now threatens the economic recovery , and with it the hope for rising revenues . ”
Santelli acts just like your typical WATB conservative when confronted .
I had a similar situation with Andrew Breitbart at a panel we were on together in Los Angeles .
He 's a typical bully and he did n't like it very much when I got into his face after he picked up my notebook when I was n't looking and began reading my notes .
Santelli does n't appear to be drunk , as did Breitbart , but a hissy fit is still a hissy fit .
It tells us everything we need to know about them .
The field of photography has taken a step forward to interpret the architecture in several ways .
Since architecture is a way to express the creative stance of the architect who has designed that master piece .
Nowadays , the art of architecture photography has taken the many forms ; either it is photographing the exterior or interior , you can always come up with many awesome photographs if you have make the use of correct photographic techniques and above all if you have an observant eye that can spot the different point of view .
In this post , we have collected some awesome examples of Architecture Photography that would simply amaze you with their beauty .
You will notice that the interior architecture with repeating patterns and geometric shapes serves like a bonus for photographers .
So , without a further ado , let ’s take a look at this post .

Why Zipblock Modular Building Systems Are the Best
Leonardo Da Vinci is accredited with saying that “ simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication . ”
At Zipblocks we like to brag that our modular building systems are simplest both because they are and because you can do sophisticated things with them .
To help you understand Leonardo ’s point , consider this .
Fundamentally your computer is a simple device that can differentiate only between 1’s and 0’s and yet your computer can run very sophisticated programs .
The crux of the matter is that if your computer were not so very simple , then it would be near impossible to run all those highly sophisticated programs on it !
In nature , the simplest and most fundamental modular building system is the cubic lattice .
It stands to reason then that a modular building system that mimics a cubic lattice is the simplest building system .
Zipblock modular building systems mimic the cubic lattice .
When you build with Zipblocks every part that you place lines up precisely on the x , y , and z planes just like the atoms in a cubic lattice .
The ability to build anything you want , knowing that everything will line up and fit together perfectly , provides a powerful reason to choose Zipblocks .
Nature got it right and so did Zipblocks .
Our building systems are the best because they are “ so very simple . ”
And it is precisely because our building systems are “ so very simple ” that you can do so many totally amazing things with our products !
Our Modular Building Systems Have Diverse Application
Zipblock modular building systems can be used for modular construction , modular furniture , modular toys , etc .
Because Zipblocks are so versatile , you can build everything in the above picture and much more !
Zipblocks are like toy building bricks because anything that you can build with them can be built life - sized with Zipblocks .
Other modular building systems do n’t even come close do doing what is possible with Zipblocks because they are more complicated .
Do n’t Fall Apart
Other building systems rely on stacking .
Lots of bad things are prone happen when you lean against or bump into stacked things .
Because Zipblock blocks and panels fully interlock , things made using our building systems are rigid , sturdy , and solid .
Traverse Long Spans
Our 8 - foot long building blocks make short work of traversing large openings .
Traverse over openings as large as a garage without first placing supports .
Virtually all non-Zipblock systems require that you first provide a framework to support blocks before you can traverse large openings .
Not having to provide supports around openings when “ framing ” out all your walls with blocks and panels is an extreme time saver .
This advantage means that you do n’t have to always stop to frame openings before you can traverse over them with blocks .
Instead , you can quickly build all your walls and then frame in all of your openings at once .
Having to frame in sections before you can traverse over them is a painful process that is prone to errors for obvious reasons .
Being able to just go right over open spans in a hassle free manner and then framing these areas in later is much more pleasant .
Framing blocked openings is a piece of cake .
Take measurements .
Frame opening .
No room for error .
If you do make an error then your frame will not fit into the opening !
With Zipblocks framing openings is error proof .
Seamless Block and Panel Interchangeability
This picture demonstrates why our modular building systems are hybrid .
It illustrates the fact that panels and blocks work together seamlessly .
With our hybrid building systems you can build out large areas with panels and small areas with blocks .
Transitioning from blocks to panels or from panels to blocks is an effortless process !
Low Waste
Zipblocks modular building systems are similar to toy building brick systems because all Zipblock parts work together just as if they were a toy building brick system .
The exception is that with Zipblocks you can transform longer “ bricks ” into fully functional smaller “ bricks . ”
The only waste produced is the dust that falls when you cut your “ bricks ” .
Follow these two simple rules to avoid waste :
Use panels for large areas that do not have openings .
Use cut - to - length blocks to create window and door openings .
We Are Developing Products in A Garage at Low Costs
OK .
So , if you are reading this you are scratching your head saying “ why on earth would you list this as a reason that your products are the best ? ”
The answer is simple .
An extremely low research and development budget for Zipblocks mandated low cost molding technologies .
Low cost molding technologies translate into lower production costs .
Lower production costs translate into lower consumer costs .
Look around our site .
As you browse , keep in mind that all the polyurethane foam Zipblock parts you see were cast in a garage using low cost molds .
The large corrugated polyurethane panels shown in the above picture were cast in a garage !
To create these panels we poured predetermined amounts of parts A and B foam mix into a two gallon bucket , mixed the foam components together with a drill and then poured the rigid polyurethane foam mix into our ultra low cost mold .
We repeated this process several times until our mold was filled .
If you look carefully you can see the delineations in the panels that were created when each additional bucket of foam was poured into the mold .
Were we to have used a foam machine to fill our mold , then no delineations would be visible and our panels would be perfect .
The point of this example is that extraordinary things can be accomplished on a shoestring budget !
Our low research and development budget has resulted in gold !
Ironically we are now producing high quality , low cost parts precisely because we were initially forced to use a low research and development budget .
Presently Zipblocks are not being manufactured .
We are soliciting partners via articles like this , so please contact us should you or someone you know have interests in bringing Zipblocks to market .
We will be happy to underwrite some sort of profit sharing agreement .
3/3/2019 … just a few updates thrown in here …
We recently created / developed our own PU mixing machine and used it to cast the panels shown below .
The mixing machine allowed us to cast each panel in just one pour .
We also recently cast a SIP panel from our new panel mold .
The Duck Face Song
Featured 05/27/2010 in Funny
Dedicated to those dummies who make a duck face in pictures .
Reinventing the wheel is sometimes viewed as a significant barrier to the development of open source software .
Critics point out that if developers simply collaborated more with each other , instead of creating yet another Linux distribution or programming another text editor , this would help to simplify matters for users , and actually significantly advance the development of established open source projects .
Personally , I like choice .
Having the opportunity to select from dozens of mainstream Linux distributions and choose the one that best fits my requirements works really well .
The same applies for the individual applications that are included in a Linux distribution .
I do not see an issue in the availability of hundreds of open source text editors , backup tools , databases , productivity tools etc even if many of them have a similar set of features .
There will always be important differences between the applications .
Moreover , a developer who simply reinvents the wheel still learns from the programming experience .
The simple open source text editor or sticky notes utility may lay the foundation blocks for a developer to create something more groundbreaking in the future .
Even with the abundance of Linux multimedia software , users are often polarised into one of three camps – either the music management application Rhythmbox ( inspired by Apple ’s iTunes ) , the Rediscover music world of Amarok , or the feature - laden Banshee media player .
Our Audio Software Group
Test identified a number of other quality audio players worthy of attention besides the aforementioned trio .
For this feature , we wanted to identify top - notch audio players which receive even less attention in Linux publications .
The majority of these applications are not included in mainstream Linux distributions , and some are early in their development cycle .
But they all have in common something which makes them stand out from the rest of the crowd , and come with our strongest recommendation .
Now , let ’s explore the 9 alternative audio players at hand .
For each title we have compiled its own portal page , providing a screenshot of the software in action , a full description with an in - depth analysis of its features , together with links to relevant resources and reviews .

When the American right were being taught second world war history in their youth , they did not learn anything about the horrors of the period they learnt how to modernise the NAZI tactics of spreading fear and hate .
Lunatic right - wing bloggers have started a campaign against a “ mega mosque to be built on the ground zero ” .
There is no such plan .
The bloggers on the right doing the most to spread this are doing it oly for their personal and political gain at the expense of slandering a religion and enraging Americans .
It should be of no surprise that Fox News will be getting in on selling the bigotry .
Fox have invited Pamela Geller of Atlas Shrugs and “ Executive Director ” of “ Stop the Islamification of America ” ( whose equivalent group is very closely related to the Neo Nazi British National Party ) to spread her lies .
Geller has already been on Sean Hannity ’s radio show spreading her lies .
Here is a quote from one of the right - wing blogs spreading her lies .
Currently , Muslims are attempting to build “ a Mega - Mosque ” near the site of the World Trade Center — to celebrate the murder of 3,000 Americans by Muslims on 9/11/01 by installing a mosque near Ground Zero as Islam ’s way of claiming victory over America .
Having a mosque so near the site of Islam ’s worst attack on America , where their call to prayer will echo out into the streets where thousands of people ran for their lives on the day “ The Religion of Peace ” decided to prove , yet again , how peaceful it really is would be beyond shameful .
It ’s an absolute disgrace .
Here ’s how we stop it folks — and all it will take will be enough wealthy conservative , independent , and moderate private individuals in New York City to commission public works of art to line all the sidewalks in a three block radius of where that “ Mega - Mosque ” is supposed to be built .
Pig sculptures .
Pig fountains .
Pig murals .
A vast procession of pigs leading straight to where this Mega - Mosque is supposed to be built , so that any Muslims making a pilgrimage to this building to celebrate the murders on 9/11 will appear to join all of those giant pigs headed straight for the mosque as well .
Never mind how disgusted people should be for the suggestion that the victims of 9/11 should be modelled as pigs .
People should feel disgusted that that quote is from a now mainstream Republican blog .
What would the reaction be if this was written about the building of a synagogue ?
Yet you have a national news network , that is syndicated in many Countries across the World helping to sell this crap .
So what is the truth ?
No mosque is being proposed for Ground Zero .
It is a complete and utter lie designed to spread hate .
What is actually proposed ?
A cultural outreach building to counter misunderstanding and fear about Islam that will have within it a mosque .
From the developers site :
Why the Cordoba House ?
In recent years the global public has shown an increased interest in Islam and the Muslim world .
Many facets of Islamic life , religious , cultural and artistic , remain underrepresented and misunderstood .
The Muslim community must provide an opportunity to educate individuals about Islam through education and organized experiences of art , culture and entertainment .
A need exists in New York City , America and the world to integrate Islamic education , spiritual development , the arts and culture under one roof .
The Muslim community in NYC will build a world - class facility to promote tolerance , self - awareness and self - recognition within society .
Both community driven and globally oriented , the center will serve as the platform to launch a broader vision of Muslim - West harmony and interdependence .
The community center will satisfy the current need of a prayer space in the lower Manhattan area , making it the only prayer area opened for the five daily prayers below Houston ( greater lower Manhattan ) .
Where is it ?
Not on Ground Zero .
Slandering a religion and creating the politics of fear did not work out well in the 1930’s .
The difference between then and now was that the far right did not have a 24 hour news network to back them .
I really do worry about America .
An election defeat should have given the right an opportunity to look at their principles and beliefs and offer something to the American people .
Instead they are promoting the only beauty queen to have never called for world peace as President , one who is busy endorsing convicted war criminals for Congress .
They are creating and fostering a culture of fear and hate .
Appealing to the very worst of peoples fears and bigotry should never again be acceptable .
It is shameful that hate has become a mainstream Republican viewpoint .
Let ’s face it : Large corporations have our country , and us , in a death grip .
Some of their bad behavior makes big headlines : the BP oil disaster , Goldman Sachs ’ financial shenanigans , Enron ’s book - cooking .
However , equally dangerous corporate activity happens every day , far from public view .
Corporations have seeped almost invisibly into nearly every government agency and too many congressional offices .
And they ’re as poisonous as carbon monoxide .
In the last 20 years , protective legislation and regulation , carefully constructed from the days of President Coolidge and vastly strengthened due to the Depression , have seriously deteriorated .
There ’s nothing inherently evil , or even bad , about corporations .
Indeed , the combination of capital and management under one roof is efficient and essential in a global , competitive world .
So much of our standard of living and our worldwide leadership are directly traceable to our corporate and entrepreneurial culture .
But even good things , when they get out of control , turn destructive .
Cancer , after all , is just growth gone wild .
There has always been tension between good government and free enterprise .
It hurts the bottom line to scrub emissions from coal - burning power generators , ensure meat is sanitary , clean up toxic waste , and disclose the full risks of financial products .
But once corporations realized that instead of fighting government they could actually buy it through lobbying and political contributions , the base of our democracy eroded .
Their “ invisible power ” got a grip .
The stealthy hunt for corporate profits metastasized from the marketplace and entered the halls of Congress and the executive branch .
The fight over reforming Wall Street is just the latest example .
The need for regulation is hardly theoretical here .
We ’re still reeling from a crisis caused by the absence of it .
Congress does n’t even need to reinvent the wheel , a favorite task .
There were laws and regulations that had worked for so long , such as those to keep banks and investment brokers separate ; require diligent lending ; prohibit betting against your own borrowers ; require full disclosure to borrowers ; and , above all , keep the risk with the lenders to insure they make prudent loans .
So why has the debate on reform dragged on for nearly a year ?
The public wants Wall Street reined in .
So why would any legislator , much less an entire political party , get in the way of financial reform ?
It ca n’t just be a coincidence that the financial sector happens to be the biggest contributor to 2010 congressional campaigns , with more than $ 129 million doled out already .
Financial firms have also spent well over a half a billion dollars on lobbying since early 2009 .
To reverse this situation we must change who gets elected to Congress .
And that is the one thing we can do , and perhaps the only thing , to neutralize corporate control of our government .
Only real people have the vote ; corporations do n’t .
To regain our democracy , we must :
Identify and make public those elected representatives who owe their jobs to corporate largesse and cast their votes accordingly .
Insulate the election process from corporate funding .
Bills in both the Senate and House that would forbid campaign spending by contractors who receive more than $ 50,000 in taxpayer funds would be a good start .
Prohibit lawmakers and lobbyists from interacting with each other , except to exchange ideas on legislation , and require them to publish a record of their contacts .
It may take several election cycles to scrub corporate influence and control from our political system , but once it starts it will gain momentum .
And once we ’ve accomplished this feat , appropriate regulation and control will follow .
The horse will be before the cart , and the driver will be a human person .
Mr. Gandhi traverses the country , often on secret trips , to recruit as many as 10 million new youth members .
His job is also to try to take back crucial strongholds like Uttar Pradesh , in the north , which his family claims as its home base but which the Congress Party does not control .
Most Indian political parties are internally undemocratic and often dominated by political dynasties , none more famous the Gandhi clan .
But Mr. Gandhi has also insisted that the party ’s youth organizations hold internal elections for posts and operate as meritocracies .
He also has succeeded far more than other Indian politicians in tapping into the hunger for generational change in India , analysts say , and has positioned himself as a change agent for the future , despite his obvious debts to India ’s political past .
He is trying to bypass the identity politics of caste and appeal to young people of all backgrounds .
“ We youth are with Rahul ! ” said Manonit Garharabari , 23 , at the rally .
“ The whole youth is with Rahul .
We seen an internal strength in him . ”
Mr. Gandhi is omnipresent in the media , and his face is plastered on untold numbers of billboards and political posters .
His public image is as a humble , serious man , if somewhat shy , even as his name invariably tops polls ranking the country ’s “ hottest ” or “ most eligible ” bachelors .
Yet he almost never grants interviews , including for this article , and only occasionally conducts news conferences .
Reporters are often tipped to his appearances at one village or another but often all they get is a photograph  which inevitably appears in newspapers around India .

His daily life is cloaked in secrecy , which makes it an irresistible if elusive topic for the Indian media .
One news station ran a lengthy report after obtaining a short video clip of Mr. Gandhi riding his bicycle in New Delhi .
Mr. Gandhi confirmed in 2004 that he had a Spanish girlfriend , but whether they remained a couple was unclear .
His advisers say his low profile reflects his desire not to overstep the authority of his organizational position while the secrecy is rooted in security concerns .
His grandmother , Indira Gandhi , was assassinated , as was his father , Rajiv Gandhi .
( The family is not related to Mohandas Gandhi , considered the father of modern India .
Rahul Gandhi ’s great - grandfather was Jawaharlal Nehru , the first prime minister and another founding father . )
His official residence in New Delhi is heavily fortified and he traveled to the rally in Ahraura with a special black - clad security detail .
A Slocum Glider named Waldo was launched by the Mote Marine Laboratory yesterday to look for oil in the water from the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Waldo will patrol an area above Key West to about 20 miles west of the Dry Tortugas .
In this area Waldo will gather information from sensors approximately every four minutes and transmit that information every fifteen minutes via satellite .
Waldo is the second UAV ( Underwater Autonomous Vehicle ) to be launched to look for oil .
The first UAV was launched last week and is called Nemo .
Mote Marine Laboratory may even launch a third UAV even further west of the Dry Tortugas and hopes all three gliders will act as an early warning system should any oil be detected .
Dr Gary Kirkpatrick , who is heading up the glider mission , stated :
‘ There are really large issues at stake for us here in Florida , ’ Kirkpatrick said .
‘ It ’s not really logistically possible to have humans in boats covering these wide areas , constantly looking for signs of the oil spill coming toward our shores .
But we have these great robots that can do this 24 hours a day for three weeks in a row , so it ’s important we use these tools . ’

German pro-Palestinian activist Norman Paech has said he only saw wooden sticks being brandished as Israeli commandos abseiled on to the deck of the Mavi Marmara .
Eyewitness accounts from ships raided by Israeli commandos have cast doubt on Israel 's version of events that led to the deaths of at least 10 people .
Israel says its soldiers were attacked with " knives , clubs and other weapons " and opened fire in self defence .
What 's wrong with states ' rights ?
Posted Thursday , June 17 , 2010 7:38 am
First there were " Truthers " andthen " Birthers , " and now there are " Tenthers . "
To be accurate , the " Tenthers " actually came first , since this newly coined term ( which is supposed to denote a " fringe " position and is therefore derogatory ) refers to those who believe the 10th Amendment to the Constitution actually means what it says , that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states .
By this definition , today 's " Tenthers " may consider themselves in good company since we can assume many , if not all , of the founders themselves agreed with this concept .
The history of the " Tenthers " dates back to 1789 , when the Constitution was being considered for ratification throughout the former colonies .
Though the enumerated powers listed in Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution seemed concise enough to limit federal power , Americans were still wary of government 's tendency to grow and liberty to yield .
This concern was a central theme at the state ratifying conventions and as a compromise the first ten amendments , known as the Bill of Rights , were added to the Constitution in 1791 .
Amendments IX and X briefly encapsulated the two - fold theory of the Constitution : that its purpose was to protect our natural rights , which are not granted by government but are inherent by virtue of our humanity ; and , in keeping with this idea , the powers of the national government are limited by the Constitution to only those enumerated therein .
Among the early " Tenthers " was Thomas Jefferson , who , while considering the constitutionality of a national bank in 1791 , quoted the tenth amendment verbatim : " I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground that ‘ all powers not delegated to the United States , by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states or to the people , ' " Jefferson said , then declared prophetically : " To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specifically drawn around the powers of Congress , is to take possession of a boundless field of power , not longer susceptible of any definition . "

This idea of limited federal authority is a cornerstone of federalism , a governing philosophy which James Madison , principle author of the Constitution , helped develop .

" The powers delegated to the federal government are few and defined , " he said .
" Those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite .
The former will be exercised principally on external objects , [ such ] as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign commerce .
The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which , in the ordinary course of affairs , concern the lives , liberties , and properties of the people . "
The powers of the federal government today can hardly be called " few and defined . "
Far too much of our news and our lives seem to revolve around Washington , D.C.
With nearly 2 million civilian employees the federal government is the nation 's largest employer after the Postal Service , itself a semi- independent government agency .
Many federal agencies and departments -- Health and Human Services , Education , Housing -- do not even come close to being required under Constitutional authority .
Most scholars trace this power grab to the 1930s and the Roosevelt administration , when the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce was suddenly interpreted to mean Congress could regulate anything and everything .
With this decision the Supreme Court essentially declared " No holds barred ! "

But finally the states are starting to fight back against this encroachment on their rights to create a governing atmosphere in accordance with the will and the character of their residents .
As of today more than 20 states have either introduced , passed or signed non-binding resolutions or binding legislation which basically warns the federal government to " cease and desist " from any and all activities outside the scope of its constitutionally delegated powers .
For the states ' declarations of sovereignty to have any teeth , however , they must be willing to exercise the principle of nullification with regards to federal laws .
Through nullification a state declares a federal law null and void within that state 's boundaries .
There are currently nullifications efforts underway against such diverse federal laws as those concerning Real ID , firearms , medical marijuana , health care and more .
Why is the reemergence of states ' right an important step on the road toward restoring liberty ?
State governments , though still powerful , are in theory closer to and thus more responsive to their citizens .
Also , allowing states to create varied and diverse societies within the larger society of the United States allows people to choose the one that best answers their desires and needs .
In a society where choice is abundant , from the shelves of our local food stores to the multitude of apps for our iPhones , can we really tolerate a government that comes in only one size -- XXL ?

They say you can never be too rich or too thin .
But is it possible to eat too many leafy green vegetables ?
Last year , an 88 - year - old woman was admitted to NYU Langone Medical Center in a nearly comatose state , unable to walk or swallow and barely able to breathe .
Though she had no history of thyroid disease , she was given a diagnosis of myxedema coma , a life - threatening condition caused by extreme hypothyroidism , or low thyroid function .
The culprit , it turned out , was raw bok choy .
The patient had been eating two to three pounds of it every day for several months , in the belief it would help control her diabetes .
Instead , the vegetables may have suppressed her thyroid , according to NYU physicians who described the case in a letter in the May 20 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine .
Bok choy contains compounds called glucosinolates that have been found to inhibit thyroid function in animals .
Henry Fords articles in the Dearborn Independent were clearly antisemitic .
Whether his views were based on naïvety or racist ideology is a topic of continuing debate .
HENRY FORD KU KLUX KLAN ALBERT PIKE PROTOCOLS .
The Dearborn Independent A series of articles on " the Jewish question " in American automaker Henry Fords Dearborn Independent have aroused much debate and controversy since their publication in the early 1920s .
The Dearborn Independent first attacked Jews in its 22 May , 1920 issue and continued to do so in 91 subsequent editions .
1 " The Scope of Jewish Dictatorship in the United States " " Jewish Degradation of American Baseball , " " The International Jew  The Worlds Foremost Problem , " and other stories like them claimed the Jews were using communism , labour unions , gambling and even jazz music to weaken the American people .
They were later reprinted by the Dearborn Publishing Company in four paper - bound volumes .
2
Even before the articles were written , E.G. Pipp , editor of The Dearborn Independent , resigned in April , 1920 , and was replaced by William J. Cameron .
Ernest Liebold , Henry Fords personal secretary , collected much of the material and Cameron likely wrote many of the articles himself .
For another five years after the last of the " International Jew " articles was published , the Dearborn Independent continued to attack Jews .
3
After being accused by the Dearborn Independent in 1927 , of trying to control American wheat production , Jewish lawyer Aaron Sapiro filed a defamation suit in Detroit but a mistrial was declared after a juror spoke to a reporter .
Although Ford never testified , after the mistrial was declared , he issued public statements and apologies to individuals and Jews as a group .
4
On July 16 , 1927 , an out - of - court settlement of the Sapiro suit was announced .
Ford shortly thereafter sold the newspaper .
In a 1942 letter to Sigmund Livingston , then ADL national chairman , Ford wrote , " I do not subscribe to or support , directly or indirectly , any agitation which would promote antagonism against my Jewish fellow citizens . "
He pointed out that he " destroyed copies " of The International Jew when he first apologized and had refused to give " permission or sanction to anyone to use my name as sponsoring such publication , or being the accredited author thereof . "

Klan editors later assembled ninety - six of Henry Fords antisemitic essays from The Dearborn Independent and bound them in a volume they entitled The International Jew The book subsequently was reprinted in Germany by the Nazi World Service .
6 On January 12 , 1942 , an embarrassed Henry Ford wrote [ Imperial Wizard James A. ]
Colescott saying that he did ' not subscribe or support , directly or indirectly , any agitation which would promote antagonism against my Jewish fellow citizens . '
Ford threatened the Klan with legal action unless it ceased publication and circulation of his misbegotten essays . "
7 During the Nürnberg Trial of Nazi war criminals after the Second World War , two of the twenty - one defendants present , Hitler Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach and Radio Propaganda Chief Hans Fritzsche , cited the German edition of The International Jew as a major influence on their antisemitic views .
8 Fords retraction whether opportunistic or heartfelt  did not discourage a California group , the Christian Nationalist Crusade , from reprinting an abridged and much smaller edition within a decade of his death , introducing the " Protocols of the Elders of Zion " to a new generation .

This retraction was dated June 30 , 1927 : " To my great regret I learn that in the Dearborn Independent and in reprint pamphlets entitled , ' THE INTERNATIONAL JEW ' , there have appeared articles which induce the Jews to regard me as their enemy , promoting anti-Semitism .
" As a result of this survey I am deeply mortified that this journal , which is intended to be constructive and not destructive , has been made the medium for resurrecting exploded fictions , for giving currency to the so - called Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion , which have been demonstrated , as I learn , to be gross forgeries , and for contending that the Jews have been engaged in a conspiracy to control the capital and the industries of the world , besides laying at their door many offences against decency , public order and good morals ... I deem it to be my duty as an honourable man to make amends for the wrong done to the Jews as fellow men and brothers , by asking their forgiveness for the harm which I have unintentionally committed , by retracting , as far as lies within my power the offensive charges laid at their door by these publications , and by giving them the unqualified assurance that henceforth they may look to me for friendship and good will ...

An annual cheese rolling contest in which contestants chase cheese down a steep hill has gone ahead despite officially being cancelled .
The event at Coopers Hill in Gloucestershire was called off on health and safety grounds after 15,000 people attended last year .
Officials feared the event could not host so many people safely .
Despite the warnings , more than 100 people were believed to have attended an unauthorised cheese - rolling event .
More than 11,000 people have joined a campaign to bring back the event .
Meanwhile , up to 5,000 people were estimated to have turned up to watch annual Woolsack Races in Tetbury this year .
The Woolsack Race involves running up a steep hill carrying heavy sacks .
Stephen Hirst , from the Woolsack Race committee , said : " It 's a mediaeval tradition .
Men carry 60 lb ( 27kg ) woolsacks , the ladies carry 40 lb sacks ( 18kg ) . "
The course runs from The Crown in Gumstool Hill to the Royal Oak at the bottom of the hill , a distance of about 280 yards ( 256 m ) .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The time for tinkering is done .
That was the message Californians sent when they voted Tuesday to radically rejigger elections in the nation ’s most populous state .
Under Proposition 14 , a measure that easily passed , traditional party primaries will be replaced in 2011 with wide - open elections .
The top two vote - getters  whatever their party , or if they have no party at all  will face off in the general election .
Supporters argue that without parties picking candidates for the general election , moderates and independents will move to the fore , and voters will pay more attention to the electoral process .
Critics of the measure say it will give a huge advantage to candidates who have the most money or the widest name recognition .
That no one actually knows what the real effect of Proposition 14 will be seems almost beside the point to frustrated voters .
What mattered , supporters said , is that something fundamental about politics  anything fundamental  had been changed .
Not only are these lettuces laid out in beautiful patterns , they do n't seem to have a single hole , blemish , aphid or unwanted creepy crawly .
In fact , they look almost unreal , like something you 'd see in a wacky window display in Harvey Nichols or Selfridges .
They are in the Model Vegetable Garden at Wisley where the word ' model ' might appear to have several meanings .
( On the subject of unreal veg , I never understood why butchers always had - and sometimes still have - plastic tomatoes and sprigs of false parsley in amongst the sausages and chops . )
Scarborough : " Why is Joe Barton being allowed to keep his job ? "
" Why is Joe Barton being allowed to keep his job , when Joe Barton apologized to a corporation that is destroying my home town 's economy , and is destroying the environment across the Gulf Coast ? "
That 's Joe Scarborough this morning , posing a very well - framed question to Eric Cantor .
The ensuing verbal skirmish between the two men is the day 's must - watch video :
Cantor put up a good fight , repeatedly claiming that Joe Barton is " not the issue , " reiterating the Republican line that the real issue that matters is stopping the spill .
When Cantor compared Barton 's BP apology to gaffes issued by Joe Biden , Scarborough repeatedly pushed back hard , pointing out that Barton 's apology came from prepared remarks .
And Scarborough wondered aloud in a mystified tone why Republicans were n't axing Barton :
" This hurts the Republican Party .
This hurts the Republican brand .
Joe Barton is the most powerful Republican on the Hill when it comes to energy policy , and that shows his mindset .
Does it not ? "
The question is , Why have n't Republicans removed him ?
As best as I can determine , Republicans believe there 's no political percentage in doing so because Dems will continue attacking them as stooges for Big Oil no matter what they do .
Republicans do n't appear to think the Barton attack is as effective as , say , attacking them for taking Big Oil 's campaign contributions .
They think attacks featuring the unknown Barton will sound like so much Beltway white noise .
Republicans appear to think that any discussion of oil has a downside for Dems , because it allows Republicans to keep pointing out that Obama has failed to stop the spill .
But judging by the pressure on Cantor , Scarborough , for one , appears worried that Barton is damaging to the GOP .
UPDATE , 12:31 p.m. : DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan responds :
Last month an early cut of the unreleased movie Hackers Wanted found its way to BitTorrent .
As the director 's cut of the movie also leaked out last night , Torrent Freak caught up with director Sam Bozzo who through the prism of 15 years in movie making gives his opinion on how leaks , BitTorrent and file - sharing affects the industry .
As described by director Sam Bozzo , the movie ‘ Hackers Wanted ’ explores the differences between true hackers and today ’s “ computer criminals ” and follows the lives of hackers who found themselves arrested after pointing out security holes in computer systems .
Although the movie was completed , internal conflict with its producer meant that it was unlikely to see a release , officially at least .
Last month we were able to report that the Internet had pushed those conflicts aside and the movie had leaked and become available worldwide through BitTorrent .
It seems that the version was only a rough cut though .
“ I am sad that my cut was never officially released , ” explains Bozzo .
“ It would be hypocritical of me to complain of this internet leak , since I openly spoke on TorrentFreak in favor of such leaks for my new film Blue Gold , but on the other hand , I am sad that the leaked cut is not my Director ’s Cut , but a very old cut ! ”
Yesterday , Sam ’s disappointments were overcome .
Pirate Bay releaser ‘ room101bellboy ‘ told us the he was about to release the Director ’s Cut after being offered it by an unnamed source .
TorrentFreak contacted Sam and informed him of the new leak and followed up an earlier request for a first hand opinion on how BitTorrent is affecting the movie industry .
Here is his response in full .
Hackers Wanted Director Sam Bozzo On BitTorrent and the Movie Industry
I have never uploaded or downloaded any torrent , so it is strange for me to be in a position where both of my independent feature documentaries have been so positively effected by torrents , both in very different ways .
One was an already released film , the other an unreleased film .
TorrentFreak asked that I consider my fifteen years navigating the film industry as a struggling filmmaker and these torrent experiences to write up an opinion of how file - sharing will affect the film industry , in hopes that my opinions may benefit both the torrent and film communities .
In a nutshell , I believe the only films that are hurt by torrent sharing are mediocre and bad films .
In contrast , the good films of any genre only benefit from file - sharing .
Due to this , I feel the current file - sharing trend is a catalyst for a true evolution in filmmaking and attempt to explain my theory in this article .
Readers of TorrentFreak may remember when my already released documentary “ Blue Gold : World Water Wars ” was leaked .
Initially I reacted as most independent film producers do , enraged and terrified I would never make my money back from my film due to this ‘ breach ’ .
Thankfully , I have some very good hacker friends who talked me into viewing the situation in a positive light , which I did .
I contacted the uploader of my film and asked she spread a message of support with the torrent , asking for donations if a viewer likes the film and explaining that was a self - financed endeavor .
The result ?
I received many donations and emails of support from those who downloaded the film , but I furthermore believe that viewers spread the word of the film to their non-torrent - downloading friends and that DVD sales increased due to the leak .
For me , the torrent leak was ultimately “ free advertising ” , and I am the only truly independent documentary filmmaker I know making his money back this year .
With “ Blue Gold ” already available on DVD in North America , UK , Japan , and Australia , the initial fear of a filmmaker is that each person who downloads a torrent would have instead paid to buy or rent a DVD if the torrent were not available .
I feel this is false for many reasons .
For an independent film like mine , most torrent users would have never heard of my film if not for the torrent .
Unlike a large blockbuster film , I had no advertising money to spread the word of the film , so the torrent leak provided another outlet to hopefully create a viral campaign of word - of - mouth .
The main point , though , is that this only worked because the film is a solid good film ( for the target market at least ) , so word of mouth could only help the film .
But what about major films which have millions of dollars of advertising costs to recoup ?
Blockbusters which have already been released and are public - knowledge due to their market exposure ?
In this case , I feel it is important to compare file sharing not with DVD - purchases or rental , but with streaming a film via Netflix ’s Watch Instantly and also with inviting friends over to watch a film in a group .
In neither of these situations does a film make any money .
Most are surprised to learn that Netflix pays only a fixed fee to the distributor for the number of years they may offer a film , regardless of whether that film is streamed once or a million times in that time period .
Yet anyone I know on Netflix ’s Watch Instantly platform , including me , is thrilled to be there .
Why ?
The exposure .
The more people who see the film , the more will likely love it and want to buy it for their collection .
When you invite a group of friends to your house to watch a DVD , do you charge them ?
One person bought one DVD , and ten watch it free , but if the film is good , hopefully a few of them will buy a DVD for themselves , or at least spread positive word .
Torrents should be viewed the same .
But why are n’t they ?
The difference is the quality of the film being produced .
Because I believe in the product I create , I want as many people exposed to it as possible , for free if needed , as I believe my films will create fans and grow a wider audience .
I ’ve had college students change their majors to environmental studies because of seeing “ Blue Gold ” , and an activist with terminal cancer using his last months of life organizing hundreds of free worldwide screenings .
Why would I want to hide a film that creates such a reaction in an audience ?
How would that benefit me ?
Good filmmakers are not afraid to have their films seen , they fight to have them seen .
They pay thousands of dollars for the ‘ honor ’ of screening them for free at film festivals , so why not embrace screening them for free online with no ‘ submission fee ’ required ?
How , then , do ‘ bad ’ films become hurt by torrents ?
I believe it is because of the timing .
Whereas Netflix Watch Instantly will only be available ‘ after ’ the theatrical release and DVD sales , torrent leaks make the film available for mass online blogging reviews and word - of - mouth ‘ before ’ the film is for sale to a paying audience .
Why is that a problem ?
If it is a good film , I do n’t think it is .
It only spreads a pre-marketing buzz for the upcoming official release .
But distributors of bad and mediocre films depend solely on a paying audience ’s misconception that they are paying to watch a good film , when they are not .
Via mass marketing , trailers , posters , and paying high fees to star actors , distributors of bad films are betting all their money on one thing ; getting as many people to pay to see the film the opening weekend in a theater before that disgruntled , unsatisfied audience tells all of their friends to avoid their bad film .
If you think logically just a second , it ’s ridiculous to judge a film ’s quality at all from the opening weekend , because nobody has seen the film yet to judge it !
The opening weekend only demonstrates how much money was spent on advertising and the stars .
That ’s it .
Yet you will notice all of the industry reviews and charts of the ‘ success ’ of a film looks primarily at the opening weekend versus the long - term results .
Why is the system set up like this ?
I and many other film fans feel the quality of storytelling in films has deteriorated at an alarming rate since the 1970 - mid 1980s .
Of course there are rare gems each year we all look forward to re-watching , but in general the quality of film product being produced is mediocre at best .
Why ?
I remember Kathleen Kennedy , a great producer , visiting my film school Art Center College of Design in Pasadena , and explaining that a film ’s ‘ success ’ was judged during the 1970 - mid 1980s by the long term box - office , not the opening weekend .
About week five , after the audience has had a chance to discuss the film , positively or negatively with their friends , did a film audience attendance peak .
Why did the shift occur ?
One reason is certainly that as distributors were willing to put more money into pre-advertising , usually to at least match the budget of the film itself , then theater owners were somewhat safer booking those films , even if they were bad , so they could make a lot of money on opening weekend , drop the film after people realized they were robbed , and replace it with a new bad film that has had an insane amount of money put behind it .
This could conceivably make the theater owner more money than waiting four weeks to see which films were going to live and which were not .
This became especially true as less and less great films were being made .
So it is a chicken and egg problem .
Regardless , why are bad films made ?
Again it ’s completely subjective what has happened since the 1970 - 1980s period of filmmaking in America .
Personally I believe film used to be considered a director ’s medium and now it is considered a Producer ’s medium .
How ?
A great Producer is priceless and I only hope to work with more , having worked with Si Litvinoff and Mark Achbar already .
But increasingly the credit “ Producer ” has become a bargaining chip that any executive who recommends a script to another demands they receive , so you end up with fifteen “ Producers ” on a film who did no real Producing ( To Produce is a verb , remember ) .
So we end up with real Producers as angry with this problem as Directors .
There was a great Producer ’s Guild of America campaign where George Lucas made a PR poster saying “ Even in Science Fiction , the Fiction ends when the credits role ” or something like that .
Any person can claim to be a producer .
An ex-military Wall Street broker can wake up and claim to be a “ Producer ” .
No questions asked .
So these type of people do not want to hire good filmmakers .
I know of so many such “ Producers ” who will not hire a Writer / Director because they want to control the film even though they do n’t have the creativity or talent to .
They would rather hire six Writers and two Directors to maintain the drivers seat .
The result ?
Bad to mediocre films .
Sound familiar ?
Regardless of ‘ why ’ films have deteriorated , I believe nobody goes into a film wanting to make a bad or medicore film .
These self - declared “ Producers ” feel they have enough talent to juggle mutliple filmmakers and make it work , but then do n’t .
I also believe that subconsciously they and their distributors know their film is not great .
This is why they are willing to spend $ 20 million on a star actor and hundreds of millions on advertising .
It ’s a panic move .
They want to try to appear to make money even if ultimately the film loses money .
How ?
By throwing insane amounts of money towards the opening weekend .
Enter a torrent leak .
You can see how a bad Producer would panic .
They fear that the torrent community will reveal their scam by letting consumers know they will be wasting their money on trash .
I have never self - produced a short film or documentary that has not won international awards and had a strong audience .
Huge audience ?
No , but always devoted .
And being a true filmmaker who produces , writes , directs , and edits his film , let me say for the record that no film should ever cost more than $ 2 million , and that only if people are well paid .
With such a budget , a film can and should make its money back and torrents can only help spread the word to make that happen .
It ’s when people spend hundreds of millions on one film that it becomes an impossible model , similar to the real estate bubble that recently burst .
With everything focused on the opening weekend , it is difficult to really calculate how many of these ‘ blockbusters ’ actually ever net a real profit after advertising , film prints , and star salaries are factored in .
Torrents threaten to pop that bubble .
I , for one , am glad .
Why ?
Because I am bitter towards people who make large budget films ?
Yes and no .
I feel a studio would make more money and safer money by taking $ 300 million they spend on one film and making 150 independent films and betting that half of those pay for the rest and make profits above the $ 300 million invested .
If that were the model , we ’d have more filmmakers , more films , and torrents and Netflix Watch Instantly would be no threat to anyone .
It would be , as I said , free marketing .
My second and most recent film that leaked was another issue .
It was an unreleased film called “ Hacker ’s Wanted ” , which I did not produce but wrote , directed , and edited .
The potential here is almost more rewarding for a filmmaker , to simply have his work seen at all .
I had the honor of meeting my film hero Terry Gilliam on set of “ Brothers Grimm ” ( Matt Damon introduced me as I was a Top 10 Project Greenlight Director ) .
“ Brazil ” is one of my favorite films , and any who are fans know of the infamous “ Battle for Brazil ” where the studio simply did not understand the film and wanted to recut it and make a dark surreal comedy - tragedy into a light romantic - comedy .
The fight was epic and basically “ Brazil ” sat on a shelf for years .
Gilliam eventually had to take out a full page Variety ad saying “ When will you release my film Brazil , Mr. ( Producer ) ” , enter his cut into Los Angeles Film Critics Association where it won Best Picture , and even arrange a private USC screening where the studio sent police to try and get the film print from him .
What if this all happened with the internet out there ?
With torrent users ?
I think what just happened with “ Hackers Wanted ” is a very small humble example of how much easier it would have been for Gilliam to have his film seen .
And if he were lucky like me , he would n’t even have to leak it !
I have no clue who leaked my documentary , a frustrated hacker fan or disgruntled ex-employee of the producer .
Who cares .
It lives somewhere now .
And people can talk .
They can blog .
They can discuss .
They can give life to what was lifeless .
If the producers release another cut , great !
There is already word - of - mouth leading up to it .
Free advertising .
How can that be ‘ wrong ’ in any way ?
Ultimately , I believe there is no choice .
I believe that given the ease of Netflix and others being streamed to TVs and the impossibility of stopping torrents , the evolution from billion dollar all - or - nothing gambles to greater quantity , lower budget films will happen .
Torrents are , if I had to pitch it , “ Darwin meets Hollywood ” and frankly Hollywood needs an Evolution !
For the last few years , much of the innovation around solar technology has been aimed at generating more electricity from sunlight .
But a new crop of entrepreneurs is working to use the sun more efficiently by using its heat , as well as its light , for individual business , factories and , perhaps one day , even homes .
These companies say that providing both electricity and heat reduces the amount of time it takes customers to recoup their investments .
“ It ’s a single system that provides the greatest impact on a homeowner ’s energy bill , ” says Sam Weaver , CEO of heat and power solar startup Cool Energy .
These technologies stand to benefit if natural - gas prices rise , considering that natural gas is used both for heating and for electricity .
Those prices rose after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sank and began leaking oil in the Gulf of Mexico , amid concerns that the spill could reduce natural - gas production , and prices could rise again if hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast and reduce production .
A gas pipeline explosion in Texas probably does n’t help either .
In general , the new combined - solar - heat - and - power systems are based on the same concentrating solar - thermal technology used by the big solar projects — both already built and in the works — in the Mojave Desert .
( The 392 - megawatt system BrightSource is building with its $ 1.37 billion federal loan guarantee is one of these . )
The large desert systems concentrate sunlight and use it to heat fluid running in tubes .
Then , that steam can be used to run a turbine and make electricity .
With the systems for homes and businesses , the heat would be used directly for warm air or hot water , or — although it may seem counterintuitive — could be used to run an air conditioner .
( Heat paired with an absorption chiller , for example , can power air conditioning . )
Meanwhile , some of the systems siphon a portion of the steam to make electricity , such as via a generator , while others use photovoltaic cells , and in some cases concentrators that direct sunlight to those cells , to produce electricity .
A Symbiotic Relationship
Pairing solar heat and electricity is an attractive idea because , companies say , a combined system would cost less than two separate systems , and could be far more competitive compared to the price of both a heating and an electric system added together .
On top of that , the technologies fit well together , according to Jenny Chase , lead solar analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance .
“ Generally speaking , you have something that wants heat and something that wants to get rid of heat , ” she says .
All photovoltaic cells lose their efficiencies at higher temperatures , and that challenge is exacerbated with concentrating - photovoltaic technologies , which get very hot , she explains .
Solar - thermal technologies could potentially use that heat , keeping the photovoltaic systems cool .
And as solar prices continue to fall and conventional electricity prices remain low , companies are looking for ways to stand out from the competition and to do more with less , such as by boosting the value of solar energy .
Technologies have improved , reducing the expected prices of combined heat - and - power solar systems and raising their efficiencies , and state and federal policies pushing more renewable energy .
“ People are starting to think more broadly , ” Weaver says .
“ People are realizing that in a lot of places , electricity is not the largest part of the energy bill and are taking a more holistic [ view ] of energy in people ’s homes and commercial facilities . ”
While nearly everybody understands electricity , making solar electricity an easier sell , heat is much more regional , he adds .
“ In some places , such as the Southwest , electricity is dominant ; in other places , heating is dominant . ”
Some companies and researchers are approaching combined heat and power from two directions : concentrating photovoltaic ( PV ) systems and concentrating solar - thermal systems .
They ’re also targeting a variety of markets , including industrial , commercial and residential uses .
Concentrating PV vs. Concentrating Solar - Thermal
The Center for Architecture Science and Ecology ( CASE ) in New York is developing a concentrating PV technology integrated into a glass façade with a ‘ gem - like ’ architectural design ( see lead image for a close - up look at the product ) .
CASE claims the system brings more daylight into buildings , while removing much of the heat that comes with the light , and delivers electricity and usable heat with 60 percent efficiency .
The Fresnel lens concentrators direct light into gallium - arsenide solar cells , while a heat sink behind those cells collects heat .
If architects and developers like the look and the lighting features , this technology could gain traction , Chase says .
“ It sounds like it could be attractive and useful , ” she says .
“ It depends on how good they are at marketing this stuff . ”
In California , Entech Solar is also taking a concentrating - photovoltaic approach .
It ’s developing a system for commercial and industrial customers that concentrates sunlight 20 times to make electricity , while also capturing the heat for hot water , according to a CNET article published back in 2008 .
Meanwhile , Chromasun , also based in California , is working on a concentrating solar - thermal system that uses shiny metal strips to concentrate and reflect light onto oil - filled pipes , creating heat to run commercial air conditioners .
CEO Peter Le Lievre , formerly the chief executive of utility - scale solar - thermal company Ausra , said last year that Chromasun is also developing a concentrating PV panel , which would reflect light onto solar cells and produce more heat for the pipes , to add to the system .
In 2008 , the company partnered with researchers from the Australia National University and China ’s Tianjin University to explore the technology .
And Colorado - based Cool Energy wants to provide space heating , water heating and electricity with a system that uses weather predictions and other data to predict the most cost - effective combination for customers on any given day .
Founded in 2006 , the company is developing a system that uses off - the - shelf evacuated solar collectors , usually used for solar hot - water systems , to heat a mineral - oil - based fluid that retains heat well .
The fluid , which can be stored in an insulated tank until it ’s needed , will be able to heat both water and air , while some of the heat will be used to run a Stirling engine ( pictured , left ) the company calls SolarHeart .
Stirling engines use pressure created by hot air on one side and cooler air on the other side to move pistons and generate electricity .
The system also includes an Internet - based control system that will use publicly available information , such as predictions about the weather , temperature and sunlight , to decide how much heat and electricity to produce .
The idea is that in the winter , or whenever it ’s cold and cloudy , the system will store heat , while in sunny temperatures , it will deliver electricity .
With a heat exchanger , the system also could potentially make use of waste heat from appliances like dishwashers .
Cool Energy , which is targeting residential customers that use fuel oil and propane for heat , believes it will be able to address a potential market of roughly $ 1 billion annually in North America alone .
The system would make the most sense for customers in places with long winters , who need space heating for winter , electricity for air conditioning in the summer and hot water all year round , Weaver says .
In some parts of the United States and Canada , in places with long winters , air and water heating accounts for more than half of customers ’ annual energy bills , he adds .
The technology wo n’t be available for a few years , however .
The eight - person company has developed a 1.8 - kilowatt prototype running at 15.5 percent efficiency and expects to bring that to around 20 percent efficiency by the time it hits the market in 2011 .
Cool Energy is looking for around 10 pilot projects now , then plans to ramp to a few hundred in 2011 , thousands in 2012 in 2013 and between 10,000 and 20,000 per year by 2014 , Weaver says .
The company ’s already raised a few million in angel funding and about $ 900,000 of government funding from the National Science Foundation , and is now seeking $ 5 million for its first round of venture - capital funding .
Canada - based Conserval Engineering also makes a PV / Thermal hybrid solution that pairs with its SolarWall , which RenewableEnergyWorld.com recognized with an Excellence in Renewable Energy award last year .
Finally , Swedish startup Absolicon has developed a solar collector that tracks the sun , uses a parabolic reflector to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells to produce power , then collects heat for hot water and cooling .
( See image of the collector , right . )
For cooling , the heat is used to dry a salt that then cools water , the company says .
Founded in 2007 , Absolicon already has completed a handful of installations on large buildings with flat roofs , including an eight - collector array installed at a hospital in Härnösand in April , and has raised 1 million euros from angel investors .
Challenges
Of course , these systems face plenty of challenges .
Combining two systems , no matter how symbiotic , is rarely as easy as it sounds , and complexity can lead to unexpected costs in production or installation .
“ The big problem is new solar products are all a bit risky , ” Chase says .
With that risk , customers and financiers may not be willing to lay out the upfront cash to buy these heating technologies right away .
In the meantime , prices for regular photovoltaic solar panels keep falling .
By the time these technologies hit the market , “ it might just be cheaper to shove a PV system on the roof and run your conventional AC from it , ” Chase adds .
Traditional heating and cooling technologies are n’t standing still , either , and those improvements could make these new solar heat and power systems less competitive .
Hallowell International , for example , sells an energy - efficient electric heating and cooling system that uses boosted compression to absorb more heat , which it claims can deliver 30 to 70 percent cost savings , and this year also began offering a hybrid option to allow customers to switch between electricity and natural gas depending on prices .
CEO Duane Hallowell says the company conservatively forecasts it will sell 3,000 systems this year .

Also the doctor 's journal of incredible things and the master 's ring !
Now we ’ve all had a few days to play around with Safari 5 , here are some tips for getting the most out of the new features .
1. Update plugins
The first thing you are going to want to do after you install Safari 5 is make sure all your plugins are up to date .
Updates are available for 1 Password , SafariStand and Saft .
PithHelmet is not yet Safari 5 compatible , but an update is expected within days .
ClickToFlash does n’t require updating .
For other plugins you will have to check on a case by case basis .
Also keep an eye out to see if any of these plugins change to become Safari Extensions .
2. Enable Extensions
To enable extensions , check “ Show Develop menu ” under the Advanced tab in the Safari Preferences .
Then find the Develop menu in the menubar and choose “ Enable Extensions . ”
Now you can download extensions and double - click on them to install them in Safari .
I ’ve written a few that are available here , and there are loads of others available on the Safari Extensions Tumblr site .
Update : Extensions are now enabled by default in Safari 5.0.1 .
3. Reader keyboard shortcut
On any page where the new reader function is available , just press Command - Shift - R to quickly bring it up .
This will only work on pages that Safari decides are suitable for reader .
Safari seems to be quite clever at figuring out whether a page contains an article .
If there is not enough text in one place , or if there are clearly multiple articles on one page , the feature is disabled .
4. Access RSS feed on reader pages
On article pages , the reader button replaces the RSS button .
If you want to access the RSS feed for the page , just click and hold on the reader button to bring up a menu with a list of all the available RSS feeds .
5 . Print from reader
Reader provides a great way to print articles .
It automatically strips out all the unnecessary stuff on a page such as adverts , while keeping in important images .
For articles spread out over separate web pages , it even gathers them all together so you can read and print them more easily .
6 . Change the look of reader
The only change that you can officially make to reader styles is the text size .
With reader enabled , just press Command -+ ( plus ) and Command -- ( minus ) to increase and decrease the size .
Modifying the look further can be done by editing a file within the Safari bundle , but be warned that this can disable Safari ’s Keychain access ( a precaution as the application has been tampered with ) .
If you really want to do it , find Safari in your Applications folder , right - click it and choose Show Package Contents .
Inside the package , in the Resources folder , you should find a file called Reader . html , which you can edit in your favourite text editor .
To open it properly in TextEdit , choose Open from the File menu , press Command - Shift - G , paste in / Applications / Safari.app / Contents / Resources , and make sure you check “ Ignore rich text commands . ”
This file is mainly just CSS that defines the appearance of reader .
Just experiment with it to figure out what changes what .
Some popular changes are stopping the text from being justified , changing the colour of the links , and changing it to white text on a black background .
Remember to make a backup of Reader . html before you make any changes .
7 . Always open windows in new tabs
There is now a new setting in the Tabs Preferences to specify the behaviour of links that are set to open in new windows .
Choosing “ Never ” keeps the old behaviour of opening in a new window , whereas “ Automatically ” opens these links in new tabs instead of windows .
New window links that have a specified size like a small popup will still open in a new window unless you choose “ Always . ”
8. Improved Web Inspector
If you ’re a web developer , this will be a welcome improvement .
It ’s also really useful for those developing extensions for Safari .
One useful change that I noticed is that you can now click a link in the CSS inspector on the right to jump straight to the rule definition in the source file .
The Javascript inspector also has improved breakpoint support , and there is a new Timeline Panel .
9 . Searchable address bar
The address bar now Spotlight searches your history and bookmarks .
So now when you start to type into it , instead of just matching URLs , pages with titles or contents that contain what you are typing will appear .
I ’m not sure if I really like this yet , as it ’s a bit of a big change to get used to .
Also it seems that Apple have decided to go in a different direction to Google Chrome and devote the address bar to history searching rather than Google searching .
10 . Private Browsing mode
Safari now reminds you when you are in Private Browsing mode by placing a “ Private ” badge in the address bar .
It ’s a helpful reminder if you often accidentally leave Private Browsing enabled .
When you ’re are done , simply click on the badge to return to normal browsing mode .
11 . Go watch some animated gifs
Finally Safari seems to be able to load animated GIFs in an acceptable amount of time , comparable to Firefox and Chrome .
To test it out , head over to a page like this .
If you ’re feeling really ambitious , try loading a whole load of them simultaneously using my Linked Images extension .
" Site specific Oil Spill
Response Plan . . . not required "
Read excerpts
for the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
In its 2009 exploration plan for the Deepwater Horizon well , BP PLC states that the company could handle a spill involving as much as 12.6 million gallons of oil per day , a number 60 times higher than its current estimate of the
.
In associated documents filed with the U.S. Minerals Management Service , the company says that it would be able to skim 17.6 million gallons of oil a day from the Gulf in the event of a spill .
As of Tuesday , BP reported recovering 6 million gallons of oily water since the ongoing spill began four weeks ago .
BP spokesman Tom Mueller said that only about 10 percent of the skimmed liquid was oil , which would amount to about 600,000 gallons of oil collected thus far .
Mueller also said via e-mail Tuesday that " the spill has stayed about the same size or even shrunk on the water as a result of our response efforts . "
Skytruth.org , a website that monitors environmental problems using satellite imagery , reported Monday that the spill had grown to 10,170 square miles , based on NASA images .
John Amos , head of Skytruth , told the Press - Register then that the spill had approximately doubled in size since Friday .
BP did not respond to questions about the NASA images .
BP's Deepwater Horizon Initial Exploration Plan suggests that the well 's unchecked flow would be 6.8 million gallons a day .
An emergency would activate the company 's Oil Spill Response Plan , a 582 - page document submitted to federal regulators in 2008 and designed to cover all BP operations in the Gulf of Mexico .
According to the document , the response plan is triggered " in the event the spill can not be controlled . "
It also calls for the company to " assemble a team of technical experts to respond to the situation . "
The document provides no detailed discussions of how a runaway well would be stopped , nor does it reflect any plan for devices such as an insertion tube , which is now recovering an estimated 84,000 gallons of oil daily , or the failed containment dome .
The plan includes detailed descriptions of the merits and limitations of three primary mitigation methods used at the surface : dispersants , skimming , and burning .
The response plan is exhaustive when it comes to staging a mitigation effort .
It provides lists of suppliers , contractors , and phone numbers for federal and state officials who should be notified in the event of a worst - case spill .
Extensive flowcharts describe who should be called , and when .
Organizational charts provide titles and positions for dozens of people to be involved in managing the crisis .

How to help :

HOW YOU CAN HELP
will appear daily in the Press - Register until there is no longer a need for volunteers in response to the oil spill disaster .
If you have suggestions for a story , or if you belong to an organization in need of such help , please call Press - Register Editor Mike Marshall at 251-219-5674 or email him at
.
The plan dictates staging areas for responders and their equipment .
It gives phone numbers for local media , results of marine toxicology tests on various dispersants , and maps showing how long it will take to get supplies to various locations .
There is a list of equipment required to set up a Joint Information Center , including a podium , four to six telephones , an answering machine , photocopier , computer and printer , a wall clock , and various other office supplies .
In the document , BP states that the company " has the capability to respond , to the maximum extent practicable , to a worst - case discharge , " which it defines as 300,000 barrels , or about 12.6 million gallons , of oil per day .
It goes on to detail dozens of skimming vessels available around the Gulf that could collectively recover 17.6 million gallons a day .
It says dispersants will be able to sink 6,080 to 7,600 barrels per day into the Gulf .
A safety data sheet about the principal dispersant that the company has reported using during the ongoing spill says " no toxicity studies have been conducted on this product , " and labels " the potential human hazard : High . "
The equipment section of the response plan 's worst - case scenario chapter does not offer any source for fire boom .
Burning , which requires such boom , is considered a primary response option for large spills in the Gulf , and its use was pre-approved by the government in 1994 .
The Press - Register has reported that in the days after the spill , federal officials had to purchase a boom from a company in Illinois to conduct the first test burn .
The BP plan contains two websites detailing locations where response supplies are stored on the Gulf Coast .
One of the addresses directs the user to what appears to be a Japanese social networking site .
Using the same address with the " .org " suffix rather than the listed " .com " leads to a spill response company .

Okay , this may be the biggest “ dog bites man ” story ever to come off Capitol Hill .
Are the liberals in Congress really so naive ?
Of course they got screwed by the Blue Dogs .
That ’s been happening for years .
I guess the good news is that they ’ve finally figured it out :
Liberal House Democrats say they ’ ve been betrayed by their conservative Blue Dog colleagues .
Months after shelving their doubts and helping Blue Dog Democrats get their signature issue of statutory pay - as - you - go language signed into law , some liberals say conservative Democrats have reneged on their side of the agreement .
They say they received assurances that Blue Dogs would support “ emergency ” spending measures intended to bolster the economy and help the unemployed even if they added to the deficit .
Designating the measures as “ emergency ” spending was supposed to exempt them from the new pay - go law , which requires new government spending to be offset with other cuts .
Instead , Blue Dog objections related to the deficit forced House leaders to strip COBRA healthcare benefits and a package of aid to states prized by liberals from the tax extenders bill .
Too many people on Capitol Hill do n’t understand that millions of families are still suffering from the economic crisis .
It ’s not over .
Unemployment is still at 9.7 % and we ’re not creating new jobs .
That seems like an emergency to me .
But , it ’s not to the Blue Dogs .
I just ca n’t believe that any liberal is surprised .
Nick Clegg will launch the Liberal Democrat manifesto with a stinging critique of Labour 's record on civil liberties and human rights – criticism that makes the prospect of a post-election partnership between the two parties more remote .
Speaking to the Guardian , the Lib Dem leader said he was shocked by the lack of reference to civil liberties in the Labour manifesto , and highlighted his own plans to scrap the next generation of biometric passports , and its communication base .
He said : " It 's a measure of the authoritarian streak of the Labour party that it did n't refer once to liberty in its own manifesto .
" Civil liberties and individual freedoms are part of the DNA of the Lib Dems .
It makes a compete mockery of the claim by Gordon Brown that he can speak for progressive voters in other parties when his own party has turned its back on one of the cornerstones of progressive politics .
" The division between the Lib Dems and Labour on civil liberties is as wide today as it was at the height of Blair 's authoritarian populism . "
Clegg was also directing his remarks at Lord Adonis , the transport secretary and former social democrat who has claimed there is a continuity of interest between the two parties .
The manifesto , part of which has been seen by the Guardian , proposes to set up a " stop unit " inside the Cabinet Office responsible for preventing anti-libertarian legislation , including the creation of new criminal offences .
The Liberal Democrats claimed scrapping biometric passports could save £ 3bn over the course of a parliament , the first time the party has mentioned this saving .
It also calls for regulation of closed - circuit television , measures to stop councils spying on people , and new guidelines to prevent unfair extraditions to the US .
The manifesto says the Lib Dems would stop children being fingerprinted at school without their parents ' permission and promises to restore the right to protest by reforming the Public Order Act to safeguard non-violent protest .
Restrictions would be introduced to narrow the scope of injunctions and there are proposals to protect free speech and investigative journalism .
The party is in favour of reforms to the English and Welsh libel laws : corporations would have to show damage and prove malice or recklessness to mount a successful court challenge against journalists .
The party also calls for a £ 10,000 cap on individual donations , down from its previous pledge to impose a £ 50,000 cap .
At the manifesto launch on Wednesday , Clegg will promise to scrap control orders , which can use secret evidence to place people under house arrest , as well as reduce the maximum period of pre-charge detention to 14 days .
The second - generation biometric passport , which includes fingerprints , is not due to be scrapped by the Tories , even though they do propose to drop the national identity register .
But the Lib Dems will argue it is not necessary to spend billions of pounds on storing fingerprints in passports , and say Britain already has a type of biometric passport known as an e-passport , which stores 16 facial measurements ( along with your name and passport number ) in the chip at the back .
Clegg said he would also scrap the communications database for which companies would be paid to store information about everyone 's email and internet use , including storing data about what you do on social networking sites such as Facebook and online computer games .
Labour had proposed a massive central database known as the interception modernisation programme to store the details of phone calls , text messages , emails and internet use .
The plans were changed so companies would hold the information at a cost of £ 2bn to the taxpayer over 10 years , and £ 800 m in the next parliament .
Data protection principles in this country say that data about citizens should only be collected if it is necessary and proportionate .
The Liberal Democrat manifesto says : " Instead of collecting information about every person in this country 's internet use , we believe that an alternative approach , based on targeting , warrants from law enforcement agencies and other safeguards is a better approach . "
seeing the benefits of human - sized environments
Perhaps the only party to emerge with a smile from last night ’s ragbag of results was the Greens , whose leader , MEP Caroline Lucas , scored a first for them , gaining a parliamentary seat for Brighton Pavilion .
The swing of 8.4 per cent from Labour to Green was just enough to leave Lucas with a majority of nearly 1,252 in what is now an effective three - way marginal .
This result wo n’t set the world on fire , but it does show that it is not impossible for Greens to win in the world of first - past - the - post voting .
Brighton Pavilion is , however , a highly unusual seat .
Brighton is seen by some as one of the focal points of British alternative culture : on the sexual front , it vies with Manchester as " queer capital of the UK " .
Ms Lucas would probably not have done quite so well just across the county border , where it seems more likely that she might have disgusted , rather than delighted , the solid citizens of Tunbridge Wells .
Lucas is a fierce and seasoned debater .
Her victory means the arrival in parliament of a strong voice arguing for a Green alternative .
She is likely to be one of the most radical MPs now seated on the green leather of the House of Commons .
Lucas will be pushing for a more equal society , with statutory maximum as well as minimum pay , positive action for women – for instance , requiring 40 per cent of board members of large companies to be female within the next five years – and a better deal for pensioners .
She will also be pushing for government to view drugs and drug addiction as health , not crime , issues .
Lucas ’ election puts the seal on what is now an established tradition in UK politics of radicalism and anti-establishment voting in the Brighton area .
Take a look at a map of the South - East , and within a sea of blue – the Tories currently hold 73 seats against 4 each for Lib Dem and Labour and one for the Greens – you will find a small island of Green and Orange clustered around Brighton .
Neighbouring Lewes and Eastbourne are Lib Dem strongholds .
Perhaps it 's something in the water .
Perhaps it ’s the social scene .
But there is definitely something about Brighton that does n’t sit comfortably with the heart of true bluedom . ®

No one is exactly sure how many Cannabis clinics exist in Los Angeles , CA , and the best estimate is somewhere between 800 and 1,000 ( CBS News ) .
The city is now attempting to close dispensaries that are n't in compliance with a new ordinance by June 7th , and ensure the roughly 130 clinics meet stringent guidelines ( MSNBC ) ..
The centers are also supposed to be non-profit , yet are making an estimated $ 1.2 per year in profits ( PBS , Need to Know ) .
This November , Californians will vote on an initiative that would legalize the use of medical marijuana for any citizen over 21 , which is even more concerning .
The following health concerns are the reasons Journey Healing Centers has taken this position :
1. Lowers Ambition -
One consequence that is overlooked from marijuana is how the drug lowers the users ' ambition to achieve life accomplishments ( SAMHSA ) .
In one case , a client ended up being suspended from school , losing his job , and eventually returning to his drug of choice crystal meth .
His last words to his counselor were , " it 's only marijuana , " says Aubrey Barrow , Admissions Director for Journey Healing Centers .
2. Marijuana is a Gateway Drug - Marijuana is typically the first drug that most drug addicts encounter when first experimenting with drugs .
The reason people call marijuana " the gateway drug " is because it often leads to other drug usage .
Years later , an addicted person may end up in treatment for a heroin , crack cocaine , meth , and / or other drug problems .
Marijuana is a harmful drug , especially since the potency of the marijuana now available has increased more than 275 percent over the last decade ( SAMHSA ) .
3. Painkiller Prescriptions
Out of Control -
The US is already challenged by a war on prescription drugs .
Opiate pain drugs and benzodiazepines are the prescription drugs that treatment centers see most commonly abused .
According to SAMHSA , prescription drug abuse is the second most common form of recreational drug use in America second only to marijuana .
Addicts are getting prescription drugs from their doctor versus the streets , who often write prescriptions quickly versus taking the time to analyze a patient 's issue .
While there are some rare instances in the medical field where marijuana may work best to alleviate pain and nausea , legalizing it for day - to - day use will only create more of an addiction problem .
Aubrey Barrow , Admissions Director at Journey Healing Centers , adds , " Although there may be economic benefits for legalizing marijuana ( business profit and taxes ) , there is also great expense .
When abused , this addiction can lead to criminal activity causing taxpayer dollars on the court system .
It will also be impossible to control the distribution and cultivation , not to mention the illegal transporting it into the US .
We do n't need additional drug challenges with our loved ones . "

The intensity of the international reactions to Israel ’s decision to stop the Gaza aid flotilla proves that we have gotten on the nerves of both friends and enemies .
After hearing endless commentaries and seeing the embarrassing displays , what should concern us is the campaign to delegitimize Israel .
This mishandled incident played into the campaign ’s hands .
There ’s a price to arrogance ; for example , when we sat the Turkish ambassador on a low seat and thought we were heroes .
This flotilla was not a humanitarian operation but a public relations campaign that Israel lost because Israel acted exactly as expected : like a bull in a china shop .
The global response from friends , and even more so from non-friends , is serious because it indicates our overall situation in the world .
People are beginning to get tired of our viewpoints and excuses .
At a time when the world is full of economic and political problems that demand solutions , Israel is taking center stage with its problems .
It seems our leaders are unaware that moderation is required when we bother the world with our problems .
Israel has to change directions quickly .
How ?
It should stop being an occupier .
I do n’t like that word , but the Palestinians have successfully introduced our image as occupiers into global awareness .
And Israel , with steps such as our siege on Gaza , is only strengthening our negative image .
When President Barack Obama ’s America is working to use agreements to reduce areas of tension around the world , Israel cannot behave like the neighborhood bully .
Even if every action is justified , our policy − what ca n’t be solved by force should be solved by more force − is not acceptable to America and the European Union .
And this comes at a time when Obama says force must be the last resort , under no circumstances the first .
That ’s why he is acting cautiously − on tiptoe − on the Iranian issue , and why the sane world is worried about the direct and implied threats that Israel will act on its own against Iran .
About a week ago a British newspaper published a report that was picked up by our newspapers , too , that Israel had sent a nuclear submarine to the Persian Gulf .
It ’s not clear whether the report is true , but just the fact that it was published was a finger in the eye of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It also embarrassed the U.S. administration .
Now , when everyone has seen how clumsily we acted against the Turkish ship the Mavi Marmara , the entire world , especially us , has to pray that Israel will leave the Iranian problem to the major powers and concentrate on bringing peace to its own backyard .
As fate − or foolish coincidence − would have it , the takeover of the Mavi Marmara took place when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Canada .
For about an hour we heard contrasting reports from there on whether Netanyahu would go on to Washington or return directly home .
He had already heard about what was happening on the ship and about the ambush set for him by Hamas ’ friends .
Sara Netanyahu ’s face did not reveal his hesitation , because in any situation the camera catches her with a big smile .
But in the end the White House decided to postpone the meeting for another time .
And they did the right thing .
Obama ’s spokesman condemned the operation , as did spokespeople , ministers and heads of state the world over .
It was the television quiz show “ 1 Against 100 ” in reverse .
It turns out that you can show contempt for some of the world some of the time , but not all of the world all of the time .
“ Something has thinned out in the Jewish brain , ” says MK Nachman Shai .
“ Every misstep of ours contains the beginning of the next one . ”
The immediate question is whether it ’s necessary to establish a commission of inquiry .
The answer is yes , because there are many unanswered questions .
Who decided and how ?
Who approved the parameters of the operation ?
How is it that Mossad chief Meir Dagan , who got us into trouble with half the world with the theft of foreign passports to assassinate Hamas leader Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai , was unable to infiltrate agents onto the Mavi Marmara to report on their forces and weapons ?
That would have prevented the surprise awaiting the fighters who were lowered onto the ship straight to the lynch units .
Where was the inventive Jewish brain ?
The defense establishment knows exactly where the failures were , but it is important to establish the commission of inquiry , with an American observer , before the United Nations sets up its own commission with a hostile chairman .
We are strong in the war against weak opponents , but the weak are turning their weakness into strength .
This operation raises questions :
How is a decision made as this one was − not in the government , not in the cabinet , but in a “ limited circle . ”
And is fat and happy Defense Minister Ehud Barak , who suits the quip about the wunderkind that “ the wonder is gone and the child remains , ” still fit to continue to serve as defense minister ?
Above all , has n’t the time come to remove Interior Minister Eli Yishai and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and their parties from the government and bring in Kadima ?
The entire world is against us − those are no longer the words of a popular Hebrew song , but a threat to our existence .
LST Low Stress Training
Well here we go , LST ( Low Stress Training ) the ultimate way to maximize your yield .
It is important to start your grow with high potency marijuana seeds genetics , with LST you can even go for tall sativa cannabis seeds strains .
Before we begin lets get some knowledge on what you will be looking at :
Light Brown : Pot Outline
Green thick Lines : Main Stem
Small Thin Lines with Green Balls on top : Fan leafs
Yellow Lines : Side Branches
Red : Tiedown Metal Hooks ( or thread whichever item you use , i use Hooks - it 's easier )
The Text in the box : First digit is Step No. and Second Digit is Pot Size , below the numbers is the type of view your looking at ( either from the SIDE or from the TOP )
STEP 1 : Grow your plant from a potent marijuana seeds strain of choice to 3 or 4 leaf sets , some use 5 but i always use 3 because after 3rd leaf set the main stem starts to harden and it will be harder to bend over your plant properly without breaking the main stem .
STEP 2 : Using a metal hook ( i cut small sections of cloths hanger and bend a U shape at the end as a hook ) bend over your plant with metal hook at the last internode ( space between the last set of fanleafs and the next to last ) and stick the metal hook into your dirt to hold down the stem .
STEP 3 : This is really not a step , just waiting time ...
Take note of how the top of the plant that was bent down will bend back upwards towards the light , this could take anywhere from 3 hours to 1 day .
Under my 1000 Watt Metal Halide light it does it in under 3 hours .
STEP 4 : Veg and dont tie down until you have a new leaf set .
You will notice Side branching has started already because good light is getting to the main stem areas next to each fanleaf stem intersection with the main stem .
STEP 5 : Depending on your starting pot size you may have to transplant .
If you started out with a large pot , repeat step 2 over and over again holding the main stem down with hooks until you reach the end of the pot .
In this illustration to save time and drawings , i started out with a small pot and it reached the end of the pot after the first tiedown .
I repotted it into a 10 inch pot which will be my final pot size for this plant in order for me to continue the LST Bends around the inside edge of the pot .
STEP 6 : Now that your new leaf set has formed you have enough length in growth since the first bend (s ) to allow you to start bending the stem horizontally around the inside edge of the pot .
Use metal hooks again to keep this bend in place .
Side branches should be coming along very nicely .
Sativa cannabis seeds strains grow faster and produce more stems , indica marijuana seeds varieties will grow half as much .
STEP 7 : Continue repeating steps 4 and 6 , allowing the plant to grow and then keep tieing it down along the inside edge of pot using metal hooks ( or whatever your using )
Side branches should be forming and growing up towards the light .
STEP 8 : Continue to repeat step 7 until you are all the way around the pot ... when you reach the point where your plant first met the edge of the plant Top the plant ( cut off the very top of the plant ) and hold it down horizontally with a metal hook ...
During all this time of repeating step 7 you should also be tieing down horizontally the new branches that have formed from the main stem as much as possible until you use up as much space as possible inside the pot as well , the outter branches growing over the outside edge of the pot you can hold down as well with string to keep those tops even with the inner branches .
STEP 9 : After you have used up all possible space inside the pot ( or your eggcrate ) its time to just let it flower ..
This is a side view of how it will and should look by that time with all the side branches growing upwards towards the light ... these will all become Collas unlike a non LST plant will only have one colla .
During flowering and even before due to lack of light on the main stem fan leafs which is all the way to the bottom almost against the soil those fanleafs will die off anyways , i usually cut these off the main stem right after the branch has grown out in that area , keeps things neat down below where you will need good airflow during flowering .. so go ahead and take off any fanleafs coming off the main stem that is going around the inside edge of the pot .
Set your timer to 12 /12 and watch it bloom .
There is no Step 10 in the picture but we all know what that is HARVEST !!!
Sativa indica hybrids or sativa marijuana seeds strains are suitable for LST as they grow fast and low stress training helps to control their height .
Choose a potent , high yielding cannabis seeds variety for LST !

WASHINGTON , DC --
The need to " fix " or restate financial statements is an admission by corporate management that these reports ( prior to their being corrected ) to the government and the investing public misrepresented the corporations ' financial positions , Texas A&M University sociology professor Harland Prechel reports in a research paper published in the June 2010 issue of the American Sociological Review ( ASR ) .
Prechel and Theresa Morris of Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut , examined the revised statements from hundreds of the largest U.S. companies between 1995 and 2004 , then co-authored the paper , titled " The Effects of Organizational and Political Embeddedness on Financial Malfeasance in the Largest U.S. Corporations : Dependence , Incentives , and Opportunities . "
The researchers ' analysis examines restatements that occurred after Congress passed the 2001 Sarbanes - Oxley Act , which held chief financial officers ( CFOs ) and chief executive officers ( CEOs ) personally responsible for corporate violations of security and exchange laws .
Soon after this legislation was passed , the number of financial restatements rapidly increased .
After eliminating the legitimate reasons for financial restatements such as accounting rule changes , their analysis shows that over 21 percent of the corporations in their study group restated their finances at least once , and some as many as seven times , during the study period .
Their research centers on financial statements , corporate structure , and politics .
And the findings have important implications for public policy , Prechel says .
" The corporate and state structures enacted in the late 20th century were the outcome of a long - term , well - financed and systematic political strategy that provided managers with unprecedented power , autonomy , and opportunity to engage in financial malfeasance , " the paper 's summary states .
There are three main findings from their quantitative analysis .
First , capital dependence on investors creates incentives to engage in financial malfeasance .
Second , managerial strategies to increase shareholder value create incentives to engage in financial malfeasance .
Third , the multilayer - subsidiary form and the political structure permitting corporate political action committees ' ( PAC ) contributions create opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance .
A key point of the analysis , Prechel says , is that the multilayer - subsidiary business model , where parent companies own multiple legally independent subsidiary corporations , creates opportunities for managers to engage in financial malfeasance by overstating the value of the assets in these corporate entities .
Prechel says that one case of improper reporting involved Enron , which overstated the value in one of its subsidiaries by $ 256 million .
He says he and Morris focus on the concept of " malfeasance " -- an act that violates a law or a rule ( or violates their intent ) established by a government agency or a nongovernmental organization responsible for corporate financial oversight -- rather than " crime , " because behaviors that are legal may still mislead investors , especially small investors , due to information asymmetry ( i.e. , when one party ( e.g. , the company ) has access to information that the other ( e.g. , investor ) lacks ) .
Individual investors are vulnerable when they invest in corporations directly or via mutual funds , Prechel says .
" There are opportunities for management to engage in financial malfeasance that investors are n't even aware of , " he explains .
" Management is aware of the true financial picture , while individual investors are not . "
Companies that do not use the multilayer subsidiaries form file revisions less frequently , Prechel says .
" The more subsidiaries a parent company has , the higher the likelihood it will restate its finances , " he says .
" But , in the cases that were included in the analysis , there is no good reason for management to not understand their corporation 's financial status . "
He says Congress could fix the problem by reinstating the tax on capital transfers that it removed in 1986 .

The Lapita culture is the name given to the artifactual remains associated with the people who settled the area east of the Solomon Islands called Remote Oceania between 3400 and 2900 years ago .
The earliest Lapita sites are located in the Bismarck islands , and within 400 years of their founding , the Lapita had spread over an area of 3,400 kilometers , stretching through the Solomon Islands , Vanuatu , and New Caledonia , and eastward to Fiji , Tonga , and Samoa .
Located on small islands and the coasts of larger islands , and separated from one another by as much as 350 kilometers , the Lapita lived in villages of stilt - legged houses and earth - ovens , made distinctive pottery , fished and exploited marine and aquacultural resources , raised domestic chickens , pigs and dogs , and grew fruit - and nut - bearing trees .
Lapita Cultural Attributes

Gérard
Lapita pottery consists of mostly plain , red - slipped , coral sand - tempered wares ; but a small percentage are ornately decorated , with intricate geometric designs incised or stamped onto the surface with a fine - toothed dentate stamp , perhaps made of turtle or clamshell .
One often - repeated motif in Lapita pottery is what appears to be stylized eyes and nose of a human or animal face .
The pottery is built , not wheel thrown , and low - temperature fired .
Other artifacts found at Lapita sites include shell tools including fishhooks , obsidian , and other cherts , stone adzes , personal ornaments such as beads , rings , pendants and carved bone .
That artifacts are not completely uniform throughout Polynesia , but rather seem to be spatially variable .
Tattooing
The practice of tattooing has been reported in ethnographic and historical records throughout the Pacific , by one of two methods : cutting and piercing .
In some cases , a series of very small cuts is made to create a line , and then pigment was rubbed into the open wound .
A second method involves the use of a sharp point which is dipped into the prepared pigment and then used to pierce the skin .
Evidence for tattooing in Lapita cultural sites has been identified in the form of small flake points made by alternating retouch .
These tools sometimes categorized as gravers have a typically square body with a point raised well above the body .
A 2018 study combining use - wear and residue analysis was conducted by Robin Torrence and colleagues on a collection of 56 such tools from seven sites .
They found a considerable variation across time and space as to how the tools were used to intentionally introduce charcoal and ochre into wounds to create a permanent mark on the skin .
Origins of the Lapita

Russell Gray & Heidi Colleran ( Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History )
In 2018 , a multidisciplinary study of DNA by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History reported support for ongoing multiple explorations of greater Oceania beginning about 5,500 years ago .
The study led by Max Planck researcher Cosimo Posth looked at the DNA of 19 ancient individuals across Vanuatu , Tonga , French Polynesia and the Solomon islands , and 27 inhabitants of Vanuatu .
Their results indicate that the earliest Austronesian expansion began 5,500 years ago , starting from modern - day Taiwan , and ultimately carrying people as far westward as far as Madagascar and eastward to Rapa Nui .
About 2,500 years ago , people from the Bismarck archipelago began arriving on Vanuatu , in multiple waves , marrying into the Austronesian families .
The continual influx of people from the Bismarcks must have been fairly small , because islanders today still speak Austronesian , rather than Papuan , as would be expected , given that the initial genetic Austronesian ancestry seen in the ancient DNA has been almost completely replaced in the modern residents .
Decades of research have identified obsidian outcrops used by the Lapita in the Admiralty Islands , West New Britain , Fergusson Island in the D’Entrecasteaux Islands , and the Banks Islands in Vanuatu .
Obsidian artifacts found in datable contexts on Lapita sites throughout Melanesia have allowed researchers to refine the previously established massive colonization efforts of the Lapita sailors .

The Russian government 's actions raise too many questions about the April 10 airplane crash that killed many of the most anti-Russian leaders of Poland .
My recent conversations with informed Polish sources reveal so many irregularities with how the Russian government handled the crash that nobody should presume that the disaster was accidental until all the facts are in .
I knew four of the Polish officials who died in the crash and have a special interest in raising unpleasant questions and pushing for full answers .
Here are the issues that surfaced in my recent discussions one month after the disaster that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and other senior Polish figures :
President Kaczynski and his entourage were traveling to Smolensk , Russia , near the Katyn forest where the Soviet NKVD ( Chekists ) murdered thousands of Polish officers during World War II .
Kaczynski was a strong critic of Moscow and its failure to repudiate its Soviet past .
His rival , Prime Minister Donald Tusk , has taken a much softer approach toward Moscow .
Tusk was not on the plane .
Tusk held an official observance of the anniversary of the Katyn massacre with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Tusk and Putin agreed in advance that Kaczynski would not be part of the official commemoration , and that Kaczynski would arrive separately on a " private " visit .
In the hour or so after the crash , the Russian government officially blamed the disaster on " pilot error , " before an investigation had begun .
Russian officials said the Polish pilot did not speak Russian , when the pilot spoke excellent Russian .
Putin has assumed personal control of the crash investigation .
The Russian government has maintained total , opaque control of the crash investigation , in violation of the Chicago Convention that governs international air crashes and in violation of a bilateral 1993 agreement that joint commissions would conduct investigations of aircraft disasters affecting both countries .
All 97 bodies of the crash victims , including the late Polish president , were removed from the crash site before Polish authorities could arrive , and brought to Poland .
No independent autopsies of the crash victims was permitted , and Polish officials did not have the ability to be present during the autopsies .
All personal effects of the crash victims were removed from the scene and taken to Moscow before any Polish official could arrive .
Russian security officers interrogated Polish family members who traveled to Moscow to recover the bodies - sometimes for hours - and were denied access to the bodies until the interrogations were complete .
The daughter of parliament member Zbigniew Wasserman , who oversaw the security services , went to Russia for her father 's body but was detained six hours and interrogated .
She was repeatedly denied the right to have a Polish official present for her interrogation .
Russian officials required Polish family members of the victims to sign that they were satisfied that the personal effects were all in order or had been destroyed in the crash ; those who did not want to sign were told that they would not have access to their loved ones ' remains until they did sign .
There has been no independent verification that all the bodies are accounted for .
The bodies were returned to Poland in sealed coffins for burial .
Families of the victims were not permitted to open the coffins .
Under Polish law , official permission from the state prosecutor 's office is required to exhume a body , and that office has denied family requests , apparently for fear of offending the Russian government .
The Russian government has not turned over two of the plane 's black boxes to Polish authorities , despite repeated formal Polish requests .
Two of the three boxes aboard the Russian - made Tupolev 154 presidential plane were of Russian manufacture , and one was Polish .
The Russian government briefly gave the Polish - made black box to the Polish government , then took it back .
Russia has refused to hand over the two Russian - made black boxes .
Russia 's intelligence services have used the disaster as a spy operation against Poland and the NATO alliance .
Russian authorities recovered laptop computers , flash drives , cell phones and other electronic gear belonging to the Polish president , senior military leaders , security chief and other top officials who died on the flight .
Those items contained sensitive names , telephone numbers , correspondents , documents , and top secret military and diplomatic codes .
The Russians delayed for days and sometimes weeks before returning the items .
Some of the items , such as flash drives belonging to officials with responsibility for security and intelligence matters , are missing .
Russian officials waited six days before returning President Kaczynski's Nokia cell phone to the Polish government .
After Russian security officers removed what they wanted from the site , they left the site unguarded .
Polish journalists discovered that the site was unattended .
A Polish aviation official who serves as a day - to - day interlocutor with the Russians on the matter told a Polish parliamentary commission , " We know everything that happened but the Russians forbid us to tell you . "
The official said that it could take as long as a year before Russia releases the information .
Most Polish officials seem to believe that the Russian government played some role in the crash .
Kaczynski was the most anti-Russian leader in Europe , and his entourage on the plane included similarly minded senior military and security officials .
Kaczynski's twin brother , Jaroslaw , was supposed to have been on the plane as well .
On the heels of years of Russian assassinations of Putin 's internal opponents , the assassination by radioactive polonium of a top KGB defector in London , the attempted assassination of the anti-Russian leader of Ukraine , the Moscow - backed overthrow of the government of Kyrgyzstan and other actions , Polish officials can only presume that Putin may have had a hand in the April 10 crash .
The disaster took place on Russian soil , with Putin 's secret services in total control of the probe that he personally directs .
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk , who opposed the late president and is in charge of day - to - day affairs of state , appears fearful of Russia and does not want to say or do anything to upset Putin .
Tusk says that those who suspect foul play are motivated by " anti-Russian " prejudice , but sources close to him say he has never definitively called the crash an " accident . "
" Prime Minister Tusk , at every moment from the crash , says , ' We will do this or that because the Russian government wants it and we do n't want to offend the Russians . '
Tusk acts like he is in fear , " a source close to Tusk tells me .
Why has Prime Minister Tusk acted like in such a servile manner toward Moscow in the wake of the April 10 crash ?
If the crash was an accident , what is Tusk afraid of ?
TWO shifty businessmen and one huge bodyguard carrying a large bag enter Vladikavkaz airport , a stone 's throw from the cemetery in which the victims of last year 's terrorist atrocity at Beslan are buried .
They whisper to an airport official , who takes their documents and sees to their check - in .
The three men and their un - X - rayed bag are next seen heading for their plane from a side door in the terminal .
Caught out by an obscure regulation , a driver tells a Moscow traffic policeman that he wants to settle things quickly , but without breaking the law .
“ Too many things are illegal in our country , ” grumbles the cop , implying that a more sensible government would make bribery legal as well as universal .
So how much does he want ?
“ Give me what your soul tells you . ”
Those recent examples are from your correspondent 's experience — but corruption in Russia is everywhere .
Often , it seems not a by - product of policy and events , but the main reason for them , a stronger force even than resurgent nationalism .
It poisons people 's relations with the police , bureaucrats and politicians ( see chart ) .
And it appears to be getting worse .
Being covert , the precise dimensions of corruption are hard to measure .
But trends are discernible .
In the latest international “ corruption perceptions index ” produced by Transparency International ( TI ) , a watchdog , Russia has fallen to rank alongside Niger , Sierra Leone and Albania .
A recent survey by Indem , a Russian think - tank , found an enormous hike , since 2001 , in the number and size of bribes given by young men and their families to avoid conscription and , relatedly , in those paid to get into universities .
( Fixing a court case , Indem found , has got a bit cheaper . )
Within the armed forces , the graft is astonishing .
Andrei , a conscript from Novosibirsk , recalls that his unit was forced to raise cash to buy a car for an officer , by begging and selling purloined military kit .
Russia 's defence minister was recently obliged to issue a special order designed to stop officers hiring troops out as day labourers , and using them to build dachas .
Indem 's most controversial finding was a surge in the volume of bribes paid by businesses , to a total amounting to more than double the federal budget .
An exaggeration perhaps ; but most businessmen confirm the deterioration .
The difference now , says the boss of one building firm , is that bureaucrats take the cash , but do n't then interpret the opaque regulations in the way they had promised — the most economically damaging kind of corruption , according to academic studies .
Forbidden means expensive
Another Moscow - region developer estimates that 10 % of his costs go in bribes : a project requires 50 licences , and every licence needs a bribe .
“ It 's like the last days of Pompeii , ” he says , adding that at least the uniformed extortionists have squeezed out the organised bandits .
Big business is less talkative , but no cleaner .
Nigeria was good training for Russia , says a western executive .
To put it in another way , Russia is a country where top state officials live luxuriously and make decisions which have no innocent explanation .
Faced with a problem that it cannot credibly deny , the usual Kremlin approach is to say that it is not a problem for Russia alone .
This has been President Vladimir Putin 's attitude to corruption ; it is , he says , an issue in all transitional countries .
But Russian corruption has some peculiar characteristics .
It is partly an age - old function of the country 's size and poverty : the tsar in Tolstoy 's “ Hadji Murad ” is convinced it is “ a characteristic of officials to steal ” .
Communism bequeathed little regard for private property or civic duty , and left big networks of patronage dating back to institutions such as the KGB .
Next came wholesale privatisation amid weak regulation , and lots of oil money .
An optimistic view is that these effects will wear off .
Indem did find that even as state officials get greedier , public aversion grows — for instance over the cost of “ free ” hospital care ( though some bribes may simply have become unaffordable ) .
But Russian corruption does n't just make life inconvenient , or hold back the economy : it kills people .
When two aircraft blew up after taking off from Moscow last year , investigations revealed many ways in which bombs could be put on planes for cash .
After the Beslan attack , reporters in Moscow proved it was possible to obtain official documents while using a photograph of Aslan Maskhadov , the Chechen leader who was later killed .
The Beslan hostage - takers are thought to have bribed their way across internal borders .
And how did over a hundred militants gather and arm themselves before launching the city - wide battle that struck Nalchik , not far from Beslan , last week ?
“ How can we withstand terrorism , ” asks Vladimir Lukin , the human - rights ombudsman , “ with such a level of corruption ? ”
It has also prolonged and aggravated the terrorists ' main grievance : the conflict in Chechnya .
Poor as the region is , it is lucrative : there are kidnappings , many of them , says Mr Lukin , corruption - related ; embezzlement of reconstruction money ; smuggling ; and even , it is said , arms sales by the army to insurgents .
Elsewhere in Russia , security services are said to control poaching and prostitution .
Across the north Caucasus , corrupt local elites have monopolised the economy .
The new president of Kabardino - Balkaria , of which Nalchik is the capital , this week conceded that unemployment and “ not being able to start up one 's own business without links to the authorities ” had pushed youngsters towards militant Islam .
The cost in lives is one reason why corruption in Russia is not , as some say , an efficient way to live with over - regulation .
Corruption , says Mikhail Grishankov , chair of a parliamentary anti-corruption committee , offers the same efficiency as the justice system in “ The Godfather ” .
Paying up encourages further extortion , ultimately raising costs all round .
Worse , the traffic policeman who takes your bribe may take one next from a drunk — or a terrorist .
In a country where money talks , it is easy to deliver a bomb , says Elena Panfilova , of TI 's Russian chapter .
Corruption , says Georgy Satarov of Indem , is like pain , a symptom of other problems .
In Russia , they include a neutered parliament , subservient ( and sometimes intimidated ) media and a suborned judiciary .
But experience elsewhere suggests that measures short of wholesale democratisation have some impact .
Rasma Karklins , of the University of Illinois at Chicago , says “ islands of integrity ” can be established in regions or institutions ; high - profile prosecutions can help .
Since corruption was a key motive behind the revolutions that have ousted three post - Soviet regimes in the last two years , the Kremlin should worry .
It has tried raising some official salaries ; corrupt bureaucrats , like the taxman arrested in Moscow this week for soliciting a $ 1 m bribe , are sometimes punished .
But in general what Ms Karklins calls a system of “ mutual blackmail ” seems to prevail .
Officials are promoted because of , not in spite of , their corruption , which makes them pliable .
“ A corrupt official is a more loyal official , ” says Ms Panfilova .
Punishment happens when spoils are n't shared , or an official steps on to somebody else 's turf .
Consider Mikhail Kasyanov , prime minister and head of the ( inert ) presidential anti-corruption council until his ouster last year .
After signalling his own presidential dreams , Mr Kasyanov faced damaging allegations — of corruption .
