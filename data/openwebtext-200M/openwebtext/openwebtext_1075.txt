Brazil 's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim once again pours cold water on his Israeli counterpart 's hopes of antagonizing Iran in the Americas .
As the Israeli foreign minister continued his 10 - day tour of South American states in Peru , comments by Amorim confirmed the Iranian ambassador 's previous predictions that Lieberman 's visit would not affect Iran - Brazil ties .
Iran is " an essential player " in Middle East peace talks , said Brazil 's FM , pointing out that one of the reasons that successive peace plans for the region have failed was that " the players have always been the same . "
" Involvement of countries that have influence in the region is absolutely essential , " said the top Brazilian diplomat during a conference organized by the United Nations in Rio.
Brazil , which is aiming for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council , has offered to play the role of a mediator that has " the confidence " of both parties in Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
As Lieberman began his South American tour on Wednesday , Tehran 's envoy to Brasilia , Mohsen Shaterzadeh , asserted that " a visit by such an individual from an illegitimate regime can never impact the relations of Iran and Brazil . "
" At the moment , the Israeli regime is known as a racist government that has the blood of Palestinians on its hands .
The regime has even lost its close friends , " Shaterzadeh commented .
During his first stop in South America , Lieberman took part in a news conference , where he asked Brasilia to take advantage of its growing ties with Iran to help bring to a halt the country 's nuclear activities .
" I believe that Brazil , more than other countries , could try to convince the Iranians to stop their nuclear program , " Lieberman said in Brazil .
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim , however , defended Tehran by pointing out that the country had every right to nuclear technology for " exclusively non-military " purposes .
The Brazilian official then took an indirect swipe at Israel -- the only Middle Eastern regime with ready - to - launch nuclear warheads .
" Brazil would like all countries to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ..[ We want ] a Middle East free of nuclear weapons , " said Amorim , in an apparent reference to Tel Aviv 's refusal to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Tel Aviv -- the only possessor of nuclear arsenal in the region - refuses to heed regional and international concerns over an entirely nuclear - free Middle East .
WASHINGTON  All Americans would have access to “ essential health care benefits , ” with no annual or lifetime limits , employers would have to contribute to the cost of coverage and the government would create a new public insurance program under sweeping legislation drafted by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and circulated Friday .
Under the legislation , the government would subsidize premiums for people with incomes up to 500 percent of the poverty level ( $ 110,000 for a family of four ) , and private insurers would have to pay out a specified percentage of their premium revenues in benefits .
The new government - run program would pay doctors and hospitals at Medicare rates , plus 10 percent .
Mr. Kennedy ’s bill would also establish a new insurance program to provide home - and community - based care for 10 million people with severe disabilities .
The bill gives no indication of how Mr. Kennedy would pay for his proposals , other than by requiring contributions by individuals and employers .
CHICAGO  Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois appointed a panel on Wednesday to investigate accusations that the University of Illinois admitted hundreds of applicants based largely on their political connections .
Mr. Quinn said the Admissions Review Commission would look into 800 applicants who , as first reported by The Chicago Tribune , won spots at the university ’s Urbana - Champaign campus after intervention from state lawmakers and university trustees .
The Tribune said these students , whose names appeared on an internal list , were admitted even though some did not meet the university ’s admission standards .
“ We want to make sure that the taxpayers , parents and students of Illinois know there is no kind of special process where individuals who have less qualifications are admitted because of their political influence or clout , ” Mr. Quinn , a Democrat , said .
The University of Illinois , which has three campuses , is considered the state ’s most prestigious public university .
The commission , which is to complete its work in 60 days , will be led by Abner Mikva , a retired federal judge and former state legislator and congressman , who had been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School .
Mr. Mikva said the panel should not be as concerned about meting out punishment as with ensuring that any patronage influence in the university ’s admission practices would not be tolerated .

President Barack Obama has told reporters he should not have described the arrest of a black Harvard professor as " stupid " .
Mr Obama has faced criticism for wading into the controversy during a televised news conference on Wednesday .
Professor Gates was apprehended at his own home after a witness saw him apparently trying to force his way in .
He was held for disorderly conduct after allegedly accusing the arresting officer , Sgt James Crowley , of racism .
I could have calibrated those words differently
President Barack Obama
Harvard row highlights US tensions
Send us your comments Making a surprise appearance at the daily White House press briefing , Mr Obama said he should have chosen his words more carefully at his Wednesday news conference .
" Because this has been ratcheting up and I obviously helped to contribute ratcheting it up , I wanted to make clear in my choice of words I think I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department or Sgt Crowley specifically , " Mr Obama said .
" I could have calibrated those words differently , " he added .
Mr Obama also revealed that he had spoken to Sgt Crowley on the telephone , and described him as an " outstanding police officer and a good man " .
He said he continued to believe that Professor Gates 's arrest was " an overreaction " , but that " Professor Gates probably overreacted as well " .
Obama critics
On Wednesday , Mr Obama had said : " The Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home . "
Professor Gates leads the African American research centre at Harvard
And he put the arrest in the context of " the long history in this country of African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately " .
Critics seized on his comments , saying the president should not be getting involved in individual cases , especially if he was not in full possession of the facts .
Officers were called to Prof Gates 's house after a woman reported seeing two black males - the professor and his driver - trying to force entry .
Prof Gates 's lawyer later said the professor had just returned from a trip overseas and , upon arriving at the property with a driver , found his front door jammed and had to force it open .
Although the exact facts of the incident are disputed , Prof Gates was asked to provide the officer with identification .
He was then asked to step outside his house and was arrested .
According to police , Prof Gates shouted at the officer and accused him of racial bias .

Hearings began Tuesday for the case in which Exxon - Mobile , the country ’s largest oil producer , has been accused of intentionally sabotaging South Texas oil wells by fraudulently plugging them up and then attempting to cover up the damage .
" Exxon committed irrefutable , intentional and flagrant violations of state rules regulating the oilfield , " Jerry Patterson , Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office , said .
" The Texas Railroad Commission should act to enforce its own rules . "
Patterson requested in July that the Texas Railroad Commission hold hearings about the matter .
If Exxon - Mobil loses the case , they could face fines exceeding $ 1 billion : $ 10,000 per well , per violation , for every day since 1992 .
The alleged sabotage took place over a dispute with the O’Connor family , with whom Exxon - Mobil negotiated a lease for their oil - rich acreage in Refugio County .
When the relationship soured , Exxon - Mobil terminated the lease and plugged the wells , filing all of the legally - required paperwork outlining their well - plugging procedures and signing sworn affidavits regarding their conditions .
However , it was soon discovered that those reports were fraudulent .
When a new company , Emerald Oil , went to re-open the wells as per new legislation , they discovered that the wells had been sabotaged rather than closed properly .
They were filled with junk , cut well casings , contaminated oil tank sludge and even explosives .
Exxon Mobil acknowledges that it plugged the wells in the 1990s after concluding that it " was no longer economically feasible " to produce the O’Connor oil and gas leases .
" The area in which the wells are located has a water table very close to the surface , " Exxon Mobil said in a statement to the Ft. Worth Star Telegram from corporate media adviser Margaret Ross .
" As a result , it was critical that Exxon protect the groundwater by plugging the wells solidly and thoroughly .
" If there is a belief that more production can be obtained from the land , one does not have to re-enter the same well but has the option to drill a new well , " the statement said .

If you live in California , Bakersfield is just a place where farming mega- corporations grow a lot of stuff .
If you 're remotely literate , you remember it as the ' Promised Land ' the " Okies " left home for in The Grapes of Wrath .
If you like pop culture , it is part of the Route 66 highway ( 1 ) , which became famous in a song first sung by Nat King Cole ( 2 ) .
But Bakersfield 's rich central farmland was once the Temblor Sea , thanks to global warming , and the fossil remains tell a science tale .
In the famed Sharktooth Hill Bone Bed near Bakersfield , Calif. , shark teeth as big as a hand and weighing a pound each , intermixed with copious bones from extinct seals and whales , tell of a 15 - million - year - old marine killing ground .
New research by a team of paleontologists from the University of California , Berkeley , the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , and the University of Utah paints a less catastrophic picture .
Instead of a sudden die - off , the researchers say that the bone bed is a 700,000 - year record of normal life and death , kept free of sediment by unusual climatic conditions between 15 million and 16 million years ago .
The team 's interpretation of the fossils and the geology to establish the origins of the bone bed , the richest and most extensive marine deposit of bones in the world , are presented in Geology .
The mix of shark bones and teeth , turtle shells three times the size of today 's leatherbacks , and ancient whale , seal , dolphin and fish skeletons , comprise a unique six - to - 20 - inch - thick layer of fossil bones , 10 miles of it exposed , that covers nearly 50 square miles just outside and northeast of Bakersfield .
Teeth such as this from the extinct 40 - foot - long shark Carcharocles megalodon are common in the Sharktooth Hill Bone Bed near Bakersfield , Calif. , because , like modern sharks , these extinct sharks also shed teeth throughout their lives .
Credit : Nick Pyenson / University of British ColumbiaSince the bed 's discovery in the 1850s , paleontologists have battled over an obvious question :
How did the bones get there ?
Was this a killing ground for megalodon , a 40 - foot version of today 's great white shark ?
Was it a long - term breeding area for seals and other marine mammals , like Mexico 's Scammon 's lagoon is for the California gray whale ?
Did a widespread catastrophe , like a red tide or volcanic eruption , lead to a massive die - off ?
The new and extensive study of the fossils and the geology of Sharktooth Hill tells a less dramatic story , but an important one , for understanding the origin of rich fossil accumulations , said Nicholas Pyenson , a former UC Berkeley graduate student who is now a post - doctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia .
"
If you look at the geology of this fossil bed , it 's not intuitive how it formed , " Pyenson said .
" We really put together all lines of evidence , with the fossil evidence being a big part of it , to obtain a snapshot of that period of time .
" Pyenson and his colleagues , totaling five UC Berkeley Ph.D.s and UC Berkeley integrative biology professor Jere Lipps , hope that the study will draw renewed attention to the bone bed , which Lipps said needs protection even though a small portion of it was added to the National Natural Landmark registry in 1976 .
" This deposit , if properly developed , would look just like Dinosaur National Monument , " said Lipps , referring to a popular park in Colorado and Utah .
" ( Sharktooth Hill ) is actually much more extensive , and the top of the bone bed has complete , articulated skeletons of seals and other marine mammals .
" One 12 - foot - long fossil seal skeleton that Lipps helped excavate during the 50 years he has visited the bone bed was mounted and displayed for decades at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County ( NHM ) , which houses thousands of fossils excavated from the Sharktooth Hill deposits during expeditions in the 1960s and 1980s .
Other collections are in the California Academy of Sciences , San Diego Natural History Museum , Buena Vista Museum of Natural History in Bakersfield , and UC Berkeley 's Museum of Paleontology ( UCMP ) , where students over the years have made studies of the bone bed 's extinct sea turtles , sharks , marine mammals and seabirds .
Lipps is a faculty curator in the UCMP .
This is a reconstructed skeleton of the extinct seal Allodesmus from the Sharktooth Hill Bone Bed , now on display at the San Diego Natural History Museum .
Credit : Nick Pyenson / University of British ColumbiaThe paper 's other coauthors - all of whom obtained their Ph.D.s from UC Berkeley are Randall B. Irmis , now an assistant professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah , and Lawrence G. Barnes , Edward D. Mitchell Jr. and Samuel A. McLeod of NHM's Department of Vertebrate Paleontology .
When the bone bed formed between 15,900,000 and 15,200,000 years ago , the climate was warming , sea level was at a peak , California 's Central Valley was an inland sea dubbed the Temblor Sea and the emerging Sierra Nevada was shoreline .
By closely studying the geology of the Sharktooth Hill area , the paleontologists determined that it was part of an underwater shelf in a large embayment , directly opposite a wide opening to the sea .
Pyenson and Irmis examined some 3,000 fossilized bone and teeth specimens in the collections of many museums , including the NHM and UCMP , and they and Lipps also cut out a meter - square section of the bone bed , complete with the rock layers above and below , and transported it to UC Berkeley for study .
Below the bone bed , they found several feet of mudstone interlaced with shrimp burrows , typical of ocean floor sediment several hundred to several thousand feet below the surface .
The bone bed itself averaged 200 bones per square meter , most of them larger bones , with almost no sediment .
Most were disarticulated , as if the animal carcasses had decayed and their bones had been scattered by currents .
" The bones look a bit rotten , " Lipps said , " as if they lay on the seafloor for a long time and were abraded by water with sand in it . "
Many bones had manganese nodules and growths , which form on bones that sit for long periods in sea water before being covered by sediment .
Toward the top of the bone bed , some articulated skeletons of seals and whales were found , while in the layer above the bone bed , most skeletons were articulated and encased in sediment .
The team 's conclusion is that the climatic conditions were such that currents carried sediment around the bone beds for 100,000 to 700,000 years , during which time bones remained exposed on the ocean floor and accumulated in a big and shifting pile .
Given the rarity of bones marked by shark bites , plus the occurrence of terrestrial animals such as tapirs and horses that must have washed out to sea , predation by sharks like Carcharocles megalodon seems unlikely to have been the major source of the bone bed , the authors wrote .
Because of few young or juvenile specimens , the team also discounted the hypothesis that this was a breeding ground for early seals such as Allodesmus .
The absence of volcanic ash makes a volcanic catastrophe unlikely , while the presence of land mammal fossils makes red tide an unlikely cause .
" These animals were dying over the whole area , but no sediment deposition was going on , possibly related to rising sea levels that snuffed out silt and sand deposition or restricted it to the very near - shore environment , " Pyenson said .
" Once sea level started going down , then more sediment began to erode from near shore .
" Pyenson noted that , while bone beds around the world occur in diverse land and marine environments , the team 's analysis of the Sharktooth Hill Bone Bed could have implications for other fossil - rich marine deposits .
The work was funded by UCMP and UC Berkeley 's Department of Integrative Biology , as well as by grants from the Geological Society of America and the American Museum of Natural History , and graduate fellowships from the National Science Foundation .
NOTES : (1 ) U. S. Highway " Route " 66 was commissioned in 1926 , the year U. S. numbered highways came into existence .
It consisted of two - lane concrete or asphalt paved roads extending from Chicago to Santa Monica , running through the states of Illinois , Missouri , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and California .
Route 66 is considered the " Mother Road " of American highways .
The old " Main Street of America " was deactivated in 1984 and the U. S. 66 highway shields taken down , after being replaced by the modern interstate highway system .
HISTORIC ROUTE 66 ( 2 ) Cole was first , but certainly not last .
It has also been covered by Acoustix , Asleep at the Wheel , Chuck Berry , The Cheetah Girls , Natalie Cole , Perry Como ( the only version with the complete lyrics , according to its Wikipedia entry - so caveat emptor ) , The Cramps , Lamont Cranston , Bing Crosby & The Andrews Sisters , Depeche Mode , Dr. Feelgood , Bob Dylan , The Wes Paul Band , Guitar Wolf , The Outlaws , Hot Zex , Jason & the Scorchers , The Jolt , Jerry Lee Lewis , The Manhattan Transfer , John Mayer , Brad Paisley , Pappo , Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , John Pizzarelli , The Replacements , Rockfour , The Rolling Stones , Scatman John , Brian Setzer Orchestra , Skrewdriver , Téléphone , Them featuring Van Morrison , Mel Tormé , Buckwheat Zydeco , The Count Bishops , Hans Teeuwen

DNS redirection ( or DNS hijacking , depending on who you ask ) is now officially " Comcastic ! " after the cable company yesterday began a nationwide deployment of its " Domain Helper " service .
The new product , which has been tested in trial markets since July 9 , redirects nonexistent URLs like www.clinteckergoatbonedbyhisnewbicycle.com to a search page slathered in advertising instead of returning the proper DNS error to the browser .
Readers began reporting the change to us yesterday .
Comcast says that the new service is " here to help you , " but critics have made their own feelings clear — " this is a piece of CRAP , " wrote one .
While purists object to Comcast messing with " proper " DNS behaviors , others do n't appreciate what feels like nothing more than an attempt to make money off users misspelling domains .
Domain Helper currently works in cases where a URL includes a properly - spelled top - level domain ( such as " .com " ) at the end and where the site name is not a registered domain name .
When activated , Domain Helper redirects users to a comcast.com page that is powered by Yahoo Bing search .
The layout of the results , however , suggests that the goals are less about helping you find your intended destination and more about presenting you with ads .
To begin , the redirect page displays " sponsored results " ( ads ) above its suggestions for your intended destination .
To the right , Comcast invites users to " Get More Out of Your Subscription " and to " Upgrade Your Services . "
To the left , you get " narrow your search " options which favor advertising categories .
To its credit , Comcast includes an opt - out , but it 's not particularly friendly .
Comcast 's opt - out page requires subscribers to enter both an e-mail address and the MAC address from their cable modem .
Providing a MAC address to opt - out is not only cumbersome , but to many Joe Sixpack users , it 's arcane , and probably not worth the effort .
It 's less of an opt - out and more of a hassle - out , if you catch our drift .
Comcast does offer a page of explanation , noting that the MAC number is printed on the modem and may begin with any of the following : CABLE , CABLE RF MAC , CM , CM MAC , CMAC , HFC MAC , RF , or RF MAC — which is not at all confusing .
The example graphic provided shows a label with two lengthy numbers on it , one beginning with " RF MAC " and the other with " RG MAC . "
The numbers differ by a single character , but enter the wrong one and you 're out of luck , even though both are " MAC " numbers .
Here 's how one Comcast user described the opt - out process in a comment made on Comcast Voice , the Official Comcast Blog :
While I realize customers can opt - out of this program , the opt - out procedures are less than simple .
To recap my opt - out process , I had to : ( a ) click a link in an email , ( b ) enter my Comcast email address , ( c ) go down into the back part of my basement , ( d ) take my cable modem off the wall , ( e ) jot down the MAC addresses on the back of the modem , ( f ) come back to my computer and view a help screen on Comcast 's site to try to identify the appropriate MAC address , ( g ) enter the MAC address , ( h ) submit the form , ( i ) wait for a confirmation email from Comcast , and ( j ) follow a link in the email to confirm my opt - out .
In reality , I 'm still stuck at h , as I have not yet received my confirmation email .
Thank you , thank you , Comcast , for making it so simple for me to opt - out of a service I never opted - in for in the first place .
Instead of opting out , customers can also use another DNS provider , though anyone confused by trying to input a modem MAC number is unlikely to find configuring their router 's DNS much easier .
When Comcast publicized the service during testing back in July , its announcement attracted 114 unremittingly negative comments .
One of the feistier ones asked , " Has the entire staff over there been possessed by demons ?
... I am aghast , I can't tell you the last time I witnessed such unmitigated arrogance on the part of a corporate entity .
Are you friggin serious ?
You all have utterly taken leave of your senses . "
Making DNS hijacking an IETF standard
That 's not the way Comcast sees it , of course .
The company has submitted a protocol for DNS redirection to the Internet Engineering Task Force , hoping to create a set of best practices for such services .
The engineers who wrote the document clearly do n't want to degrade the customer experience , and they propose that redirects not override or block user DNS settings , that they not slow down DNS queries , that they not redirect valid DNS responses , and that the opt - out experience be effective ( i.e. , not use cookies or IP addresses to identify opted - out machines ) .
But " best practices for opt - out DNS redirection " is a bit like " best practices for jabbing yourself in the ribs with a sharp stick . "
Technically savvy users do n't want the service , which overrides the normal NXDOMAIN ( non-existent domain ) response from DNS servers .
By changing the expected functionality of the DNS system , problems can arise — as the Comcast engineers understand .
" It is important to note that this technology can directly impact non-Web clients such as instant messaging , VPNs , FTP , email filters , [ and ] related DNS queries .
Thus , special exclusions may need to be made in order to prevent unintentional side effects , " they note .
Despite the negative response that the issue always draws from the techheads , DNS redirection is like an addiction that the industry can't shake .
Because it 's a source of " free revenue " and does n't draw nearly the same sorts of privacy complaints as do URL - sniffers like NebuAd and Phorm , Internet companies continue to try redirection .
Verisign , one of the major domain registrars , tried a similar service called SiteFinder back in 2004 , but DNS overseer ICANN shut down the experiment .
In 2006 , ISP Earthlink announced a redirect service of its own .
In 2007 , Verizon thought about getting into the game with " Advanced Web Search " ( which also broke applications that relied on NXDOMAIN messages ) .
This year , Bell Canada has also rolled out a DNS redirection service to Canadians — who also get the same service from Rogers Cable .
None of these services have been opt-in .
As mentioned above , Comcast 's implementation currently kicks in only when the top - level domain is valid , but the company says that a future update will also do redirects when the top - level domain is misspelled or missing .
StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty will not be released by the end of 2009 as previously stated , Activision Blizzard said Wednesday .
Confirming suspicions of fans and analysts that a delay was inevitable , the press e-mail from Blizzard PR said the reason is due to prepping the new version of their proprietary online gaming service Battle .
net for the game 's launch :
Over the past couple of weeks , it has become clear that it will take longer than expected to prepare the new Battle .
net for the launch of the game .
The upgraded Battle . net is an integral part of the StarCraft II experience and will be an essential part of all of our games moving forward .
This extra development time will be critical to help us realize our vision for the service .
The press release went on to say that Blizzard " will always take as much time as needed " to meet the quality expectations of players and themselves as developers .
The company promises to continue to refine the real - time strategy game and says it expects it to be released in the first half of 2010 .
StarCraft II is the latest game to be delayed out of the 2009 holiday season .

Too bad for Barack Obama and the Democrats , but George W. Bush is the shrinking man of American politics , growing ever smaller on the far horizon .
Merely invoking his name will soon no longer frighten women and horses .
The not - so - new president has treated his predecessor as his training wheels , invoking his presence every time ( which is often ) the ground trembles , a dog barks , the wind blows , the rain falls and he threatens to topple over .
We were promised nirvana , or at least a lollipop , if only we could banish George W. and the inept and evil Republicans .
Banish we did , and the messiah from the South Side of Chicago has been practicing miracle - working for five months .
Alas , there ’s no sign of clearing skies .
Five months is not very long , of course , and it ’s unreasonable to expect nirvana so soon , but that ’s the nature of the impatient American public .
Reason , like love , has nothing to do with it .
With every nightfall , the news gets worse , or at least not any better , and growing numbers of Americans are beginning to doubt that he has all the answers he so confidently insisted he did .
The public - opinion polls clearly show deteriorating public confidence in the confidence man .
Worse than not having the answers is the growing suspicion that Mr. Obama and his wise men even understand the question .
The unemployment numbers , the closely watched benchmark by which presidents are judged , stood at 7.2 percent when Mr. Obama took his oath , and Thursday , it inched up to 9.5 percent .
The average workweek subsided in June to 33 hours , lowest since the feds began keeping such records in 1964 .
Cutting hours and freezing pay has spread even to companies awash in profits , with managers , never wanting to waste a crisis and looking to an uncertain future , are taking advantage now , just in case .
“ We are in some very hard and severe economic times , ” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis told an interviewer in the wake of the new bad news .
“ The president and I are both not happy .
I do think the public needs to be patient .
We know they are hurting . ”
The president is saying the things every president says when recession hits and panic and depression threaten .
Some of the president ’s friends insist they see “ tiny green shoots ” on the landscape , promising prosperity soon .
The president himself concedes the economy is in a hole and blames the man who preceded him .
His predecessor ’s policies “ have left us in a very deep hole , ” he says , “ and digging our way out of it will take time , patience and some tough choices . ”
The secretary of State , Hillary Rodham Clinton , likes the shovel - ready metaphor , too .
“ You know , ” she told a television interviewer the other day , “ we are in just so many deep holes that everybody had better grab a shovel and start digging out . ”
What “ somebody ” should do is hide those shovels from “ everybody . ”
If you ’re in a hole , as any ditch digger could tell you , the only thing you can do with a shovel is dig yourself a little deeper into the hole .
Not a good idea .
A speechifyer such as Barack Obama is expected to be more careful with his metaphors ( Hillary gets a pass ) , and the president ’s growing problem is that growing numbers of voters who imagined he was “ the one ” now think he ’s in that hole and over his head .
The Democrats diverted attention from shortcomings big and small for a decade of depression by hauling poor old Herbert Hoover out for frequent floggings , and Mr. Obama obviously thinks he can similarly use George W. Bush .
But that was then and this is now ; no president now can monopolize the microphone as FDR did , with his mastery of press and radio and equipped with a terrified and compliant Congress .
Barack Obama once imagined he could make it so by saying it ’s so , but that only works for a little while .
He ’s learning what presidents before him learned , that the job of president is harder than it looks .
As the effects of the stimulus , such as they are , begin a slow fade , the unemployment number , already the highest in 26 years , is projected to keep rising .
Shrinking payrolls naturally restrain growth .
A jobless recovery driven by federal spending may improve certain numbers , but “ it ’s the economy , Stupid . ”
Stupid , standing in the rain out there on the street will say , “ Where are the jobs ? ”
Stupid is not actually as stupid as presidents sometimes hope he is .
He ’s not so stupid that he ca n’t see who that is in the White House .

The idea behind the IT security concept known as the honeypot is all about luring hackers into a server or network so they can be tracked .
The Web Application Security Consortium ( WASC ) has its own particular brand of honey to attract would - be attackers -- a blend of open source and open proxies .
The WASC is now entering Phase Three of its Distributed Open Proxy Honeypot Project , including more participants , sensors and analytical reporting as the project moves into wide deployment .
The aim remains the same , however : providing security researchers and law enforcement with a new resource in the battle against Web attacks .
" Ultimately what we 're trying to identify is Web - based attacks -- how are they are actually happening -- because it 's very hard to get real details , " WASC Honeypot Project Leader Ryan Barnett told InternetNews.com .
Barnett , who also serves as director of application security research for Breach Security , described the first two phases of the Open Proxy Honeypot Project as learning phases .
In Phase Three , the project will now have as many as 60 sensors deployed , up from the current 14 .
Barnett also noted that there will be more people and technology involved on the analysis side to better identify and report about attack traffic .
That 's a critical upgrade , considering the important work the project 's supporters aim to accomplish -- and the unique way they 're going about it .
In the typical , Web - based honeypot scenario , the honeypot masquerades as a target for attack .
Barnett said that as a result , most honeypots typically attract the attention of automated programs that scan IP ranges and happen to hit the honeypot 's address .
The Open Proxy Honeypot Project is somewhat different .
" It 's just an open proxy server that is open , and people can send traffic through it , " Barnett said .
An open proxy is a relay on a Web server that enables a third party to route any traffic they wish through it .
Attackers will often use open proxies in a bid to mask their own identities .
So by having an open proxy as a honeypot , the WASC effort is providing attackers with a host for relaying their attacks -- or so the attackers will be led to believe .
" The idea is we get a bird 's eye view of what 's happening because we know the bad guys want to hide where they are coming from , " Barnett said .
" We 're not the target of the attack -- we 're just a conduit . "
Open source is at the heart of the setup .
The Open Proxy Honeypot uses the open source mod_security Web application firewall ( WAF ) to monitor , identify and report the attack traffic .
Apache Web servers often use the mod_security WAF to defend against malicious Web traffic by monitoring traffic and applying rules to mitigate application risks .
Barnett 's company , Breach Security , is one of the principal sponsors of the mod_security project and Breach also offers a commercial version as well .
" I think the idea of using open source mod_security is attractive because it's not just tied to a commercial product that people can't use , " Barnett said .
" The project participants get a VMware image that has Ubuntu Linux , the Apache Web server and mod_security .
The only requirement is that the participants have something that can run the virtual image . "
How the Open Proxy Honeypot Project uses mod_security is also quite different than its typical purpose -- stopping attack traffic .
Barnett noted that normally , mod_security examines predominantly legitimate traffic in which attacks represent a needle in the haystack .
" With the honeypot , it 's revered , " Barnett said .
" Where instead of looking for the needle in the haystack , everything is needles and you 're just trying to classify it all correctly . "

Whereas :
We spend over $ 2.3 trillion , or $ 7,500 per capita , for healthcare in the US , yet 42 percent of people under 65 have inadequate or no insurance coverage ;
Whereas :
The healthcare coverage in the United States is ranked # 37 in the world by the World Health Organization and yet we spend almost twice as much as any other country , enough to cover everybody with excellent comprehensive healthcare ;
Whereas : A bill has been proposed in Congress , HR - 676 , non-profit Medicare for All , that outlines a national healthcare program that will provide guaranteed , comprehensive , and affordable quality healthcare and prescription drugs to everyone in the country ;
Whereas :
Over 59 percent of physicians now support a national , single - payer health insurance system for everyone ;
Whereas : HR 676 has been endorsed by 463 union organizations in 49 states including 116 Central Labor Councils and Area Labor Federations and 39 state AFL - CIO%u2019s ;
Whereas :
Under this proposed plan , we can pay for a comprehensive national health care program with the same money we are now spending by removing insurance companies % u2014 and cover every single person in the United States ;
And Whereas :
The bill provides money for retraining and giving priority to those whose jobs as administrators in the insurance industry would be lost as a result of this shift ;
Be it Resolved That :
We call on our members of Congress to pass HR 676 , non-profit Medicare for All , so our people and our nation can have the excellent healthcare system we deserve .
Healthcare is a human right , and we call on our members of Congress to recognize that right .
Have your waitresses been getting better looking lately ?
That might be a sign that the economy will still be troubled for some time .
Hugo Lindgren of New York Magazine explains how the Hot Waitress Index works
The hotter the waitresses , the weaker the economy .
In flush times , there is a robust market for hotness .
Selling everything from condos to premium vodka is enhanced by proximity to pretty young people ( of both sexes ) who get paid for providing this service .
That leaves more - punishing work , like waiting tables , to those with less striking genetic gifts .
But not anymore .
A waitress at one Lower East Side club described to me what happened there : “ They slowly let the boys go , then the less attractive girls , and then these hot girls appeared out of nowhere .
All in the hope of bringing in more business .
The managers even admitted it .
These hot girls that once thrived on the generosity of their friends in the scene for hookups — hosting events , marketing brands , modeling — are now hunting for work . ”
A Soho restaurateur I know recently received applications from “ a couple of classic Eastern European fembots .
Once upon a time , these ladies must ’ve made $ 1,500 a night lap dancing .
At my place , they ’re not going to make that in a week . ”
This is more than just a real time indicator of our financial health , according to Lindgren .
It 's a leading indicator , predicting future performance of our economy .
You 'll recall that lots of people think unemployment may not be a lagging indicator this time around .
But hotness is even more likely than employment to be an indicator because the hotness market is more flexible than the normal employment market .
" As a commodity that ’s fairly cheap , historically effective as a marketing tool , and available on a freelance basis , hotness will likely be back in demand long before your average Michigan autoworker is .
Or the rest of us , for that matter , " Lindgren writes .
So take a look around this week .
Are your waitresses getting hotter ?

Since the energy crises of the 1970s , the United States has known it has an energy problem .
Yet today , the energy requirements in building codes remain weak across half the country , and at least seven states have virtually no rules .
That means that in many places , particularly the nation ’s heartland , almost every new home , store and factory that goes up locks the country into unnecessary energy use for years to come .
The problem is not just construction defects like the one Mr. Umphress caught , though those are plentiful .
In many places , builders are still using too little insulation .
Citing cost , they have not adopted the most energy - saving water heaters , roofing materials or window panes .
The Energy Department reports that buildings and the appliances inside them account for almost 40 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted in the country .
Stricter codes have been fought bitterly by politically powerful builders ’ lobbies , which contend that they can add $ 2,000 or more to the cost of a house .
But in a few places , including cities like Austin and entire states like California , tough new rules have been adopted .
The efforts of these localities show that no new technology needs to be invented to make major gains in saving energy .
Products already available permit the construction of homes at least 30 percent more efficient than the national average .
With enough political will , a new law can be put in place anywhere with the stroke of a pen , and made even more potent if it is coupled with tough oversight , as in Austin .

Despite his past denials , memos and transcripts released by Congress show that former White House political adviser ( and current Fox analyst ) Karl Rove was deeply involved in the firing of the U.S. attorney in New Mexico David Iglesias .
The material also shows that the White House planned the firings of Iglesias and the other prosecutors for months .
The material on its face appears to contradict Rove ’s public statements that he was not substantially involved and that politics played little role in the firings .
That could raise serious legal questions if he made the same statements to congressional investigators .
It is a crime to give misleading or false statements to investigators .
Rove may argue that this is just opinion and that it is not a crime to characterize the evidence .
He is certainly not subject to legal consequences for misleading or false statements to the press or public .
The more 5,400 pages of White House and Republican National Committee e-mails shows Rove as a critical player in pushing for the terminations .
As the chief political adviser to Bush with no legal training , it is hard to disguise the emails as anything other than political manipulation of the Justice Department .
Bush ’s politicalization of the Justice Department has long been condemned by liberals and conservatives alike .
The evidence includes such e-mails as the one in 2005 where Rove aide Scott Jennings told another Rove aide , saying , “ I would really like to move forward with getting rid of NM US ATTY . ”
Chairman John Conyers was blunt : “ After all the delay and despite all the obfuscation , lies , and spin , this basic truth can no longer be denied : Karl Rove and his cohorts at the Bush White House were the driving force behind several of these firings , which were done for improper reasons . ”
The question is whether Conyers now views this as a criminal matter or just another example of Rovian reconstruction of the truth .
It seems like the Democrats are treating it as the latter and leaving it up to the public to judge his credibility and honesty .
That is what Rove asked for when he called for citizens to review the documents and reach their own conclusions .
The document confirm what has long been argued : Rove and his minions pushed for the removal of these prosecutors to force the Justice Department to bend to political demands .

Beginning in 1848 , a wave of revolutions rippled across continental Europe .
Spurred in part by long - time industrialization and recent economic crises , middle and lower classes in France , Italy , Germany , and other countries struggled for liberal political reforms , including a free press , voting rights , and democratic parliaments to replace dynastic regimes still claiming to be ordained by God .
( Ultimately this " Springtime of the Peoples " largely failed but without first making it clear that the days were numbered for absolute monarchies . )
Germany at the time was a loose confederation of autonomous states , and the revolutionary demands included unification of Germany into a constitutional monarchy governed by a democratically elected assembly .
Protests , demonstrations , and uprisings continued for over a year , and one of the last took place in May 1849 in Dresden , part of the kingdom of Saxony .
Troops were called in to suppress the demonstrations , and the battle got violent .
On the front lines in the Dresden Uprising was 35 - year old composer Richard Wagner — attempting to juggle revolutionary convictions with an official position as Kapellmeister ( music director and conductor ) for the Royal Saxon Court .
The exact nature of Wagner 's actual participation in the Dresden Uprising is still hazy , but it is believed he made hand grenades .
When the uprising was suppressed after just seven days , Wagner fled to Zurich .
He would be exiled from Germany for eleven years .
By the time of the Dresden Uprising , Richard Wagner had already composed six operas .
The first three — Die Feen ( 1833 ) , an adaptation of Shakespeare 's Measure for Measure called Das Liebesverbot ( 1835 ) or The Ban on Love , and Rienzi ( 1840 ) — are rarely performed today .
Much more popular are the three operas from Wagner 's so - called middle period : Der Fliegende Holländer or The Flying Dutchman ( 1841 ) , Tannhäuser ( 1845 ) , and Lohengrin ( 1848 ) .
But Wagner was really just getting started .
The composer 's legacy would be not as a political revolutionary , but as an artistic and musical revolutionary — entirely reconceiving the nature and structure of opera , stretching traditional harmony to a crisis point , and writing some of the most glorious music ever heard .
Wagner 's achievements continue to reverberate not only in music , but in our culture and particularly in the use of myth to construct compelling drama .
For example , J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and George Lucas 's Star Wars are inconceivable without the influence of Wagner .
Wagner 's biggest creation — the 15 - hour tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung ( first performed in its entirety in 1876 ) — began rather inauspiciously soon after Wagner 's exile .
Perhaps inspired by a previous reading of Jacob Grimm 's German Mythology and based mostly on Norse legends , Wagner began writing the libretto for a proposed opera called Siegfried 's Death .
He eventually realized that events in this opera required more background , so he decided to write a libretto for a preliminary opera , Young Siegfried .
Still not happy that earlier events had been dealt with properly , he then conceived two additional operas , Das Rheingold and Die Walküre .
( Throughout this blog entry I 'll use the original German titles when the translation is obvious — Das Rheingold is The Rhine Gold and Die Walküre is The Valkyrie . )
By the end of 1852 , Wagner had completed a complete libretto for The Ring whose four operas eventually became Das Rheingold , Die Walküre , Siegfried , and Götterdämmerung — or The Twlight of the Gods .
The saga begins in an age when gods rule the world through authority , force , and tenuous treaties .
Following an act of desecration of nature by one of the Nibelung ( a race of dwarf smithies ) , a ring is forged that gives its possessor total power .
In attempting to gain control of this ring , Wotan ( the head of the gods ) puts into motion a series of events that [ spoiler alert ! ] leads to his own downfall .
Wotan creates humans who have free will , and who are capable of love .
It is this love that proves to be greater than the authoritarian dictates of the gods .
In the final scene of Götterdämmerung , Valhalla ( the castle of the gods ) goes up in flames , leaving the People — with all their flaws and foibles — now running the show .
The Modern Age has begun .
If all this sounds like a mythical setting of Wagner 's left - wing politics , that 's a perfectly legitimate interpretation .
But Wagner had also by this time come under the influence of Ludwig Feuerbach , whose 1841 book The Essence of Christianity caused a sensation .
( The book was translated into English in 1854 by Marian Evans , who published her first novel in 1859 under the pseudonym George Eliot . )
German theological and Biblical scholarship had created deep doubts concerning the veracity of the Gospels and , consequently , left Christianity in tatters .
Feuerbach set out to discover what could be salvaged .
Although the actual personages and narratives of religion may not be true , religion nonetheless reveals profound truths about we humans , because it is we who created the religion to begin with .
It is through the creation of God that we are able to express our ideals about virtue and beauty .
In The Ring , the gods themselves are loveless and cruel , but the people find redemption in the love that overthrows these gods .
By 1853 , Wagner had finished all the texts for The Ring and was now ready to compose the music .
Although he had written the libretti in reverse order , he began composition with the first opera , Das Rheingold .
When Wagner began the composition of The Ring , operas were mostly popular entertainments with often cheesy stories and music divided into bite - size set pieces — recitative , aria , duet , dance , chorus — punctuated with pauses for audience applause .
Wagner instead wanted to create serious music dramas , where everything — music , libretto ( which Wagner preferred to call the " poem " ) , scenary , costumes , lighting — became subservient to the drama depicted on stage .
Of course , the idea of music being merely a subservient part of opera is absurd , and it only makes sense in Wagner 's case because his music is so powerful and effective .
Rather than dividing an opera 's story into song - like fragments , Wagner instead wrote long stretches of music with continuous melodic development and almost no repetition .
The only time for applause in a Wagner opera is after the conclusion of an act , which is usually more than an hour ( and sometimes more than two hours ) after it began .
The acts of Wagner 's later operas are still some of the longer continuous pieces of music in Western music .
To hold the 15 hours of music in The Ring together , Wagner developed a system of motifs — phrase - like elements of music that symbolize various people , objects , and concepts , and which continually evolve , combine , and metamorphose over the course of the four operas .
But at the same time Wagner was revolutionizing opera composition in The Ring , he was also creating a stagework that is impossible to stage .
The first opera begins at the bottom of the Rhine where Rhine - maidens swim around guarding their gold .
Gods , giants , and dwarfs walk the stage , and an on - stage thunderstorm creates a rainbow that the characters use as a bridge .
The Valkyries of the second opera are women who ride flying horses , Wotan 's wife appears in a chariot drawn by two rams , and Brunnhilde is put to sleep at the top of a mountain surrounded by fire .
In the third opera , Siegfried must forge a sword on stage and then use it to battle a dragon , and in the final opera the realm of the gods succumbs in a massive conflagration .
By 1857 , Wagner had finished the music for the first two operas of The Ring , but neither opera had yet been staged , and it was not certain they ever would .
After finishing about 2/3rds of the third Ring opera , Siegfried , he suspended work on the entire project .
Wagner knew he had to write something more " practical , " an opera that could be performed in an " ordinary theater " ( Zuckerman , pg. 12 ) with far fewer characters than The Ring , easy sets , and no special effects .
After getting the idea to compose an opera based on the ancient story of Tristan and Isolde , he could n't get it out of his head .
Wagner wrote the text and the music for Tristan und Isolde in just over two years ( which for Wagner constitutes a state of " white heat " ) and he completed the opera in August 1859 — 150 years ago this month .
Just prior to beginning Tristan and Isolde , Wagner had started reading the works of Arthur Schopenhauer , who quickly became Wagner 's most significant philosophical influence .
Schopenhauer 's ideas reveal themselves throughout the opera .
To Schopenhauer , man was in a perpetual state of unhappiness because of the difference between the phenomenal world that could be perceived , and the noumenal reality that can not be perceived .
All cravings and desires are directed towards the phenomenal world but they can never be fulfilled .
Man can only achieve some kind of balance and peace through a negation of the will , and a letting - go of desire .
Of course , to speak of a " negation of the will " with respect to Wagner seems ridiculous .
This is a man who had the biggest ego in all Europe , who trapped friends and acquaintainces in long readings of his dramas , and who believed that his every thought — even vile anti-Semitic rants — was worthy of publication .
( One thing Wagner definitely proved was that it 's not necessary to be a nice person to write great music . )
How Wagner actually put Schopenhauer to practice in his personal life remains a mystery , but he certainly explored the implications in his work .
When it became evident to both Schopenhauer and Wagner that the philosophy had a strong relationship to Buddhism , Wagner even planned writing an opera on Buddhist themes with reincarnated characters .
Although Schopenhauer 's philosophy provides many of the ideas of Tristan und Isolde , the narrative elements came largely from the retelling of the legend in the early 13th century by Gottfried von Strassburg , who Wagner read in a modern German translation .
Wagner stripped away extraneous details from the story ( eliminating a second Isolde character , for example ) , and began his opera near the end of the tale .
Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde balances several conflicting concepts :
The story is straight - forward without hidden codes or symbols , yet it lends itself to perpetual discussion and opinions .
The opera is brainy but penetrating on a raw emotional level ; musically daring in its use of chromaticism , yet ultimately reaffirming of traditional harmony .
The Prelude of the opera begins with three notes on the cellos and then a chord that announces to the world that a new era of harmony is dawning .
The chord defies conventional harmonic analysis , and it has come to be known simply as the Tristan Chord .
The chord unwinds , and then recombines , and motifs develop that we will hear throughout the opera , but in this Prelude — and much of the remainder of the opera — harmonic resolution will be elusive .
We are instead set adrift in a turbulent uncertain dream - world .
Act I takes place on a ship , and Isolde is furious .
She is royalty — a princess of Ireland — yet she is being abducted against her will and taken to Cornwall to marry King Marke .
The man carrying out this insolent and humiliating plot is King Marke 's nephew , the knight named Tristan .
This is not the first time Tristan and Isolde have crossed paths .
They have a history , which Isolde now reveals to her maid , Brangäne .
It was Tristan who killed her fiancé Morold in Cornwall and then sent his head back to Ireland , and it was also Tristan who , wounded in the battle , came to Isolde in disguise to take advantage of her healing arts .
But Isolde was not fooled :
By matching up the nick in Tristan 's sword with the fragment in Morold 's skull , she knew exactly who this man was , and she prepared to kill him as he lay wounded .
But as he lay there
He looked up
Not at the sword ,
Not at my hand ,
He gazed in my eyes .
And his anguish
Wounded me so ;
The sword then fell before me .
( verse translation by Andrew Porter )
And now this Tristan is paying back Isolde 's healing love by carrying her back to Cornwall to be King Marke 's bride .
She demands atonement from him by drinking with her , and she prepares poison for them both .
They drink , and believing themselves to be on the verge of death , uncontrollably confess their love for each other .
( Brangäne then reveals that she substituted a love potion for the poison , but it 's often been noted that it 's really the prospect of death that unleashes the passion — not any magical potion . )
The love - drunk duet between Tristan and Isolde is intense yet short - lived , for the ship is docking , King Marke is approaching , and neither Tristan nor Isolde barely know where they are or what 's going on .
" Cornwall hail ! " the men on the ship sing as the curtain falls .
If Tristan and Isolde 's love duet in Act I was unsatisfying short , Act II more than makes up for it .
The setting is a garden outside Isolde 's room in the early evening .
Many of the men , including King Marke but not Tristan , have gone out hunting , and we can hear the hunting horns progressively getting fainter and fainter in the distance .
Isolde is awaiting Tristan 's arrival , and the music becomes more and more excited as he gets closer .
When Tristan enters , the words of the duet tumble over each other in a chaotic and chromatic frenzy of passion .
It slowly subsides in intensity , but evolves into a peculiar and potentially confusing discussion about day and night .
Traditionally , the Enlightenment ( as the word itself suggests ) valued day and light as symbolizing knowledge .
Yet , Tristan and Isolde seem to abhore the daylight and wish to retreat into the dark of night , and not only because it 's the traditional time of love - making .
This is a retreat into the undifferentiated void that is the nuomenal realm of Schopenhauer .
Oh , sink around us
Night of loving
Let me now
Forget I 'm living ,
Bear me softly
Unto thee ,
From the world
Oh set me free .
Now ev 'ry light
Has lost its gleaming ,
All our doubting ,
All our dreaming ,
All remembrance ,
All reminding
Holy twilight
Radient blinding
Drives afar my fear
World - release is near .
Soon , Tristan begins singing what sounds at first like a lullaby :
So let us die
And never part ,
Die united ,
Heart to heart ,
Never waking ,
Never fearing ,
Nameless ,
Endless rapture sharing ,
Each to each devoted ,
In love alone abiding .
But the music builds in a gorgeous seductive swirl , and soon waves of climbing and descending motifs seem to suggest impossible yearning , and then melt into what is clearly ( although some will deny it ) the most sexually explicit music ever written .
Just on the verge of musical climax , a scream from Brangäne interrupts the proceedings :
The hunters have returned , and Tristan and Isolde have been discovered .
King Marke is very disappointed with Tristan , and in a brief scuffle , Tristan allows himself to be seriously wounded .
In Act III , Tristan 's servant Kurwenal has brought Tristan back to his home in Brittany .
They are awaiting the arrival of Isolde , whose healing powers will help cure him of his wounds .
A shepherd plays a plaintive melody on a pipe ( and it is now that we realize that each of the three acts of the opera began with " natural " music — in Act I a sailor 's song , in Act II the hunting horns , and now the shepherd ) .
We learn much about Tristan 's early life , and we know he seeks not life but death , and when Isolde does arrive , he tears off his bandages and dies .
To the same yearning sexual music of the second acts , Isolde bids her farewell , often referred to as the Liebestod ( love death ) but which Wagner called the Verklärung ( transfiguration ) .
Can it be that I alone
Hear this wondrous , glorious tone ,
Softly stealing ,
All revealing ,
Mildly glowing ,
From him flowing ,
Thro ' me pouring ,
Rising , souring ,
Bolding singing ,
Round me ringing ?...
In the raptuous swell ,
In the turbulent spell ,
In the welcoming wave ,
Holding all ,
I 'm sinking ,
I 'm drowning ,
Unaware ,
Highest love !
The libretto calls for Isolde to sink over Tristan 's body , but for at least the last half century , some directors have chosen something quite different : Isolde remains standing , either with her arms outstretched in triumph , or down by her side in defiance .
What 's interesting is that this option does n't seem wrong .
So much of Tristan und Isolde seems to exist not as literal action but as mental states of the two characters , and while the opera is customarily treated as a tragedy , it does n't feel like a tragedy .
We know that Tristan and Isolde are not going to meet together in heaven , but we know that the only possible place for them is in the undifferentiated void of unbeing .
In a sense , Tristan und Isolde is a religous work — as profound and as beautiful as Bach 's St. Matthew Passion , but for a post - religious world .
Although Wagner completed Tristan und Isolde in 1859 , it had to wait until 1865 to be premiered .
Earlier attempts at staging Tristan und Isolde were abandoned due to the strains the opera puts on its two leads , and the difficulty that singers had in learning the extremely chromatic score .
( Wagner 's attempt to create an easily performable opera entirely failed . )
The opera sounds richly melodic to us now , but for early singers it made little musical sense and was effectively unperformable .
Wagner 's opera career might have entirely collapsed around this time were it not for the patronage of young Ludwig II , who became King of Bavaria in 1864 at the age of 18 .
It was only with Ludwig II 's help that Tristan und Isolde was performed , after which Wagner wrote Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg ( 1865 ) , and then returned to complete The Ring , which was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at an opera house in Bayreuth built specifically for these operas .
Wagner wrote one other opera , Parsifal ( 1882 ) , after which he felt he had no more to say in the form .
He died in 1883 at the age of 69 .
Like Beethoven 's 9th Symphony ( 1824 ) or Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring ( 1913 ) , Tristan und Isolde is one of those rare works that break free of old constraints and demonstrate the potential of a whole new vocabulary of music .
Most directly influenced by Wagner were Bruckner and Mahler , and later Richard Strauss .
Debussy was forever wrestling with the ghost of Wagner .
He parodied the Tristan Chord in " Golliwog 's Cakewalk " and while composing his only real opera , Pelléas et Mélisande , deliberately tried to avoid sounding like Wagner .
While Debussy was largely successful in making his opera sound not much like Wagner , it is impossible to imagine without Wagner 's influence .
Perhaps the furthest reaching compositional influence of Wagner was through Arnold Schoenberg .
You can certainly hear Wagner in Schoenberg 's early string sextet of smouldering eroticism , Verklärte Nacht ( Transfigured Night ) .
Like Wagner , Schoenberg attempted to stretch harmony to its breaking point , but then pursued a very non-Wagnerian solution .
In the 1920s , Schoenberg completely re-axiomatized music with an atonal theory of harmony based on equal use of all 12 tones of the octave — a theory that affected almost every composer for the rest of the century .
Tristan und Isolde is still considered one of the most difficult operas to stage successfully — largely due to its lack of action and static sets — and it still presents enormous challenges for the two lead singers .
The harmonic challenges that the opera presented 150 years ago have now been almost entirely absorbed , but that does n't negate the power of its emotional punch , and surely not the sheer beauty of its music .
Nothing else comes close .

looking for a ghost in the machine
Let 's review the seminal paper which gave rise to the idea that enough computers reading enough data at the right speed will eventually create a super - intelligent entity .
Illustration by Neil Blevins
A short while ago , I wrote about some of the challenges involved in creating artificial intelligence and raised the question of how exactly a machine would spontaneously attain self - awareness .
While I ’ve gotten plenty of feedback about how far technology has come so far and how it ’s imminent that machines will become much smarter than us , I never got any specifics as to how exactly this would happen .
To me , it ’s not a philosophical question because I ’m used to looking at technology from a design and development standpoint .
When I ask for specifics , I ’m talking about functional requirements .
So far , the closest thing to outlining the requirements for a super - intelligent computer is a paper by University of Oxford philosopher and futurist Nick Bostrom .
The first thing Bostrom tries to do is to establish a benchmark by how to grade what he calls a super - intellect and qualifying his definition .
According to him , this super - intellect would be smarter than any human mind in every capacity from the scientific to the creative .
It ’s a pretty lofty goal because designing something smarter than yourself requires that you build something you do n’t fully understand .
You might have a sudden stroke of luck and succeed , but it ’s more than likely that you ’ll build a defective product instead .
Imagine building a DNA helix from scratch and with no detailed manual to go by .
Even if you have all the tools and know where to find some bits of information to guide you , when you do n’t know exactly what you ’re doing , the task becomes very challenging and you end up making a lot of mistakes along the way .
There ’s also the question of how exactly we evaluate what the term smarter means .
In Bostrom ’s projections , when you have an intelligent machine become fully proficient in a certain area of expertise like say , medicine , it could combine with another machine which has an excellent understanding of physics and so on until all this consolidation leads to a device that knows all that we know and can use all that cross - disciplinary knowledge to gain insights we just do n’t have yet .
Technologically that should be possible , but the question is whether a machine like that would really be smarter than humans per se .
It would be far more knowledgeable than any individual human , granted .
But it ’s not as if there are n’t experts in particular fields coming together to make all sorts of cross - disciplinary connections and discoveries .
What Bostrom calls a super - intellect is actually just a massive knowledge base that can mine itself for information .
The paper was last revised in 1998 when we did n’t have the enormous digital libraries we take for granted in today ’s world .
Those libraries seem a fair bit like Bostrom ’s super - intellect in their function and if we were to combine them to mine their depths with sophisticated algorithms which look for cross - disciplinary potential , we ’d bring his concept to life .
But there ’s not a whole lot of intelligence there .
Just a lot of data , much of which would be subject to change or revision as research and discovery continue .
Just like Bostrom says , it would be a very useful tool for scientists and researchers .
However , it would n’t be thinking on its own and giving the humans advice , even if we put all this data on supercomputers which could live up to the paper ’s ambitious hardware requirements .
Rev it up to match the estimated capacity of our brain , it says , and watch a new kind of intellect start waking up and take shape with the proper software .
According to Bostrom , the human brain operates at 100 teraflops , or 100 trillion floating point operations per second .
Now , as he predicted , computers have reached this speed by 2004 and went far beyond that .
In fact , we have supercomputers which are as much as ten times faster .
Supposedly , at these operating speeds , we should be able to write software which allows supercomputers to learn by interacting with humans and sifting through our digitized knowledge .
But the reality is that we’d be trying to teach an intimate object made of metal and plastic how to think and solve problems , something we ’re already born with and hone over our lifetimes .
You can teach someone how to ride a bike and how to balance , but how exactly would you teach someone to understand the purpose of riding a bike ?
How would you tell someone with no emotion , no desires , no wants and no needs why he should go anywhere ?
That deep layer of motivation and wiring has taken several billion years to appear and was honed over a 600 million additional years of evolution .
When we start trying to make an AI system comparable to ours , we ’re effectively way behind from the get - go .
To truly create an intelligent computer which does n’t just act as if it ’s thinking or do mechanical actions which are easy to predict and program , we ’d need to impart in all that information in trillions of lines of code and trick circuitry into deducing it needs to behave like a living being .
And that ’s a job that could n’t be done in less than century , much less in the next 20 to 30 years as projected by Ray Kurzweil and his fans .
Crocheted Bags , Plastic Bag Crafts Recycled Plastic Messenger Book Bag
I crocheted this messenger book bag from recycled plastic Safeway bags .
People ask me all the time how many bags it takes to crochet different projects of mine .
I did a calculation on this project as I crocheted it .
I found that I used about 3 bags for two full rounds on the crocheted body of the bag .
Therefore I used about 39 bags to crochet the main body of this book bag .
Overall I recycled about 60 plastic bags to crochet the messenger book bag .
I cut my plarn about 1 inch wide using the looping method to create my plastic bag yarn .
I crocheted 26 rows in half double crochet ( HDC ) before starting the flap .
For the flap , I crocheted 12 rows in HDC before starting the decreases for the tapered flap .
I crocheted a total of 25 rows and then added a edging of single crochet stitching around the edges of the flap .
By adding the single crochet stitches , it helps even out the edges and makes for a smooth finish to the flap .
I crocheted my strap even on 6 stitches wide for a 35 inch long strap .
The original crochet pattern for the messenger bag is found here .
It ’s a free plarn crochet pattern and I just tweaked it a bit to make this smaller book bag of 14 ″ wide by 11.5 ″ long .
The original crochet pattern makes a Continue Reading
Yarn Projects More Crocheted Hats
I have been busy crocheting more hats .
In my last post I wrote about a new all front post brimmed hat I tried .
I really liked how it came out and crocheted this one for my grandson .
The hat was worked seamless after row 2 which makes it nice looking without the normal joining showing on the hat .
Photo below shows how it looks without joining except for FPDC rows .

Yarn Projects Front Post Hat Band
I want to share a new twist on an old hat pattern of mine .
My original ribbed hat pattern features a hat band that alternates between front post double crochet ( FPDC ) and back post double crochet ( BPDC ) .
For this new hat band , basically you want to follow my original crochet pattern for the ribbed hat but stop at about 7 inches in length while working the half double crochet ( HDC ) rounds .
Depending on the yarn , I find that I crochet about 18 - 19 rounds of HDC to reach 7 inches .
Then it ’s time to work all FPDC for 5 rounds .
The final length of this crocheted FPDC beanie is about 8 inches .
Here is a closeup of the FPDC hat band .
It does tighten up the hat and makes a nice finished brim .
One last comment about the brown hat .
I tried a new idea so I did n’t have to do a Ch - 2 and join with a slip stitch at the end of each round .
You do n’t have to use this method but it does help the hat look as it does n’t have the noticeable joining seam on each round .
Here is what I did .
At round 3 , I worked a SC into the next HDC stitch to start the round .
Then I just crocheted using HDC stitches to round 18 all without joining or the Ch - 2 which leaves a seam .
On round 18 , I did a sc and slip stitch to join the last rounds together .
Then Ch - 2 and worked FPDC for 5 rounds for the hat brim with the typical joining .
Here is one other hat style idea to share .

Yarn Projects Latest Round Ripple Blanket
Here is my latest round ripple blanket that I have been working on .
I was lucky enough to get a few more brown skeins of yarn donated to me so I could finish it up .
There are no stores anymore in my immediate area that sell yarn .
The local senior center that donates yarn to me was shut down for months so I was n’t able to get any yarn from them either .
Last week they opened back up and I was so excited to go in and obtain yarn from them to finish this blanket .
Finished size is 52 inch wide .
This blanket will be donated back to the senior center for their Veterans Outreach Program .
Hopefully some
Vet will enjoy the blanket and find comfort in using this blanket crocheted with lots of love .

Great Sites & Causes , Yarn Projects Ridged Hat Pattern
These last few weeks , I have been busy crocheting more hats for the Warmth for Warriors annual hat drive .
These hats were crocheted using the free Red Heart Ridged Hat Pattern .
I first saw this hat on a Red Heart yarn wrapper and really liked the look of the crocheted cables on the hat .
I have crocheted this pattern using a I hook and also a J hook .
Both times the hat is too short without having to add some additional rows to get the desired length I need for a men ’s hat size .
I have found that if I add 3 extra rows in the middle I am at about 7.25 ” long in length .
Then I crochet rows 14 - 17 ( 4 rows ) for the trim rows .
Length is about 8.5 ” long and fits nicely .
Here is one more hat I crocheted using the pattern and added some camo type yarn for stripes .

Crocheted Bags , Plastic Bag Crafts Recycled Seahawks
Tote Bag
I have had lots of time on my hands lately to crochet with all the stay - at - home orders .
I thought it was time to break into my huge stash of plastic bags and crochet a new recycled plastic tote bag .
This bag was crocheted using mainly white plastic retail bags made into plarn and I added blue and green yarn to give it a Seattle Seahawks color theme .
This tote bag was crocheted using my free ultimate recycled bag pattern .
I added stripes using regular yarn by doing 3 blue HDC ( half double crochet stitch ) rows , 3 green HDC and then 3 more blue HDC rows along with plastic bag yarn to crochet this bag .
Finished size is 12 ″ wide by 13 ″ long with 7 ″ handles .
I think it would make a nice book bag so I may donate it to the next library fundraiser .
So in honor of my beloved Seahawks , Continue Reading
RUSSELLVILLE , Ala . ( AP ) -- A Franklin County judge has ordered a death sentence for a Russellville woman accused of setting a house fire that killed her 6 - year - old son in order to collect life insurance .
Circuit Judge Terry Dempsey sentenced 31 - year - old Christie Michelle Scott today , deciding not to go along with the jury , which recommended life in prison without parole .
Scott was convicted of capital murder in July for starting the fire at her family 's Russellville home that killed Mason Scott a year ago .
She was accused of starting the fire to collect $ 175,000 in life insurance on her son , including a $ 100,000 policy purchased 12 hours before his death .
Dempsey said a death sentence is " the only way justice can be served in this case . "
Scott testified during the trial that she was innocent and did not know how the fire started .
Is history ending yet again ?
Much as the hammers that leveled the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the end of the Cold War , so might the protests rocking Iran signal the death of radical Islam and the challenges it poses to the West .
No , that does n't mean we 'll be removing the metal detectors from our airports anytime soon .
Al - Qaeda and its ilk , even diminished in strength , will retain the ability to stage terrorist strikes .
But the danger brought home on Sept. 11 , 2001 , was always greater than the possibility of murderous attacks .
It was the threat that a hostile ideology might come to dominate large swaths of the Muslim world .
Not all versions of this ideology -- variously called Islamism or radical Islam -- are violent .
But at the core of even the peaceful ones , such as that espoused by Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , is the idea that the Islamic world has been victimized by the West and must defend itself .
Even before the United States invaded Iraq , stoking rage , polls in Muslim countries revealed support for Osama bin Laden and for al - Qaeda 's aims , if not its methods .
If such thinking were to triumph in major Muslim countries beyond Iran -- say , Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- violent extremists would command vast new stores of personnel , explosives and funds .
This is precisely the nightmare scenario that is now receding .
Even if the Iranian regime succeeds in suppressing the protests and imposes the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by force of bullets , mass arrests and hired thugs , it will have forfeited its legitimacy , which has always rested on an element of consent as well as coercion .
Most Iranians revered Ayatollah Khomeini , but when his successor , Ayatollah Khamenei , declared the election results settled , hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets , deriding his anointed candidate with chants of " Death to the dictator ! "
" Even if they manage to hang on for a month or a couple of years , they 've shed the blood of their people , " says Egyptian publisher and columnist Hisham Kassem .
" It 's over . "

First National Climate Asssessment
The First National Climate Assessment , entitled Climate Change Impacts on the United States : The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change , was published in 2000 and was a major landmark in the ongoing effort to understand what climate change meant for America .
This assessment began a national process of research , analysis , and dialogue about the coming changes in climate , their impacts , and what Americans can do to adapt to an uncertain and continuously changing climate .
Second National Climate Assessment
The Second National Climate Assessment , entitled Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States , was published in 2009 and summarized the science of climate change and its impacts on America , now and in the future .
It identified key climatic vulnerabilities of particular regions and sectors , in the context of other changes in the Nation ’s environment , resources , and economy .
It also identified potential measures to adapt to climate variability and change .
Finally , the Second National Climate Assessment identified the highest priority uncertainties about which further study is needed to understand climate impacts , vulnerabilities , and America 's ability to adapt .
Interim Assessments
From 2002 to 2009 , USGCRP was known as the U.S. Climate Change Science Program ( CCSP ) .
CCSP created a series of 21 Synthesis and Assessment Products ( SAPs ) that integrated research on key climate science issues and aimed to support informed discussion by decision makers ( such as resource managers and policymakers ) , stakeholders , and the general public .
In 2008 , the National Science and Technology Council ( NSTC ) and CCSP released the Scientific Assessment of the Effects of Global Change on the United States , which placed special emphasis on climate change .
This assessment analyzed the effects of global change on natural and human environments , agriculture , water resources , social systems , energy production and use , transportation , and human health .
It analyzed existing trends in global change , both natural and human - induced , and projected major trends for the future .
Like the SAPs and other assessment products , it was intended to support informed discussion by decision makers , stakeholders , and the public .
Third National Climate Assessment
The Third National Climate Assessment , Climate Change Impacts in the United States , was published in 2014 and summarizes the impacts of climate change on the United States , now and in the future .
A team of more than 300 experts guided by a 60 - member Federal Advisory Committee produced the report , which was extensively reviewed by the public and experts , including federal agencies and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences . ​
Damn , I ’ve been trying to find this plugin for a while now , ever since I ’d discovered clickcomments I ’ve been trying to get a similar solution running on the Division by Zer0 but there was nothing of the sort , at least as far as I knew .
So as a workaround I used another similar plugin called WP - Likes which did almost the same thing but unfortunately was limited to only one option and hard - coded to “ Like ” .
It was a compromise while hoping that it ’s developer might include the multiple - choice functionality in the future .
Fortunately I did n’t have to wait that long .
Through a chance encounter with the Sikkdays blog , I noticed exactly what I wished to have :
Three little icons at the end of the pos , allowing people to rate / judge a post according to emotion .
A quick question to the admin , led me to the plugin responsible for this , called Emo -Vote .
Fortunately , I did n’t have to stay with Emo - based titles as there is a customization possibility and I quickly switched to Slashdot - based ratings , which are far more descriptive of how people might find the topics I write about .
So you ’ll notice further below that you can now vote for each article on how you found it .
Options are based on how I think opinionated blogposts can be judged as , such as interesting , boring , funny etc .
I ’d like to have a couple of options more , such as “ disagree ” etc , but I think for now the current capability is enough .
But why do I think that this kind of functionality is something beneficial to have on one ’s blog ?
A few reasons .
First , it allows people who had a reaction to the article from some perspective ( say , finding it informative ) to state so without having to write a short comment about it ( which is far more time - consuming than a simple click of the mouse . )
In a sense , allowing the author to see how his articles are being received from a part of the audience he could n’t see before .
The silent majority .
And as I consider comments and feedback in general as the main measure of success of blogposts , a way to increase that can not be anything but good .
Second , it provides some interesting statistics , such as being able to see which are my top funniest topics , which are the most boring etc , according to audience interaction .
This in turn one can publish on sidebars or a particular page so that new visitors can quickly find the most interesting content in the blog according to their tastes .
It also provides the author with valuable information on what kind of topic he should concentrate on , based on previous success .
Lastly , it has potential .
What Postreach attempted to do but failed due to its centralized nature , perhaps can be achieved by blogs federating amongst themselves .
So for example , perhaps there will be a way to export such ratings to an aggregator which would allow anyone visiting it to quickly find new insightful , interesting etc posts from different blogs .
Of course that would require than many use the same rating names or some other working system .
Who knows , perhaps the Automattic will be willing to host such a service for the benefit of their userbase .
But yeah , potential .
So anyway , I really hope I ’ll see you all clicking away below , and you should even see this as an option on your RSS reader .
😉
Normal comments are of course welcome as always and do let me know if you think that a category should be swapped to something better .

I hope you 've been enjoying the variety of flavors available to those on a vegan diet .
If you like bold spice and flavor , then you 're definitely down with Sriracha .
It really is an amazingly versatile and simple sauce that goes with just about everything .
Do you like heat ?
Thai in origin , the main star is the red chili pepper .
You may be familiar with the popular Huy Fong Foods product by its creator David Tran who helped to make this amazingly simple sauce popular throughout the United States and the world .
Here is a nice little recipe you can try to make your own vegan sriracha sauce .
Ingredients : Prepare the peppers by washing and cleaning .
Remove stems .
Chop the peppers , and add to a food processor .
Toss the vinegar , salt , soy sauce , agave , and garlic into the food processor along with the peppers .
Process the mix , leave chunky .
Move the whole mixture to a large jar or container , and seal with a coffee filter and rubber band .
To get the best result you should let it sit for a few days .
You 'll notice a little bubbling below the surface , that 's when you know it is ready .
From here you can process the mixture down into a smoother form .
Add water as needed .
A couple of months ago we reported that Sony CEO Howard Stringer had said “ We will be expanding the PlayStation Network to hardware other than the PS3 ” .
Later this year Sony are releasing the VAIO W , their first foray in to the Netbook market , offering a small sized and lower specced laptop for the budget price of $ 499 .
During an interview Sony ’s Information Technology Products Division Senior Vice President ( phew ) Mike Arbary , was asked :
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
So given what Howard Stringer has been saying about breaking down internal silos across Sony , would n’t this be a great opportunity for you to offer some sort of integration with the PlayStation movie and TV service ?
We are absolutely talking about that internally .
The PlayStation network is growing .
We believe that network will have an option with VAIO PCs or any PCs for that matter .
What we are trying to do is collaborate with our peers at PlayStation in that regard .
Would the PlayStation Network on VAIOs include games as well ?
That is a possibility but we are concentrated more on movies and TV content .
We find casual gaming to be interesting for PCs and we are driving right now to establish our role in that area .
We believe this segment of end user of causal gaming is growing we can address that marketplace in a way that is unique on VAIOs .
Even if you have no intention of purchasing a VAIO it will still have positive reverberations in the world of the PlayStation , as at the very least it will mean more eyeballs for PlayStation content which will in turn lead to more content for the whole network .
He does also say “ VAIO or any PC for that matter ” which may leave the door open for some sort of PSN interface being made available to any PC user , although I ’d have thought they ’d be better off just giving the PSN a much needed web interface similar to Xbox Live Marketplace .
It all still sounds very much a work in progress , so whether the PSN will be appearing on the VAIO W when it ’s launched in October is not yet confirmed .

Khartoum —
To the media she is the " Sudan trouser woman . "
Images of Lubna Hussein wearing the outfit that led to her arrest in Khartoum last month have zipped around the world .
News reports give the impression that she is a radical on a crusade , her trial a fight over women ’s rights in an Islamic capital city .
But this impression fails to scratch the surface .
What is at stake is no less than a burgeoning social movement that promises to test the authoritarian Sudanese government on a global stage .
Hussein is one of thousands of women arrested each year for one of the " public order " offenses listed in Sudan ’s criminal code .
Article 152 , the one relevant to Hussein ’s case , reads : " Whoever commits an indecent act or an act that breaches public morality or wears clothes that are indecent or would breach public morality which causes annoyance to public feelings is liable to forty lashes or fine or both punishments . "
The laws are officially meant to keep the public safe .
But in practice , public order police use the vaguely worded regulations to extract bribes from women on the street , while public order justices deliver immediate punishment for infractions , devoid of due process .
This means that public order laws are the subject of suppressed but persistent debate inside Sudan .
The current regime , led by President Omar Hassan al - Bashir , enacted the sharia - based provisions upon seizing power in a military coup in 1989 .
But the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement , which ended two decades of bloody civil war between the government and southern Sudan , mandated a " democratic transformation . "
The Interim Constitution , which takes the country through a set transition period , includes a bill of rights meant to respect the " freedoms enshrined in international human rights treaties " — which includes equality between the sexes and due process , two things disrespected in cases like Hussein’s .
A disparate group of activists — including non-governmental organizations , opposition political parties , and media outlets — have been trying to use the Interim Constitution to argue for the easing of the public order provisions .
" The government ’s statistics tell us that last year 43,000 people were arrested for crimes against the public order , " explained Sudanese human right activist Nahid Gabralla .
" I consider every one of those people to be victims . "
But activists have made no headway in changing the laws or the institutions that enforce them .
Nor have they garnered the attention of the public officials who could make the necessary reforms .
What has started to change , with Hussein ’s arrest , is the opposition itself .
The incident has spurred diffuse activists into coordinating and bolstered their efforts .
And Hussein herself has played an integral part , by refusing to duck a trial and then drawing attention to her case — a startling move for a woman in this conservative society .
As a staffer at the U.N. Mission in Sudan ’s media department , Hussein could have invoked diplomatic immunity to avoid flogging for the " crime " of wearing trousers .
Instead , she waived her immunity and decided to challenge the law head - on .
Hussein says she hoped to shed light on those flogged under unjust laws — especially because most women and girls who are thus punished do everything they can to keep their ordeal from the rest of the world .
Speaking with me the day before her trial , she explained her decision to go public .
" The trouble is that usually people do n’t hear about this law .
If you tell people you have been flogged for wearing trousers , they wo n’t believe you .
This way , there will be witnesses . "
After waiving immunity , Hussein says she considered using her skill in journalism to write an article on her case , highlighting the absurdity of the law .
But Sudan censors its press .
Anything she wrote would never have seen the light of day .
Hussein enlisted the support of legal reform advocates instead , writing personal invitations asking them to attend her trial .
She then reached out to the international media to give the case a global profile .
The grassroots movement coalesced and grasped the opportunity .
On Tuesday , more than 100 women appeared at the North Khartoum District Courthouse with hand - written signs reading " No more women ’s rights violations ! " and " Kill me , but do n’t suppress me ! "
Gabralla , the human rights activist , stood proudly in the front row , facing scores of the much - feared policemen carrying batons and AK47s , with riot gear at the ready .
Inside the courtroom , the judge postponed the trial for a month , saying he wanted time to clarify Hussein ’s immunity status .
It would have been hard to imagine , given the global spotlight on this case , there being any other outcome from the hearing .
Hussein and her acolytes have forced the Sudanese government to decide whether it wishes to flog a practicing Muslim widow in full view of the world .
At this time , Sudan is attempting to prove its bona fides to a U.S. administration .
Recently , U.S. Special Envoy Scott Gration indicated the United States may be willing to normalize relations , suggesting that Sudan should be removed from the official U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Although the Sudanese government wishes to appease the Americans , it also does not want to let the protestors have their way .
Hussein knew these dynamics well when she took the step of challenging the law .
The Sudanese government has turned the tactic of delay into an art form — hoping that in a month ’s time , the outrage over Hussein ’s case will have blown over .
It is a hope resting on a shaky foundation .
The international media spotlight may be fickle — " trousergate " can only run for so long .
But the regime in Khartoum will not be able to stamp out the hundreds of women intent on protesting Hussein ’s trial .
In a country where the omnipresence of the dreaded security services has led the population to self - censor , Hussein ’s act of defiance shows the possibility of a different path .
As Hussein puts it , " This is not about trousers . "
Chapter 8 : Positivism and the Crisis of Western Civilization
The outstanding fact about the contemporary ideological situation is that the most popular political doctrines aim at totalitarianism , the thorough abolition of the individual 's freedom to choose and to act .
No less remarkable is the fact that the most bigoted advocates of such a system of conformity call themselves scientists , logicians , and philosophers .
This is , of course , not a new phenomenon .
Plato , who even more than Aristotle was for centuries the maestro di color che sanno , elaborated a plan of totalitarianism the radicalism of which was surpassed only in the nineteenth century by the schemes of Comte and Marx .
It is a fact that many philosophers are utterly intolerant of any dissent and want to have any criticism of their own ideas prevented by the government 's police apparatus .
As far as the empiricist principle of logical positivism refers to the experimental methods of the natural sciences , it merely asserts what is not questioned by anybody .
As far as it rejects the epistemological principles of the sciences of human action , it is not only entirely wrong .
It is also knowingly and intentionally undermining the intellectual foundations of Western civilization .
Homunculus image from Reinhard Blutner .
[ i.e. , genital - less ]
During the last 70 years the description of the sensory homunculus has been virtually a standard reference for various somatotopical studies ( Penfield and Boldrey 1937 ; PDF ) .
This map consists of a detailed description of the functional cortical representation of different body parts obtained via electrical stimulation during open brain surgery .
In their findings they relied on reported sensations of different body parts after electrical stimulation of the cortex .
Assessment of the exact location was generally difficult and sometimes led to conflicting results .
The genital region was especially hard to assess due to difficulties with sense of shame .
... classical and [ some ] modern findings appear to be at odds with the principle of somatotopy , 1 often assigning it to the cortex on the mesial wall .
Using functional neuroimaging , we established a mediolateral sequence of somatosensory foot , penis , and lower abdominal wall representation on the contralateral postcentral gyrus in primary sensory cortex and a bilateral secondary somatosensory representation in the parietal operculum .
Prior to the imaging session , two self - attaching surface disc electrodes ( 1 × 1 cm ) were placed bilaterally next to the clitoris of the subjects so that we were able to stimulate the fibers of the dorsal clitoral nerve .
Before the start of the experiment , electrical test stimulation was performed to ensure that subjects could feel the stimulation directly at the clitoris .
In addition , the strength of electrical stimulation was adjusted to a subject - specific level , i.e. that stimulation was neither felt [ as ] painful nor elicited – in case of clitoris stimulation – any sexual arousal ( see below ) .
Functional imaging was performed in a block design with alternating rest and stimulation conditions , starting with a rest condition .
...
In addition to the clitoris stimulation , we performed in eight of the recorded subjects a second experimental session , in which we applied electrical stimulation of the right hallux using the same type of electrodes , stimulation and scan paradigm .
Electrical clitoral stimulation produced significant activations predominantly in bilaterally prefrontal areas ( BA 6 , 8 and 45 ) , the precentral , parietal and postcentral gyri , including S1 ( BA 2 and 3 ; 40 –70 % probability ) and S2 ( BA 43 and ventral BA 40 , 30 –60 % probability ) .
In addition , distributed activations were also seen in the anterior and posterior parts of the insula and the putamen .
Fig. 3 (

Illustration of the random - effect group - activation pattern for the contrast ‘ electrical clitoral stimulation versus rest ’ ( orange – yellow color code ;
p less than 0.02
uncorrected for multiple comparisons ) and for the contrast ‘ electrical hallux stimulation versus rest ’ ( green – blue color code ;
p less than 0.001
uncorrected for multiple comparisons
) on a group average brain .
A cluster extent threshold of
p less than 0.05 is applied for both contrasts .
Electrical clitoral stimulation elicited bilateral activations of lateral surface of S1 as indicated by the white circles .
We found no evidence of clitoral representation in the mesial wall , even when using unconventionally low statistical thresholds .
This finding is further substantiated by other recent cytoarchitectonic studies revealing that BA 2 does not reach the inter - hemispheric fissure and BA 3 and BA 1 reach the postcentral mesial wall with a probability of only 30 % .
Our results are also in good agreement with [ neuroanatomical ] studies on nonhuman primates .

OK kids , let 's start today 's lesson by viewing the G - Rated flash explanation of homunculus .
The neuroanatomical definition of homunculus is a " distorted " representation of the sensorimotor body map ( and its respective parts ) overlaid upon primary somatosensory and primary motor cortices .
The above figure illustrates the sensory homunculus , where each body part is placed onto the region of cortex that represents it , and the size of the body part is proportional to its cortical representation ( and sensitivity ) .
It 's rare to see the genitals represented at all .
And if they are present , they are inevitably male genitals .
To remedy this puritanical and androcentric situation , Swiss scientists at University Hospital in Zurich conducted a highly stimulating study in 15 healthy women to map the somatosensory representation of the clitoris ( Michels et al. , 2009 ) .
The authors begin by reviewing the work of Wilder Penfield et al. : Recent studies have tried to map the somatosensory represenation of the human penis using neuroimaging methods , but there has been disagreement over whether it shows the classic medial representation seen in the figure above , or a more laterally located representation in the postcentral gyrus .
For example , Kell et al. ( 2005 ) noted that ... But there are no comparable fMRI studies of female genitalia .
So how is such a study conducted , methodologically speaking ?
Electrical stimulation of the dorsal clitoral nerve was compared to electrical stimulation of the hallux ( big toe ) .
It was all very clinical , no sexual arousal involved .
Here 's the experimental protocol :
If you " see below " in the Methods you 'll discover that after the fMRI session , participants rated their level of sexual arousal and discomfort on a visual analogue scale that ranged from - 10 ( unbearable pain or strong sexual arousal ) to 10 ( pleasure or no arousal at all / sleepiness ) .
The median score for sexual arousal was zero with some variability [ range : − 7.5 to 8 ; − 2 ( 25 % percentile ) and 2.5 ( 75 % percentile ) ] .
The median score for comfortableness was − 2 [ range : − 7 to 9 ; − 2.5 ( 25 % percentile ) and 0 ( 75 % percentile ) ] .
C'est la vie .
The neuroimaging results revealed that compared to the rest blocks , The major result was similar to the penile homuculus findings of Kell et al. ( 2005 ) : a failure to replicate the original 1937 studies of Penfield and Boldrey .
Although the statistical thresholds here for the clitoral stimulation were not stringent enough , the authors use this to their advantage :
In conclusion , it appears that Michels et al. ( 2009 ) have indeed mapped out a new clitoral homunculus , to go along with the new penile homunculus .
The standard somatosensory imagesshould be revised accordingly .
Somatotopy , or somatotopic organization refers to Foot fetishes aside , the mapping of the genitals next to the toes is in violation of somatotopic organization . [ like the standard homunculi shown above and below ]

TOKYO  Prime Minister Taro
Aso faced the possibility of a revolt in his own party on Monday , after a bruising defeat in a local vote forced him to call for a general election in which his Liberal Democratic Party faces almost certain defeat .
Mr. Aso had been trying to put off the national elections , now set for Aug. 30 , in part because polls had shown that his party could lose its almost unbroken 54 - year grip on power .
Mr. Aso ’s hand appeared to have been forced , though , by a poor showing on Sunday in a municipal election in Tokyo .
With both Mr. Aso and the conservative Liberal Democrats sinking in opinion polls , political experts say that the prime minister may face the wrath of his own party members , who fear their organization could break apart if it finds itself in the unusual position of losing power .
A poll conducted last week for Asahi Shimbun , one of Japan ’s largest newspapers , showed that 37 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the opposition Democrats in national elections , compared with 22 percent for the Liberal Democrats .
A poll last week by another newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , found Mr. Aso ’s approval rating had fallen to 20 percent .
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has confirmed its Palo Alto facility put the chief of optometry on administrative leave and reassigned another optometrist while it investigated the treatment of hundreds of eye patients , some of whom experienced significant vision loss under the department ’s care .
In February , the VA Palo Alto Health Care System initiated a three - month internal review of 381 charts and determined 23 glaucoma patients experienced “ progressive visual loss ” while receiving treatment in the hospital ’s optometry department , the Veterans Affairs office in Washington , D.C. , told the Bay Area News Group .
The VA informed seven of those patients that improper care might have caused their blindness .
At issue is whether the optometry department failed to follow VA policy requiring it to consult with medical doctors on glaucoma cases — possibly costing the patients their vision .
“ The VA Palo Alto Health Care System has a policy that all patients with glaucoma seen in the optometry section should have their cases overseen and reviewed by the ophthalmology section , ” VA Press Secretary Katie Roberts said in a statement .
“ Earlier this year , VAPAHCS leadership became aware this had not occurred in some cases .
VAPAHCS leadership took immediate action , ordering an exhaustive review of all glaucoma patients and patients at risk for glaucoma who were being actively seen in optometry . ”
Of the seven blind patients contacted , two have filed lawsuits , the VA said , noting it settled one claim and the other is pending .
During the review , doctors identified 87 other veterans at high risk of losing their sight and placed all of them — except one who was living out of state — under the care of the ophthalmology department , the VA said .
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging the optic nerve , according to the National Eye Institute ’s Web site .
Optometrists are doctors of optometry , with a minimum of four years of training , who can treat glaucoma if certified .
Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with eight years of training , including medical school , an internship and a residency .
As a result of the probe , the ophthalmology department now handles all glaucoma cases and is supervising the optometry department , the VA said .
The investigation came after doctors discovered a 62 - year - old male veteran had “ significant visual loss in one eye as a result of poorly controlled glaucoma ” during a Jan. 16 , 2009 , visit to the ophthalmology clinic , the VA said in a second written statement .
He had been treated at the hospital ’s optometry unit since at least June 13 , 2005 , when a clinic note indicated optometrists suspected he had glaucoma .
“ Ophthalmology Service became concerned that optic nerve damage and visual loss might have been avoided if the patient had been referred to ophthalmology sooner , ” the statement said .
A VA physician involved in the investigation said the patient saw Optometry Chief Curtis Keswick for years but was n’t treated for his glaucoma .
The patient went blind in one eye and experienced serious vision loss in the other , said the physician , who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal .
“ They watched the optic nerve get worse , worse , worse , and they documented it , ” the doctor said .
“ This particular patient was never even put on eye drops . ”
Reached by phone Monday , Keswick said he could n’t give his version of what happened because the VA had barred him from speaking about the case .
“ As part of the investigation , which is still ongoing , I have been mandated not to talk with anyone about it , ” Keswick said .
Optometrists and ophthalmologists have been fighting over glaucoma certification requirements for optometrists after state legislation passed last year broadened optometrists ’ ability to treat the disease and prescribe medication .
Backers of the bill , sponsored by Sen. Lou Correa , D - Santa Ana , argued it would enable more people with glaucoma to receive treatment .
Ophthalmologists have expressed concern about the amount of training optometrists receive .
Last week the California State Board of Optometry accepted final education recommendations for the certification and will enact regulations in January of next year , said Mona Maggio , board executive officer .
Keswick has no California glaucoma certification , according to the state board ’s Web site .
However , he is also licensed in Washington state , where additional certification is not required for optometrists to treat glaucoma with topical medications , a spokeswoman for the Washington Department of Health said .
Doctors with certifications from other states can practice at the VA .
However , the VA has a stricter ethics policy than many private institutions , VA spokeswoman Roberts said .
Foreign demand for long - term US financial assets fell in April as both China and Japan trimmed their holdings of Treasury securities .
The Treasury Department said Monday that net purchases of stocks , notes and bonds obtained by foreigners fell to $ US11.2 billion ( $ 13.85 billion ) in April , from $ US55.4 billion ( $ 68.51 billion ) in March .
China , the largest holder of US Treasury securities , trimmed its holdings to $ US763.5 billion ( $ 944.22 billion ) in April , from $ US767.9 billion ( $ 949.67 billion ) in March .
Japan , the second largest holder of Treasury securities , reduced its holdings to $ US685.9 billion ( $ 848.26 billion ) , from $ US686.7 billion ( $ 849.25 billion ) a month earlier .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner travelled to Beijing earlier this month to assure the Chinese government that the Obama administration is determined to get control of an exploding US budget deficit , which is projected to hit a record $ US1.84 trillion ( $ 2.28 trillion ) this year .
China 's holdings of Treasury securities represent about 10 per cent of America 's publicly held debt .
As most people have probably heard by now , we are in the midst of a pandemic – swine flu or H1N1 .
This is a strain of the Influenza A virus , which causes a severe respiratory infection .
The virus evolves rapidly and each year new strains appear , causing the annual flu season which causes 30,000 deaths in the US and 500,000 world wide .
( The H and N refer to the two main proteins used to classify different strains of the virus – I wrote a more detailed summary here . )
Because the current pandemic is being caused by an H1N1 strain , the same strain that caused the 1918 - 1919 pandemic that killed millions , world health organizations are understandably concerned and they are tracking it carefully .
There are also efforts underway to develop a vaccine .
This further raises concerns because of the 1976 H1N1 pandemic – the vaccine given for that strain was linked to cases of Guillain - Barré Syndrome – GBS .
Unfortunately , while the likely risk of GBS is much smaller than the risk from the flu itself , this risk has stoked the flames of fear - mongering about vaccines .
This somewhat irresponsible article in the Daily Mail is a good example .
GBS
GBS is an autoimmune neurological disorder .
It is a monophasic ( one time process that gets worse then gets better ) post - infectious illness .
Essentially , an infection with a virus or bacteria triggers the immune system to have a second inflammatory response against myelin proteins .
Myelin is the insulation around nerves – the inflammation inhibits nerve conduction , damages the myelin , and when severe can damage the underlying nerve fiber itself .
This results in weakness , numbness , and autonomic dysfunction .
The weakness , when very severe , can inhibit breathing resulting in the need for mechanical ventilation .
Right now the greatest risk from the disease is the autonomic dysfunction which can cause a severe drop in blood pressure , among other symptoms .
If recognized early and treated properly , most patients with GBS have a short illness – days to weeks – and recover nearly fully .
However , severe or untreated cases can result in permanent paralysis and there is a 3 - 4 % death rate .
( Although I have treated many cases , I have never seen a death from GBS – not even close .
I suspect these cases result from a significant delay in treatment or improper treatment . )
GBS can not only be triggered by the flu or other infections , but also by vaccines used to prevent infections .
This is because vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system , to provoke an immune response – which is what causes GBS .
The risk of getting GBS from the flu vaccine is about 1 in a million .
This is very reliable data , as we have been using the same basic technology for the flu vaccine for decades and we have reliable statistics on GBS as treatment requires hospitalization .
Some cases may be missed if they are very mild ( probably rare , but also if a case is too mild to be recognized then who cares ) or from misdiagnosis ( also probably rare as it is fairly easy to eventually confirm the diagnosis even if it may be difficult initially ) .
Of note , GBS does not affect the brain ( as the Daily Mail incorrectly reported ) but only the peripheral nerves .
Occasionally the spinal cord may also be affected , but generally speaking GBS is a peripheral disease .
H1N1 Flu Vaccine
As we gear up for the H1N1 flu vaccine there is much fear - mongering among the antivaccinationists , the usual conspiracy theorists and critics ( usually competitors ) with science - based medicine .
The Daily Mail piece , unfortunately , plays into this fear mongering while burying any reasonable responses from scientists deep within the article .
The reason the GBS concern is raised is because in 1976 the H1N1 or swine flu vaccine triggered a GBS outbreak , and it is estimated that about 10 in a million recipients came down with GBS .
It also turns out that the 1976 pandemic fizzled , and turned out to be very mild .
The flu vaccine uses the same basic technology that has been used for decades , and therefore it is very reliable and the risks are fairly well known .
Each year the vaccine has to be tweaked to target the likely strains of Influenza A that will be prominent that year .
So the risks from the vaccine may vary slightly as new strains are being targeted , but over the last 30 years since the 1976 episode the risk of GBS has been steady at about 1 in a million – far less than the risk of the flu itself .
Therefore the accusation that the upcoming H1N1 flu vaccine is untested is not a fair or accurate statement .
It is highly tested .
But it is true that the particular strains targeted will be new .
Some charge that therefore vaccinating the public will amount to a large “ guinea pig ” experiment .
This is a naive and misleading statement , however .
The fact is that every single medical intervention , every new drug on the market , is in the same situation .
Even if we highly test a new drug or treatment in thousands of subjects , it may be marketed to millions .
We cannot possibly know the statistical effects on millions of people until it happens .
There is therefore nothing different about the H1N1 vaccine from any other mass medical intervention .
If anything , our experience is even greater because we have decades of experience vaccinating millions of people with very similar vaccines .
Even still , it makes sense to track new interventions – to gather data about what happens when millions are treated .
For that reason the British National Health Service has apparently asked neurologists to report new cases of GBS starting this summer .
They want to establish a baseline rate of GBS using this reporting system so that if there is a spike of GBS following the H1N1 flu vaccine they will pick it up quickly and can make recommendations about whether or not to continue the vaccine or abort it .
This makes sense .
But the Daily Mail is using this precautionary measure to scaremonger about the safety of the vaccine .
This is like using the presence of seat - belts in cars to scaremonger about their safety .
Conclusion
The upcoming H1N1 vaccine is simply the regular flu vaccine targeted against the H1N1 proteins to cover the current pandemic strain .
Because the pandemic will likely come in two waves , and we are between them right now , this gives us the opportunity to create a vaccine specific for the pandemic strain – rather than guessing , as we do each year for the regular flu season .
We have a great deal of information about the safety of this vaccine , but it is always reasonable to track safety going forward .
We also have a lot of information about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine – it is very effective .
The vaccine itself is very effective , but the actual effectiveness each year varies from 60 - 80 % depending upon whether or not the proper strains were targeted .
The risk of GBS from the flu vaccine has been around 1 in a million – a very rare complication .
The risk may not be any higher for the H1N1 vaccine .
It is actually not known why the 1976 vaccine had a higher rate of GBS , but it has not been repeated in the last 30 years .
Perhaps there is something about H1N1 that increases the risk of GBS , and for this reason monitoring GBS as the vaccine is administered is reasonable .
So far , in preliminary tests of thousands of individuals with the new vaccine there has not been any increased risk of GBS , but this process in ongoing .
There are no absolute guarantees in medicine – but the best evidence we have to date strongly suggests that the risk of the H1N1 flu is likely to be much greater than the risk of the vaccine itself .
And the usual safety measures and testing are in place – in fact there is heightened safety monitoring .
Medicine is a risk vs benefit assessment .
But it is easy to fear monger by focusing only on the risk .
A bond between three people in a German concentration camp is still there many years after they were split up , all deep scars from back then .
One of them invites them to a reunion , and we 're out for a night none of them will ever forget .
Public - Private - NGO Conservation Alliance Invests $ 100 Million in Mexico
The global conservation group WWF , along with the foundation established by telecommunications tycoon Carlos Slim , and the Mexican federal government , launched the initiative to support conservation in areas of exceptional natural richness .

" Mexico is home to 10 percent of the Earth 's species and this wealth of diversity is important not only for Mexico 's ecosystems , but for the people here who depend on these resources for their social , economic and physical well - being , " said WWF President and CEO Carter Roberts .
" This is the largest private financial commitment from an individual ever made in support of conservation and sustainable development in Mexico , " said Omar Vidal , director of WWF - Mexico .
" This alliance between the private sector , NGOs and government is exactly the kind of partnership that WWF sees as the model for transforming the way we conserve our special places and balance the needs of people and nature around the world , " Vidal said .
The work of the alliance will include efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change , develop comprehensive water management policies , strengthen civil society , develop innovative financial mechanisms , and invest in local sustainable economies .

" This alliance also underscores Mexico 's rising leadership in global negotiations on the design of new financial mechanisms to help developing nations confront and adapt to climate change , " Roberts said .
An assessment of the major issues and recommended actions was developed based on consultation with more than 100 government and civil society experts across the selected regions .
The six regions - the Gulf of California , Chihuahuan Desert , Mesoamerican Reef of Mexico , the Monarch Butterfly Region , and the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca - collectively represent 30 percent of the country .
" Carlos Slim is one of the world 's most important philanthropists and most people have never heard about his humanitarian activities , " said former U.S. President Bill Clinton .
" He owns stock in more than 200 companies that employ more than 200,000 people in Latin America and beyond , " Clinton said .
In his own country , Mexico , he has personally supported more than 165,000 young people in attending university , paid for numerous surgeries , provided equipment for rural schools and covered surety bonds for 50,000 people who were entitled to their freedom but could not afford , " said Clinton .
" He recently created the Carso Institute for Health , and designed it to provide a new approach to health care in Mexico . "
The Six Priority Regions , as described by WWF :
The Gulf of California stretches over 900 miles , contains around 922 islands , and is surrounded by five Mexican states .
Attracting more than two million sport fishermen , divers and tourists a year , it is home to more than eight million people , including eight indigenous peoples , who rely on the Gulf for their livelihoods .
Threats to this area include unsustainable tourist , urban and real - estate developments ; industrial , unsustainable shrimp and sardine fisheries ; overexploitation and pollution of natural water sources ; and climate change .
Marine life on the Mesoamerican Reef ( Photo courtesy WWF ) The Mesoamerican Reef runs from the northern end of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and the Caribbean coasts of Belize and Guatemala , to the Bay Islands in northern Honduras .
It provides a defense against storms and coastal erosion , while the living reef and associated ecosystems support recreation and commercial fishing .
Threats to the area include illegal fisheries and commercialization of marine products ; overexploitation ; introduction of non-native species to the area ; shipwrecks in coral reefs ; fires ; urban and real - estate developments ; limited local capacity ; and limited local knowledge and valuation of natural resources .
Unsustainable tourism is also a growing threat .
Tourism is the fastest growing industry in the Mesoamerican Reef , with diving and coastal tourism as the principal socio-economic drivers in the majority of sites in the region .
The region has seen exponential growth of cruise ship tourism in recent years , bringing an estimated eight million tourists to Mesoamerica in 2008 .
The Chihuahuan Desert is the largest desert in North America , stretching all the way from the southwestern United States deep into the Central Mexican Highlands .
Very little rain falls in the area , but underground springs , small streams , and the Rio Grande River provide plants and animals with precious water .
The Chihuahuan Desert is inhabited by more than 130 species of mammals and contains more than 3,000 plant species ; provides nesting sites and migratory habitats for over 500 bird species ; and harbors 110 native freshwater fish species in its rivers .
Threats to this area include the change of land use , overexploitation and pollution of natural water sources , and climate change .
Oaxaca State is located in the southeast region of the Mexican Pacific and has more than 3.4 million inhabitants .
With 32.5 percent of the population comprised of indigenous peoples , Oaxaca represents 53 percent of the total indigenous population in Mexico .
Oaxaca is among the five highest - ranking areas in the world for endangered species , and it ranks first in the country for its biodiversity with 50 percent of all species in Mexico .
Threats to this area include high marginalization , lack of economic alternatives , agricultural conflicts , agricultural activities , fires , overexploitation and pollution of natural water sources , inadequate forest management and illegal tree felling , unsustainable coastal tourist developments , and climate change .
The Monarch Butterfly Reserve receives millions of migratory Monarch butterflies each fall after they have traveled on a two - month journey of about 2,800 miles from Canada and the United States to Mexico to hibernate for the winter .
They remain in colonies for five months in the Oyamel fir forests of central Mexico .
The main factors affecting these forests are illegal logging , low - tech legal timber harvesting , agriculture , high impact tourism , unsustainable cattle management , and forest fires , overexploitation and pollution of natural water springs , and climate change .

Chiapas State , together with Oaxaca , is Mexico 's most biologically diverse area .
There are 13 protected natural reserves covering 10 percent of the state 's total area .
The biodiverse Lacandon rainforest bordering Guatemala functions as a biological corridor between the two countries .
The Usumacinta River , one of the largest rivers in Mexico , flows through the rainforest .
The forest holds most of Mexico 's tropical trees , 30 percent of the country 's mammal species , 50 percent of bird species and 50 percent of daytime butterflies .
Many are endangered , such as the red macaw , the eagle , the jaguar , the tapir , the spider monkey and saraguato , and the swamp crocodile .
It is home to several indigenous Maya peoples .
Located among the peaks of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Southern Chiapas , El Triunfo became a state park in 1972 and a federal protected area in 1990 .
In 1993 , it was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve .
Threats to these Chiapas treasures include agricultural conflicts , invasive species , forest fires , pollution of rivers and creeks by solid waste and agrochemicals and climate change .
One G.M. dealer said he had already talked with the company about the program and was excited about it .
The dealer , Inder Dosanjh , who owns Dublin Chevrolet outside San Francisco , said listing new cars on eBay would allow his dealership to get in front of customers who were doing most of their car shopping on the Internet .
He said that would include some people who might not have otherwise considered a G.M. car .
For customers , he added , shopping on eBay could take some of the pressure off the negotiation process .
" One of the fears the customer has when they walk in the door is that they are going to pay too much for a car , " Mr. Dosanjh said .
" If they are negotiating a deal on eBay , from their living room , they are in their comfort level . "
Manhattanhenge Twice a Year the City 's Streets Blaze in a Golden Sunset Text & Photos by Allan Weitz
One evening about 8 or 9 years ago I stepped out of the subway on 34th Street and found myself awash in rays of golden sunlight unlike anything I can recall seeing in all of my years of buzzing in and out of the City .
The streets were literally awash in gold light , and every reflective surface in its path glowed likewise .
And within a few minutes the ' event ' was over .
Not having a camera handy , I decided to come back the following evening to take a few photos of this dazzling display .
The next day I showed up at the same time and same place , but despite the clear skies the big show of the previous evening was a no - show .
Baffled , I headed back home .
I later learned I had witnessed an event that occurs only twice a year – usually on May 28th and again on July 12th or 13th – depending on the exact date of the summer solstice , and assuming it 's not raining or cloudy .
Commonly known as the Manhattan Solstice or Manhattanhenge ( a tongue - in - cheek reference to England 's legendary Stonehenge ) , this twice - a- year event marks the occasion of the sun setting in alignment with the 28.9° east - west axis of New York City 's street grid , a system that was put into place back in 1811 .
( Note - A reverse - oriented version of Manhattanhenge occurs at sunrise on December 5th and January 8th , depending on the exact date of the winter solstice . )
In anticipation of this year 's Manhattan solstice we decided to sponsor a photography event open to anyone and everyone .
Being a street event , we decided to have everyone meet on the corner of 34th Street and 5th Avenue at 7:45 on July 12th , which despite the record - breaking rainfall we 've had as of late , turned out to be a gorgeous summer 's eve .
Waiting for the show to begin
And our designated corner was n't the only one buzzing with photographers .
Walking over from Penn Station I saw camera - toting sunset - seekers lurking on every corner .
One photographer managed to have W.33rd Street sealed off from 7th Avenue straight down to the river .
And I could n't help noticing the expressions on the faces of those not clued into the impending event as they stared dumbfounded at the legions of camera - toting lunatics ( solatics ? ) prowling the streets .
Where you are during this event ( which only lasts a few minutes ) determines how the show plays out .
If you 're on the east side of town , the sun slowly comes into view from the west until it literally sits on the double yellow line running down the city 's east - west cross streets .
Anything reflective takes on a golden glow .
And because of the light ricocheting off all of the windows that line the building facades , even shadows fill with a warm glow .
The further east you are , the more dramatic the effect .
For maximum effect you can also view the event from the Brooklyn waterfront , from which point the sun 's rays blast through the streets surrounded by a darkening sky and silhouetted skyscrapers .
If you 're on the west side of town facing east , the show is quite different .
Instead of watching the sun you watch the reflections of the sun that bounce back after making direct hits on every window and reflective surface in it 's path .
Viewed from the New Jersey side of the Hudson River , the city sparkles as if it's on fire .
But regardless of whether you view the event from the east side of town or the west side , it 's an amazing display of light .
Along with Jennifer Diamond and David Brommer ( of B &H Event Space fame ) we spent a good deal of time answering questions such as " What 's the best exposure ? "
" What focal length is best ? " and " When 's it gonna ' happen ? " to name a few .
David got so sidetracked he forgot to shoot pictures with the twin - lens Blackbird he had dangling around his neck .
When the sun finally made its debut from behind the buildings lining the south side of the street it looked like the last scene in ' Close Encounters of the Third Kind ' where everybody freezes in place while staring in wonder at the approaching spacecraft .
The facial expressions of car , bus , and taxi drivers trying to get through all of this chaos was equally entertaining and bravura was on display even by New York standards .
Old ladies were setting up tripods smack - dab in the middle of 34th Street while gesturing to on - coming traffic to get out of her way .
And while buses usually got the right - of - way , cars and taxis were all but laughed - off in their efforts to navigate through the throngs .
And then it was over .
Within a minute or two traffic was back to normal with everybody back on the sidewalk and the glow of the sun was replaced by the glow of hundreds of LCD screens playing back what were surely wonderful pictures .
And a splendid time was had by all .

Alison
Shaw still wakes up some nights convinced she 's back in an Orangeville holding cell , her fingertips covered in black ink .
" To this day , I do n't understand why I was put in handcuffs and put in jail overnight , " says Shaw , 42 .
The Shelburne mother of three is n't all that different from many women .
As her nine - year relationship with her husband Steve unravelled around her last year , Shaw took to " venting " to girlfriends via email , joking with one that she wished she had a gun to put herself out of her misery .
" I even put LOL at the end , " Shaw said in an interview yesterday .
But Shelburne police were n't laughing .
Nor was her estranged husband , who took it as a personal threat .
Unbeknownst to Shaw , he had been monitoring her emails for months .
Shortly after she threatened to leave him back in March 2008 , and take their children with her , he took the emails to Shelburne police – along with a complaint his wife had punched him in the face a month earlier at a Legion dance .
Shaw acknowledged she has a lot of regrets , especially over hitting her ex-husband when " nine years of frustration and anger just got the better of me . "
Her ex could n't be reached for comment , but Shaw was ordered into an anger - management program by the court , which , she says , " has been really helpful . "
Ironically , she claims , the counsellor said she needs to speak her own mind and stand up for herself more .
After her husband saw the reference to a gun in her email , Shaw faced the same wrath that divorcing dads say they 've been subjected to for years at the hands of police and Ontario 's criminal justice system :
Police arrived at her door , slapped her in handcuffs , charged her with assault and held her in jail overnight until her mother arrived to post $ 5,000 bail .
While Shaw would just like to put the whole ugly incident behind her , it 's ignited concerns around Ontario's " zero tolerance " domestic abuse policy .
Over a year ago Ontario Court Justice Bruce Pugsley criticized Shaw 's treatment in a family law decision and expressed frustration at how it's " too commonplace " for the criminal courts to be misused by one spouse – usually it 's the wife , but in this case it was the husband – to gain custody of the kids , possession of the house and an advantage in divorce proceedings .
This week well - respected family law lawyer Phil Epstein , who sat on the committee that drafted Ontario 's so - called " duty to report " directive to police and Crown attorneys back in 1979 , said it 's time to re-examine the domestic abuse policy and create some " limited discretion . "
What happened to Shaw is almost textbook :
She was questioned at the police station , searched for a gun , charged and held overnight .
She was released on bail , on condition she stay away from her house and her computer .
In effect , her ex was given custody of the kids .
It was days until she saw them , for just half an hour , she says , and 10 months until she could step into her own home .
Her mother was allowed to go in , with a list of Shaw 's personal items and clothes that she stuffed into garbage bags .
The bosses at the office where Shaw works were " very understanding " when she returned from her arrest unable to focus .
They let her take two months off .
" I spent that time seeing lawyers , going to court and doing the things I had to do to get back on track . "
Over a year later , Shaw is in a healthy , happy relationship , she says .
Her kids are with her every second week .
While he would n't comment on Shaw 's case , Shelburne police chief Kent Moore acknowledged that domestic abuse cases are among the most difficult for police .
But " zero tolerance " is a bit of a misnomer , he added .
It implies that police lay charges every time they are called , when , in fact , they investigate each case , looking for a reasonable level of proof that abuse occurred .

Every suspect has to be handcuffed while in a cruiser , for the safety of officers , he stressed .
Shaw no longer has a computer .
" My girlfriend has moved to Hamilton now .
We talk from time to time , but not by email .
I do n't talk to anybody on the computer anymore .
I 'm kind of afraid to . "

Insider views from the technology front line - sometimes informative , sometimes scathing .
MONTEREY , California –
As sexy as the Fisker Karma plug - in hybrid looks in pictures , it 's better in person – and better still at speed .
The super - luxe EV made its public driving debut Saturday during the Rolex Monterey Historic Automobile Races .
It lapped Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca at about 100 mph , and it was wild seeing a car move that fast without making a sound .
The lap of the historic track came just 19 months after designer and company CEO Henrik Fisker unveiled the car at the Detroit auto show .
" Fisker Automotive is only 19 months old , and we 're already as far along with the Karma as General Motors is with the Volt , " company spokesman Rusell Datz told Wired.com moments before COO Bernhard Koehler took to the track ahead of a pack of vintage Porsche 908s and 917s .
The Karma is a lot like the Chevrolet Volt , and it uses the same basic technology as the Volt .
Fisker just wraps it in much sexier bodywork .
A 22 - kilowatt - hour lithium - manganese Enerdel battery provides power to a pair of electric motors that deliver a total of 403 horsepower – and a stunning 959 pound - feet of torque – to the rear wheels .
Fisker claims the car has a range of 50 miles on electric power .
As the battery winds down , a 2.0 - liter turbocharged direct - injection GM Ecotec engine will power a 175 - kilowatt generator to keep the electric motors turning .
The company says the car will deliver 100 mpg in combined city and highway driving .
Saturday 's lap of the track marked the first time it 's moved under its own power in public .
Koehler had hoped to take at least two laps , but the schedule got so backed up that track officials only let him make one trip around the track .
Company CEO
Henrik
Fisker would n't let us take the Karma for a spin , but we did get to look under the hood and spend some time in the car .
As you 'd expect for a car with a list price of $ 87,900 , fit and finish are top - notch and interior appointments are excellent .
The car we saw is one of 12 prototypes , but it looked and felt like something you 'd see on a showroom floor .
" That car is 99 percent of what you 'll see rolling off the line in May .
The big difference is that car is handbuilt , " Fisker told us , referring to the Karma parked near Turn 5 of Laguna Seca .
" But everything is there . "
The Karma is roughly the same length and width as a BMW 7 - Series , but it 's only as tall as a Porsche 911 .
That low stance makes the car look much bigger than it actually is .
Although the Karma bears some resemblance to the Maserati Quattroporte , it is utterly distinctive .
Nothing we saw on the grounds of Laguna Seca or the streets of Carmel – where it was n't unusual to see , say , a Ferrari 250 GT alongside a McLaren SLR – looked anything like the Karma .
" I wanted to design something that is timeless , " said Fisker , whose designs include the BMW Z8 and Aston Martin DB9 .
" If I designed another 7 - Series , no one would buy it .
I had to do something radical . "
Hence the sweeping beltline , 22 - inch wheels , aggressive shoulders and short overhangs at the front and back of the car .
Fisker talks a lot about the car 's " stance " and " proportion , " a theme interior designer Alexander Klatt echoed when describing the interior , which is no less impressive .
It 's got acres of leather – a PETA - friendly " Eco- Chic " version will be available for $ 104,000 – and wood trim with glass accents .
The switches are metal , as is the shifter and the trim around the 10.5 - inch touch - screen navi and climate control system .
The dashboard follows the curves of the hood , which flow through the passenger compartment .
Klatt says he was inspired by the symmetry of the human body , the 3 - by - 4 " golden ratio " and Bauhaus design .
" We wanted to create a timeless design , something with beautiful proportions , " he said .
As radical as the styling of the Karma is , it 's nothing compared to the ambitious goal Fisker has set for the company that bears his name and the mid-sized sedan he 's got planned .
We 'll tell you more about that tomorrow , and give you a lot more pics , too .

Lord Turner 's championing today of a levy on financial dealings to curb the power of the City marks a breakthrough in the long struggle to have the neglected brainchild of American economist James Tobin become a practical policy proposition .
As they sift through the wreckage caused by the biggest crisis the global banking system has ever endured , policymakers are no longer prepared to dismiss a " Tobin tax " as impractical , pointless or plain wrong .
The struggle to get a hearing has , however , been a hard one .
Towards the end of his long life , Tobin noted that during the neoliberal ascendancy following the oil shock of the mid-1970s , his idea had tended to fall on deaf ears .
" It did not make much of a ripple .
In fact , one could say that it sunk like a rock .
The community of professional economists simply ignored it . "
This was written in 1995 , just as the first cracks were starting to show in the shiny new system of global finance ushered in by deregulation , the collapse of communism and the spread of market economies .
But neither the Mexican peso crisis of that year nor the Asian financial meltdown two years in the future would change the generally held view that Tobin was harking back to an age of Keynesian economics that had disappeared for ever .
Tobin , who was born in 1918 and died in 2002 , outlined his proposal in 1972 , just after the break - up of the Bretton Woods fixed - exchange - rate system .
The idea was simple : there should be a tax on foreign currency transactions that would allow national governments to stop their economies being at the mercy of speculators .
" My main objectives for the tax are two " , he said in the foreword to a 1995 book .
" The first is to make exchange rates reflect to a larger degree long - term fundamentals relative to short - range expectations and risk .
My second objective is to preserve and promote autonomy of national macroeconomic and monetary policies . "
Those operating in financial markets , predictably enough , hated the idea .
But so did central bankers .
Tobin recalls that when quizzed about the idea of a transactions levy , the then chief economist at the Bundesbank , Otmar Issing , replied : " Oh that again .
It 's the Loch Ness monster popping up once more . "
The next time Tobin bumped into Issing , he said cheerfully : " Here I am , the Loch Ness monster still ! "
Nor was the idea of a tax universally supported by the remaining disciples of Keynes , many of whom doubted that a levy of between 0.1 % and 0.25 % on foreign exchange deals would really " throw sand in the wheels of global finance " .
Tobin himself identified many of the main criticisms of his idea .
At root , it was opposed by those economists who frowned on any interference in the working of free markets – the majority in the 1970s and 1980s .
More specifically , opponents said it would drive financial business offshore , or that it would not prevent currencies from being overvalued , or being at the mercy of speculators .
As time wore on , the idea made a comeback when it was seen as a way of raising money for multilateral projects .
The French president , François Mitterrand , was one of the first world leaders to see the money - raising potential of a Tobin tax back in the early 1990s .
More recently , development campaigners have suggested a tax levied at .005 % would raise between $ 30bn and $ 60bn ( between £ 18bn and £ 35 bn ) a year – enough for the G7 countries to meet their commitment at the Gleneagles summit in 2005 to double global aid .
Interestingly , Tobin himself never envisaged this as being its principal purpose .
Like Lord Turner in today 's article in Prospect magazine , he thought a tax on finance would lead to greater economic stability .
" Most disappointing and surprising , critics seemed to miss what I regarded as the essential property of the transactions – the beauty part – that this simple one - parameter tax would automatically penalise short - horizon round trips , while negligibly affecting commodity trade and long - term capital investments , " Tobin said .
The scale of the crisis has brought Tobin out of the shadows .
Indeed ,
Turner appears to be considering throwing the net wider than simply a tax on foreign exchange dealings .
" If you want to stop excessive pay in a swollen financial sector you have to reduce the size of that sector or apply special taxes to its pre-remuneration profit , " he writes .
The first line of attack for the authorities will be higher capital requirements to prevent financial institutions from speculating so wildly during booms .
But Turner adds : " If increased capital requirements are insufficient I am happy to consider taxes on financial transactions – Tobin taxes .
Such taxes have long been the dream of the development economists and those who care about climate change – a nice sensible revenue source for funding global public goods . "
While not seeking to minimise the difficulties involved in getting universal support for a Tobin tax , Turner is one of the first policymakers to suggest that the effort might be worth it .
" The problem is that getting global agreement will be very difficult .
But at least proposals for special financial sector taxes , with increased capital requirements , address the issue of excessive profits and therefore have a chance of doing something about it .
Insisting that someone ' does something ' about bonuses , by contrast , is a populist diversion . "
Tobin believed that some of the practical objections to his tax were overblown .
He argued that the threat of business being relocated offshore could be prevented by imposing a penalty rate on transfers to tax havens , or to levy the Tobin tax where the transaction occurred .
Turner says that the sheer scale of the crisis means nothing should be ruled out .
" What has occurred has imposed huge economic harm throughout the world and so we really do have to work out how to stop it happening again in five or ten years ' time , " he said in today 's interview .
" And that requires a very major reconstruct of the global financial system . "
Charity amid the crisis
But not everyone is waiting for regulators to start taxing City profits .
Today , Ethical Currency will become the first foreign exchange broker in the world to voluntarily ringfence 0.005 % of all its transactions into a single pot that will go to the Global Fund , set up to fight Aids , tuberculosis and malaria .
Founded by foreign exchange trader Alastair Constance , Ethical Currency has been warmly received by campaigners .
The timing of its launch , they say , comes as the financial crisis is having an adverse effect on poor nations .
Oxfam estimates the number of people facing chronic hunger will rise to 1 billion .
And the Global Fund , which buys life - saving drugs and distributes them to poor countries , is facing severe shortfalls in funding .
" As funding for international development becomes more scarce , we need to be creative about finding new and sustainable sources of income , " said Ethical Trading 's Constance .
" We have chosen to base our model on the Currency Transaction Levy ( CTL ) with the specific aim of getting governments and international business to commit to widespread implementation and the delivery of the Millennium Development Goals .
If we can prove that a single business can flourish then the case for implementing a CTL increases .
If consumers vote with their business then they will prove the commercial case and force a structural change in the global financial architecture . "
Constance believes a currency transaction levy ( CTL ) would be easy to replicate , as forex transactions are electronic .
He envisages the city and Wall Street " fighting tooth and nail " against it – but over time , he argues , the tax would be barely noticed .
Campaigners say that by introducing the levy on major currencies as they are traded , the ability to dodge the tax would be closed .
Ethical Currency is targeting charities and social enterprises who buy foreign currencies on a regular basis .
It is confident it can give them a better deal than mainstream banks with the added bonus that banking with them will see money going to a good cause .
Photo manipulation is an ever evolving collaboration between photography and graphic design .
Combining certain elements to create a unique image , that can convince even the most experienced set of eyes , requires a very creative set of skills .
Because the manipulation of a photo gives a realistic view of an unreal picture , you should have an open mind when gathering ideas on how to get creative with your images .
Photo manipulations are a great source for inspiration , generally because designers are able to express their creativity through various aspects of design .
Several of the following images contain illustrative elements , while others display a more realistic approach .
So here are 40 of the most incredible examples of photo manipulation .
Which ones are your favorites ?

A glitch caused NASA ’s water - hunting LCROSS mission to lose more than half its fuel , but the spacecraft is still on track to collide with the moon ( Illustration : NASA )
NASA ’s moon - colliding probe LCROSS lost more than half its propellant late last week after a glitch caused it to repeatedly fire its thrusters to try to orient itself .
But the spacecraft is still on track to complete its mission to slam into the moon ’s south pole in October .
The Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) took off on 18 June and has been orbiting the Earth at about the moon ’s distance in preparation for a lunar collision on 9 October .
NASA hopes the impact will excavate material from one of the moon ’s permanently shadowed craters , which could be rich in water that could supply future lunar outposts .
Mission managers made contact with the spacecraft on Saturday to conduct a ‘ cold - side bake ’ .
This manoeuvre flips the spacecraft to allow the sun to heat up and vaporise any residual water on the 2400 - kilogram upper stage of LCROSS ’s launch rocket , which will be sent crashing into the moon four minutes before the LCROSS spacecraft itself .
When the team made contact with the spacecraft , they discovered it had lost 140 kg of hydrazine propellant in the 20 previous hours , when the spacecraft was not in contact with Earth .
The spacecraft ’s tank originally held 306 kg of fuel ; 50 kg remain .
Advertisement
“ It was pretty apparent that the thrusters had been firing for quite a bit , ” says LCROSS project manager Daniel Andrews of NASA ’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California .
Noisy data
The fuel was lost after a fault in one of the spacecraft ’s data lines caused a change in the probe ’s control system .
It switched from the craft ’s Inertial Reference Unit ( IRU ) , which uses spinning gyroscopes used to gauge the spacecraft ’s orientation , to a less precise star tracker , which orients the probe by observing the position of stars .
The spacecraft made an effort keep up with these noisier star tracker data , causing it to rapidly burn through fuel to keep up with the heavily fluctuating numbers .
The switch was triggered by a change in an indicator used to monitor the health of the IRU .
The fault , which lasted just one second , may have been a passing glitch .
But mission operators have not been able to eliminate the possibility that there is a problem with the IRU .
” We ’re not 100 per cent convinced that it is n’t a sign the IRU is about to fail , ” Andrews says .
If the unit does fail , LCROSS can fall back on the star tracker for orientation information .
The team is working on re-tuning the spacecraft so it does not respond as attentively to information from the unit .
The spacecraft has also been reprogrammed to switch from the IRU to the star tracker only if problematic signals last for at least five seconds , a change that should cut down on LCROSS ’s sensitivity to fleeting glitches .
Extra fuel
Despite the heavy fuel loss , LCROSS is still on track to conduct its water ice search .
“ It turns out we did n’t need anywhere near that 300 [ kilograms ] to complete the mission .
We just filled it up in case we had a bad day , ” Andrews told New Scientist .
LCROSS still has more fuel than the mission requires – about 10 to 20 kg extra , Andrews says .
The exact cushion depends on how many other activities , such as turns to look at Earth , LCROSS will conduct before the collision .
Because the spacecraft is already on a ballistic trajectory to the moon , it should still be able to intersect the moon without using up any additional propellant .
The remaining fuel is needed to trim the spacecraft ’s trajectory so that it hits the surface at the right place .
The team is expected to announce LCROSS ’s target crater about a month before impact .
Observation :
Co-routines are to state machines what recursion is to stacks
When you have to traverse some sort of a nested data structure ( say , a binary tree ) , one approach is to create a stack that remembers where in the tree you are .
Another , much more elegant approach , is to write the function recursively .
A recursive function employs the machine stack used to implicitly implement function calls - you get the benefits of the stack without paying the cost of reduced readability .
In this article I 'll try to show , using a simple , yet very realistic example why co-routines do the same to state machines .
The problem - serial framing I 've written a detailed article about framing earlier this month .
The simple summary is : we have an endless incoming stream of bytes , from which we need to deduce structured data frames .
That is , we have to find where a frame starts , where it ends and what is the data it carries .
For this purpose we use a special header value , footer value and an escape byte ( DLE ) .
A complete Python implementation is described here , but in this article I will present the solution in a simplified manner , keeping all irrelevant details out .
The state machine Given a stream and receiving one byte at a time , here is the state machine that describes the framing process :
Only inputs and state transitions are shown .
The framing process outputs complete frames when moving from the IN_MSG state to the WAIT_HEADER stage ( this happens when a footer is received )
Implementing the state machine Here 's an implementation of this state machine in Python .
The internal state is kept in an object : class ProtocolWrapper ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , header= ' \x61 ' , footer= ' \x62 ' , dle= ' \xAB ' , after_dle_func= lambda x : x ) : self . header = header self . footer = footer self .dle = dle self .
after_dle_func = after_dle_func self . state = self .
WAIT_HEADER self . frame = '' # internal state ( WAIT_HEADER , IN_MSG , AFTER_DLE ) = range ( 3 ) def input ( self , byte ) : " " " Receive a byte .
If this byte completes a frame , the frame is returned .
Otherwise , None is returned . " " " if self . state == self .
WAIT_HEADER : if byte == self . header : self . state = self .IN_MSG self . frame = '' return
None elif self . state == self .IN_MSG : if byte == self . footer : self . state = self .
WAIT_HEADER return self . frame elif byte == self .dle : self . state = self .
AFTER_DLE else : self . frame += byte return
None elif self . state == self .
AFTER_DLE : self . frame += self .after_dle_func( byte ) self . state = self .IN_MSG return None else : raise AssertionError ( )
Note that the code of the input method closely follows the state diagram .
This is how implementations of state machines are - it 's generally difficult to understand what 's going on in the code without having some sort of a state diagram in front of your eyes .
In this case the state machine has just 3 states , but it can be easily 20 for more complex needs .
Understanding such a state function with 20 states is impossible without a diagram .
Anyhow , here 's some test code that simulates a stream of data with a couple of frames and invalid data in between : bytes = '' . join ( chr ( b ) for b in [ 0 x70 , 0 x24 , 0 x61 , 0 x99 , 0 xAF , 0 xD1 , 0 x62 , 0 x56 , 0 x62 , 0 x61 , 0 xAB , 0 xAB , 0 x14 , 0 x62 , 0 x7 ] ) pw = ProtocolWrapper ( ) for byte in bytes : frame = pw.input ( byte ) if frame : print ' Got frame : ' , frame.encode ( ' hex ' )
This prints :
Got frame : 99afd1
Got frame : ab14
Co-routines I do n't intend to teach the theory behind co-routines here , and I 'll assume at least a basic familiarity with the concept .
My goal is to show a real - life , relevant example that demonstrates how co-routines relate to state machines .
This link is a good tutorial on co-routines ( in C , of all languages ) , and there 's of course Wikipedia and C2 .
But the absolutely best tutorial , with focus on Python , is David Beazley 's presentation from this year 's PyCon : A curious course on coroutines and concurrency .
It is while reading this tutorial that the connection finally ' clicked ' in my head .
It is most highly recommended .
If there 's one description of co-routines you should remember while reading this article and later , it is that co-routines save the control state of a function between calls .
Kinda like recursion - you know exactly where are you going to return after a function call .
When you call a co-routine , it does n't start all over from the beginning .
Rather , it starts from right after where it returned ( yielded control ) the previous time it was called .
This also explains why co-routines can replace state machines .
The input method of ProtocolWrapper is invoked multiple times .
Since it 's a " normal " function , it begins running from its first line for each invocation .
This is why it needs to keep a state machine - to know it 's current " place in the world " when the next byte is received .
With co-routines this is n't necessary - co-routines start exactly where they stopped the previous time they were called - so no state keeping is required !
Using co-routines for framing Without further ado , here is the co-routine implementation of the framing problem : @coroutine def unwrap_protocol ( header= ' \x61 ' , footer= ' \x62 ' , dle= ' \xAB ' , after_dle_func= lambda x : x , target= None ) : " " " Simplified framing ( protocol unwrapping ) co-routine . " " " # Outer loop looking for a frame header # while True : byte = ( yield ) frame = '' if byte == header : # Capture the full frame # while True : byte = ( yield ) if byte == footer : target.send ( frame ) break elif byte == dle : byte = ( yield ) frame += after_dle_func( byte ) else : frame += byte Look how simple and elegant it is .
You can tell immediately what it does just by looking at the source code - no state diagrams are needed .
We loop over frames .
A frame starts with a header byte .
After a header byte has been received , we accumulate the bytes of the frame until a footer is encountered .
The ( yield ) calls is where the magic is .
The function suspends at these points until it is called again .
Then , the value passed in the new call is returned from ( yield ) and the co-routine proceeds from the same place .
Note how the state machine is implicitly embedded in this code .
It 's there , but you do n't see it - it 's hiding in the control structures ( the IFs , ELSEs and the WHILEs ) of the function .
When a complete frame is received , it is sent to the target of the co-routine , which may process it at will .
After executing send , the co-routine breaks out of the inner loop and suspends waiting for a new header in the outer loop .
The @coroutine decorator is a simple utility required for Python co-routines : def coroutine ( func ) : def start ( * args , ** kwargs ) : cr = func ( * args , ** kwargs ) cr.next ( ) return cr return start
This is needed to bring a co-routine to its first yield and suspend there .
You can just use this decorator without worrying about the details , until you become more comfortable with the concept to understand the exact inner workings described in PEP 342 .
To test this co-routine implementation we also need a simple " sink " co-routine ( using Dave Beazley 's terminology from his presentation ) .
This will be the receiver of the send calls made by our co-routine : @coroutine def frame_receiver ( ) : " " " A simple co-routine " sink " for receiving full frames . " " " while True : frame = ( yield ) print ' Got frame : ' , frame.encode ( ' hex ' ) bytes = '' . join ( chr ( b ) for b in [ 0 x70 , 0 x24 , 0 x61 , 0 x99 , 0 xAF , 0 xD1 , 0 x62 , 0 x56 , 0 x62 , 0 x61 , 0 xAB , 0 xAB , 0 x14 , 0 x62 , 0 x7 ] ) unwrapper = unwrap_protocol ( target=frame_receiver( ) ) for byte in bytes : unwrapper.send ( byte )

Sources are saying that Sarah Palin ’s sudden resignation as Alaska Governor is actually damage control because a major embezzlement scandal is about to erupt involving construction projects in her home town of Wasilla , Alaska .
Multiple sources have been digging around in the wake of Sarah Palin ’s cryptic resignation speech Friday and they ’ve found that when Palin was Mayor of her home town of Wasilla , AK in 2002 , she was influental in the construction of the Wasilla Sports Complex and hockey arena .
First of all , the $ 12 mil + project ended up in the hands of contractors who were friends of friends of Palin .
Secondly , at around the same time the sports complex was being built , so was Palin ’s new house .
What ’s interesting about that is the house is constructed from the exact same materials the sports complex was built with .
The windows in both structures are the same , the wood is the same , pretty well everything .
When the house was being built , Palin , being Mayor at the time , influenced the bylaw requiring building permits in the town so that now there is no official list of the contractors who worked on her house .
The information is coming from local Alaskans who have been watching Palin and collecting information for some time .
The reason it has n’t been made public yet is because they have been told by federal investigators to keep their mouths shut so a subsequent media frenzy does n’t impede the investigation .
It is plausable that the suddenness of Palin ’s resignation , which even members of her family did n’t know was going to happen , could be the reason for her rather strange resignation speech – she simply did n’t have time to construct an elaborate speech because she already knew this mess was about to go public in a big way .
Other blogs have already dubbed this as the “ Iceberg Scandal ” and “ Iceberg Gate ” but it ’s safe to say that we ’ll be getting some extremely controversial Sarah Palin news in the near future .
You see Barack Obama 's totally real Kenyan birth certificate that is not photoshopped and completely believable unlike those phony Hawaiian documents ?
I mean , if there 's one country that you know wo n't scam you , it 's Kenya !
Yet some people persist in casting suspicious glances at the document .
User CatM in the comments :
First , the hospital is Coast Provincial General Hospital ( sometimes said to be Coast Province General Hospital ) , not Coast General Hospital .
Second , Kenya was a Dominion the date this certificate was allegedly issued and would not become a republic for 8 months .
Third , Mombasa belonged to Zanzibar when Obama was born , not Kenya .
Fourth , Obama 's father 's village would be nearer to Nairobi , not Mombasa .
Fifth , the number 47O44-- 47 is Obama 's age when he became president , followed by the letter O ( not a zero ) followed by 44 -- he is the 44th president .
Sixth , EF Lavender is a laundry detergent .
Seventh , would a nation with a large number of Muslims actually say " Christian name " ( as opposed to name ) on the birth certificate ?
Eigth , his father ( born in 1961 ) would have been 24 or 25 when he was born and not 26 .
Ninth , it was called the " Central Nyanza District , " not Nyanza Province .
The regions were changed to provinces in 1970 .
Old Redneck in a recommended diary ( omitting duplicates from above ) :
The document is dated 5 August 1964 -- a Saturday .
From what I can find , Kenyan guvmint offices close early on Friday and are closed on Saturdays .
Oooops [...]
This piece of paper certainly looks nice and new to be 45 years old -- unless the Kenyans were using acid - free paper back in 1964 .
Heh , heh .
Finally , Officials of Coast Province General Hospital reported : “ We do not have computerized records going back to the 1960 ’s and can only sort through our archives by hand , ” Dr. Christopher Mwanga , an administrator at the Mombasa hospital tells GLOBE .
“ We have searched for all the names of babies born on Aug. 4 , 1961 , and have not found the name of Barack Hussein Obama .
That is all I can tell you . ”
Dr. Mwanga is clearly in on the scam .
In all seriousness , some of these bullet points may turn out to be misfires .
But the totality of the evidence -- gathered lightning fast , I may add -- suggests that this is a forgery .
And not just any forgery , but one good enough to take in the idiot birthers , while poor enough to let everyone else in on the joke .
In other words , the Birthers just got played , in a hilariously overt way .

Randy and Ronnell Vorick thought La Habra was about as far away as one could get from terrorism .
They were wrong .
For the last 2 1/ 2 weeks , the lives of the couple and their three children have been plunged into an unsettling routine of drivers shouting profanities , stopping to photograph their house and -- most recently -- spray - painting a slogan on their property .

Grocery store owner --
An article in Thursday ’s California section reported on statements made by John Loftus , a commentator for Fox News , describing grocery store owner Iyad K. Hilal as a terrorist .
Although the article accurately quoted Loftus ’ expression of his opinion , The Times wants to make clear that Hilal has not been charged with any illegal activity and The Times is not aware of any law enforcement agency or official that has identified Hilal as a terrorist .
In addition , a previous story on Hilal , which ran in some editions of the California section on Wednesday , said that Omar Bakri Mohammed , a Muslim cleric formerly based in London , had identified Hilal last year in an interview in a newsletter as “ leader of the U.S. branch ” of an organization known as Hizb ut - Tahrir .
Mohammed ’s interview actually identified a man named Iyad Hilal as the leader of a splinter group of Hizb ut - Tahrir that includes only “ a few individuals . ”
The Times regrets any confusion that may have resulted from these articles .
Their house , a suburban fixer - upper the Voricks bought three years ago , was wrongly identified in a cable news broadcast as the home of a terrorist .
“ I ’m scared to go to work and leave my kids home .
I call them every 30 minutes to make sure they ’re OK , ” Randy Vorick said .

“ I keep telling myself this ca n’t be happening to me .
This ca n’t be happening to my family .
But it is .
I want our lives to be normal again , ” he said .
In what Fox News officials concede was a mistake , John Loftus , a former U.S. prosecutor , gave out the address Aug. 7 , saying it was the home of a Middle Eastern man , Iyad K. Hilal , who was the leader of a terrorist group with ties to those responsible for the July 7 bombings in London .
Hilal , whom Loftus identified by name during the broadcast , moved out of the house about three years ago .
But the consequences were immediate for the Voricks .
Satellite photos of the house and directions to the residence were posted online .
The Voricks told police , who arranged for the content to be taken down .
Someone even removed the street sign where the Voricks live to provide some protection .

Still , it has not been easy .
A driver yelled a profanity at the family and called them terrorists as they barbecued on their patio Aug. 14 .
Some drivers have stopped and photographed the house , Randy Vorick said .
Last weekend , someone spray - painted “ Terrist ” on their home .
Police , who have regularly patrolled their house since the day after the broadcast , now station a squad car across the street .
Randy , a restaurant manager , and Ronnell , a manager at a staffing agency , have been married 19 years and met as teenagers when they worked at a local McDonald’s .

They grew up in La Habra and bought the house three years ago after Hilal moved out so they could be close to Ronnell Vorick ’s parents .
La Habra Police Capt .
John
Rees said the department was “ giving special attention to the family to make sure they ’re safe , ” but declined to elaborate .
“ This thing broke on a Sunday , when we started receiving inquiries from the public about terrorists , ” he said .
The Voricks said they had made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Fox News and Loftus by telephone and e-mail .
They want a public apology and correction .

Both have issued apologies --
Fox in a one - line statement to the Los Angeles Times and Loftus in an e-mail to the family -- after being contacted by the newspaper .
The Voricks say they have yet to see or hear a correction .
“ John Loftus has been reprimanded for his careless error , and we sincerely apologize to the family , ” said Fox spokeswoman Irena Brigante .
Loftus also apologized and told The Times last week that “ mistakes happen . ”
“ I ’m terribly sorry about that .
I had no idea .
That was the best information we had at the time , ” he said .

Loftus said he gave out the address to help local police , and insisted that Hilal , a Garden Grove grocery store owner , was a terrorist .
“ I thought it might help police in that area now that we have positively identified a terrorist living in [ Orange County ] , ” he said .
Cathy Viray , an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles , said agents were looking into Loftus ’ terrorist allegations but stopped short of calling it an investigation .
The Voricks ’ nightmare began Aug. 7 when they were returning from SeaWorld in San Diego with their daughters , 17 and 5 , and son , 14 .

“ I was driving home and my neighbor called saying that some guy on Fox said a terrorist lives at my house and gave out the address , ” Randy Vorick said .
The next day , the couple left for a four - day cruise to Santa Catalina Island and Ensenada , leaving their children in the care of a house - sitter and Randy Vorick ’s brother , all unaware of the growing fallout from Fox ’s report .
When they returned Aug. 12 , Randy Vorick said he had received several e-mails and messages on his cellphone from friends who told him that Loftus had been interviewed on KFI - AM ( 640 ) radio and repeated his allegation about a terrorist living in La Habra .
The radio station did not broadcast his address .
In addition , the house - sitter said police had stopped by Aug. 8 to check on their safety and were keeping an eye on the house .
Randy Vorick said he had e-mailed Fox and Loftus , asking for a public retraction and apology .
Advertisement
He said the apologies that came were too little , too late .
On Monday night , the day after someone spray - painted their house , the Voricks were up all night looking at the street and the cars that drove by .
“ I just want a good night ’s sleep , ” Randy Vorick said .
“ I do n’t know when I ’m going to have it . ”

An important property of a good test suite is that it runs fast , the faster the better .
But over time , as tests accumulate , the test suite will take longer to complete .
A countermeasure would be to run tests in parallel , maybe even on several systems ( after all , tests should not have any interdependencies ) .
This is were Devver comes into play : Devver ( pronounced like " developer " ) will run your tests on their cloud in parallel .
For example , the CruiseControl.rb 's integration test suite runs in just 17 seconds , compared to the 59 seconds a test run needed on their local machine .
Devver comes in the form of a gem you install and a Rakefile for your project that contains the new tasks , like rake devver : test to run all unit , functional , and integration tests on their infrastructure .
InfoQ talked to Benjamin Brinckerhoff from the Devver team to learn how exactly they can speed up your tests :
We partition the tests and then distribute the tests among many machines .
Each machine has a full copy of the test environment , including the test database and gems .
But what happens when a user needs an additional gem to run the tests ?
That 's no problem .
Since most of our users have Rails projects , by default we run ' rake gems : install ' to install the required gems ( each user has their own separate set of gems ) .
If that does n't work for any reason , a user can configure the step that installs gems .
So , for instance , a user could run ' geminstaller ' instead .
Running the tests faster is certainly very helpful , but what about running them with different versions of Ruby in parallel ?
Our current version does not yet support multiple versions of Ruby , but it is a feature we 're planning on supporting in the future , especially if we hear a lot of demand for it .
Devver is currently in a beta and during this time free of charge .
Afterwards , they " plan to offer Devver free of charge for open source projects but will charge closed source projects a monthly fee " .

Renault allowed to race at Valencia
F1 Grand Prix , GP Europe , Valencia Street Circuit
The FIA Court of Appeal have allowed the appeal filed by Renault after the stewards at the Hungarian Grand Prix had imposed a one - race ban on the team .
They claimed the team released Alonso , knowing that a wheel was not fastened securely .
On 26 July 2009 , the Stewards of the Meeting suspended the competitor ING Renault F1 Team from the next event in the 2009 Formula One World Championship ( namely , the Grand Prix of Europe to be held in Valencia ) for the following reasons :
- Renault knowingly released car N°7 ( driver Fernando Alonso ) from the pit stop position without one of the retaining devices for the wheel - nuts being securely in position ;
- Being aware of this , Renault failed to take any action to prevent the car from leaving the pit-lane ;
- Renault failed to inform the driver of this problem or to advise him to take appropriate action given the circumstances ;
- This resulted in a car part detaching at turn 5 and the wheel itself detaching at turn 9 .
The FFSA appealed the Stewards ’ decision on behalf of Renault .
Decision
Renault admitted to the Court that it breached the Sporting Regulations , in that it failed to ensure that car no .
7 complied with the conditions for safety throughout practice and the race , and that it released the car after a pit stop when it was unsafe to do so .
However , it requested the Court to reconsider the severity of the sanction imposed by the Stewards .
Having heard the arguments of the parties , the Court has decided as follows :
1. to allow the appeal and overturn the sanction imposed by the Stewards in the Contested Decision ;
2. to issue a reprimand and impose a fine of $ 50,000 upon Renault .
The FIA also stated that the reasons for this decision will be published in a full judgment in the coming days .
Do you have any idea where you head when you 'd like to sue everyone on the face of the planet , make yourself look like a Class - A fool and get a mention right here ?
The Eastern District of Texas ( Tyler ) District court , that 's where .
The freshest meshuggeneh to head on down there and start trouble is Tsera , who 's claiming that Apple , Microsoft , LG , Philips , Bang & Olufsen , iriver , Coby , Cowon and even Meizu are violating a patent that it owns .
Said patent is titled " Methods and apparatus for controlling a portable electronic device using a touchpad , " and evidently each of the aforesaid outfits have failed to pay Tsera for using its technology .
Before you get all bent out of shape , you should realize that this case -- in all likelihood -- will simply be tossed out or settled away from the courtroom , but you can bet your bottom dollar that Tsera 's never gonna be satisfied .
Or taken seriously .

The pilot took drastic action after realising help was a long way away A helicopter pilot in Australia became so excited when he spotted a crocodile that he flew in for a closer look - and crashed into mudflats .
He suffered minor injuries , but his passenger was seriously hurt in the crash near the northern city of Darwin .
Concerned that his friend could get hypothermia , the pilot buried him in sand before raising the alarm .
Medical officials said doctors thought the man was dead - until they saw his head moving in the sand .
Air ambulance operator Careflight said in a statement that the pilot had been flying along the Dundee Beach , 60 km ( 37 miles ) from Darwin , when he tried to turn to look at a crocodile .
" The pilot said after starting the turn the next thing he remembered was being upside down in the mud , " the statement said .
" The pilot dragged his passenger to the safety of the shore , away from crocodiles , then buried the man in the sand up to his neck in an attempt to prevent his companion from developing hypothermia . "
The pilot then used his satellite phone to alert emergency services .
Ian Badham , director of Careflight , said the case was " bizarre " .
" A doctor thought initially the passenger was dead as he was buried in sand , " Mr Badham said .
" It turned out that the pilot had realised it might take rescue services until daylight to actually get there . "
Mr Badham said the passenger was being treated in hospital for head , chest and arm injuries .

While most in the US were celebrating the 4th of July , a Russian immigrant living in New Jersey was being held on federal charges of stealing top - secret computer trading codes from a major New York - based financial institution — that sources say is none other than Goldman Sachs .
The allegations , if true , are big news because the codes the accused man , Sergey Aleynikov , tried to steal is the secret code to unlocking Goldman ’s automated stocks and commodities trading businesses .
Federal authorities allege the computer codes and related - trading files that Aleynikov uploaded to a German - based website help this major “ financial institution ” generate millions of dollars in profits each year .
The platform is one of the things that apparently gives Goldman a leg - up over the competition when it comes to rapid - fire trading of stocks and commodities .
Federal authorities say the platform quickly processes rapid developments in the markets and uses top secret mathematical formulas to allow the firm to make highly - profitable automated trades .
The criminal case has the potential to shed a light on the inner workings of an important profit center for Goldman and other Wall Street firms .
The federal charges also raise serious questions about the safeguards Wall Street firms deploy to protect their proprietary trading systems .
The Federal Bureau of Investigations , in charging Aleynikov , says he began working for the major financial institution in May 2007 as a computer programmer and left in early June .
That would appear to match the description of a man named Serge Aleynikov , as it is listed on the social networking website LinkedIn .
The bio information for Aleynikov on Linked In says he joined Goldman in May 2007 and was vice president for equity strategy .
The bio says he was responsible for “ development of a distributed real - time co-located high - frequency trading platform . ”
In his own words , he goes on to describe the platform as “ a very low latency ( microseconds ) event - driven market data processing , strategy and order submission engine . ”
The case against Aleynikov may explain why the New York Stock Exchange moved quickly in the past week to alter its methodology for reporting program stock trading .
Goldman often was at the top of the chart–far ahead of its competitors .
If you ’re going to rely on the latest and greatest in silicon - based technology to get an edge on the competition , you had better do a leading edge job at security , human resources , checking back on whoever you hired to get that edge – and the folks you trust to do the checking .
Looks like someone was snovered at Goldman - Sachs .

To Stop Snoring , You Must Understand Why You Start Storing .
If a “ chainsaw in a tub of jello ” noise has been keeping you up at night , the chances are that you are just screaming that you want to stop snoring now .
Or maybe it ’s someone in the bed with you that has the problem .
Either way , how can this be done ?
Do stop snoring devices that you see advertised work ?
Is surgery your only option to get you to stop snoring ?
Listen to Your Doctor
If your doctor has told you that you absolutely must have surgery , then you should listen to him or her .
But for many , there are other options to help them to stop snoring long before it ’s necessary even to visit a doctor .
And yes , some of those devices you see advertised do seem to work well , for some people that are .
Understanding Why You Snore
The real key to getting you to stop snoring is to understand why it happens in the first place .
For many people , they simply sleep in a position that causes their head to fall back and their mouth to fall open .
When they breathe through their mouth , their throat gets dry , and they begin to make the sound we call snoring .
In this case , the best way to stop snoring is to keep the head from falling back .
This might mean a so - called snore pillow which cradles your head and neck and keeps it in proper alignment .
You might also consider piling some pillows under one side of you so that you ca n’t roll over on your back and will be forced to sleep on your side or stomach .
Others cannot stop snoring because their nasal passages are constantly clogged so no matter what position they ’re in they ’re going to start breathing through their mouth when they sleep .
If this is you why are your sinuses clogged ?
If you have chronic sinus problems , you should probably see a doctor for asthma , allergies , collapsing nasal passages or any other problem causing your sinuses to clog .
You ca n’t stop snoring if you ca n’t breathe properly and you ca n’t breathe properly if you do n’t unclog your nose .
It may not be as easy for someone with a medical condition or concern to unclog their nasal passages as it is for others .
If you just have a cold or it ’s very dry in your home , a bit of eucalyptus or menthol rub might do the trick or a mentholated cough drop before you go to bed may be sufficient ( being sure to finish it completely before you go to sleep so as to reduce a choking hazard ) .
But if it ’s allergies or some chronic respiratory problem this needs to be addressed by a doctor .
So What ’s Right For You
For yourself , the only way that you ’ll be able to stop snoring is if you figure out what ’s causing it in the first place .
Be honest with yourself about your respiratory health overall .
If you ca n’t breathe during the day , of course , you wo n’t be able to breathe at night .
It may be time to see an allergist or to try some menthol oil on your nose before you go to bed .
If you want to stop snoring you must understand it and stop it before it starts .

BBC director general Mark Thompson claimed more than £ 2,000 when he cut short his holiday to deal with the row over the Ross / Brand lewd calls in 2008 .
The figure was one of a number of details to emerge after the expenses of some top BBC executives were published .
The corporation revealed the figures in response to Freedom of Information requests and pressure for more clarity .
The expenses and salaries of the BBC 's 50 top-earning managers were also revealed on the website on Thursday .
Following public concern over star salaries , Thompson told an audience in Manchester that the total figure paid to talent will be revealed in September , but said it would not be broken down into individual salaries .
Additionally , the salaries and expenses of the BBC 's top 100 executives and decision - makers will be published , quarterly , from September .
" Public expectations about openness , trustworthiness and every kind of value for money are becoming more trenchant , more insistent and more vocal than ever before , " Mr Thompson said .
Vintage champagne
The expenses published on Thursday are those the executives paid for out of their own pocket before claiming back .
They do not include any flights , hotels or other purchases booked directly through the BBC .
They include £ 2,236.90 claimed by Mr Thompson to fly him and his family back from a holiday in Sicily last October .
He returned to London to deal with the fall - out following calls made to actor Andrew Sachs by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand on the latter 's Radio 2 show .
Mr Thompson also chartered a private plane from Maine to Boston - at a cost of £ 1,277.71 - on 8 August 2004 to interrupt a family holiday to return to London to " deal with an urgent staff issue " .
Other expenses detailed include :
• £ 99.99 claimed by Mr Thompson to pay for a bottle of vintage champagne given to Bruce Forsyth for his 80th birthday last year
• £ 1,137.55 claimed by former head of audio and music Jenny Abramsky for a dinner to celebrate Terry Wogan 's knighthood in 2005
• £ 238 and £ 217 for iPods in 2005 and 2007 respectively claimed by former future media and technology director Ashley Highfield
• £ 500 claimed by BBC Vision director Jana Bennett after her handbag and contents were stolen on official BBC business .
This cost was ultimately covered by insurers - not the BBC
• £ 231.55 claimed by Ms Bennett for a dinner with Jeremy Paxman to discuss the presenter 's contract in July 2004
• £ 100 claimed by Ms Bennett for flowers for Jonathan Ross in May 2006
• £ 14.99 claimed by deputy director general Mark Byford for a book on the history of QPR football club in September 2007 .
Mr Byford has said the book was a gift for a colleague who was leaving the BBC and was " used as a key prop " in their farewell speech

More from PM
The BBC said rules on leaving dinners and celebrations had now changed with spending limited to £ 20 per head .
Buying champagne is also now banned .
A spokesman said senior figures needed to get together in formal settings to make important decisions .
Gifts and flowers had been bought for stars because it was " part of the BBC 's job to nurture talent " , the spokesman added .
Chief operating officer Caroline Thomson told BBC
News there had been 38 Freedom of Information requests over expenses - " predominantly from newspapers and journalists " .

The BBC already publishes the pay details of its executive board , as well as the pay and expenses of the corporation 's governing body , the BBC Trust .
In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Public Finances and Accountancy 's annual conference in Manchester , Mr Thompson said the trust and the BBC 's executive board had " strongly encouraged us to look at whether we could and should go further in our practice of routine disclosure " .
As a result , there would now be a breakdown of the pay and expenses of the " top 50 earners in BBC management " and 50 " top decision - makers " , he said .
The 100 individuals , including " those with the greatest responsibility both for spending public money and for overseeing the BBC 's services and operations " , will be published , in addition to the existing publication of the salaries of executive directors .
Media attention will doubtless now focus on the BBC 's reluctance to make public the same kind of information about highly - paid presenters or ' talent '

Mr Thompson said there was " a legitimate interest in how much the BBC spends on talent , including top talent " .
" In future , we will disclose the total amount we spend on talent as a whole , and we will work on a plan to make our spend on talent more transparent so the public can monitor the direction of travel over time , " he said .
But it would be wrong to disclose individual star salaries " in an industry where confidentiality is the norm " , he added .
" There 's a real danger that talent would migrate to broadcasters where confidential information about how much they are paid will not be disclosed . "
' Maintain trust '
Earlier this month , stars including Bruce Forsyth and Sir Terry Wogan were warned to expect their salaries to be cut when their contracts were renewed as part of the BBC 's plan to save money .
Stars such as Forsyth and Ross have been warned of pay cuts
A report in the Times on Thursday suggested the BBC was " refusing to reveal how much is spent on hospitality and gifts for its best - paid celebrities " .
But in his speech Mr Thompson announced that a hospitality and gifts register would also be published .
BBC correspondent Torin Douglas said there was " a great appetite " for this material in the wake of the MPs ' expenses scandal .
There 's a real danger that talent would migrate to broadcasters where confidential information about how much they are paid will not be disclosed
Mark Thompson , on not disclosing the fees of BBC stars
Privacy rights will prevent some claims - such as money spent on lunches to recruit people who did not go on to join the BBC - from being published .
But Mr Thompson was keen that as much information as possible was published , our correspondent added .
In an email to staff , Mr Thompson said : " I do n't underestimate the extent to which this may feel uncomfortable for individuals , " Mr Thompson said in the email .
" However , I firmly believe that these changes will help us maintain trust with the licence fee payer and will ensure the BBC continues to lead the way in transparency and disclosure . "

Federal court documents are currently made available to the public through a crufty system called PACER .
For eight cents per page , users can download filings and other relevant documents associated with individual cases .
PACER is intended to open case law and court activity to broad public scrutiny , but the system 's obfuscated design and its paywall significantly undermine its efficacy .
The content hosted on PACER can be freely redistributed by third parties because copyright is not applicable to court documents , but the access fees make it costly and difficult for data archivers to assemble their own comprehensive mirrors that would offload the hosting burden and make the content more easily accessible to the general public .
Princeton 's Center for Information Technology Policy ( CITP ) is launching a new project to tackle this problem .
A team led by CITP director Ed Felten has devised a novel means of boosting the availability of PACER documents outside of the paywall .
They have created a new Firefox extension called RECAP that seamlessly replicates PACER content and uploads it to a mirror hosted by the Internet Archive .
When RECAP users browse the PACER site , the content that they pay to view will be uploaded to the mirror by the Firefox extension .
Users will get free access to the documents that are already hosted by the mirror .
Over time , free PACER content will accumulate at the Internet Archive 's mirror , making it unnecessary for additional users to pay PACER for access to those files .
The unrestricted availability of the mirrored legal documents will empower legal researchers and members of the public who can't simply pass the access costs along to clients as most lawyers do .
The Administrative Office of the United States Courts contends that access fees are needed in order to fund the bandwidth requirements and ongoing maintenance of the system .
Crowdsourcing distribution and offloading the data to public mirrors like the Internet Archive presents a practical way to alleviate the strain on PACER while making the data more broadly available .
The RECAP project could also illuminate potential solutions to the problems that are blocking a more complete PACER overhaul .
Despite growing pressure from Congress to reform the PACER system and make data available at no cost , the courts are still reluctant to make major changes to the system because of uncertainty about the cost and the technical challenges of hosting and distributing the data .
The RECAP project 's effort to mirror a portion of PACER could help answer those questions and provide a real - world model that demonstrates the viability of open access .
Our own Tim Lee , who wrote about the problems with PACER in article earlier this year , is one of the developers behind the RECAP project .
Lee participated in the creation of the Firefox extension and some related backend infrastructure in collaboration with Harlan Yu and Steve Schultze .
The Firefox extension is open source software and is distributed under the terms of GNU 's General Public License .
The extension is available for download from the RECAP website , which launched today .
The website also has an introductory video and additional details about the project 's goals and philosophy .
Yu offers additional commentary about RECAP at the CITP 's Freedom to Tinker blog .
He envisions a future where court documents are freely available to everyone and are annotated with software - friendly metadata that makes the information easy to process , index , and programmatically analyze .
" With today 's technologies , government transparency means much more than the chance to read one document at a time .
Citizens today expect to be able to download comprehensive government datasets that are machine - processable , open , and free , " he wrote .
" Today , we are excited to announce the public beta release of RECAP , a tool that will help bring an unprecedented level of transparency to the US federal court system .
RECAP is a plug - in for the Firefox web browser that makes it easier for users to share documents they have purchased from PACER , the court 's pay - to - play access system . "
As Lee explained in his previous article , the revenue generated by PACER 's paywall far exceeds the amount of money needed to run the system .
The operating costs could be further reduced through much - needed consolidation and other changes .
The RECAP system is an important vehicle for encouraging open access and moving the system forward .
It also reflects the growth of an emerging movement that seeks to boost government transparency through data availability .
A number of similar projects have popped up recently with the goal of making the inner workings of the government visible to regular citizens via the Internet .
An example is OpenRegs.com , a website established in June by Mercatus Center researcher Jerry Brito and programmer Peter Snyder to help people navigate federal regulations .
The government itself is also pushing a number of important data transparency projects , such as the new Data.gov website that was launched in may by Federal CIO Vivek Kundra to aggregate government data sets in machine - readable formats .

In this brilliant and groundbreaking book , New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in out society so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly .
Ideas , behavior , messages , and products , he argues , often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease .
Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu , so too can a few fare - beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave , or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant .
These are social epidemics , and the moment when they take off , when they reach their critical mass , is the Tipping Point .
A decade ago , General Electric was the shining star of American business .
Its longtime chief executive , Jack Welch , was named manager of the century by Fortune Magazine , and its stock seemed always to go up .
It ran a bewildering array of businesses but somehow always managed to make the expected profits .
That record was viewed as proof of superior management , and the battle to succeed Mr. Welch in 2001 was watched all over the business universe .
When a winner emerged , the losers quickly were hired to run other major companies .
G.E. is different now .
The stock has fallen and the aura has dissipated .
This week General Electric agreed to pay $ 50 million to settle a suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that said the company fiddled with its books repeatedly early in this decade .
In at least one case , that allowed it to preserve its reputation for making the numbers .
Some of the details are eerily reminiscent of Enron .
As is customary in such settlements , G.E. neither admitted nor denied the charges .
But it sounded contrite .
“ The errors at issue fell short of our standards , and we have implemented numerous remedial actions and internal control enhancements to prevent such errors from recurring , ” said a company statement .
Two men accused of funding Palestinian group Hamas through a US - based charity have been sentenced to 65 years in jail .
Five leaders of what used to be the largest Muslim charity in America were convicted last year of funnelling more than $ 15 million to Hamas .
Three others received sentences of up to 20 years in jail .
The two men jailed for 65 years have family ties to Hamas members .
" These sentences should serve as a strong warning to anyone who knowingly provides financial support to terrorists under the guise of humanitarian relief , " said David Kris , assistant US attorney - general for national security .
Hamas is designated a terrorist group by the US Government .
The charity , the Holy Land Foundation , was shut down after the September 11 terrorist attacks .
Prosecutors did not accuse the charity of directly financing or being involved in terrorism .
Instead , they alleged the humanitarian aid was used to promote Hamas and allow it to divert existing funds to militant activities .
All five men say they are innocent victims of anti-Islamic sentiment .
The men's defence said the charity was a non-political organisation that operated legally to get much - needed aid to Palestinians living in squalor under the Israeli occupation .
They argued their clients were on trial chiefly because of their family ties .

Accounting in Wonderland Jeremy Kahn goes down the rabbit hole with GE 's books .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) –
The rabbit - hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .
-- Lewis Carroll , Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland
General Electric is without a doubt one of the most beloved stocks in history .
About the worst criticism ever leveled at the illustrious company is that its stunning run of profit growth -- 101 straight quarters -- is somehow artificial , the result of " managed earnings . "
After all , the argument goes , GE never seems to have had a loss in one division that was n't happily offset by a gain in another ; it never seems to have encountered a windfall profit that was n't smoothed away by a " one time " restructuring charge .
Can such an extraordinary record really be the result of an uncannily canny management -- or is there a bit of accounting wizardry going on behind the curtain ?
While there 's nothing illegal per se about managing earnings -- and indeed , many big - name companies are alleged to be doing just that -- GE , for one , denies that it engages in such artful accounting .
As longtime CEO Jack Welch likes to say ( and as a company spokesman recently reiterated to FORTUNE ) , " GE manages businesses , not earnings . "
And besides , demand legions of investors , what would be so terrible if the company did help smooth out the ride ?
Is n't such earnings consistency why GE stock trades at a lofty premium to its competitors ' ?
Good question .
And the answer is n't exactly cut and dried .
But such accounting games do make it difficult to gain a clear picture of how GE 's businesses are actually performing .
That means , if the company 's core operations were ever to hit a rough spot -- in a jarring and jumbled economy like this one -- investors might not discover it until too late .
Until very too late indeed .
So I decided to take a look for myself .
On a tip from a friendly money manager , who served as my White Rabbit of sorts , I dove into GE 's financial statements and wound up having an adventure worthy of Lewis Carroll ( or Carol Loomis , as the case may be ) .
When I landed , I was in a place where little was obvious , nothing was simple , and no one -- not even the number crunchers at GE - - seemed to know the difference between reality and fantasy .
Welcome to Accounting Wonderland .
To start with , it is a labyrinthine realm .
GE 's 12 operating businesses -- including television network NBC and GE Capital , as well as the companies that make light bulbs and aircraft engines -- generated $ 129.9 billion in revenue last year .
If this large , diversified portfolio of businesses is what enables GE to generate a consistent earnings stream , it 's also what makes it so obtuse .
" It is an extremely difficult company to evaluate because there are so many moving parts , " says William Fiala , GE analyst at Edmond Jones .
Perhaps that 's why only 28 Wall Street analysts cover GE , compared with the 47 who follow Gillette , which has a market cap one - thirteenth the size of GE's .
By far the company 's largest and most profitable division is GE Capital Services .
It routinely accounts for more than 40 % of GE 's earnings .
Capital includes five of GE 's operating segments , involving some 28 subsidiaries .
Since GE Capital Services powers GE 's earnings , I thought I 'd begin there .
But almost immediately things started getting strange .
Just trying to figure out the corporate structure of all these insurance and financing operations is , well , trying .
It turns out there are more incestuous relationships among GE Capital 's business units than among the original cast members of The Brady Bunch .
GE Capital Services is divided into two divisions : GE Capital Global Insurance Holdings , which owns GE 's insurance companies , and GE Capital Corp. , which owns everything else .
One of GE Global 's insurance businesses , Employers Reinsurance -- one of the largest reinsurance outfits in the world -- has issued almost $ 1.2 billion in preferred stock to GE Capital , stock on which it pays dividends .
Then GE Global itself has issued another $ 150 million of dividend - paying preferred stock to GE Capital .
So why would one wholly owned GE entity have to pay dividends to another ?
I called a half - dozen GE analysts to find out .
None of them were aware of these cross-holdings or what purpose they might serve .
Think about that for a minute .
These people read the company 's financial statements for a living .
In Accounting Wonderland , analysts who cover the stock are much like the guests at the Mad Hatter 's tea party -- blissfully oblivious to the illogic swirling around them .
Luckily , GE was happy to set me straight .
Take a deep breath :
It seems that in 1994 , GE Capital transferred Puritan , a life insurance company it owned , to Employers Reinsurance in exchange for the preferred stock on which Employers Reinsurance now pays dividends that are set to approximate the earnings of Puritan 's assets at the time of the transfer ; the stock GE Global issued GE Capital was in exchange for a loan that GE Capital gave it in 1995 to help it buy two German insurance companies for $ 1 billion .
Got that ?
Not that you 'd know any of this unless you went back to read the 1994 and 1995 annual reports .
After that the tangled structure remains in place , but GE 's filings omit any explanation .
GE assured me that none of this has any impact on its bottom line .
Indeed , when you look at the consolidated results at GE Capital Services or GE itself , the dividend expenses from one entity and the dividend income realized by the other cancel out .
Still , the arrangement makes it harder to figure out exactly how each operating unit is performing .
And why continue such a complicated structure if it serves no purpose ?
I thought it might be a tax dodge , but GE says no .
These cross-holdings are merely vestigial , GE 's version of an appendix .
And guess what ?
GE says it is now considering eliminating them .
If , in the above case , who owns what matters not a whit , in other cases GE has profited greatly by shifting assets from one corporate cousin to another .
Take NBCi , the less than exceptional NBC - affiliated Web portal .
In 1999 GE helped create NBCi by taking an odd assortment of Internet investments --a 19 % interest in Snap.com , a 10 % interest in CNBC.com , all of AccessHollywood.com , plus a few additional sites - sans - business - model - - and donating them to a publicly traded Internet direct marketer called Xoom.com .
GE received a 39 % stake in Xoom , which was then renamed NBCi .
But contributing these assets to NBCi also allowed GE to record a $ 388 million accounting gain , simply because these sites were now valued at a much higher multiple than they had been as part of GE .
Why ?
Because they were suddenly part of a pure - play Net company with a $ 3.9 billion market cap and no earnings , naturally .
GE had hoped its stake in NBCi would give it some Internet funny money to play with .
It has n't worked out that way .
Instead the stock has lost 97 % of its value since its debut .
GE 's share of NBCi's losses last year came to $ 258 million .
Some of the company 's other Internet investments have proved troubling lately too .
GE Equity , one of GE Capital 's subsidiaries , is essentially an in - house hedge fund .
It owns stock in hundreds of companies , many of them former new - economy Wunder - stocks , like Commerce One , Internet Capital Group , Digital Think , and iVillage .
When Net stocks were hot , GE quietly used these investments to goose earnings -- realizing almost $ 300 million in after - tax gains in the last quarter of 1999 and another $ 400 million in the first quarter of 2000 .
Even with the sales , at one point GE Equity was sitting on $ 4 billion in unrealized gains in publicly traded stocks plus a $ 2 billion portfolio of private investments .
Then the Internet bubble burst , and billions in unrealized gains turned to billions in unrealized losses .
( From March to December , the total value of GE 's investments in public companies dropped from about $ 5 billion to $ 1.6 billion ) .
Exactly how great these losses are , however , is a bit difficult to calculate , owing to what in GE's Accounting Wonderland might be called the Cheshire Cat effect : Certain investments suddenly appear , disappear , and then reappear in GE 's filings with the SEC .
Meanwhile , the value of some investments float , mischievously disembodied from reality .
For instance , look at GE 's stake in Internet shopping network ValueVision ( in another of the company 's keiretsu - like deals , ValueVision owns options to buy NBCi stock as well ) .
In one quarterly SEC filing last year , GE claimed its 16 million - plus ValueVision shares were worth $ 222.6 million when the markets closed on March 31 .
This simply is n't true .
Based on the close of ValueVision 's stock that day , they were actually worth $ 662 million .
In the next quarterly filing ValueVision disappears completely from a list of GE 's investments , only to reappear the following quarter , when GE claims -- correctly -- the stock was worth $ 413 million .
Similarly , GE's 8.6 million shares of Internet Capital Group are listed as being worth $ 923 million at the end of March , when in fact they were worth just $ 782 million .
And then there 's GE 's investment in NBCi , which it first acquired in November 1999 .
We see neither hide nor hair of this until September 2000 -- when it miraculously materializes on a list of investments filed with the SEC and boosts the overall portfolio by $ 161 million .
Just what the heck is going on here ?
" There were errors in our methodology for calculating value , " says GE spokesman Gary Sheffer somewhat sheepishly .
In other words : my bad .
And what about NBCi's sudden appearance in GE's September filings ?
Oh , that was a mistake too .
Turns out GE does n't even account for NBCi like its other Internet stocks -- instead it 's what GE defines as an " affiliated company , " and it consolidates its portion of NBCi's earnings on its own income statement -- so NBCi should never have been included in that filing .
( Is that Britney Spears I hear ?
" Oops !
We did it again . " )
GE has already filed amended statements with the SEC , correcting some of these errors , and ( after our conversation ) it began doing so for the others .
But , okay , how many accountants missed these mistakes ?
GE could n't provide a number , but the answer is : lots .
The central figures in GE 's alleged earnings management -- Accounting Wonderland 's King and Queen of Hearts -- are the company 's use of various one - time gains and losses from asset sales and its use of restructuring charges for layoffs and plant closings .
Most recently , GE recorded a $ 1.3 billion gain last year when UBS bought Paine Webber , in which GE had a large stake .
But according to a GE press release this gain was " more than offset by one - time charges . "
The company did something similar in 1993 , and again in 1997 -- when it sold part of its Paine Webber stock to make up for a $ 200 million charge it took to write down loans GE Capital had granted bankrupt retailer Montgomery Ward , and then took a $ 2.3 billion restructuring charge to offset gains from a deal with Lockheed Martin .
Thank God for coincidences .
Finding these restructuring charges and one - time gains within GE 's financial filings is about as easy as using flamingos as croquet mallets ( another Alice reference ) .
GE mentions them in the discussion accompanying its quarterly reports but does n't break them out in its financial statements .
In its 1997 annual report , an unnumbered footnote advises investors that the $ 2.3 billion in restructuring charges have been lumped in with normal operating expenses on the " Cost of Goods Sold , " " Cost of Services Sold , " and " Other Costs and Expenses " lines of GE 's income statement .
That makes some sense when you start to read what the charges are for .
Some items , such as employee severance , lease termination , and building demolition , certainly sound extraordinary .
But then there are others , such as " higher estimated manufacturing cost , " which one would be hard - pressed to describe as anything but routine .
( It 's curious why GE , supposedly the best - managed company in the world , announces big restructuring charges almost yearly -- but that 's a question for another day . )
And finding out just which of GE 's businesses are affected by these one - time charges poses yet another challenge , since the company has excluded restructuring from its segment results since 1998 .
In fact , this and several other accounting changes and revisions GE has made over the past decade make it nearly impossible to assess the results of any business segment for an entire ten - year period .
In many cases these accounting changes make the performance of business segments appear much more positive -- and consistent -- than before .
For instance , the 1997 annual report states that GE's Industrial Products and Systems segment earned a profit of $ 1.5 billion in 1997 , a decline of 6 % from the $ 1.6 billion it had earned the year before .
But in its 1998 annual report the same segment 's 1997 profits are now listed as $ 1.8 billion , a 12 % increase from the prior year .
GE says it is simply complying with SEC rules that require it to present investors with information in the same way it is reported to the company 's executives .
And , at GE , managers are n't penalized for restructuring charges .
But again , this explanation is a head scratcher .
Why are n't managers held accountable for these expenses ?
After all , how does a manager evaluate his business without being aware of the costs associated with layoffs and factory closings ?
How does he determine his return on capital ?
To be fair , GE says it tries to outline the way in which restructuring costs are divvied up -- it just does n't do so in its segment results .
Instead the company leaves it up to investors and analysts to do the math .
And GE says it ignores restructuring charges when evaluating operational performance because business - unit managers have no control over them .
Such decisions are made at HQ .
When I called General Electric and said I was doing a story on how confusing its financial filings are , the company informed me that it had won all sorts of awards for transparency .
Last year a trade magazine named its investor - relations department the best in the country .
And in a survey of analysts and portfolio managers , GE was selected as the publicly traded company that does the best overall job of disclosing financial and corporate information ( only 6 % of those surveyed picked GE , but this was twice as many as chose the runner - up , Intel ) .
Analysts and portfolio managers , however , get to spend a lot of time on the phone asking GE to clarify and expand on its financial statements .
And in many cases GE provides analysts with detailed information that it does n't reveal to the general public .
GE can do this despite a new SEC rule - - rule FD ( for fair disclosure ) -- that is supposed to prohibit a company from making important information available to only a select group .
The reason is , once again , a function of GE 's size .
Rule FD says only that " material " information cannot be disclosed selectively .
But materiality is a somewhat subjective term , and in a $ 129 billion company it takes a pretty big number for something to become " material " to consolidated earnings .
Yet is n't there a point at which several immaterial events --a $ 100 million gain there , a $ 50 million charge there -- might add up to something material ?
As in the last quarter , perhaps , in which GE 's profit growth from the previous year 's fourth quarter totaled $ 496 million .
" We are trying to provide investors with as much information as they need to make a valid decision on whether to buy the stock , " GE CFO Keith Sherin says .
" We have to reach a balance between line - item detail and providing information that will be useful to our stockholders . "
Perhaps the company is simply too big to achieve this balance -- or maybe the details are too small .
In Accounting Wonderland , you sometimes can't tell at all .

Truly Grilled Pizza !
Now regular readers of this blog will know I am no stranger to making pizzas on the grill .
I use the term “ truly grilled ” because I grilled the dough directly on the grates , something I usually do n’t do .
This was really a choice out of desperation since my pizza stone broke several weeks ago , and I have yet to replace it .
So , tonight ’s pie was pure grill : no stone , no screen , no paper … just Mr. Pizza and Mr. Weber .
I made my dough the usual way ( In my opinion , still a work in progress ) .
For the toppings I went traditional , with the exception of adding some breakfast sausage I ground on Sunday .
( Sausage Making Note : I will grind and stuff soon .
I have the casings , but have neglected to buy the stuffer Andrew pointed out .
Soon…soon ! ) .
I took my dough ball and cut it in half , which resulted in two 8 inch pies .
I wanted smaller pies so I could better manage them over the grill .
I preheated the grill to direct medium and oiled both sides of the dough .
With the dough “ untopped ” , I placed the first side down on the grates .
After about 3 minutes , I flipped the dough and added the toppings on the fly while the second side cooked .
I suppose I could have waited until I initially grilled both sides to top them , but I was hungry and I like the feeling of skin sluffing off my wrists while they dangle over the hot grill .
By the time the pizzas were topped and my wrists were red , I slide the pies to the middle and went to indirect high .
Cook for about 10 more minutes , or until your desired level of “ doneness ” .
The results were good .
Grilling the pizzas this way produces a much more crisper crust , which is altogether not surprising .
I still like my stone , but in a pinch a “ truly grilled pizza ” works just as well .
So , if you own a grill and you like pizzas , you have no excuses for NOT being able to make “ truly grilled pizzas ” .
Next up ?
Grilled calzones and an experiment with smoke …
Iran 's police chief admitted yesterday that protesters who were arrested after June 's disputed presidential election had been tortured while in custody in a prison in south - west Tehran .
But he denied that any of the detainees had died as a result .
General Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam said the head of the Kahrizak detention centre had been dismissed and jailed .
" Three policemen who beat detainees have been jailed as well , " the official IRNA news agency quoted Moghaddam as saying .
Human rights groups had previously identified at least three detainees they said had died after torture at Kahrizak , which was closed last month on the orders of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Moghaddam denied that the abuses were responsible for any fatalities there , claiming that an unspecified " viral illness " had caused the deaths .
His admission marked the second occasion in as many days that a senior official had accepted that some criticisms levelled at the regime were well - founded , suggesting growing doubts and uncertainty within the embattled regime .
On Saturday , Qorbanali Dori-Najafabadi , Iran 's prosecutor - general , conceded that " mistakes " had led to " painful accidents which cannot be defended , and those who were involved should be punished " .
He said the mistakes included " the Kahrizak incident " , an apparent reference to the deaths .
Dori-Najafabadi indicated that the judiciary had taken overall charge of the detainees and their trials away from the militia and revolutionary guards .
He said about 200 people were still being held and urged people not to be afraid to come forward .
" Maybe there were cases of torture in the early days after the election , but we are willing to follow up any complaints or irregularities that have taken place , " he was quoted as saying .
One of those to die after being detained in Kahrizak was the son of a top adviser to the defeated conservative presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaie .
After Mohsen Ruholamini's death , Iran 's most senior judge , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi -Shahroudi , ordered officials to inspect all prisons and detention centres .
A parliamentary investigation into Kahrizak is also under way .
There have been widespread opposition claims of torture and abuse of the hundreds of anti-government demonstrators , politicians , journalists and academics arrested since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the June election .
The result , swiftly endorsed by Khamenei , led to large - scale demonstrations and violent clashes in Tehran and other cities , resulting in dozens , possibly hundreds of deaths and mass arrests .
Sporadic protests were continuing despite a harsh security crackdown .
Until now , officials had rejected the torture claims .
The website of one of the defeated presidential candidates , Mehdi Karoubi , said yesterday that some of those detained had been raped in detention .
" Some senior officials told me that ... really shameful issues ...
Some young male detainees were raped ... also some young female detainees were raped in a way that have caused serious injuries , " the website quoted a 10 - day - old letter from Karoubi as saying .
Despite Dori-Najafabadi's assurances , Iranian websites reported that relatives and supporters who gathered outside a court in Tehran during the latest trial on Saturday were attacked by riot police when they began chanting slogans .
Saturday 's proceedings , condemned as a " show trial " by opposition factions , involved more than 100 people accused of trying to overthrow the Islamic republic .
Among those in the dock was Clotilde Reiss , a French researcher working at Isfahan University , who was alleged to have passed information about the protests to the French embassy in Tehran .
Also among the accused was an Iranian citizen , Hossein Rassam , who is employed as a political analyst at the British embassy and who helped to monitor the elections .
Both Reiss and Rassam expressed " regret " at their actions , according to the official Fars news agency , and asked for a pardon .
Britain and France expressed outrage at the proceedings .
Hello , beautiful .
Danish phone site Mobil has uncovered " internal documents " on what appears to be Sony Ericsson 's upcoming Android - based handset , an XPERIA number codenamed Rachael .
Under the hood is a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor , HSPA and an 8 megapixel camera .
It 's unclear how big the touchscreen is , and other details are scarce -- there is a 3.5 m m headphone jack , so that 's nice , but unless we 're severely misguided , there does n't seem to be a slide - out keyboard tucked away inside this thin chassis .

News Corporation 's James Murdoch has said that a " dominant " BBC threatens independent journalism in the UK .
The chairman of the media giant in Europe , which owns the Times and Sun , also blamed the UK government for regulating the media " with relish " .
" The expansion of state - sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision , " he told the Edinburgh Television Festival .
The scope of the BBC 's activities and ambitions was " chilling " , he added .
Organisations like the BBC , funded by the licence fee , as well as Channel 4 and Ofcom , made it harder for other broadcasters to survive , he argued .
' Chilling '
" The BBC is dominant , " Mr Murdoch said .
" Other organisations might rise and fall but the BBC 's income is guaranteed and growing . "
The BBC has a very strong competitor in Sky , and not one to be ignored
Sir Michael Lyons , BBC Trust News Corporation , which is the largest shareholder in BSkyB , lost $ 3.4bn ( £ 2 bn ) in the year to the end of June , which his father , News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch , said had been " the most difficult in recent history " .
Other media organisations are also struggling as advertising revenues have dropped during the downturn .
Sir Michael Lyons , chairman of the BBC Trust , told the BBC's World Tonight that Mr Murdoch had underplayed the importance of Sky as a competitor .
" Sky continues to grow and get stronger and stronger all the time so this is not quite a set of minnows and a great big BBC , " Sir Michael said .
" The BBC has a very strong competitor in Sky , and not one to be ignored . "
Free news Mr Murdoch said free news on the web provided by the BBC made it " incredibly difficult " for private news organisations to ask people to pay for their news .
" It is essential for the future of independent digital journalism that a fair price can be charged for news to people who value it , " he said .
News Corporation has said it will start charging online customers for news content across all its websites .
Former BBC director general Greg Dyke said Mr Murdoch 's argument that the BBC was a " threat " to independent journalism was " fundamentally wrong " .
He told BBC Radio 5 live : " Journalism is going through a very difficult time - not only in this country but every country in the world - because newspapers , radio and television in the commercial world are all having a very rough time . "
He said declining advertising revenues in the recession , rather than the corporation , were to blame for the problems facing the commercial media .
" That is nothing to do with the BBC , that is just to with what 's happening , " he said .
News Corporation owns the Times , the Sunday Times and Sun newspapers and pay TV provider BSkyB in the UK and the New York Post and Wall Street Journal in the US .
Rupert Murdoch addressed the same festival 20 years ago , and was also critical of the UK 's media policy .

2020 Hyundai Sonata videos
Hyundai vs. Honda : How the New Sonata Stacks Up Against the Accord Dollar for Dollar
[ MUSIC PLAYING ] CARLOS : The Honda Accord has long been our favorite family sedan .
It 's spacious , smart , and nice to drive .
It even won our best sedan award two years in a row .
SPEAKER : If anything is going to challenge it , it would be the 2020 Hyundai Sonata .
It 's entirely new and packed with usable features .
Mostly usable .
CARLOS : We 've spent a lot of time evaluating these vehicles .
We 've done performance testing , static measurements .
We 've even taken them on our standardized road test loop .
We 've also lived with the cars , and commuted in rush hour , and ran all the family errands .
SPEAKER : All of that sounds pretty thorough , so which one should you buy ?
CARLOS : That 's what we 're going to tell you in this video .
But before we do , make sure you hit subscribe and visit Edmunds.com to find your perfect car .
[ MUSIC PLAYING ]
Yeah , these cars are n't evenly matched with regard to pricing and powertrain .
But with that in mind , remember we 've tested every variety of Accord over the past few years .
We even had a 2018 as a long - term test car .
So think of this red touring as a representative of our experience .
SPEAKER : Mid-sized sedans have a reputation for being boring , but both the Sonata and the Accord are clearly making efforts design - wise .
Now , it 's pretty difficult to say which one has the best design because that is so subjective .
But I think we can tell you which one has the most design .
Carlos , do you have a giant grill ?
CARLOS : I have a chrome unibrow .
SPEAKER : Not as good .
Do you have light - up chrome strips ?
CARLOS : I have chrome , but they do n't light up .
SPEAKER : I 'm taking that point .
What about a full chrome greenhouse surround ?
CARLOS : Partial chrome ?
SPEAKER : Chrome door handles ?
CARLOS : Again , partial chrome .
SPEAKER : Do you have speed nubbings on the tail lights ?
CARLOS : Are those fake vortex generators ?
SPEAKER : Do I look like an aerodynamicist ?
CARLOS : No , I do n't have speed nubbings .
SPEAKER : How cool is your hidden trunk release ?
CARLOS : Uh , not as cool , and my trunk 's a little flaccid .
SPEAKER : I think it 's fair to say that these Sonata wins for most style .
Whether you like it or not is up to you .
CARLOS : Obviously the interior of a midsize sedan should be functional answer of the duties of a family commuter or both .
But because you 'll be spending a lot of time inside , it should make you feel good , too .
SPEAKER : Based on specs , the interior dimensions are similar , but the Sonata has a few small advantages .
It appears to favor the front seats more , especially with regard to leg room .
The Sonata is currently telling me that my attention level is high , I think .
I do n't know .
Also , it 's saying that it 's sunny , which is something I could have figured out by looking out the window .
CARLOS : I think so , yeah .
Yeah .
SPEAKER : What do you think of the interior in the Sonata ?
CARLOS : I think this design is really strong , but it 's ultimately let down by the materials .
Like , the layout 's really cool , and modern , and pleasant .
But then you look at some of the materials they used to put it all together and the way it 's kind of assembled , and it just does n't match the design .
The dash material right here and some of the gaps just are n't as uniform or as pleasant as they are in the Accord .
SPEAKER : Yeah , I can't argue with that .
I like the way that they laid out , like , these door handles that are insert in the door , like a 911 or something .
And this is kind of cool and Star - Trekky .
But you would never have this much hard black plastic in a real luxury car .
CARLOS : Piano black trim across all cars -- this goes for luxury cars , too -- is the worst .
It looks great when it 's clean .
But as soon as I put my gross oily hands on the shifter area , which I would do because I 'm shifting while driving the car , look .
Now , it 's covered with my gross oil hand oil .
SPEAKER : That is so gross .
CARLOS : And now , you have to touch that .
SPEAKER : I 'm not touching .
[ LAUGHTER ] CARLOS : OK .
But design aside , the Sonata actually does some really nice things with storage , like this front cubby , right ?
SPEAKER : The cubby is so much better than the one in the Honda .
And I 'm actually very surprised to ever let a Honda lose in terms of small storage , because they normally do such a good job .
But this cubby has more options for more different size phones .
You could put things that are n't phones there .
You can see what 's there and reach it while you 're driving without having to dig inside .
And all of that cleverness applies all the way back , too .
This is really nice in the cup holder .
CARLOS : Yeah , yeah .
It 's really cool that you can have multiple phones in multiple places in the center console and have it not interrupt the functionality , whether you 're in the wireless charger , whether you 're in the center of the cup holders .
Really nice , clever stuff .
And then on the right here , I have an additional little cubby that you do n't have on that side and the Accord does n't have it all .
And that 's really nice just to have more options to put your things .
SPEAKER : The other thing about the Sonata has over the Accord is charging ports in the back seat .
CARLOS : At least one , yeah .
At least one .
It does n't have heated back seats , but I think the power options for rear passengers is more important .
And the car seat situation is more traditional , where the anchor points are just sort of wedged in between the seat bottom and the seat cushion .
So you do have to reach into them .
It 's not bad .
It 's not something to not buy the car over .
But just know the Accord pays a little bit more attention to that .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
I mean , Honda is just really good about thinking about moms and dads , you know , what they might need .
CARLOS : Families , yeah .
SPEAKER : Families .
[ LAUGHTER ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ]
I cannot reach the dead pedal in this car .
CARLOS : And how tall are you with your shoes on ?
SPEAKER : Like 5 ' 5 " with these shoes on .
So that 's a normal height .
I should be able to reach it .
And it's , like , two , three inches away from me .
So I do n't know who their test driver is over at Hyundai , but they are very long - legged .
I really like the way that the digital gauge cluster looks , even if it does give me information that I do n't necessarily need .
CARLOS : Like it 's sunny ?
SPEAKER : Yeah , I know .
CARLOS : Yeah , thank you .
SPEAKER : And I absolutely adore the way that they integrated this into the dash .
It just looks so pretty , and it 's really easy to use .
Even if you 've never been in one before , you 'll be able to figure it out .
CARLOS : This is like 10.3 inches or something .
It is the top of the line system in the Sonata , but you can option it on most Sonata trim levels , and it 's just nice .
It 's powerful .
It 's high - resolution , definitely a higher resolution than the Accord , and it moves more fluidly , too .
And it 's a little bit easier to use .
Not only that , but when you have Android Auto or Apple CarPlay in use , you get the widescreen version of both those systems .
And that 's a really nice advantage when you have it , because that 's the way I 'd like to use those systems .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
There 's a lot of little things in the Sonata that make it kind of cool or quirky .
CARLOS : Accord 's definitely more comfortable , but this has a lot more tech .
Before we move on to functionality and all that , let 's talk about overall style of the Accord .
SPEAKER : OK .
I think it 's boring , but nice .
[ LAUGHTER ] CARLOS : Well , here 's the thing .
When I hop in the Accord , I get a very obvious but kind of undefinable sense of quality .
And I think that it has to relate to how the interior is assembled , and just sort of the quality of materials .
It just seems nicer than most vehicles in this segment .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
I mean , if I was just looking into each of the vehicles that we have here , I think that the Sonata actually is a cooler interior .
But once I get in , this one feels better put together .
CARLOS : Yeah .
Now , the backseat , you get heated seats in this car , for sure .
But no power ports for backseat passengers ?
SPEAKER : Yeah , it 's interesting .
When you think about why people might choose a small SUV over a mid-sized sedan , I think that a lot of that has to do with the design of the seats behind the driver .
CARLOS : Let 's talk about the car seat hook - up .
The upper anchor points are easy to find .
You have the lower tether anchor points .
I think that 's the right term .
They 're kind of by little fabric blankets that you can fold in .
And once you do , the anchor points are right there .
You do n't have to reach your fingers in and squeeze them in between seat cushions .
That 's a nice little touch on that in the Accord .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
Then , you do n't have to fight your way through year old Cheerios to find the tethers .
I think that if you were looking for a more family - friendly car , unsurprisingly , once again , Honda is the way to go .
CARLOS : Now , up front , we can talk about the entertainment system , but I think you want to talk about seats , right ?
SPEAKER : I mean , I want to take a nap , because this is an extremely comfortable seat , and I 'm enjoying sitting in it .
CARLOS : The Accord has a nicer front seats , for sure .
I mean , I 've got a 12 - way adjustable seat in the driver 's seat .
I think year is eight - way adjustable .
And they are obviously so much more comfortable than the Sonata's .
The Sonata 's are n't bad .
But for long driving , these are the seats I want to be in .
And what 's nice are these are the seats that you get across most Accord models , too .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
I think that there 's , like , without question , the Accord has more comfortable .
Really just across the board , but especially in terms of the seats .
CARLOS : Now , the entertainment display , this is the biggest and nicest screen you can get in the Accord .
SPEAKER : It 's not that big and it's not that nice .
[ LAUGHTER ] CARLOS : It 's an adequate screen .
Like , it gets the job done .
But the upgraded screen in the Sonata , which you can option on most Sonata trim levels , is just not only bigger , but it 's nicer to look at and it 's nicer to use , too .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
It 's glossy , and it 's really clear , and the cameras are really clear , and it does n't have these little fiddly buttons .
CARLOS : The Accord is definitely the more comfortable car and the one that feels more nicely put together .
But it does have some key disadvantages with , again , the entertainment display and interior storage .
SPEAKER : Yeah
It 's also just less interesting , you know ?
Like , it does n't have neat digital gauges or anything like that .
[ MUSIC PLAYING ] CARLOS :
When it comes to performance measurements , we do n't really care about outright speed .
What we care about is how well you can keep pace with the flow of traction , control your position within traffic and make it up freeway on - ramps .
But we can talk about overall drivability , too .
SPEAKER : Just for the record , I do care about outright speed .
But these things are surprisingly decent .
CARLOS : Even for mid-sized sedans .
This Accord is significantly faster than the Sonata and more enjoyable to drive because its turbo two - liter engine is simply more powerful than the Sonata 's 1.6 - liter four - cylinder .
We should note , however , that the less expensive and more comparable Accord EXL comes with a 1 and 1/2 - liter engine that 's closer in performance to the Sonata's .
On the other hand , you can option the two - liter turbo engine in the EXL Accord for about the same money as this Sonata Limited .
It 's a worthwhile upgrade .
Also , currently the Sonata is n't available with a more powerful engine .
Now , the big difference between the two is definitely ride quality .
SPEAKER : It 's not even a question .
The Accord has so much more comfortable in every way .
I mean , we already talked about how the seats are more comfortable .
But it 's also quieter , and smoother , and just feels more refined in every input .
CARLOS : Absolutely .
The Sonata 's suspension is way more firm , not uncomfortably so .
But in that car driving back - to - back with the Accord over the same stretch of road , you certainly noticed bumps and hear bumps in the Sonata that you did n't even notice in the Accord .
And that adds to that Accord 's overall sense of refinement that the Sonata just does n't have when it comes to ride quality .
And you 're right about the noise , too .
The Sonata is just louder inside , both wind , tire , and engine noise .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
I mean , it 's not insane or anything , but it 's noticeable .
One place where the Sonata does have it over the Accord is turning radius , though .
On paper , it does n't look like a whole lot .
But it was dramatic on the street .
CARLOS : Yeah .
I want to say the difference was , like , four or five feet .
And that makes the difference on a tight busy street between making a three - point turn , not making the U - turn at all , just not attempting it , or making it like you can in the Sonata .
I mean , on the same stretch of road , we could make tighter turns in the Sonata than you can in the Accord , and that 's a real plus when you 're commuting or running errands .
SPEAKER : Definitely a better getaway car , if you 're planning on committing some crimes .
[ LAUGHTER ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] CARLOS :
When you talk about value , you often get into safety features .
And the truth is it 's pretty much the same between these two .
They both have similar features .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
They pretty much match up feature for feature .
I mean , they both have blind spot monitoring and collision mitigation .
CARLOS : Adaptive cruise , and so on and so on .
SPEAKER : Yeah .
CARLOS : But the Sonata does have some advantages when it comes to tech features .
A lot of them , though , we 've classified as why tech .
SPEAKER : Why do you call it why tech ?
CARLOS : We 'll show you .
SPEAKER : All right , why tech number one blind spot monitoring cameras in the digital gauges .
Oh , look .
It 's showing me what 's behind me in here .
Except if I 'm turning , I need to be looking over there .
So , like , neat trick , Hyundai , but why ?
Why tech number two , sounds of nature .
I mean , I like nature , but do n't really need -- [ CRUNCHING ] -- the sound of a snowy village while I 'm driving .
And even worse -- [ WATER RUSHING ] -- I have to pee .
[ TRICKLING ]
Now , I really have to pee .
Can we cut ?
CARLOS : You have the ability to record voice memos in the Sonata .
It 's nice , but it makes you wonder -- why would I ever use this feature ?
Smart Park is a neat idea that kind of falls apart in execution .
You can drive the car forward and backwards with just the key fob , but it does n't steer that much .
And any parking spot that type is just a place where you 're going to get a bunch of door dings .
So unless you have a really tight garage , why ?
We have to point out the Sonata 's his biggest feature , and that is warranty coverage .
It simply has longer powertrain and basic coverage .
SPEAKER : While we 're on the topic of features , though , I just kind of want to remind everybody that a nice seat is a feature .
A good engine is a feature .
Ride quality is a feature .
And I think they might be the most important features .
CARLOS : Agreed , and that brings us quite nicely to our conclusion .
The Sonata has some real advantages on paper .
It has great tech features , a really cool surround system .
We love the entertainment display and we really like the digital gauge cluster .
SPEAKER : The Sonata is more fun , or at least it wants to be more fun .
It 's doing some kind of cool , silly things .
But in the end , it might be more sprinkle than cake .
CARLOS : The Accord wins this comparison .
And that 's because it has priority on the things that matter when you 're driving .
These are cars .
You have to drive them .
So we consider more carefully how comfortable the seats are , what the ride quality is like , what it 's like from behind the wheel .
And while there are some shortcomings versus the Sonata , like the entertainment system and a couple of other things , they do n't add up to outweigh the upsides .
And that 's why the Accord is our best midsize sedan .
SPEAKER : Again .
[ MUSIC PLAYING ]
In this video , Edmunds ' Carlos Lago and Elana Scherr find out how the new Hyundai Sonata compares to the Honda Accord .
The Honda Accord has been Edmunds ’ top recommendation to most shoppers looking for a midsize sedan , but the new Hyundai Sonata looks to be a competent challenger on style , value and features .
In this comparison , we determine which one is worth your dollar .
I heard a comment from a developer the other day :
You do n’t need indexes on small tables .
So I asked what the definition of a small table was .
He said , anything with a few hundred rows .
So I said , 2300 rows ?
Well ….. 24000 rows ?
Well ….. 292000 rows ?
That ’s large .
I showed him unindexed queries in his application dealing with tables that had 2300 , 24000 and 292000 rows .
Avoid tablescans
When MySQL deals with a query that is unindexed , it does a full tablescan to see if each record in the table meets the criteria specified .
On a small table , if the query is executed frequently , the MySQL query cache might be able to serve the query .
However , on a larger table , or a table with large rows , it must read every row , check the fields , possibly create a temporary table in ram or disk , and return the results .
On a small site , you might not notice it , but , on a large system , forcing tablescans on tables with even a few thousand rows will slow things down considerably :
Uptime : 60016 Threads : 11 Questions : 105460332 Slow queries : 197769 Opens : 5819 Flush tables : 1 Open tables : 1320 Queries per second avg : 1757.204
Slow queries are sometimes unavoidable , but , often , slow queries are missing an index .
Use the slow - query log to find potential issues
When analyzing a system to find problems , putting :
log -queries - not - using - indexes
in the my.cnf file and restarting mysql will log the unindexed queries to the slowquery log .
What can be indexed ?
The rule of thumb when writing indexes is to write your query in such a way that you reduce the result set as quickly as possible , with the highest cardinality possible .
What does this mean ?
If you are collecting data of the IP address and the Date , your query against date , ip will actually be worse than ip , date .
Imagine receiving 40000 hits to your site on the same date .
If you were looking for the number of hits that a particular IP had , you would search the 41 hits they have made over time , and then the 8 that they had today .
If you queried by date , ip , you would search 40000 rows then would receive the 8 they had today .
Each index you have , adds extra overhead and an index file should be as small as possible .
IP addresses can be represented in an unsigned int which takes much less space than the varchar ( 15 ) usually used .
Remember when you index a varchar field , indexing will spacepad the key to the full length .
If you have a variable length field you want indexed , you might be able to figure out the significant portion of that field by finding the average length and adding a few characters for good measure and indexing fieldname ( 15 ) rather than the entire field .
If a query is longer than the 15 characters , you have still created a significant reduction in the number of rows that it must check .
Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of the data .
The more unique the data , the lower the chance that you ’ll have thousands of records that match the first criteria .
When the data is very similar , the index as built on disk will become imbalanced resulting in slower queries .
Since MyISAM and InnoDB use a B - Tree index ( or R - Tree if you use a spatial index ) , data that is similar when inserted , can create a very imbalanced tree which leads to slower lookups .
An optimize table can resort and reindex the table to eliminate this , but , you ca n’t do that on an extremely large , active table without impacting response times .
# Query_time : 0 Lock_time : 0 Rows_sent : 1 Rows_examined : 3323
SELECT * FROM websites_geo where ( zoneid = ‘ 5135 ’ ) LIMIT 1 ;
In this case , zoneid is not indexed on the table websites_geo .
Adding an index on zoneid eliminates the tablescan on this query .
Check for equality , not inequality .
An index can only check equality .
A query checking to see if values are not equal , cannot be indexed .
# Query_time : 0 Lock_time : 0 Rows_sent : 5 Rows_examined : 2548
SELECT * FROM websites where ( id = ‘ 1056692 ’ && status != ‘ d ’ && status != ‘n ’) order by rand ( ) LIMIT 5 ; # Query_time : 0 Lock_time : 0 Rows_sent : 10 Rows_examined : 2544
SELECT * FROM websites where ( status != ‘ n ’ && status != ‘ d’ && traffic > 3000 ) order by added desc LIMIT 10 ;
These two queries show two different issues , but , deal with the same fundamental issue .
First , id is not indexed which would have at least limited the result set to 9 records rather than 2548 .
The status check is n’t able to use an index .
On the second query , status is checked followed by traffic .
There are other queries issued that check status , traffic , clicks_high .
When we look at status ( which should be an enum or char ( 1 ) rather than varchar ( 1 ) ) , we find that there are only 4 values used .
By indexing on id , status and status , traffic , clicks_high , we could alter the queries as such :
SELECT * FROM websites where ( id = ‘ 1056692 ’ && status in ( ‘ g ’ , ’ ‘ ) ) order by rand ( ) LIMIT 5 ; SELECT * FROM websites where ( status in ( ‘ g ’ , ’ ‘) && traffic > 3000 ) order by added desc LIMIT 10 ;
which would result in both queries using an index .
Choose your data types intelligently .
As a secondary point , id ( though it is numeric ) happens to be a text field .
If you index id in this case , you would have to specify a key length .
mysql > select max( length ( id ) ) from websites ;
+ — — ———–+
| max( length ( id ) ) |
+ — — ———–+
| 22 |
+ — — ———–+
1 row in set ( 0.02 sec ) mysql > select avg ( length ( id ) ) from websites ;
+ — — ———–+
| avg( length ( id ) ) |
+ — — ———–+
| 8.3315 |
+ — — ———–+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec ) mysql >
Based on this , we might decide to set the key length to 22 as it is a relatively small number and allows room to grow .
Personally , I would have opted to have the id be an unsigned int which would be much smaller , but , the application developer uses alphanumeric id ’s which are exposed externally .
With sharding , you could use the id throughout the various tables , or , you could map the text id to a numeric id internally for all of the various tables .
There are a number of possible solutions to help any SQL engine perform better .
And your data set will dictate some of the things that you can do to make data access quicker .
Helping MySQL Help You
If you do select * from table where condition_a=1 and condition_b=2 in one place , and select * from table where condition_b=2 and condition_a=1 , setting up a single index on condition_a , condition_b and adjusting your second query , reversing the conditions to the same order as the keys on the index will increase performance .
Limit your results
Another thing that will help considerably is using a limit clause .
So many times a programmer will do : select * from table where condition_a=1 which returns 2300 rows but only the first few rows are used .
A limit clause will prevent a lot of data from being fetched by MySQL and buffered waiting for the response .
select * from table where condition_a=1 limit 20 would hand you the first 20 records .
Avoid reading the data file , do all your work from the Index
Additionally , if you have a table and only need three of the columns from the result , select fielda , fieldb , fieldc from table where condition_a=1 will return only the three fields .
As an added boost , if the fields you are checking can be answered from the index , the query will never hit the actual data file and will be answered from the index .
Many times
I ’ve added a field that was n’t needed in the index , just to eliminate the lookup of the key in the index then the corresponding read of the data file .
Let MySQL do the work
MySQL reads tables , filters results , can do some calculations .
Going through 40000 records to pick the best 100 is still faster in MySQL than allowing PHP to fetch 40000 rows and do calculations and sorts to come up with that 100 rows .
Index , optimize , and allow MySQL to do the database work .
Summary
Making MySQL work more efficiently goes a long way towards making your database driven site work better .
Adding six indexes to the system resulted in quicker response times and an increase in the transactions per second .
Uptime : 32405 Threads : 1 Questions : 58729705 Slow queries : 64122 Opens : 2911 Flush tables : 1 Open tables : 295 Queries per second avg : 1812.366
Previously , MySQL was generating 3.26 slow queries per second .
Now we ’re just beneath 2 slow queries per second and our system is processing 55 more transactions per second .
There is still a bit more analysis to do to identify the slow queries that are still running and to alter the queries to reverse the inequality checks , but , even just adding indexes to a few tables has helped noticeably .
Once the developer is able to make some changes to the application , I ’m sure we ’ll see an additional speedup .

ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Switzerland has vowed to prevent UBS from handing over client information to U.S. authorities , in an attempt to defend bank secrecy , saying a tax case targeting its main bank is souring diplomatic ties .
The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at the company 's office at the Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich July 1 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
Wealth management giant UBS is facing a court hearing in Miami next week after refusing to disclose data on 52,000 Americans holders of secret Swiss bank accounts to U.S. tax authorities .
The Swiss Justice Ministry said on Wednesday that Swiss law prevents UBS from handing over client information and the government would seize UBS client data , if necessary , to stop that happening .
The case , which comes amid a global fight against tax cheats supported by the U.S. administration , has damaged the UBS brand and could result in an expensive settlement for the bank at a time when the bank needs to focus on restructuring .
“ Switzerland will use its legal authority to ensure that the bank cannot be pressured to transmit the information illegally , including if necessary by issuing an order taking effective control of the data at UBS , ” the Swiss government said in a response to U.S. authorities filed in Miami on Tuesday .
The tax litigation is also crucial for the future of the multi-billion dollar wealth management industry and is pushing several offshore banks to force clients to come clean .
A court hearing that will lead to a ruling on the UBS data issue is due to start on July 13 .
Washington has accused UBS of hiding nearly $ 15 billion in assets in secret accounts .
The Swiss statement came in response to a filing by the U.S. Justice Department last week asking the Miami court to enforce tax compliance with the full weight of U.S. law .
Although Swiss criminal law prohibits banks passing on client information to foreign authorities , UBS and Switzerland have already made concessions on their treasured bank secrecy .
UBS agreed to pay in February $ 780 million , admitted wrongdoing and disclosed about 250 client names to avert tax fraud criminal charges the Swiss government said threatened the bank ’s survival .
And faced with the threat of possible sanctions from the G20 , Switzerland -- along with other tax havens -- vowed in March to redraft its tax treaties with the United States and other countries and cooperate more on tax evasion .
“ INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT ”
Switzerland said in its latest court filing it hoped it would not have to take the “ extraordinary action ” of issuing an order to seize the UBS client data .
“ The IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) now inappropriately seeks to provoke international conflict through this civil proceeding , ” the statement read .
In its brief last week , the Justice Department said that UBS had already acknowledged that its bankers committed “ very serious crimes on U.S. soil ” and had therefore subjected the bank to the full jurisdiction of U.S. law .
“ Swiss banking secrecy is not an impenetrable wall , ” it said .
But Berne said the fact that UBS had released some names in settling the criminal case and admitted wrongdoing did not undermine the legitimacy of Swiss banking secrecy as a whole .
Although the court hearing is due next week , the Swiss government has not ruled out the possibility of UBS and Washington agreeing another out - of - court settlement .
Swiss Finance Minister Hans - Rudolf
Merz has repeatedly said there is still room for a deal and Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that it expected UBS to pay a price as the bank had made mistakes .
Swiss media have said UBS may have to pay 3 - 5 billion Swiss francs ( $ 2.76 - $ 4.6 billion ) .
The bank raised 3.8 billion francs of capital late in June and will report earnings on August 4 .
“ As the whole story is about money and as UBS has already admitted its fault , there can be only one solution : the Swiss bank will have to pay a fine or a compensation of an amount corresponding to taxes that are still due to the U.S. government ” said Nicolas Michellod , senior analyst at Celent .
UBS shares fell 1.7 percent at 12.8 francs at 0849 GMT against a 1.2 percent drop in the European banking index .
People who persist in swapping copyrighted films and music will have their internet connections cut off under tough new laws to be proposed by the government today .
The measures also include taking the power to target illegal downloaders away from regulator Ofcom and giving it to ministers to speed up the process .
The decision to cut off peer - to - peer filesharers is unexpected since it was ruled out by the government 's own Digital Britain report in June as going too far .
In the report , the then communications minister Lord Carter said illegal filesharers should receive letters warning them their activities could leave them open to prosecution .
If that failed to reduce piracy by at least 70 % , Ofcom would have the power to call on internet companies such as BT to introduce so - called " technical measures " to combat piracy .
The most draconian of these measures was to slow down a persistent filesharer 's broadband connection , but it would not appear until 2012 .
But today the government will take the unusual step of proposing much stricter rules midway through the Digital Britain consultation process .
Illegal filesharers will still get warning letters but if they continue to swap copyrighted material they could have their internet connection temporarily severed , although it may be possible to retain basic access to online public services .
A similar law in France under which filesharers could be cut off for up to a year was recently kicked out by the country 's highest court as unconstitutional .
In the UK , privacy groups are likely to challenge any similar legislation as contrary to human rights law .
The power to introduce technical measures , meanwhile , will rest with the secretary of state , not Ofcom and their introduction will not rely upon an arbitrary 70 % reduction in piracy but be up to the minister 's discretion as he tries to secure the future of the UK 's creative industries .
" The previous proposals , whilst robust , would take an unacceptable amount of time to complete in a situation that calls for urgent action , " according to a draft of the government 's new plan .
The surprise move will intensify speculation that Lord Mandelson reached a secret deal to protect the film and music industries with Hollywood mogul David Geffen earlier this month .
The business secretary met Geffen , founder of Asylum Records and the man who set up DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg , at a private dinner with members of the Rothschild banking dynasty at the family 's holiday villa on Corfu .
Following that meeting with Geffen , a long - term and outspoken opponent of online piracy , Mandelson instructed officials at his Department of Business Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , charged with tackling online piracy by June 's report , to clampdown even harder on the pirates .
Last night , a BIS spokesperson said there was no discussion of online piracy when Mandelson met Geffen and there is no connection between that meeting and the government 's new proposals on illegal filesharing .
The music and film industries had campaigned hard to have measures introduced earlier than 2012 and the fact that persistent pirates can be cut off is likely to be welcomed .
The UK 's internet service providers , however , will be less pleased by the plans .
Several have made it quite plain they have no desire to police the web on behalf of another industry .
They will be particularly annoyed that the government reckons the cost of technical measures should be borne by the ISPs and it wants that enshrined in the autumn 's Digital Economy bill .
The content industry , meanwhile , will continue to pick up the tab for identifying illegal filesharers and preparing enough information for them to be targeted by the ISPs , while the costs of the letter - writing campaign will be split equally .

First of all , let ’s dispense with one of the sillier claims circulating about this topic :
The good folks at Kentucky Fried Chicken were allegedly breeding “ mutant ” chickens with extra-large breasts and additional legs ( four , six , or eight , depending on which variation of this wacky legend you heard ) .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration stepped in and told Kentucky Fried Chicken that the genetically engineered creatures they were producing on their poultry farms could not legally be marketed as “ chicken . ”
Rather than give up the lucrative sales of meat from their big - breasted , multi-legged fowl to adhere to FDA regulations , the company deftly sidestepped the problem by changing their name to “ KFC , ” thus eliminating all mention of the word “ chicken ” from their menu and advertisements .
Obviously , this tale is complete hokum , one of the many business legends concerning attempts to avoid government regulations through the expedient of a deceptive name change .
( Other examples include the town in Japan that supposedly changed its name to “ Usa ” so that it could stamp “ Made in USA ” on its exports , or the meat company that chose “ 100 % Beef ” as its moniker so that it could ship sub - standard beef in boxes marked “ 100 % Beef . ” )
Back to our story :
In 1991 , Kentucky Fried chicken announced that it was officially changing its name to “ KFC ” ( as well as updating its packaging and logo with a more modern , sleeker look ) .
The public relations reason given for the name change was that health - conscious consumers associated the word “ fried ” with “ unhealthy ” and “ high cholesterol , ” causing some of them to completely shun the wide variety of “ healthy ” menu items being introduced at Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets .
The new title and image were designed to lure back customers to a restaurant now offering foods branded as “ better for you , ” we were told .
It sounded good , but the real reason behind the shift to KFC had nothing to do with healthy food or finicky consumers : it was about money — money that Kentucky Fried Chicken would have had to pay to continue using their original name .
In 1990 , the Commonwealth of Kentucky , mired in debt , took the unusual step of trademarking their name .
Henceforth , anyone using the word “ Kentucky ” for business reasons — inside or outside of the state — would have to obtain permission and pay licensing fees to the Commonwealth of Kentucky .
It was an unusual and brilliant scheme to alleviate government debt , but it was also one that alienated one of the most famous companies ever associated with Kentucky .
The venerable Kentucky Fried Chicken chain , a mainstay of American culture since its first franchise opened in Salt Lake City in 1952 , refused as a matter of principle to pay royalties on a name they had been using for four decades .
After a year of fruitless negotiations with the Kentucky state government , Kentucky Fried Chicken — unwilling to submit to “ such a terrible injustice ” — threw in the towel and changed their name instead , timing the announcement to coincide with the introduction of new packaging and products to obscure the real reasons behind the altering of their corporate name .
Kentucky Fried Chicken were not the only ones who bravely refused to knuckle under .
The name of the most famous horse race in North America , held every year at Churchill Downs , was changed from the “ Kentucky Derby ” to “ The Run for the Roses ” for similar reasons ; many seed and nursery outfits that had previously offered Kentucky Bluegrass switched to a product known as “ Shenendoah Bluegrass ” instead ; and Neil Diamond ’s song “ Kentucky Woman ” was dropped from radio playlists at his request , as the licensing fees he was obligated to pay the Commonwealth of Kentucky exceeded the peformance royalties he was receiving for the airplay .
Update :
In November 2006 , KFC and the State of Kentucky finally reached an undisclosed settlement over the former ’s use of the trademarked word “ Kentucky , ” and the restaurant chain announced it would be resuming its former name of “ Kentucky Fried Chicken . ”

Instead , Barrett praised the actions of his 20 - year - old niece , Molly Flood , who called 911 after Barrett 's attacker had knocked the mayor 's phone from his hand and smashed it on the street .
The mayor appeared remarkably collected and fit , considering the seriousness of his injuries .
" Molly is my hero , " Barrett said .
It was his first public appearance since the attack .
He spoke at a news conference before an unusually large gathering of news media and well - wishers in front of his Washington Heights home on the city 's west side .
The assault happened as Barrett , his sister Betsy Barrett Flood , Molly Flood and two of Barrett 's daughters were walking to their car near State Fair Park in West Allis .
Barrett responded to a woman 's call for help by pulling out his cell phone to call 911 , he said .
" I can't think of a situation like this where people would not have responded as I did , " Barrett said .
" When someone says , ' Call 911 , ' you call 911 , " Barrett said .
" It 's that straightforward . "
What came next was unexpected and " bizarre , " he said .
Barrett 's vision was focused on the woman and her 1 - year - old grandchild , and he was blindsided by his attacker , who ran at him from his right side , said Patrick Curley , Barrett 's chief of staff .
The man smashed Barrett 's cell phone , said he had a gun and would " shoot everyone , " Curley said .
Barrett then doubled over from punches to the stomach , but he refused to lie on the sidewalk , as ordered by the attacker , Curley said .
Instead , Barrett rose and took a punch at the man .
That 's apparently how the mayor suffered multiple fractures to his hand , said Curley .
The man may have blocked Barrett 's swing with a steel baton that the attacker also used to strike the mayor in the face and head , Curley said .
Barrett said he was staying home this week to rest and keep doctors ' appointments .
He had been slated to be on vacation .
Aside from the cast on his right hand and a visible scar on his cheek and lip , Barrett betrayed few visible signs of the trauma he suffered .
He lost a few teeth , had cuts on his head and multiple fractures to his right hand .
Barrett , who is right - handed , said that injury was likely his most serious .
Charges expected
A 20 - year - old man , Anthony J. Peters , is being held in connection with the attack on the mayor .
Prosecutors expect to charge Peters on Thursday , according to the Milwaukee County district attorney 's office .
Peters was arrested Sunday by Milwaukee police and held in their custody until Tuesday , when he was booked into the Milwaukee County Jail , according to jail records .
He is being held in lieu of $ 25,000 bail on suspicion of first - degree reckless injury while armed , a felony , and on warrants issued this summer in connection with bail - jumping and disorderly conduct charges .
Peters ' mother has described her son as " borderline psychotic " and off his medication during an interview with WTMJ - TV ( Channel 4 ) .
Barrett said the woman 's suggestion that the mayor had somehow provoked her son was " pretty bizarre . "
The mayor did n't mention Peters by name .
As the attack progressed , Barrett said , he thought , " This is bad , this is really , really bad . "
He declined to delve much into specifics of what happened , saying he did n't want to compromise the criminal case .
Barrett explained that he did n't have security personnel when he attended the State Fair because family members decided to have an impromptu gathering , and his niece wanted to see a band playing there .
" This was a spur - of - the - moment decision to , in essence , have a family reunion with my siblings , " Barrett said .
Barrett was greeted by applause from a couple of dozen neighbors when he emerged from his home Wednesday and again when he finished the news conference .
He said he appreciated the many kind words and thoughts , including a get - well call from President Barack Obama .
" We are on the mend , " Barrett told reporters .
" I just wanted to let you know I was still standing . "
Barrett did not say anything about whether he might run for governor next year , an opportunity that opened up with Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle 's decision not to seek re-election .
Curley told reporters before the news conference that Barrett would n't talk about it .
Barrett has been prominently mentioned as a possible Democratic candidate next year .
He 'll consider the possibility of running , Curley said .
Some of Barrett 's neighbors said they thought he should run for governor , a post he unsuccessfully sought in 2002 when he lost a primary to Doyle .
" I think he is a hero , " said neighbor Denise Edmund .

Just some of the 49 acres in which the Creation Museum is set
By Peter Jackson
BBC News
While celebrations are on - going this year to mark Charles Darwin 's bicentenary , there 's at least one place that wo n't be toasting his memory - a creationist museum in Kentucky , US .
There are tail - wagging animatronic dinosaurs , a special effects cinema , a planetarium and a petting zoo .
As museums go , the Creation Museum in Petersburg is not short on attractions .
And it does n't want for space either .
Set in 49 acres of well - groomed grounds - that 's 35 more than London 's Natural History Museum - this is the biggest creationist museum in the United States .
Behind it all is a Christian ministry , Answers in Genesis , committed to spreading its belief that the universe was created by direct acts of God over six days , less than 10,000 years ago .
The museum , which cost $ 27 m ( £ 17 m ) to build , opened two years ago .
And while millions of people the world over will spend 2009 celebrating Charles Darwin 's memory - it 's 200 years since he was born and 150 years since his seminal work ,
On the Origin of Species , which set out his theory of evolution , was published - many others will side with this museum 's theme : " Life does n't evolve around Darwin . "
Why is Darwin buried with kings at Westminster Abbey ?
He 's not a king
Robert Mailloux
The Creation Museum is the uncompromising vision of Australian - born evangelical Ken Ham , who aims to " expose the bankruptcy of evolutionary ideas " and " enable Christians to defend their faith " .
The ministry he founded also distances itself from " intelligent design " , the theory that creatures exist of such complexity they could not have evolved as a result of natural selection .
To Mr Ham , that theory provides " good scientific arguments to challenge the idea life could evolve by chance " but ultimately does not question evolution or promote creation " as the Bible teaches " .
Answers
In Genesis is not alone in rejecting evolution - creationism has its supporters in the UK .
A 2006 survey for the BBC's Horizon programme , found a fifth of people polled were convinced by the creationist argument and just less than half accepted evolution as the best description for the development of life .
' Creationist in training '
And Britain has its own creationist museum , in Portsmouth , Hampshire .
But its size and popularity is dwarfed by that of its Kentucky counterpart .
The former claims 50,000 visitors in nine years , compared with the latter 's 700,000 in less than two .
So who goes to America 's biggest and best attended creationist museum and why ?
Dan Schoonmaker , 26 , drove 11 hours from Alabama with his family after his wife Kristy heard about the museum in a Bible class .
The Army helicopter pilot ( who as a member of the military gets in free ) described himself as a " creationist in training " , admitting it needed " a lot of faith " .
" I personally do n't know , but natural selection seems to be the only thing people go on .
It should be more open , " he says .
" There are sometimes better explanations for things , I mean people thought the earth was flat . "
Theories other than evolutionary science should be given more prominence and there should be an option to study creationism in schools , with parents given the choice , he believes .
" I 'm a creationist in training , I do n't really go to church but I 'm curious about Genesis . "
Robert Mailloux , 68 , flew 1,200 miles from his home in Colorado Springs just to visit the museum .
The retired businessman dismisses Darwin 's theory as " not even a low grade hypothesis " and said it had " no substantial science " in it .
" The Bible says God created the Earth in six days and we flat believe that .
There are over 100 ways science is able to look at the Earth and 90 say it is thousands of years old - only 10 say it 's real old . "
He adds : " The way liberals and evolutionists win an argument is to outlaw freedom of speech ... they wo n't let us in .
Why is Darwin buried with kings at Westminster Abbey ?
He 's not a king .
He 's the king of the atheists ' movement , of people who do n't want to deal with the guilt that 's put on them by sin ... it 's a weight and a bondage , they become their own God . "
Laurie Geesey , 57 , made the 560 - mile trip from Wisconsin the night before with her husband Richard .
The former high school teacher , who says she believes God created " everything visible and invisible " , feels people look down on her views " especially under the current [ White House ] administration " .
" It interferes with their lifestyle , you know ' If it feels good go ahead and do it ' - the Bible does n't teach that , " she says .
In fact , she 's not sure Darwin believed his own theory .
Husband Richard Geesey , 67 , a retired university professor , says he was " very impressed " by the museum and liked the fact that scriptures backed up the exhibits .
" I believe in a lot of this and wanted to see how accurate it was , " he says .
" I believe the Earth is around 5,500 years old .
If you do n't believe in Genesis , you do n't believe in anything else . "
Scott Rubin , 42 , says he turned to God late in life .
The father - of - three , from Chicago , was a business consultant when he " had an encounter with Jesus " and became a youth pastor .
" Evolution is a good theory , I do n't believe in it , but parts of it are sensible and parts of creationism are sensible , " he says .
" When it comes down to it , how can you know for sure ?
What I do know is God 's changed my life .
I believe God created the world in six days , I do believe that . "
Mr Rubin , who is visiting the museum ahead of a baseball game in his home town of Cincinnati , says he grew up in the church but did not pay much attention to it .
" I never intended to be the church guy .
It makes sense why people believe in evolution , especially if they 've not had the encounter with Jesus I 've had . "
Mr Rubin 's sign - off sentiments could be taken as a conciliatory gesture to those who would beg to differ with his views .
But what do creationists make of the scientific evidence that claims to undermine their theories ?
The most recent such finding , a " 47 - million - year - old fossil " of a primate , called Ida , may have given scientists a " fresh insight " into evolution - but followers of Answers In Genesis are having none of it .
President and founder Ken Ham stayed resolutely silent about the fossil , called Darwinius masillae , which scientists believe was linked to an early human ancestor .
Meanwhile , the ministry 's website stated : " Because the fossil is similar to a modern lemur , it 's unlikely creationists need any interpretation of the ' missing link ' other than it was a small , tailed , probably tree - climbing , and now extinct primate from a kind created on Day Six of Creation Week .

PROVIDENCE , R.I. , June 7 ( UPI ) --
A planned union picket line by city firefighters has prompted U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to cancel a trip to Providence , R.I. , officials said .
Biden and several high - ranking members of the Obama administration were to attend next weekend 's annual U.S. Conference of Mayors in the city , but White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday the administration has agreed to a request to not cross a planned picket line , the Providence Journal reported .

The newspaper said the request from Providence Fire Fighters Local 799 comes as a blow to Mayor David Cicilline , a member of the mayoral group 's advisory board who had lobbied hard to bring the conference to the Rhode Island capital for the first time .
The White House move means U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and several Cabinet members in addition to Biden will not be attending .
" I 'm disappointed we wo n't have the opportunity to meet with members of the administration , " Cicilline told reporters Friday .
" I 'm disappointed they wo n't be here . "
Contract disputes between the firefighters and the city have been going on for nearly a decade , the Journal said .
The city reportedly has resolved about six of the 10 years ' worth of unresolved contracts .
Middle East Quarterly SUMMER 2009  VOLUME 16 : NUMBER 3 Western Sahara and the Self - Determination Debate https://www.meforum.org/2400/western-sahara-self-determination
The dispute over Western Sahara , a sparsely - populated territory along the Atlantic coast between Morocco and Mauritania , is as much a struggle over the potency of international law as it is a row over land .
The right to national self - determination , it is often argued , dictates a pathway out of the current diplomatic stalemate .
This path could be taken by holding a United Nations - supervised plebiscite to enable the territory 's residents to determine their own political future .
[ 1 ]
Yet , from a legal perspective , national self - determination does not necessarily offer a one - size - fits - all remedy , let alone a helpful framework , for the settlement of conflicting claims and grievances over disputed territories .
King Mohammed V ( L ) successfully negotiated with France for Moroccan independence , granted in February 1956 .
Following independence , Morocco also worked to liberate the southern provinces of Western Sahara from Spanish colonial rule .
Here , the king greets President Dwight D. Eisenhower on his visit to Morocco , December 22 , 1959 .
While Western Sahara is hardly at the forefront of U.S. or European policy , any resolution to its claims will be important as it may create a precedent for Palestinian claims to national self - determination in territories disputed with Israel , or to Kurdish claims to self - determination in Turkish , Syrian , Iraqi , and Iranian territory .
Proponents of nationalist struggle or secession often argue that their cause is not only just but is validated by national self - determination .
This they conceive of as an unassailable principle of international law justifying not only the ends but also any means used to achieve them .
However , not only is the common conception of self - determination incomplete in international law , but it has actually hampered international law 's development as an authoritative body of law capable of resolving disputes between countries .
Western Sahara 's Troubled History While Western Sahara is hardly at the forefront of U.S. or European policy , any resolution to its claims will be important as it may create a precedent for Palestinian claims to national self - determination in territories disputed with Israel , or to Kurdish claims to self - determination in Turkish , Syrian , Iraqi , and Iranian territory .

This they conceive of as an unassailable principle of international law justifying not only the ends but also any means used to achieve them .
However , not only is the common conception of self - determination incomplete in international law , but it has actually hampered international law 's development as an authoritative body of law capable of resolving disputes between countries .
Western Sahara hugs the Atlantic Coast between Morocco and Mauritania .
It is more than twice the size of New York state , but the Central Intelligence Agency estimates its population at just over 400,000 , only about one - fiftieth of that of New York and less than that of any single U.S. state or the District of Columbia .
[ 2 ]
More than half of Western Sahara 's population lives in Laayoune , a small town just thirty miles from the internationally - recognized Moroccan border .
The territory is as desolate in resources as it is in population .
There is no arable land and while the region boasts phosphate deposits , much of its economic potential comes from fishing off its 700 - mile coastline .
The marginality of the land condemned the region to peripheral status in history .
While empires rose and fell to the north , south , and east , Western Sahara was always a backwater .
Caravans passed through the territory , tribes slowly Islamized , and various North African Islamic dynasties — the Berber Almoravids ( 1040 - 1147 ) and Almohads ( 1121 -1269 ) , for example , exerted some control .
Nevertheless , the region remained largely nomadic and free from central authority .
Spain seized the territory after the 1884 Berlin Conference and while Madrid sent governors and engaged in some construction , the area proved less profitable than other European colonies and little development occurred .
Spain finally abandoned its territory in 1975 , after which both Morocco and Mauritania — each stating historical claims but motivated more by a hope that the territory would hold oil — claimed the region .
Morocco went further , however , and sent Moroccan settlers into the region .
While natives of the region and international backers continue to argue that Western Sahara should be independent , Rabat has firmly insisted that the territory should remain under its control .
What Is the Principle of Self - Determination ?
The notion of self - determination as a universal principle , whether viewed through a political , moral , or legal lens , has been , and continues to be imprecise and in dire need of further clarification .
U.S. president Woodrow Wilson understood self - determination to be the belief that every people had the right to select its own form of government , to " choose the sovereignty under which they shall live , " and thus be free of alien masters . [ 3 ]
Although there was initially disagreement as to who precisely is the " self " to which the right of self - determination refers , the Versailles Peace Conference linked self - determination with the " principle of nationalities , " or an ethnographic view of the " self . " [ 4 ]
While Palestinians , Kurds , and other peoples without an independent state like to root their claims to sovereignty in the United Nations , the U.N. Charter added little clarity to existing notions of self - determination in international law .
The document refers only twice to the " principle of equal rights and self - determination of peoples , " and then only in a preamble to a statement of the broader purpose of the organization .
[ 5 ]
Such passing references stand in stark contrast to the operative principles of the charter that spoke of the need for its member states to refrain from " the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state " and ruled out U.N. intervention in " matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . " [ 6 ]
It was not until 1960 with the passage of the U.N. Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [ 7 ] that self - determination began to develop coherence as a principle .
It envisioned full self - determination as a goal for all peoples subject to " alien subjugation , domination , and exploitation , " intolerable political living conditions which it identifies as a denial of a people 's fundamental human rights .
[ 8 ]
This theory of self - determination presumed that the majority of inhabitants in any colony would be free to choose their future political status although the integrity of established national boundaries would continue to be respected . [ 9 ]
Third World leaders , putting aside tribal claims that could result in a wholesale redrawing of maps , largely accepted the importance of recognized borders .
Such boundaries were viewed as the essential building blocks of stable self - government , helping to guard against the absorption by another state or the dismemberment of a territory against the will of the majority of its inhabitants .
[ 10 ] U.N. General Assembly resolutions 1514 and 1541 set out three means by which a territory could achieve self - government .
These were emergence as a sovereign independent state , free association with an independent state , or integration with an independent state . [ 11 ]
The 1970 Declaration of the U.N. Special Committee on Friendly Relations reinforced the position that there were legitimate outcomes of self - determination apart from independence , so long as these outcomes reflected the freely expressed choice of people in colonized territories . [ 12 ]
The creation in 1961 of the U.N. Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples set out a supervisory role for the U.N. in the final stages of the self - determination process .
In this process , a colonial power would request that the U.N. supervise a self - determination referendum so as to ensure an orderly transition through decolonization to whatever form of state the local population chose . [ 13 ]
The uncertain status of self - determination in international law continues to spark debate .
An early community of legal " formalists " argued that self - determination was incompatible with international law because all states with a right to membership in the international system were already members . [ 14 ]
Under such logic , Bosnia , Kosovo , and East Timor , should not enjoy independence .
Other international legal scholars argue that the concept of self - determination may not yet be a legal norm , but it is nevertheless necessary to recognize that it is evolving in that direction .
In the post - World War II era , " equality theory " became predominant .
Its proponents held that the right of dominated peoples to achieve equality in relation to those who dominate them removed self - determination from the realm of abstract legal norms and transformed it into a universal right ( although one applied selectively to instances in which a non-Western population has been subject to European colonial domination ) .
[ 15 ]
Not all scholars and officials accept equality theory , however .
Critics point out the arbitrariness used in determining the " colonial " or " alien " label . [ 16 ]
Ali Mazrui , a scholar of African studies and director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at Binghamton University , for example , noted that " the definition of colonialism as subjugation to alien rule " has been " of a very relative character , " depending " not on whether the ruler is alien , but on whether in being alien … [ he ] is also European . " [ 17 ]
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly in 1961 , Lord Home , then - foreign secretary of the United Kingdom , articulated this concern , asking , " Is there to be one principle for Asia and Africa and another for Europe ?
One rule for the British Commonwealth and another for the Russian Empire ?
I thought if a principle was anything , it was universal . " [ 18 ]
Likewise , Thomas Franck , an emeritus professor of law at New York University , argued that drawing artificial distinctions between situations that are otherwise so similar eroded the legitimacy of the concept and called for it to be applied coherently and consistently if it were to be hailed as law . [ 19 ]
Some scholars have questioned whether a decolonization or equality model for self - determination has outlived its usefulness .
Gerry Simpson , a professor of public international law at the London School of Economics , argued that " the decolonization model is a demonstrably unwieldy and inflexible device " when applied to cases of " indigenous , nationalist , secessionist , democratic , and devolutionary self - determination . " [ 20 ]
Situations involving minority populations seeking to secede from a sovereign state also render irrelevant traditional conceptions of self - determination . [ 21 ]
In such cases , in the absence of a history of Western colonization of that territory , the doctrine of uti possidetis ( the maintenance of colonial borders ) prevails over any conflicting interest in achieving ethnic autonomy . [ 22 ]
Thus , until the Russian invasion in 2008 resolved the matter by force , international lawyers could not assist the desire of South Ossetians in Georgia to unite with their kin in Russia . [ 23 ]
The era of decolonization has largely passed .
Today , fresh ethno-national conflicts within established states have called into question how useful the traditional conception of self - determination is .
Moreover , they raise questions about whether any international legal consensus can provide guidance in situations that involve states ruling over adjacent territories .
The short answer to those questions is " no " as reflected in the discrepancy between the strong international support for self - determination in East Timor ( Timor Leste ) , which gained its independence from Indonesia in 2002 , and more muted calls for self - determination in such classic cases as Kashmir and Western Sahara . [ 24 ]
The Western Sahara Case Western Sahara provides an interesting test case in just how divided the world remains on whether to support self - determination in a territory amid a neighboring state 's irredentist claims . [ 25 ]
In the case of Western Sahara , for example , Morocco and Mauritania have laid claim to its territory even as Spain and Algeria support its independence .
The paralysis in resolving the Western Sahara dispute is a result , on the one hand , of battlefield reality and , on the other , the fact that , despite the passage of time and the consequent development of the law in response to new realities , there are no objective criteria that would lead to the preference of one claim over another . [ 26 ]
Claims to Western Sahara are multilayered .
The Berlin Conference , hosted by Otto von Bismarck in November 1884 for the purpose of carving up the African continent among the European powers , ended with the Western Sahara territory allocated to Spain .
Spain colonized the territory in 1884 and held it as a Spanish protectorate .
From 1961 onwards , Spain administered Western Sahara as a non-self - governing territory under Chapter XI of the U.N. Charter .
This implicitly recognized the right of its inhabitants to self - determination . [ 27 ]
Meanwhile , neighboring Morocco gained its independence from France in 1956 , and Algeria followed soon after in 1962 .
In 1966 , the U.N. General Assembly reaffirmed the right to self - determination of the peoples of the Spanish Sahara [ 28 ] and requested Spain , in consultation with other interested parties including the governments of Morocco and Mauritania , to establish procedures " for the holding of a referendum under United Nations auspices with a view to enabling the indigenous population of the Territory to exercise freely its right to self - determination . " [ 29 ]
Spain , Morocco , and Mauritania , however , essentially colluded to postpone the referendum . [ 30 ]
After Spain announced that it would hold a referendum under U.N. auspices in 1975 , the U.N. General Assembly , at Morocco 's urging , requested that the International Court of Justice determine two things : " (1 ) Was Western Sahara … at the time of colonization by Spain a territory belonging to no one ( terra nullius ) ? " and , if not , " (2 ) What were the legal ties between this territory and the Kingdom of Morocco and the Mauritanian entity ? " [ 31 ]
Spain and Algeria took the position that the " questions formulated … were , from a legal standpoint , ambiguous , incomplete , and irrelevant , since they failed to take into account the development of contemporary international law in relation to Non-Self - Governing Territories . " [ 32 ]
Nevertheless , the International Court of Justice accepted the case [ 33 ] and , in an advisory opinion , ruled unanimously on the first question that at the time of colonization by Spain , Western Sahara was not terra nullius . [ 34 ]
As to the second question , the court acknowledged that its opinion on the question of historic title should in no way be seen as detracting from the fundamental right of self - determination of the people of Western Sahara . [ 35 ]
The court ultimately ruled that Morocco and Mauritania did not have a valid claim to Western Sahara based on historic title , dealing a blow to the " automatic retrocession " to their own control which both demanded . [ 36 ]
However , reference to Morocco's " legal ties " to the territory shifted the terms of the debate .
By construing " legal ties " as broader than mere ties of territorial sovereignty , the court " blurred the line between ' self ' and ' territory ' arguments that it had drawn by equating the right of self - determination with the free will of the colonial population , and legal ties with pre-colonial claims to territory . " [ 37 ]
Such a finding arguably weakened rather than bolstered the " strength and universality of the principle of self - determination . " [ 38 ]
From an international law perspective , the court ruling opened the door to arguments that challenged the paradigm framing the rules on the acquisition of sovereignty over territory at the time . [ 39 ]
Abdeslam Maghraoui , a professor of comparative politics at Duke University , divided Morocco 's counter - narrative into three distinct categories : ( 1 ) historical ties of sovereignty between Moroccan sultans and Saharan tribes ; ( 2 ) treaties and colonial records recognizing Morocco 's territorial integrity and its control over the Saharan provinces ; and ( 3 ) Morocco 's efforts to help liberate the southern provinces from Spanish colonial rule after 1956 . [ 40 ]
European states might concentrate power territorially , but Morocco in effect argued that in its nomadic Western Sahara context , tribal and religious connections should be paramount . [ 41 ]
Maghraoui acknowledged that , before European colonization , the authority of Moroccan sultans " did not extend evenly and consistently to all territories they considered to be under their sovereignty " but , nevertheless , he argued that official representatives appointed through royal decrees operated throughout the distant Saharan territories within the framework of the sultan 's administrative apparatus . [ 42 ]
Morocco 's occupation of Western Sahara would , in its view , help reconstitute an empire that it had lost at the time of the Spanish colonization of its territory and thus vindicate its historic title to the territory . [ 43 ]
Rabat 's prioritization of relations between states and tribes interpreted sovereignty according to a pre-modern state structure rather than the modern mechanisms . [ 44 ]
Two justices , Isaac Forster of Senegal and Fouad Ammoun of Lebanon , offered separate opinions that challenged the international court 's pro-Sahrawi independence leanings and instead proposed that the Moroccan counter - narrative , rooted in Morocco 's pre-colonial historical ties of sovereignty to Western Sahara , as well as its claim of decolonization by " reversion to former sovereignty , " [ 45 ] be accorded appropriate emphasis in arriving at the court 's decision .
The Moroccan response was quick .
The day after the international court published its advisory opinion , Morocco put the international community on notice that it would march 350,000 " unarmed civilians " from Morocco southward into Western Sahara " to gain recognition of [ Morocco 's ] right to national unity and territorial integrity . "
It had concluded that , rather than rejecting its historic and legal claims to the territory , the advisory opinion had in fact endorsed them . [ 46 ]
Facts on the ground matter .
Morocco , Mauritania , and Spain initiated tripartite negotiations .
The resulting Madrid agreement amounted to a Spanish endorsement of a decolonization formula that involved partition of the territory between Morocco and Mauritania . [ 47 ]
U.N. General Assembly Resolution 3458A , adopted by the General Assembly on December 10 , 1975 , reaffirmed the right of the inhabitants of Western Sahara to self - determination but also noted the Madrid agreement and called for further consultations with the territory 's population without offering any formal timetable or condemnation of Moroccan actions . [ 48 ]
In effect , this set the stage for decades of stalemate .
Algeria and Morocco , meanwhile , pursued a diplomatic and at times military proxy war over the territory . [ 49 ]
Algeria provided support , for example , to the Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro ( Polisario ) , a guerilla organization that sought to obtain international recognition of the territory 's independence from Morocco .
Algerian policy aimed to keep Moroccan forces bogged down in the territory while harming its neighbor 's standing in the international arena where the rights of the disputing parties were widely debated .
After the Algerian government recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in February 1976 , Morocco broke off diplomatic ties with its eastern neighbor . [ 50 ]
Through the late 1980s , Algeria assisted the Polisario with money , arms , and diplomatic support although Moroccan military superiority ultimately rendered the Polisario little more than a government - in - exile in western Algeria . [ 51 ]
While Morocco and the Polisario agreed , in principle , to a referendum , preparations for this became bogged down in a dispute over the identification of Sahrawis eligible to vote in any self - determination poll .
Former U.S. secretary of state James A. Baker III , acting as personal envoy to U.N. secretary - general Kofi Annan , outlined three possible outcomes of a final status referendum in the territory : independence , autonomy , and full integration into Morocco .
But Rabat continued to balk at any plan that explicitly offered independence . [ 52 ]
Morocco instead proposed creation of a " Sahara Autonomous Region , " which it updated in April 2007 with the introduction of the " Moroccan Initiative for Negotiating an Autonomy Status for the Sahara . " [ 53 ]
While the U.N. Security Council says that the two sides should negotiate without preconditions , [ 54 ] the council has , in fact , itself stated two preconditions : that talks should aim at achieving self - determination for the people of Western Sahara and that the U.N. should be in charge of the referendum . [ 55 ]
Not every organization agrees with the Security Council .
While proponents of Western Sahara 's independence say the dispute should be an open - and - shut case from the perspective of international law , given " the peremptory norm of international law with respect to decolonization , " [ 56 ] a body no less important than the International Crisis Group described the failure to break the deadlock to be the result of what it sees as the U.N. 's continuing focus on self - determination .
Its report maintains :
By continuing to define the issue as self - determination , the U.N. has encouraged the Polisario Front and Algeria to continue to invest all their energy in seeking the realization of this principle and at the same time has pressured the Moroccan government to pay lip service to self - determination , when in reality Rabat has never sincerely subscribed to it .
The U.N. thereby has inhibited the parties to the dispute from exploring the possibility of a resolution based on a different principle or set of principles . [ 57 ]
The International Crisis Group thus recognizes that self - determination is anything but a panacea for the resolution of conflicting sovereignty claims , as it offers a one - size - fits - all solution that may not be appropriate in the case of some present - day conflicts , including that being waged over Western Sahara .
The End of Self - Determination ?
While the latter half of the twentieth century may have marked the predominance of equality theory , that same theory may not be as appropriate for resolving disputes in the twenty - first century .
Claiming an absolute right to full " external " self - determination in the form of complete independence for the Sahrawi people while ignoring Morocco 's interests in the matter has continued to block any meaningful diplomatic compromise .
Within the scholarly community , there is a growing realization that the law of self - determination as crystallized in the era of decolonization is inadequate to deal with modern disputes involving conflicting sovereignties .
Conflagrations along ethno-national divides pit the indigenous inhabitants of former European colonies against each other for control of what were once colonial territories .
Such conflagrations are more prevalent than they were while neocolonial disputes between majority and minority populations in the developing world have increasingly given rise to calls for more equitable treatment within existing states , as opposed to outright secession or independence .
Accordingly , Gregory H. Fox , a visiting professor of law at Wayne State University Law School , notes that " with the effective end of decolonization and the virtually unanimous refusal of states to recognize a right of secession , the legal norm [ of self - determination ] appears to have been deprived of much of its content . " [ 58 ]
According to Fox , trying to understand the right to self - determination within the decolonization period as " a vehicle for independent statehood " has been rendered essentially meaningless .
This has led to a demand that self - determination be re-conceptualized as an " internal " right requiring a " reordering of a state 's domestic law . "
This law operates along the lines of " minority protection regimes , democratic political processes , safeguards for cultural rights , and various forms of federative autonomy , " [ 59 ] but it stops short at redrawing state boundaries made necessary by independence or secession scenarios .
Fox insists that the internal right to self - determination has been slowly gaining acceptance . [ 60 ]
In his view , such a right acts as a general tool that allows a variety of particular rights to be joined together .
This allows us " to demonstrate that a principled coexistence is possible between claims to group autonomy and the maintenance of states ' territorial integrity . "
What must follow , in Fox 's view , is the reframing of the rule of self - determination as a principle permitting greater flexibility in its interpretation and application .
Hurst Hannum , a professor of international law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University , is largely in agreement with Fox and articulates a new vision of self - determination within international law , a vision which " will support creative attempts to deal with conflicts over minority and majority rights before they escalate into civil war and demands for secession . " [ 61 ]
This right to autonomy is not an end in itself but rather a political tool to ensure that the rights and needs of the concerned population are properly addressed in light of their unique goals . [ 62 ]
Self - determination must be addressed as a means to an end rather than an end in itself — " that end being a democratic , participatory political and economic system in which the rights of individuals and the identity of minority communities are protected . " [ 63 ]
For Gerry Simpson , the aim must be to save the principle of self - determination from its " descent into incoherence . "
At the core of its renewal is " the adoption of a more liberal and expansive interpretation of the right , incorporating autonomy , constitutional recognition , devolution , and cultural self - expression . "
He adds that " this proposal would galvanize self - determination and rescue it from the theoretical confusion and political misuse that have plagued it in recent decades . " [ 64 ]
A redefinition of self - determination , Hannum contends , " may signal a new usefulness for the concept of self - determination in the decades to come " [ 65 ] insofar as it places human and minority rights before unilateral secession .
As the legitimacy of the principle of self - determination has been gradually eroded in the post - colonial era , a resurgence of self - determination along more creative , flexible lines might be precisely the boost that international law needs at the present day .
A reformed right to self - determination , envisioned as a continuum of rights rather than an absolute entitlement to independence in all situations , will do its part to promote international stability , peace , and security .
Robin
White , a professor of law at the University of Leicester , attributes harmful developments in the Western Sahara situation to an " exclusive focus " on independence as the " only solution " to colonial status . [ 66 ]
White concludes that " had the United Nations worked on the criteria to be used in determining when the alternatives of association , integration , or some other political status would be appropriate , it is possible that there would have been greater room for manoeuvre and resort to unilateral unlawful acts inhibited . " [ 67 ]
Similarly , Michla Pomerance , professor of international law at the Hebrew University , argues that self - determination has become " not a continuum of rights , nor a universal principle applicable to ' all peoples , ' but an ' all or nothing ' proposition . " [ 68 ]
The challenge for the future of self - determination then is one of Balancing conflicting principles , of maximizing individual and group rights while respecting the rights of other individuals and collectives and preserving international peace and security .
Such complexity can only be handled by means of a flexible approach which sees self - determination as a continuum of rights , as a plethora of possible solutions , rather than as a rigid absolute right to full " external " self - determination in the form of complete independence …
Independence , or other options , may need to be precluded — even if desired by the " self " concerned .
Such alternatives as federal schemes , autonomy , minority rights [ and ] guarantees of non-discrimination … may present themselves as forms of self - determination best suited to the particular circumstances . [ 69 ]
Thus , the decolonization era understanding of self - determination , which has largely prevailed up to the present , and whose preferred winner - take - all outcome conveniently ignores crucial international , regional , and domestic realities , has become a recipe for stalemate and a possible threat to peace and diplomatic compromise .
We can do better .
Conclusion
How , then , would an application of self - determination , redefined loosely along the lines described above , be achieved in the context of the Western Sahara dispute , and what might it look like ?
As long as the diplomatic process over the future of Western Sahara remains saddled with the dual encumbrances of a U.N. - administered framework and a U.N. resolution on the basis of a strict notion of self - determination , the suitability of the U.N. system as the dispute 's sole arbiter will continue to be called into question .
By removing institutional and bureaucratic obstacles to advancement in solving the Western Sahara dispute — obstacles that the present U.N. framework has done much to perpetuate — the parties would be compelled to think in terms of creative solutions to decades - old problems .
If that were to happen , they would take out of the equation a major incentive for political and diplomatic posturing that has until now stalled meaningful progress .
An arrangement rooted in a realistic vision of autonomous self - government that would incorporate reasonable guarantees of cultural expression , political freedoms , and human rights for the inhabitants of Western Sahara might then be given a chance to take shape .
Indeed , such an approach holds out the potential for advancement in the resolution of other disputes involving conflicting claims of self - determination and sovereignty , including the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Whereas international organizations have over the past sixty years served as uninterrupted debating societies with regard to the professed rights of the Palestinian people under international law , the fundamental frailty of the law concerning self - determination has largely frustrated efforts to translate mere legal pronouncements into actual on - the - ground progress .
Arguably , the result has been the squandering of tremendous financial resources , institutional efforts , and time in support of a diplomatic course of action that is pervaded by " process " and high - minded legal " principle " yet often short on the substance and dynamism necessary to translate theory into practical , real - world compromise improving the everyday lives of ordinary people .
Self - determination must , therefore , be reframed in the present context as a continuum of rights affording the affected populations a range of democratic entitlements and humanitarian protections within existing sovereign states .
The era when self - determination was synonymous with an absolute right to political independence has passed , and more flexible and creative bases for compromise between disputing parties are presently in order .
In this spirit , the chairman of the U.N. General Assembly 's Special Committee on Decolonization , Margaret Hughes Ferrari of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , speaking at an October 8 , 2007 meeting on the Western Sahara dispute , acknowledged that U.N. efforts concerning non-self - governing territories must recognize " that there is no magic formula of ' one - size fits all . ' "
Rather , she continued , a good faith effort to focus on tangible results would lead to the conclusion that " different territories have different needs and expectations and should be considered on a case - by - case basis .

Trivia
For a distinctive look , Robert Altman and Vilmos Zsigmond chose to " flash " ( pre-fog ) the film negative before its eventual exposure , as well as use a number of filters on the cameras , rather than manipulate the film in post - production ; in this way the studio could not force him to change the film 's look to something less distinctive .
However , this was not done for the final 20 minutes of the picture , as Altman wanted the danger to McCabe to be as realistic as possible .
Note the change when McCabe wakes up , grabs a shotgun , and starts off to the church .

The plan to remove blast walls in Baghdad has led to mixed reactions
The Iraqi government has announced that within the next 40 days all blast walls will be removed from Baghdad .
The building of the walls escalated in 2006 at the height of the sectarian violence .
Many residents complain that the barriers have made the city unrecognisable , but they also say that they have made neighbourhoods safer .
The move comes just a month after United States troops pulled out of cities across Iraq .
The news of the removal has provoked mixed reactions .
" It 's a good step because it reduces traffic jams and makes us feel that the situation has improved and life is back to normal , " said Waleed , who works as a taxi driver in Baghdad .
" But on the other hand , it may encourage more attacks . "
Real threat Since the American withdrawal , the government has been keen to show that it is in full control of the security situation , but many people here wonder whether Baghdad is ready for the move .
" The Americans have just left the Iraqi cities and we have witnessed a rise in terrorist activities , " said Mohammed Jasim , a blacksmith in Baghdad .
" We need to keep roads as they are until the security forces are really capable of taking control over the cities .
I think the time has not come yet , " he added Violence in Iraq has declined significantly in comparison to two years ago , when people were dying by the hundreds every day .
But explosions , attacks and roadside bombs are still part of everyday life here , and the government admits that insurgents , including al - Qaeda , still pose a very real threat .
Last Friday 30 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks that targeted Shia mosques across the city .
On Tuesday night , five people were killed in a roadside bomb explosion in Dora , one Baghdad 's predominantly Sunni neighbourhoods .
And so the question is whether giving Baghdad its face back could also create new opportunities for those who do not want the violence to stop .

The Chancellor wants to maintain the current tripartite regulatory system
The government 's plans for reforming the regulation of banks are " largely cosmetic " and " lack clarity " , MPs in the Treasury Select Committee say .
In its report on the banking crisis , the committee says that responsibility for strategic decisions and action remains " a muddle " .
The report also says that the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) " failed spectacularly " in supervising banks .
The FSA said it has " changed radically " since an internal review in 2008 .
Earlier this month , Chancellor Alistair Darling said banks would face tougher regulation and consumers would get more protection .
The reforms are specifically designed to try to prevent the current financial crisis happening again .
The most important parts of the report relate to ... the best ways of shrinking banks individually and collectively so that they can no longer hold the taxpayer to ransom
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog
But the plans have been criticised for not going far enough .
For example , the current tripartite system , where the Bank of England , the Treasury and the FSA oversee the financial system , would remain intact .
The Tories want to abolish the system and hand more power to the Bank of England .
' Extremely perturbed ' The Treasury Committee report , entitled Banking Crisis : Regulation and Supervision , does not advocate " substantial change " to the tripartite system .
Where responsibility lies for strategic decisions and executive action was , and remains , a muddle
Treasury Select Committee
But it does criticise the government 's reform plans .
The report " considers the reforms to the institutional structure of the Tripartite Committee to be largely cosmetic .
Merely rebranding the committee will do little in itself " .
The real problem lies in the fact that responsibilities are not properly allocated , it argues .
" Where responsibility lies for strategic decisions and executive action was , and remains , a muddle , " it says .
It also highlights a lack of co-ordination and admits to being " extremely perturbed " by evidence from Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England , that he had " no idea " of what the government 's plans for reform were .
John McFall , the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee , said : " Change and co-ordination are needed to clarify responsibilities . "
' Develop teeth '
The report also criticised the FSA 's response to the crisis .
We should not rule out more drastic action , such as forcibly shrinking the banks or separating out the riskier functions
John McFall , chairman of the Treasury Select Committee " By any measure , the FSA has failed spectacularly in its supervision of the banking sector , " says Mr McFall .
But the he does acknowledge that the authority has " already begun to rectify its mistakes " and is now " moving in the right direction " .
The committee says the body must be strong enough to stand up to the vested interests of the City .
It must " develop sufficient teeth to be able to go against the tide in the future and take unpopular decisions " , says Mr McFall .
Responding to the report 's findings , the FSA says it has " changed radically " since early 2008 , and has " identified and rectified its historic mistakes " .
' Drastic action '
Finally , the report argues that the government must ensure that no bank is too big to fail .
The government has bailed out Northern Rock , Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group , arguing that letting any of them fail would threaten the entire financial system .
The report says that no bank should be allowed to take risky bets in the knowledge that it will be bailed out by the government should those bets go wrong .
" Tweaking the capital requirements to prevent this happening may work , but we should not rule out more drastic action , such as forcibly shrinking the banks or separating out the riskier functions , " says Mr McFall .
The report even suggests that this " market failure " be addressed by a " tax on size " .
The committee also argues that prohibiting deposit - taking banks from making risky investments should not be ruled out at this stage .

A Chat with Andy Petranek , Interview with Andy Petranek , Petranek Fitness / CrossFit LA ,
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
I talked recently with Andy Petranek , who owns Petranek Fitness / Cross Fit LA .
He has become the go - to guy after being featured in several stories covering one of the fastest growing fitness trends , Cross Fit .
Referred to as The Toughest Workout Ever ! by “ Muscle and Fitness Magazine , ” CrossFit has seen the number of training facilities quadruple to more than 1,000 locations during the last two years .
We discuss how Andy got his start and what drew him as a top level sponsored athlete to Cross Fit .
We also begin to delve into the principles , the meat and potatoes , behind CrossFit , and how he employs these principles in his business .
Bullz - Eye : I really appreciate you taking the time to do this interview .
Being a trainer and a strength coach for as many years as I have , I always welcome the opportunity to talk to other people who are involved in the business .
Especially someone who is really making a name for themselves , like yourself .
Andy Petranek : Thanks a lot .
BE : Before we get into the whole Cross Fit phenomenon , I would like to get to know you a little bit better .
So if you could give us a little bit of a background about yourself .
What did you do before becoming one of the premier trainers in L.A. ?
On first attempting the CrossFit program : " I tried a workout and got my ass handed to me and I loved it .
It was fun .
I was suddenly kind of re-energized about working out . ”
AP : I do n’t know where to start really .
The down and dirty , kind of “ Reader ’s Digest ” version , prior to anything athletic , I was 100 percent musician .
I was a trumpet player .
I went to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester , New York .
I did no sports , no athletics up until I was in college .
I got an ROTC scholarship to go to school .
I shifted from Navy to Marines and then to get ready for Officer Candidate School , I trained my ass off .
That was my first real indoctrination into being in shape .
My Marine experience was very much fitness - related .
I did n’t really know it at the time but I was responsible for making sure my Marines were fit for combat .
BE : Right , right .
AP : I did n’t really see my job as a fitness coach but essentially I was .
I mean in addition to all the other stuff we train to do .
I spent four years away .
I got into mountaineering and outrigger paddling .
And then I discovered adventure racing .
I discovered Eco -Challenge in ’ 95 , before anybody really knew what it was .
I spent the next about seven years racing .
I started off doing the long , long expedition races .
I did four of those .
And then through a series of kind of mistakes and mishaps , and not finishing races and frustration with teammates and stuff , I started doing some short ones and got sponsored by Red Bull and became team Red Bull .
We competed for about five years on the short distance adventure racing circuit .
BE : Man , that ’s excellent .
AP : At the same time when I was racing , it just kind of evolved into a training business .
I then did go back to school .
I went to UCLA ; they have a fitness instructor program .
I went through their kind of adult education -- it ’s called UCLA Extension .
I went back to the C.H.E.K .
Institute in San Diego , which is an advanced kinesiology …
BE : I ’ve heard so much about the C.H.E.K. Institute .
I ’ve heard that is an excellent place to go .
AP : I do n’t use much of it anymore except it rounds out my background .
I use it to assess and look at mechanics and whatnot with people .
And then I retired from adventure racing in 2004 and discovered Cross Fit almost right at the same time .
I did n’t know what my next thing was going to be .
I was kind of bored .
I was a trainer , I was working out in gyms but I did n’t really like working out in gyms .
I was n’t really motivated to get back on my bike and do some of the training I was doing before .
So I was running a lot and I came across Cross Fit .
I was very skeptical of everything that they said essentially .
I looked at the WODs ( Workout Of the Day ) that were rarely longer than 25 minutes , and they said that they could create elite fitness .
I thought , yeah right , how is it possible to do that ?
Because my background told me that if it was n’t at least 45 minutes , it was n’t even worth doing .
BE : Right .
AP : So I just decided to try a workout .
And I tried a workout and got my ass handed to me and I loved it .
It was fun .
I was suddenly kind of re-energized about working out .
And so I did a little bit of my own litmus test .
I went out and ran a 5 K and I eliminated every other aspect of my training expect Cross Fit for two months .
My running mileage dropped by about -- I went from like 35 miles a week to about 5 miles a week .
You know , no kayaking , no road cycling .
All the stuff that I used to do I eliminated .
I did CrossFit for two months and my 5 K time dropped at the end of that two month period by 2½ minutes .
BE : Wow !
That ’s a heck of a drop .
AP : And I thought this is a miracle .
This was amazing to me because I was resting more than I had rested in like seven years of training .
I would take more days off .
I was spending way less time working out .
I mean , I was maybe at the most , training six hours a week .
Maybe seven hours a week .
My lightest week in seven or eight years of training was like nine hours a week .
You know , my heaviest were at like 19 hours or 20 hours .
So it was a ridiculous recovery period for me and I was getting faster .
So I was immediately converted .
I mean that day that I ran the 5K , I called Glassman and went up north to their next certification , which they had basically just begun their certifications .
Got certified , came back down here and started looking for a spot to open my own -- I had been looking for a place to open , and with CrossFit , I suddenly saw a way to make it a reality , like to make it really , really work .
CrossFit L.A. opened our doors in November of 2004 .
Now we ’re going like gangbusters ; we ’re doing great .
BE : Awesome .
That ’s really cool .
Andy , we ’re going to get into the form and some of what you feel are the positive principles of this type of training in a little bit .
But for our readers -- because obviously there are readers from all levels and types of fitness backgrounds -- in a nutshell , what is Cross Fit ?
How would you describe it ?
And I know that ’s probably a monumental task that I am asking of you .
AP : It ’s a great question .
You know people ask that question all the time and it ’s very hard to encapsulate in a very pithy statement .
We work on it a lot .
CrossFit is a workout system that incorporates elements of gymnastics , Olympic weight lifting and metabolic conditioning .
You know , running , rowing , cycling , jumping rope .
That combines those elements at high intensity with lots of variety to create what we call elite fitness .
BE : Kind of an overall fitness .
AP : Yeah , to create the world ’s fittest athletes in any discipline .
In any realm .
Our specialty is in not specializing .
I was just interviewed by someone the other day who wanted me to say “ well what is really the focus of CrossFit ? ”
And I said “ well , the focus is there is no focus . ”
We do n’t want a hole in our armor .
BE : Well I would like to let our readers know what some of your training philosophies are in general , and concerning Cross Fit .
I really was attracted to its simplicity and uniformity .
For instance , when you mentioned earlier the WOD -- the workout of the day -- can you give me your thoughts , both positive and negative concerning WODs ?
" We do n’t try and prevent you from doing the same thing two days in a row .
We have weeks go by where pull - ups are in almost every workout .
Because we feel that simulates real life .
If you ’re a construction worker and you ’re digging a trench , if you do n’t finish Monday -- guess what , you ’re going to dig Tuesday . ”
AP : Well , I think from the standpoint of it ’s very difficult for a beginner to get Cross Fit .
Because a WOD -- you know they look at a WOD and go “ okay , what ’s CrossFit ? ”
Let me do a workout .
They do a workout and -- like we had a person come and do a workout the other day .
It was three cleans , two push presses and one over head squat , as many rounds as you could do in 20 minutes .
So she comes and does the workout and goes “ wow , I do n’t really want to get buff and this is all weights . ”
I said look , you ca n’t get Cross Fit in one workout .
You ca n’t get Cross Fit in five workouts .
Cross
Fit takes place over time .
So to get Cross Fit you ’ve got to give it four months .
Which is one of the reasons why our basic membership is a four - month membership .
Nobody can come in for less than a four - month period because you ca n’t get it .
You do n’t know what it is .
It ’s not like pick and choosing an aerobics class or a spinning class , where basically , if you go to a spinning class , every time you go to a spinning class you get spinning .
You know what it is ; you know exactly what spinning is every time you go to a spinning class .
BE : Right .
I see where you ’re going with this .
It ’s the same explanation I would use with my training clients .
It ’s like trying a diet for a day to see if it works .
AP : Exactly , so that ’s a pro and a con .
I think the pro of that is that ’s incredibly diverse and incredibly fun .
And very difficult to get old and stale .
As a con , you ’ve got to stick with it .
BE : Right .
Now I noticed on your website , www.crossfitla.com concerning the WODs .
Yours are different than the one that is actually on CrossFit.com .
Is there a method of any kind , or a system to creating the WOD , or is it literally just a total random haphazard thing ?
AP : It ’s definitely not random .
It seems like random if you have n’t really looked at what ’s going on .
But it ’s definitely not random .
We do n’t have upper body days and lower body days .
We do n’t try and prevent you from doing the same thing two days in a row .
We have weeks go by where pull - ups are in almost every workout .
Because we feel that simulates real life .
If you ’re a construction worker and you ’re digging a trench , if you do n’t finish Monday -- guess what , you ’re going to dig Tuesday .
And if you do n’t finish Tuesday you are going to dig again on Wednesday .
You do n’t tell your boss sorry ; my muscles need a day off .
This is not good for me ; I ’ll start again on Wednesday .
No , you keep digging .
So life throws stuff at you where you ’ve got to do stuff more than one day in a row , and we do n’t get the recovery .
We look at three elements : weightlifting , gymnastics and metabolic conditioning .
We create combinations of those things .
Some workouts are weightlifting - based , some are met - con - based and some are gymnastics - based .
Some combine two out of the three elements or three out of the three elements .
Over the course of a week to two weeks , when I design the programming , I make sure that the workouts are all hit , those categories are all hit at least once .
And then I look at things like workout duration and intensity .
I want to make sure that the range and times of workouts goes from the low end of five minutes to , at the high end , 45 minutes .
So there are a lot of variables that go into planning the workout of the day .
And we create our own WODs because we have a tight knit community here .
We ’re writing it for our community .
And though we ’re CrossFit , I ’m more tapped in to my people than Cross Fit .
Cross
Fit is not tapped into my people at all .
So I tend to know more about what they need .
BE : Exactly .
You give more of a personal touch to the people you are dealing with .
AP : Exactly .
BE : I ’m going to play devil ’s advocate for a few questions here .
I noticed that you have programs for beginners , intermediates , advanced and even for kids , which I think is really good .
I think that ’s a really positive thing .
But is there a protocol to adjust for training weaknesses , structural imbalances and or genetic differences .
Do you make adjustments for people ’s inability to perform certain movements because of genetics or imbalances they have developed over the years ?
AP : Of course .
You know , we are an independent gym .
CrossFit is our operating system .
Now that does n’t mean we do n’t make adjustments for people we work with one - on - one , or even people in classes for various imbalances .
We make adjustments all the time to the movements that we do , or the exercises that we choose , to aid or assist someone that just ca n’t do overhead squats because of a recurring shoulder injury .
Knees are difficult , knees are hard because we run and we jump and we squat .
So can we modify for a bum knee ?
Well maybe , and it just depends .
It depends on how bad it is .
BE : Right .
AP : One of the reasons the affiliate program exists is Cross Fit online is a great program , but it ca n’t be everything for everyone .
We modify stuff all the time .
We work with people one - on - one , we do private training .
BE : What about exercise order ?
I went through a lot of the Workouts of the Day ( WODs ) on your Web Site and on CrossFit.com .
One that struck me , I mean there were a few , but the Workout of the Day “ Linda ” stuck out .
You actually do dead lifts before power cleans .
Now , of course , that is something that I ’ve never done because my goals are maximum strength with a good cardio component .
What are your thoughts on that ?
On doing explosive exercises in a fatigue state like that ?
AP : You know the Linda is an interesting one because on the first round you do dead lifts before power cleans .
But , after that first round , you kind of loose track of the order .
Is it dead lifts before power clean or is it power clean before dead lifts ?
Because you are going in circles .
BE : Right .
That ’s true , but it ’s sill done continually in a fatigued state .
AP : Well , to address any of the exercises that we do , because we do a lot of stuff in a fatigue state .
In my opinion , that ’s life .
Like it or not , life is going to throw challenges and obstacles at you when you are not in your optimal state .
You have n’t had the right amount of sleep , you have n’t had the right amount of water , you have n’t had the right amount of food , you have n’t had the right amount of sex .
You know , you just trained , you are sore as hell and somebody holds you up at your car and you ’ve got to sprint .
You ’re not going to tell the guy , “ hey , I ca n’t sprint right now because my muscles are sore . ”
You are running for your life .
BE : Now correct me if I ’m wrong , it goes back to that specificity principle .
You are not training to be an Olympic lifter or to get 100 percent of the high threshold motor units for power .
You are training for overall fitness .
AP : Right .
Exactly .
So if I were an Olympian , and I was training for the 100 - meter dash , I would n’t be doing a lot of the stuff that we do .
I ’m a specialist and the only thing I care about is 1/10 of a second or 1/100 of a second in my 100 time .
That ’s not what we are doing .
BE : What is your opinion of Cross Fit ’s certification program , and are there any changes that you would like to see in that ?
" We do a lot of stuff in a fatigue state .
In my opinion , that ’s life .
Like it or not , life is going to throw challenges and obstacles at you when you are not in your optimal state .
You know , you just trained , you are sore as hell and somebody holds you up at your car and you ’ve got to sprint .
You ’re not going to tell the guy , “ hey , I ca n’t sprint right now because my muscles are sore . ”
You are running for your life . ”
AP : Well , I think Cross Fit ’s goal is to get as many people doing Cross Fit as possible .
That ’s really the bottom line .
I think the brilliant part of how the system is set up is the information is available to anybody that seeks it out .
The certification is an introduction to CrossFit .
You know you are Cross Fit certified -- you ’re level one certified if you go to this two - day seminar .
Well , the two - day seminar is going to introduce you to nine essential elements of Cross Fit .
Does that make you an elite level trainer ?
No .
Does a two - day seminar make you elite at anything ?
No .
So yes , it ’s an entry point but no , it does n’t make you the world ’s greatest trainer .
You need to go out and seek that information on your own .
Now there are other Cross Fit certifications that round that out .
You can go get a specialty cert in Olympic weightlifting .
You can get a specialty cert in barbell training with coach Rippetoe .
You can get a gymnastics certification .
There ’s about 10 specialty certifications within the Cross Fit certification program that are phenomenal .
BE : Right .
Now at CrossFit L.A ( www.crossfitla.com ) , do you have a staff of personal trainers ?
AP : Yes .
BE : What do you feel you do differently at Cross Fit L.A. that has brought you the success you have as a trainer and an owner ?
AP : Well , we treat CrossFit as a system we are teaching and we treat our location , our box , our place as a school .
A place to come and learn Cross Fit .
And I guess you could even make that more general .
A place to come and learn movement , fundamental human movement taken to the nth degree .
Whatever level you are capable of taking that to , we encourage you to get to .
So we have created a context that this is a system , kind of like learning ikedo or learning taekwondo .
In martial arts , it is very clear when you go to do ikedo , you ’re going to a school .
You ca n’t go pop in and take a class here and a class there .
It ’s not a fitness class .
What we do here is very different than taking fitness classes .
The people that train here are committed over periods of time to learn how to move their bodies .
To learn how to pick up weights , lift heavy weights and put them up over their heads .
To learn how to gracefully and with coordination move their bodies without weights .
And to be in a high level of metabolic condition .
That ’s not something you can just drop in and take a fitness class here and there and expect to achieve .
BE : Right .
Absolutely .
AP : So it ’s a very different context when you come and train at Cross Fit L.A .
We do n’t call it the school of elite fitness but it basically is a school of elite fitness .
BE : That ’s a great approach .
In this way , you are giving people the tools that they need , which will help them be successful , which will help them motivate themselves .
We talked a little bit about the Cross Fit games .
And congratulations again on doing so well .
AP : Thank you .
BE : This was another thing that I thought was a really positive part of Cross Fit .
I think brining CrossFit as a sport is just an outstanding idea .
I really do .
What do you think of CrossFit as a sport in general and where do you think it ’s going to be or might be headed in five years ?
AP : Well it ’s kind of funny because in my mind , Cross Fit has always been a sport .
You know , injuries are a normal part of participating in any sport .
BE : Right .
AP : In CrossFit , we deal with injuries .
You ca n’t do the stuff that we do without getting injured .
I mean I ’ve had little injuries , fortunately nothing major but it ’s impossible to go mountain biking and never get thrown off your bike .
So the context again is very different .
If you lump Cross Fit into fitness , the goal in fitness programs is to keep you safe and not let you get hurt .
Well , CrossFit is n’t really fitness .
I mean it is because you are going to get in the best shape of your life , but it ’s a sport .
In any sport there is risk .
BE : Anything you are doing intensely , you are bound to get some type of injury .
AP : Absolutely .
And there is a risk .
And as in life the greater the risk , the greater the potential reward .
So the more you are willing to lay on the line , certainly you ’ve got greater risk and certainly you ’ve got a greater potential for reward .
I think the sport of CrossFit is what Cross Fit is .
BE : I told this guy the other day , “ Cross Fit , I believe , is going to do for fitness what Ultimate Fighting Championships have done for fighting . ”
Martial arts and mixed marital arts have exploded in popularity .
And it looks like CrossFit is on the same path .
I think this is going to be something huge , I really do .
AP : I mean it already kind of is , and we ’re just on the brink .
We ’re not that huge yet .
I mean god , there are still a lot of people that do n’t have any idea what Cross Fit is .
BE : Speaking of the games , what prior athletic background do you find the best Cross Fit athletes come from ?
Or has it really even mattered , that you ’ve seen ?
AP : Well , in the games it has mattered .
My opinion on the events from last year ’s games ; you know , none of the events were longer than four minutes .
The finals took some people seven minutes or eight minutes .
But in my opinion , if you really want to test all 10 areas of human performance , you ca n’t do it in workouts that are only four minutes long ; four , five , six minutes long .
BE : Oh no , I ’m kind of surprised that it would have been that way considering the emphasis on not specializing .
AP : Yeah , the other argument is , well you had to do three events in one day and that ’s the endurance .
But that ’s not really endurance , in my opinion .
So I think last year , the events favored people that were able to lift more heavy weight .
You know , the Olympic weightlifter , the Josh Everett ’s of the world , the guy that won -- Jason Kalipa .
That guy ’s a monster .
I do n’t know what his 1 RM clean jerk is , but I ’m sure it is well over 250 .
Had I been in last year ’s Cross Fit games , I would not have done so well because I still work on increasing my one rep max in a lot of those weightlifting events .
But hey , throw a 10 K in , throw a 5 K in , throw some surprise events in that people do n’t know what to expect , I ’m totally ready for that .
That is going to be a lot of fun .
So I think the stronger athletes have been at an advantage in years past .
You know , you need to be able to do 150 - pound clean and jerks , 30 of them in a row .
Okay , that immediately eliminates a lot , a lot of people .
BE : Well , what is your favorite WOD ?
If you could even possibly think of one .
AP : You know , probably the Nancy or the Annie .
The Nancy is overhead squats and a 400 - meter run , five times ; 15 overhead squats and a 400 - meter run , five times .
And you use 95 pounds for the overhead squats .
I ’m pretty good at that .
BE : What ’s your least favorite ?
AP : You know , I do n’t know if I have one .
It ’s hard to say which ones I like the best because I even like the ones I ’m not good at , because they are a challenge and they are hard .
You know the Murph we just did the other day , and though it ’s brutally difficult , I actually kind of like it .
The Murph is a mile run , 100 pull - ups , 200 push - ups and 300 squats and then a mile run .
BE : Wow !
AP : And I did the whole thing with a 20 - pound weight vest and did chest to bar pull - ups .
It took me like 49 minutes I think , and I loved it ; it was great .
I ’m beat to hell for two days afterwards but you know , I like that too .
BE : It ’s a feeling of accomplishment .
It ’s got to be .
AP : Absolutely , absolutely .
I feel like I just went to war and I ’m not sure if I won .
It ’s questionable who won that battle .
BE : Right .
Well what can we expect from you in the future ?
What ’s going on with you ?
Do you have any projects coming up ?
Or what ’s going on with your fitness facility ?
Anything going on ?
AP : Well we just moved into a new space .
We moved from about 1,500 square feet to 4,000 square feet .
So we are in the process of kind of ramping things up in our new location .
Our goal is to open up another few CrossFit facilities in and around Los Angeles .
So after we are up and running smoothly here at our new location , to look to other neighborhoods that could use a 1,500 square foot box and get them in .
Get our instructors teaching Cross Fit the way we do Cross Fit , in those locations .
BE : Well I really appreciate you taking the time out today .
AP : Absolutely .
BE : It ’s been a hell of a pleasure and you seem like a very knowledgeable , upbeat person and I really wish you luck in the future .
AP : Thank you so much .
BE : Good luck at the games by the way .
AP : Thanks a lot .
I look forward to seeing the article .
BE : Alright Andy , you have a good day buddy .
Thanks a lot ; you too .
After hearing account after account from friends and acquaintances of rude and sometimes abusive behavior by federal officials in Immigrations , TSA , and others , I spoke by telephone to a fellow at TSA in Washington .
He was agreeable and helpful , which is not a response one always gets in the capital .
Anyway , I subsequently wrote him a letter , reproduced below , which addresses matters that in the past have been of interest to readers .
Dear Mr. ,
After our conversation of last week ( and I appreciated your taking the time ) I thought carefully about the problem of  TSA  — which , as I mentioned , has become a catch - all word for everything people do n’t like about governmental intrusion on traveling .
It is true that in airports the emigrations officers are much more obnoxious than the genuine TSA personnel .
I discussed the matter with a group of friends who , like me , are roughly in their mid-sixties — that is , who remember the United States as it was years ago .
We agreed that we are seeing an anger in the United States , chiefly directed at government , that is new to us .
There was widespread anger during the war in Vietnam , but it was directed at the war , not the government in general .
Today we have something different .
There is a sense that the government now is not only hostile to the public , which it never was before , but out of control .
The degree of intrusiveness has grown from almost none to almost unrestrained — or so people feel .

A few examples :
It is widely assumed by sane and educated people that NSA monitors all email ; whether this is true I am not sure , but it is believed .
Habeas corpus seems to have gone away .
The Fourth Amendment no longer seems to exist , random searches on the street being legal .
Finances are tracked .
You ca n’t buy a commuter train ticket without a governmental ID , information from which goes into a computer ( my experience on MARC ) .
Police are more militarized and more aggressive .
The financial crisis is seen , with ample evidence , as the result of corruption and lack of federal regulation .
A million people are said to be on the no-fly list .
Metal detectors proliferate .
Toothpaste and deodorants are confiscated at airports .
The country is seen to be in serious decline while the government spends a trillion a year on the Pentagon and wars of mysterious purpose .
Children are forced to take Ritalin .
The bureaucracy is unresponsive :
It takes a year even to get records from the VA , any dealing with IRS can turn into a years - long nightmare even if it is only a routine matter , and the paperwork is so complex that you ca n’t do anything without a specialized lawyer .
I could go on for pages .
A Brass Pole in Bangko ...
Reed , Fred Best Price : $ 3.94 Buy New $ 18.80 ( as of 01:20 EST - Details )
This is the context in which  TSA  ( in the sense mentioned above ) operates .
I do not suggest that much that TSA does is illegal .
Anything is legal that Congress says is legal , except in the unlikely event that the Supreme Court disagrees .
Rather I question whether much of security  actually accomplishes what it is supposed to accomplish , and whether the benefits outweigh the harm done .
Consider the inspection of all photos in a passenger ’s camera , which recently happened to me .
It is grossly intrusive and potentially humiliating .
Depending on circumstances , the traveler may have nude pictures of his wife , or pictures of himself engaging in sex with a Thai transvestite .
Neither is illegal , and neither is the government ’s business .
Do these searches in any sense inhibit the dissemination of child pornography ?
Yes — for about a week .
Once the pedophiles learn of the searches — and people who smuggle extremely illegal photos make a point of being aware of such things — the measure becomes worthless .
The malefactor puts the memory card with the porn in his back pocket , and leaves a card of innocent photos in the camera .

Of course  TSA  could go through the traveler ’s pockets and do a detailed search of his luggage for a tiny chip secreted in a pair of dirty socks .
TSA personnel do not have tight connections .
A friend recently showed me a memory chip , four gig I think it was , no larger than a pencil eraser .
Will  TSA  begin doing random body - cavity searches ?
Does minor and ineffective inconvenience to the pedophile offset massive inconvenience and indignity to the innocent ?
So much of security  is so obviously pointless that one wonders why it exists .
If you randomly search one in fifty passengers boarding Amtrak at rush hour , you do not detect the terrorist ninety - eight percent of the time .
In the case of a suicide bomber , the detection leads to an immediate explosion and , unless you conduct the inspection robotically in a blast - proof room , several dead .
To the public , at any rate to the many people with whom I have discussed the matter , the air of federal fear seems almost demented .
I have had an ( actual ) TSA woman solemnly examine a pair of tweezers to determine whether they were blunt - nosed ( acceptable ) or pointed ( posing a threat of hijacking ) .
Do we really believe that a team of Al Quaeda terrorists are going to leap up brandishing tweezers ?
Equally absurd is that a woman cannot enter the US consulate in Guadalajara with her lipstick .
Yes , I know it could contain a cyanide dart or a hidden vial of Tabun .
So could anything .
This , while not solemnly written , makes a variety of points that occur to many , many people .

How much security is enough ?
Any amount of intrusion whatever can be justified on grounds of slight or imaginary benefits .
Those strip - scanners that famously reduce travelers to near - nudity are loathed by women ; have they actually accomplished any desirable end , except for the manufacturer ?
People in the federal security business tend to believe that surveillance is for the safety of the public , then to believe that more surveillance will produce more safety , and finally to fall into the rationale that if you are doing nothing wrong , you have nothing to fear from inspections etc . 
Police in general tend naturally to believe this .
Always , always , it leads to abuses that render the public fearful of the police .
For this reason the Fourth Amendment was propounded .
In my eight years as a police reporter for the Washington Times , the police needed probable cause to conduct a search , this being defined as an articulable reason to believe that a specific person was committing a specific crime . 
( Sometimes they lied when they wanted probable cause , but the requirement nonetheless provided a degree of protection for the public . )
Walking through Penn Station in Baltimore does not meet the definition of probable cause , yet the PA system constantly announces that people are subject to random search .
The knowledge that one may be searched at any time is intimidating , and being searched , humiliating .
Yes , it is legal .
A judge can always be found who will find constitutional almost anything .
Yet the ability to say no to causeless searches was a thing that distinguished America from the Soviet Union .
It no longer does .
Finally , there is the tendency for industry to see federal programs as money spigots .
( Having long covered the Pentagon , I know the game well . )
A company comes up with a better x-ray scanner at $ 170 thousand per each , times 2500 or however many airport security gates .
That ’s money .
There are also the contracts for training TSA personnel , for maintenance , and for upgrades .
A race ensues to come up with an even better scanner , or nitrate sniffer , of blast - proof trash cans for Metro , which can then be sold to the government .
So it is n’t just the rudeness and bullying of Immigrations people , or the confiscation of toothpaste and shampoo and bottled water .
It is the sense that the government , if not quite an enemy perhaps , is not friendly , and is endless trouble .
For a large and , I think , growing number of people , the most fervent wish is that the government leave them the hell alone .

More than a third of under - 18s have been sent offensive or distressing sexual images electronically , a survey by the charity Beatbullying suggests .
A large majority of the 2,094 respondents said a fellow teenager had sent it , compared with 2 % who said an adult had sent the message .
The charity said " sexting " constituted bullying and was a growing problem .
Beatbullying asked 2,094 teenagers aged 11 - 18 , and 38 % had received such content via new technologies .
It is important that parents and schools are aware that ' sexting ' is a significant issue among our children and young people
Emma-Jane Cross , Beatbullying
Sexting ' mortified me '
Just more than half ( 55 % ) of those said it had been sent by mobile phone .
The most common ways of communicating sexually explicit material are via Bluetooth , by uploading it on to a personal website or social networking site , or by e-mailing and texting it to individuals , Beatbullying said .
Some 45 % of teenagers who had received explicit content said it had come from another teenager , and 23 % said it was from their boyfriend or girlfriend .
Nearly one in three said they were using an online messaging service when content of a distressing sexual nature was introduced .
A higher proportion of women than men said this was the case - 31 % as opposed to 24 % .
' Significant issue '
Last year , psychologist Dr Tanya Byron carried out a review of children 's use of technology and recommended a taskforce be set up to spearhead protection measures in schools and the community .
But she said the role of parents was absolutely vital in managing teenagers ' access to potentially harmful material .
In response , the government set up the UK Council on Child Internet Safety , an umbrella group of organisations working in the field .
Beatbullying 's chief executive , Emma - Jane Cross , said new technology was facilitating sexual contact between teenagers and that this needed to be addressed .
" We do n't want to inhibit young people in their exploration of sexuality , but it is important that parents and schools are aware that ' sexting ' is a significant issue among our children and young people , so together we can act to stop this kind of behaviour before it escalates into something far more problematic . "
She said prominent cases of teenagers who had harmed themselves after experiencing such bullying had led to a debate in the US and Australia .
Schools Minister Diana Johnson said the government was committed to tackling all forms of bullying , including working with technology companies on the misuse of new formats .
" It is important that young people being bullied know that they can report it and that it can be stopped .
" We are supporting parents to have the confidence to engage with their children on the challenges of modern life - including sex and technology .
" We are also supporting teachers to identify and intervene as early as possible . "

This cartoon is ironic because the cartoonist , Gary Varvel , is a fairly right - wing conservative .
But if you interpret the Red firetruck as the Republican Party ( refusing to spend stimulus money ) then the cartoon takes on almost the opposite meaning of what the cartoonist probably intended .

THE loyalty of readers accustomed to getting their news online free is about to be tested , as Australia 's largest newspaper groups prepare to charge for access to their websites .
Fairfax Media is considering two levels of access , one free and the other incurring a charge , as newspapers move to protect declining revenues .
Last week , News Limited chief executive Rupert Murdoch announced that sites featuring the news content of his stable of papers would no longer be free .
The plan to erect pay - walls around their online sites comes as newspaper companies confront a decline in the advertising revenue that has financed print production .
Between them , Fairfax - which owns The Sunday Age - and News Ltd own all but one of Australia 's metropolitan dailies , most of the suburban and regional papers , and websites that in total claim more than 10 million browsers a month .
Rachel Maddow addresses the use of the threat of assassination as a political tactic , and those who could care less about ginning up the anger which is driving the angry protesters to these town halls .
Rachel stated this better than I ever could so I 'll let her take it from here :
Maddow :
What is not politics as usual is that opponents of health care reform have chosen to fight at this time with force and with threats of force .
Not just fringe talk show hosts , but members of Congress telling their constituents that Barack Obama is like Hitler ; members of the United States senate telling their constituents that they are right to be afraid , that health care reform really is a plot to kill the elderly .
Corporate funded conservative P.R. operations promoting those lines of attack and then telling their activists to go put the fear of God into members of Congress .
Are we now operating in a political environment which is not just politics as usual , which is not just a rowdy debate ?
Has enough kerosene been poured on the flames that the possibility of violence - even assassination - is being posited as a real political tactic in the United States ?
It 's not a rhetorical question .
It 's not even a question about rhetoric .
Because there are people in this country - people in the health care field , in fact - who have faced the actual threat of assassination as a political tactic .
Two and a half months ago , Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was assassinated and the man who 's charged in the case purportedly believe that assassinations were justified because of his own beliefs about abortion .
That belief in justified political violence was cultivated by the extreme anti-abortion movement that Scott Roeder is known to have extensive contact with before Dr. Tiller 's death .
As the anti-health reform protestors flirt with the same exultation of violence , that same excuses and purported justifications of violence , that echo in the extreme anti-abortion movement in this country , it is worth remembering that the possibility of American politics turning to violence and terrorism - at the fringe - is not all theoretical .
Full transcript and her interview with Dr. Warren
Hern to follow .
Maddow :
On July 27th , two and a half weeks ago , Democratic Congressman Frank Kratovil was hanged in effigy outside his congressional office in Maryland .
The staged lynching , the really well - tied noose and all was gleefully staged by an anti-health care reform protestor .
Later that week , on August 1st , Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas held a town hall event at a grocery store in Austin to talk about health care reform .
An anti-health reform protestor there greeted him with a mock marble tombstone engraved with the congressman 's name on it .
Two days after that , on August 3rd , Democratic Congressman Brad Miller of North Carolina reported to the Capitol Hill police that he had received death threats over his support for health care reform .
One anti-health care reform protestor called his D.C. office and told a staffer , quote , " Miller could lose his life over this . "
The very next day , on August 4th , the idea of a Democratic congressman being killed because he supported health care reform became a punch line for Republican Congressman Todd Akin of Missouri .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) REP .
TODD AKIN , MISSOURI : Different people from Washington , D.C have come back to their districts and had town hall meetings and they almost got lynched and so .
( APPLAUSE ) ( END VIDEO CLIP ) MADDOW : That same day , Democratic Senator Chris Dodd , who had just announced days earlier that he has prostate cancer , had this screamed at him by an anti-health care reform protestor outside one of his town hall events .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Barack Obama clearly said , all you should do is take a painkiller .
How come we do n't just give Chris Dodd painkillers ?
Like a handful of them at a time ?
He can wash it down with Ted Kennedy 's whiskey .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) MADDOW : Two days later , on August 6th , the FOX News anchor Glenn Beck , on national television , turns the threat of a political assassination into the acting out of a political assassination , when he and one of his staffers wearing a Nancy Pelosi mask role - played what it would be like for Glenn Beck to poison the speaker of the House of Representatives .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) GLENN BECK , FOX NEWS HOST : I just wanted to - are you going to drink your wine ?
Are you blind ?
Do those eyes not work ?
There you go .
I want you to drink it now .
Drink it .
Drink it .
Drink it .
I really just wanted to thank you for having me over to wine country .
You know , to be invited I thought I had to be a major Democratic donor , long - time friend of yours , which I 'm not .
By the way , I put poison in your - no .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) MADDOW :
The day after that , on August 7th , there were more death threats .
Congressman Brian Baird of Washington reports that his office received this fax with an image of President Obama with a communist hammer and sickle symbol paint owned his forehead and the message , " Death to all Marxists , foreign and domestic " written underneath .
The day after that , on August 8th , anti-health reform protesters started turning up to Democratic town hall events while armed .
In Arizona , a gun is dropped during a meet and greet with Democratic Congressman Gabrielle Giffords .
The same day , a man with a concealed gun is escorted out of an event held by Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee .
Yesterday , the staff of Democratic Congressman David Scott arrived at their Georgia office to find a four - foot swastika painted across the sign for their office .
Congressman Scott says he was also sent an Obama death threat fax similar to the one sent to Brian Baird 's office , only this one also addresses Congressman Scott himself and it uses the " N " word .
Also yesterday , Democratic Congressman Dennis Moore of Kansas reports that he 's received two death threats over the last 10 days .
One he describes as a phone call into one of his congressional offices .
The other is a threat he says he does not feel comfortable discussing with the media .
Yesterday also brought us a health care town hall event featuring President Obama himself in Portsmouth , New Hampshire .
Among the anti-health reform protesters outside the event was a man named William Kostric , who stood outside with a loaded handgun strapped to his leg .
He was holding a sign at the time that read , quote , " It 's a time to water - it is time - excuse me - to water the tree of liberty . "
A reference to Thomas Jefferson 's famous words , " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . "
As we noted last night , just for context , when Timothy McVeigh was arrested after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 , he was wearing a t - shirt that had on the front of it a picture of assassinated President Abraham Lincoln , along with the words " Sic Semper Tyrannis . "
Those are the words shouted by Lincoln 's assassin right after he shot him .
On the back of McVeigh 's t- shirt was the same slogan that William Kostric paired with his loaded gun at the Obama event yesterday .
There you can see both the sign and what Tim McVeigh picked out special to be wearing when he got his mug shot taken for having blown up a federal building and killed 168 Americans .
At the same event for President Obama in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , yesterday , a 62 - year - old man named Richard Terry Young was arrested after sneaking past security officials and into Portsmouth high school just a few hours before President Obama was due to arrive .
Mr. Young was allegedly carrying a knife when security officers found him .
And when they got a warrant and searched his pickup truck , they found a .38 caliber KelTec semi-automatic pistol hidden inside a bag in his truck with a round in the chamber .
Today , at a town hall event for Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland , " The Hill " newspaper reports that one anti-health reform protester stood outside the town hall , quote , " with a small , handwritten sign - cardboard sign that read , quote , ' Death to Obama . ' "
The forces against health care reform are the same forces that have always been against health care reform - corporate interests that profit from the way things are now and the politicians who support those corporate interests .
Health care is a multi-trillion dollar industry and special interests want to protect what they 've got .
That is common knowledge .
That is politics as usual .
What is not politics as usual is that opponents of health care reform have chosen to fight at this time with force and with threats of force .
Not just fringe talk show hosts , but members of Congress telling their constituents that Barack Obama is like Hitler ; members of the United States senate telling their constituents that they are right to be afraid , that health care reform really is a plot to kill the elderly .
Corporate funded conservative P.R. operations promoting those lines of attack and then telling their activists to go put the fear of God into members of Congress .
Are we now operating in a political environment which is not just politics as usual , which is not just a rowdy debate ?
Has enough kerosene been poured on the flames that the possibility of violence - even assassination - is being posited as a real political tactic in the United States ?
It 's not a rhetorical question .
It 's not even a question about rhetoric .

Rachel brought in Dr. Warren
Hern to talk about the similarities between the tactics being used now with the health care debate , and those used with the by the right to stop abortion from being safe and legal in the United States .

A Pensacola judge has green lighted the government seizure of Pensacola ’s Dinosaur Adventure Land , a creationist theme park whose owners , Kent and Jo Hovind , owe $ 430,400 in federal taxes .
The Hovinds ’ excuse for not paying was that they were employed by God and thus could claim zero income and property .
According to the Pensacola News Journal , the government will sell off the Hovinds ’ property to pay the debt .
Not sure exactly what those properties are , but the park ’s website offers a few clues :
Learn about dinosaurs , principles of science , and even how to make a paper airplane that can fly over 300 feet !
Handle our real , live creatures and take the Leap of Faith swing .
Enjoyable and educational for all ages , it is specifically targeted for kids under a million years of age !
Be prepared to be challenged to think and to follow the Lord in the way God the Creator has planned for you .
If you do not know your Creator , we will be overjoyed to introduce you to Him .
Our funny and experienced guides will lead your family or group on the tour , declaring the works of the Lord and the words of the Lord .
DAL is not an amusement park , for “ amuse ” means “ to not think , ” and we want people to think .
Rather , it is an amazement park .
So I wonder what ’s to become of all the park ’s statues and critters ?
And what ’s the going rate for a Leap of Faith swing these days , anyway ?
Breast cancer ' wonder drug ' increases risk of rare tumour by 440 %
A woman undergoes a mammogram that spots changes in breast tissue .
A study has found a breast cancer wonder drug increases the risk of developing a rare tumour
Breast cancer patients given tamoxifen are more than four times more likely to develop a more aggressive tumour than those not prescribed the drug , scientists have warned .
A study of over 1,000 patients found the oestrogen blocking drug reduced the risk of the most common , easy to treat cancer recurring by 60 per cent .
But the chances of a rarer type not sensitive to the female hormone appearing in the opposite breast increased by an alarming 440 per cent .
These are known as ER negative tumours , as opposed to ER positive , and are much more dangerous as there are no drugs that specifically target them .
Dr Christopher Li , of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle , said : ' This is of concern , given the poorer prognosis of ER - negative tumours , which are also more difficult to treat . '
Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer for more than 20 years and has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of women worldwide .
But Dr Li , whose findings are published in the journal Cancer Research , said although it has been shown to reduce the risk of dying from the disease it does have risks .
The study confirms preliminary research by the same team published in 2001 which was the first to suggest a link between long - term tamoxifen use and an increased risk of ER - negative second cancers .
Dr Li said : ' The earlier study had a number of limitations .
For example , we did not have information on the duration of tamoxifen therapy the women received .
' The current study is larger , is based on much more detailed data , and is the first study specifically designed to determine whether tamoxifen use among breast cancer survivors influences their risk of different types of second breast cancers . '
The latest research assessed history of tamoxifen use among 1,103 breast cancer survivors who were initially diagnosed with ER positive breast cancer between the ages of 40 and 79 .
Of these , 369 of the women went on to develop a second breast cancer .
Nearly all of the women in the study who took hormonal therapy used tamoxifen specifically .
Detailed information about tamoxifen use was ascertained from telephone interviews and medical record reviews .
Oestrogen encourages the growth of some breast cancer cells .
Tamoxifen interferes with this action by attaching itself to the molecule , or receptor , on a cancer cell surface that is also used by the hormone .
This , in effect , blocks the oestrogen effect on the cancer cells .
Cancer cells without an oestrogen receptor are not affected by tamoxifen .
Dr Li said while the study confirmed a strong association between long - term tamoxifen therapy and an increased risk of ER - negative second cancer , it does not suggest that breast cancer survivors should stop taking hormone therapy to prevent a second cancer .
He added : ' It is clear that oestrogen - blocking drugs like tamoxifen have important clinical benefits and have led to major improvements in breast cancer survival rates .
' However , these therapies have risks , and an increased risk of ER negative second cancer may be one of them .
' Still , the benefits of this therapy are well established and doctors should continue to recommend hormonal therapy for breast cancer patients who can benefit from it . '
We were lucky enough to take part in a press conference with WorldCon guest of honor Neil Gaiman .
We asked him about the theme of storytellers in his work .
And he talked movies versus books , and his feelings about comics .
Advertisement
Storytelling :
We felt as though there was a pervasive theme of storytelling and storytellers , and the power of creation , throughout Gaiman 's work , especially after touching base with Gaiman mega - fan Rob Clough .
So we asked Gaiman why he thought that element comes up again and again for him .
Advertisement
Gaiman says he tries to do something different with every book he writes — he wants the rabbit to be popping out of a new and different hole each time .
When faced with a choice between doing a book that 's comfortable and safe , and which all of his fans are clamoring for , versus a different book that he has no idea how to write and has nobody waiting for it , he 'll always choose the latter .
But in spite of this diverse body of work , he feels like after 25 years , he can look back at what he 's done and " the themes start piling up . "
The power of storytelling is definitely one of them , and so is " themes of doorways and transitions , " and also his books often seem to feature a kiss that signals the beginning of the third act .
As to why Gaiman 's books include the theme of storytelling so often ?
" I do n't know , because I make them .
I do n't know that writers have origin stories , and I would n't believe any writer who said that he did or she did ...
So why do I write about storytelling ?
Why was Sandman such a great huge monumental story about the nature of stories ? "
He says he thinks stories are important and the imagination is important , but those are things he 's saying after the fact , not while he 's writing a new story .
On the other hand , Gaiman says that everything that exists is here because someone dreamed it up — we sit on chairs because someone imagined them .
And he went to the first officially sanctioned science fiction conference in China , and asked why the Chinese government was sponsoring imaginative fiction after so many years of disapproving of it .
It was because the Chinese had noticed that they were incredibly good at making things , but that other people seemed to be inventing the things that they were making , and they had come out to the U.S. , and they had gone around Google and Apple and Microsoft , and one of the very few things that the people at Google and Apple and Microsoft had in common was they were science fiction and fantasy fans from way back .

And because they were science fiction fans , they believed the world could be different tomorrow , instead of just being the same thing day after day .
Comics hitting the mainstream :
Advertisement
Somebody else asked Gaiman how he felt about graphic novels being on the Hugo ballot , and he basically said it 's about time .
When The Dark Knight Returns came out some 23 years ago , the Hugo Ballot included it — but in the non-fiction category , giving the impression the Hugo voters believed Batman was real .
Watchmen got on the Hugo ballot , but only in some special made - up category .
Gaiman sees three factors bringing comics into the mainstream :
The formerly rigid distinction between high and low culture is eroding .
Gaiman did his first college appearance in 1992 , at a St. Louis college , where the Art Dept. invited him and the English Dept. boycotted the event because Gaiman wrote for comics .
But some of the English students sneaked in , and they 're professors now .
And people like Michael Chabon have come of age loving comics and being excited to be part of that world .
We 're living in a science - fictional age .
Just imagine explaining an ipod touch to someone in the 1950s .
Hollywood special effects have improved to the point where comic - book storylines can play out credibly on screen , and that means comic - book stories have infiltrated the mainstream to a much greater extent .

Movie adaptations of his books :
Someone asked Gaiman if he writes his books differently now , hoping to gear them for movie adaptation , and he said that he just wants the books to be the best things they can be .
He 's pleased that many people loved the film of Coraline , but he does n't see it as the perfected form of the book — the book is separate .
Advertisement
And if you wrote a novel aiming to make it easy to adapt into a movie , it would be a disaster , says Gaiman :
I do n't know if you 've ever done the thing of reading a novelization of a film , before you see the film , but they 're always very very odd .
As reading experiences , they 're always very unsatisfying , because they have all the beats of the film , and they do n't work in the way a novel works .
They 're things that come from the pre-DVD era [ where a book version was the only way you could revisit the film ] .
If you do that [ i.e. , write a novel so it will make a good movie ] you come up with a very broken - backed story .

He also said that for years , execs from major studios would call him up about making a movie of his novel Anansi Boys , and say " We love this book .
Can the characters be white ? "
Gaiman would reply no , because the book was about the children of the African spider god and the characters in the book are all African American .
And the execs would reply , " Black people do n't like fantasy . "
And when Gaiman would accuse them of being racist , they would backpedal and say " No , no , we 're just being practical . "
Working with Marvel and DC
Gaiman says he does n't have " a lot of patience left " with the two big comics publishers .
" They 're sweet people and I love working with them but dealing with them is often a lot like being nibbled to death by ducks . "
It does sound like he 's having fun working on the Metamorpho comics for DC's Wednesday Comics , and he 's being super careful to make it look like a comic from 1965 - 1966 , even down to a periodic table of the elements that appears in one upcoming issue , which only shows the elements known as of 1966 , and Lawrencium would have the letters " LW " instead of the more recent " LR . "

Random other stuff : Gaiman also says he loves " plotting by place , " treating places in his novels like characters and seeing how characters interact with different locations .
And he says he wrote Stardust and Neverwhere right after he moved to the U.S. and he was homesick for Britain — so he found himself creating a fictional version of London and the English countryside respectively .
And then he did American Gods , in which he came to terms with living in the U.S. , and tried to understand the place .
G - 8 - Demonstrationen Neue Randale in Rostock
Tag zwei nach den schweren Krawallen in Rostock : Auch heute kam zu gewaltsamen Rangeleien zwischen Demonstranten und Polizei .
( AP ) -- The U.N. unveiled a multimillion dollar strategy a dozen years ago to save children worldwide , but a new study has found the program had surprisingly little effect in Bangladesh , one of the world 's poorest countries .
Since 1997 , more than 100 countries have adopted the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Program , designed by the World Health Organization and UNICEF .
It was supposed to reduce deaths in children under age 5 due to diarrhea , pneumonia , measles and malnutrition , which make up about 70 percent of all child deaths .
Bangladesh is the only country where researchers compared results between areas that implemented the U.N. strategy with those that did not .
In research published in the medical journal Lancet on Friday , experts found the program had no major impact on saving children .
U.N. officials could not say how much the program in Bangladesh cost , but said millions have been spent on its implementation around the world .
" It 's remarkable the program has achieved so little , " said Philip Stevens , a director at the International Policy Network , a London think - tank .
" And it 's baffling that it has been rolled out globally without any evidence that it works . "
The U.N. strategy has three main components : training health workers ; improving health systems , which includes ensuring drugs are available ; and encouraging communities and parents to do things like maintain good hygiene and have their children immunized .
In Bangladesh , international researchers found the strategy improved the skills of health workers and convinced more people to seek treatment when they got sick .
In the areas where the U.N. strategy was used , more children were breast - fed and the prevalence of stunted growth dropped by 20 percent .
But in areas where the program was n't implemented , slightly more children were vaccinated against measles , and there was no big difference in death rates .
Researchers were n't sure why the program had failed , but said the community part of the U.N. strategy was " less effective than expected . "
The study was paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , WHO , and the U.S. Agency for International Development .
Some officials insisted the U.N. needed even more money for the program .
In an accompanying commentary in the Lancet , Trevor Duke of the University of Papua New Guinea called for an extra US $ 5 - 8 billion for the program to be expanded in 40 of the world 's poorest countries .
Stevens said the U.N. should first prove its strategies work .
" If a private company produced results like this , it would rapidly go out of business , " he said .
" Yet in U.N. land , failure is used as a justification to ask for more money to do more of the same . "

As I have mentioned a number of times , I teach data mining to the MBA students here at the Tepper School .
It is a popular course , with something like 60 % of our students taking it before graduating .
I offer an operations research view of data mining : here are the algorithms , here are the assumptions , here are the limits .
We talk about how to present results and how to clean up data .
While I talk about limits , I know that the students get enthusiastic due to the not - insignificant successes of data mining .
We give students access to a real data mining system ( SAS ’s Enterprise Miner currently , though we have used SPSS ’s Clementine Miner ( now PASW , for some reason ) in the past ) .
Invariably , students start putting in financial data in an attempt to “ beat the stock market ” .
In class , I talk about how appealing an approach this is , and how unlikely it is to work .
But students try anyway .
The Intelligent Investor column of the Wall Street Journal has a nice article on this ( thanks Jainik for the pointer ! ) with the title : “ Data Mining Is n’t a Good Bet for Stock - Market Predictions ” .
The Super Bowl market indicator holds that stocks will do well after a team from the old National Football League wins the Super Bowl .
The Pittsburgh Steelers , an original NFL team , won this year , and the market is up as well .
Unfortunately , the losing Arizona Cardinals also are an old NFL team .
The “ Sell in May and go away ” rule advises investors to get out of the market after April and get back in after October .
With the market up 17 % since April 30 , that rule is n’t looking so good at this point .
Meanwhile , dozens — probably hundreds — of Web sites hawk “ proprietary trading tools ” and analytical “ models ” based on factors with cryptic names like McMillan oscillators or floors and ceilings .
There is no end to such rules .
But there is n’t much sense to most of them either .
An entertaining new book , “ Nerds on Wall Street , ” by the veteran quantitative money manager David Leinweber , dissects the shoddy thinking that underlies most of these techniques .
The article then gives a great example of how you can “ predict ” the US stock market by looking at Bangledeshi butter production .
Now , I do n’t buy the starkly negative phrasing of the column : he ( Jason Zweig ) refers to data mining as a “ sham ” , which I think goes much too far .
Later in the article , he talks about what it takes to do data mining right :
That points to the first rule for keeping yourself from falling into a data mine :
The results have to make sense .
Correlation is n’t causation , so there needs to be a logical reason why a particular factor should predict market returns .
No matter how appealing the numbers may look , if the cause is n’t plausible , the returns probably wo n’t last .
The second rule is to break the data into pieces .
Divide the measurement period into thirds , for example , to see whether the strategy did well only part of the time .
Ask to see the results only for stocks whose names begin with A through J , or R through Z , to see whether the claims hold up when you hold back some of the data .
Next , ask what the results would look like once trading costs , management fees and applicable taxes are subtracted .
Finally , wait .
Hypothetical results usually crumple after they collide with the real - world costs of investing .
“ If a strategy ’s worthwhile , ” Mr. Leinweber says , “ then it ’ll still be worthwhile in six months or a year . ”
This is all good advice , and part of what I try to talk about in the course ( though having the article makes things much easier ) .
My conclusion : there is “ sham ” data mining , but that does n’t mean all data mining is a sham .
I ’d love to read the book , but the Kindle version is running at $ 23.73 , a price that I suspect was set by data mining .
HAIFA , Israel and ARMONK , N.Y . - 30 Jun 2009 : IBM ( NYSE : IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) today announced the public availability of Milepost GCC , the world 's first open source machine learning compiler .
The compiler intelligently optimizes applications , translating directly into shorter software development times and bigger performance gains .
Initial IBM experiments conducted on IBM System p servers achieved an average 18 percent performance improvement on embedded - application benchmarks .
In many organizations , software developers are fast becoming the nucleus of innovation , crucial to all business processes .
They build the services and capabilities that will underlie future revenue and generate business opportunity .
In fact , developers drive so much business value that the average enterprise devotes 30 to 50 percent of its entire technology infrastructure to the development and testing of software .
The new compiler , a result of collaboration between IBM and its partners in the European Union - funded Milepost consortium , is expected to dramatically reduce time - to - market for new software designs .
Applications can now be more quickly tuned for the targeted architecture , shortening the development cycle .
For example , when a company wants to develop a new mobile phone , it normally takes application developers many months to get their software running at an acceptable level of performance .
Milepost GCC can reduce the amount of time it takes to reach that level by a factor of 10 .
" Our technology automatically learns how to get the best performance from the hardware -- whether mobile phones , desktops , or entire systems -- the software will run faster and use less energy , " noted Dr. Bilha Mendelson , Manager of Code Optimization Technologies at IBM Research - Haifa .
" We opened the compiler environment so it can access artificial intelligence and machine learning guidance to automatically determine exactly what specific optimizations should be used and when to apply them to ramp - up performance . "
" We 've developed a more cost - effective development process where you can choose to integrate additional functionality or use less power in your current system , " explained Mike O'Boyle , Professor of Computer Science at the School of Informatics , University of Edinburgh and Project Coordinator for Milepost .
" Previously , the same devices could only support a limited list of features while still maintaining a high level of performance .
Significantly boosting an application 's performance means there 's now more room for added functionality while maintaining high performance . "
As a by - product of the Milepost technology , the consortium has launched a code - tuning web site available to the development community .
Developers can upload their software code to the site and automatically get input on how to tune their code so it works faster .
The Milepost GCC compiler is available to everyone as of June 25 from the consortium 's website http://www.milepost.eu.
The project consortium includes the IBM Haifa Research Lab , Israel ; the University of Edinburgh , UK ; ARC International Ltd. , UK ; CAPS Enterprise , France ; and INRIA , France .

Hummer might move to Tennessee
Fritz Henderson said today that the deal to sell the Hummer brand is proceeding .
“ The purchaser for Hummer is going through the approval processes in China , ” Henderson said .
“ We ’re cooperating with them .
The purchaser is professional , well - advised and has done a huge amount of work .
We ’re supporting the process .
Our expectation is that this deal can get done . ”
Sichuan - based Tengzhong , a Chinese firm that builds heavy - duty commercial vehicles , is in the process of buying Hummer .
Earlier , in a live Web chat on the GM FastLane blog in early June , Henderson said Tengzhong “ offered the best overall alternative , and we did not have ( a ) broad portfolio of other buyers . ”
Meanwhile , Hummer is checking out locations for its new headquarters .
Hummer , the sport utility vehicle manufacturer in the process of being spun off by General Motors , has had early discussions with Williamson County officials about relocating the company ’s headquarters here , officials said .
In late June , Hummer Chief Executive Officer Jim Taylor said in an interview the company was examining the areas around Detroit as well as Nashville for the possible site of its new corporate headquarters .
Nick Richards , Hummer spokesman , confirmed this week that the automaker has had preliminary discussions with Williamson County economic development officials .
“ We ’ve had some initial discussion with folks in Williamson County but it ’s too early to say what our plans are , ” Richards said .
“ Right now we ’re looking at all viable options for the future Hummer headquarters . ”
Matt Largen , county economic development director , confirmed the recent discussions though he declined to provide details .
Chinese manufacturer Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Co. is slated to buy the General Motors unit in a deal some expected to be finalized later this year .
That deal still needs a final sign - off from the Chinese government and recent reports say China ’s state planning agency might reject the deal because Hummer does n’t fit Beijing ’s gas - conservation goals for vehicles .
Moving away from GM means Hummer must find separate corporate offices .
It will be interesting to see what happens to this once - hot brand that represents many of the problems facing the U.S. auto industry which focused too much on gas - guzzling vehicles .
In an era of higher gas prices and a major recession , do vehicles like the Hummer H3T pictured above have a future ?
Of course it can possibly survive as a niche brand , but it will be interesting to see how the brand evolves under new ownership in this new environment .

I ’ve interviewed many a famous face , but perhaps one of my favorite memories was chatting with Dennis Kucinich at the Farm Sanctuary Gala in 2008 .
This guy is the REAL DEAL and absolutely ahead of his time .
On June 21st , the world ’s first annual Vegan Earth Day Celebration was held at Pierce College in Woodland Hills California , and Mr. Kucinich delivered a special video message .
In the clip below , Dennis says :
“ What does it mean to be a vegan ?
Well , I can share with you what it ’s meant to me .
When I made that decision back in 1995 , I was in a different state of health .
For many years I suffered from what some know as Crohn ’s Disease and I was told that there was no cure for it .
But by a vegan diet and by the use of Chinese medicine as an extra help , I do n’t have a problem anymore .
I just want to tell you that for health reasons , for compassion for animals , there are many reasons that people can make that change .
And also for helping to save the planet .
There are as many reasons why a person may be a vegan as there are vegans , I suppose .
But for me it ’s been one of the most important decisions in my life .
It ’s enabled me to have increased clarity and vitality , and its given me a joy of life that I ca n’t say that I really had when I had another diet that was weighing me down physically and spiritually . ”
See what I mean ?
HE ’S THE MAN !!

It seems quite a few individuals noticed our post attempting to justify some very peculiar language in not just a certain Goldman Sachs Internet disclaimer , but also the strange wording prominently featured in critical GS - client agreements .
One happened to be Goldman Sachs itself .
We take this opportunity to present the response by Goldman Sachs ' spokesman Ed Canaday :
Dear Mr Durbin :
This is in response to your recent blog about our web site disclaimer .
It is quite usual for websites to have disclaimers that refer to the monitoring of site usage .
Most web sites , including yours we noticed , track usage by their visitors .
This is primarily used for marketing and to help inform decision about enhancing content .
Your suggestion that we monitor our web site to facilitate front - running is untrue and offensive .
Sincerely
Ed Canaday
Vice President
Goldman , Sachs & Co .

We are happy to have caught the attention of Mr. Canaday .
We believe this is the start of a great ongoing dialog .
In that vein , Marla has replied to Mr. Canaday and Goldman Sachs , attempting to elaborate on some of the point that Ed did not touch upon .
I present it below and am looking forward for Goldman 's forthcoming reponse :
Dear Mr. Canady :
Thanks for your quick reply .
For your future reference , the correct spelling for " Tyler " is " Tyler Durden . "
( A re-viewing of " Fight Club " might be in order , but I know Goldman VPs probably rarely have time for such luxuries ) .
Obviously , we want to make sure we have our facts correct so I am pleased to see your email .
Perhaps you can lay to rest some questions we have for the record :
1. Indeed , data use disclaimers are a common feature on most websites .
Still , I think you will agree that where usage patterns are so directly linked with potential investment activity and customer intentions it is a bit unusual not to have a more explicit description of the kind of use Goldman intends here .
This is particularly so where customer attitudes are concerned , and appearances are important .
" Internal business purposes " is a bit vague in this respect , do n't you find ?
This seems unlike Goldman , usually a firm known for very careful attention to detail .
Why is a more specific description of such purposes not included ?
I would think that easier than explaining the matter repeatedly to random bloggers ( and customers ) .
2 . I notice that you have not taken the opportunity to address similar disclaimer language in the form contracts used by Goldman and Spear , Leeds and Kellogg .
Was this omission intentional or an oversight ?
( For your reference you can find the language we are curious about here : http://www.zerohedge.com/node/12083).
" You acknowledge that we may monitor your use of the Services for our own purposes ( and not for your benefit ) .
We may use the resulting information for internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory body and in compliance with applicable law and regulation . "
Not to be a stickler , but the drafting here seems quite careless .
Note the differing terms between the website disclaimer " ... the resultant information may be used by GS for its internal business purposes OR in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory organization .... " ( emphasis added ) and the form disclaimer " ... we may use the resulting information for internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory body AND in compliance with applicable law and regulation .... " ( emphasis added ) .
As a reformed legal professional myself , this seems a bit sloppy to me .
Can you comment on the language and in particular why a more explicit definition of " internal business purposes " is not included ?
3 . I also notice that you do not specifically address our question :
" ... has Goldman has ever actually used 360 submitted information in the decision making process of its prop trading desk ? "
Could you give us a response there ?
Perhaps you might augment that to include the decision making process of any Goldman investment decisions rather than just the prop desk and all information Goldman collects about 360 users .
And lastly , while we have your attention , we were hoping you could make a statement for Zero Hedge and its readers on the long discussed topic on our pages regarding Goldman Sachs ' effective monopolization of Principal Program Trading in the New York Stock Exchange .
In other venues you have attributed this domination solely to Goldman 's selection as the one and only SLP currently used by the NYSE .
Would you care to elaborate how that fits in with the NYSE 's upcoming changes to their DPTR ( http://www.zerohedge.com/node/11769)
specifically as pertaining to J and K account type indicators .
Was Goldman in any way consulted in the making of this decision by the NYSE ?
Did Goldman have any direct communication with the SEC on this issue ?
Thanks for your help with these matters .
As an aside , if there is a contact at Goldman we can routinely direct these questions to that might be helpful for both of us going forward .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Best Regards ,

Of course , as soon as we receive additional disclosure on this matter , we will post it promptly .

DOSE :
200 seeds oral Belladonna 600 seeds oral Belladonna 900 seeds oral Belladonna
BODY WEIGHT : 195 lb
This trip occured 2 years ago in the summer when I was 15 years old .
I researched a little bit about the plant .
I found out that all parts of the plant are poisonous , but I could n't find any dosage information on eating the seeds .
The main chemicals in this plant are tropane alkaloids ( scopalomine , atropine , hyoscyamine ) .
Many plants have tropane alkaloids , like datura , henbane , and european mandrake , but atropa belladonna is very high up in potency .
So I ordered a 1 / 4 ounce of these seeds online , as they are legal .
A 1/4 ounce comes with approximately 7000 seeds .
I decided to start off slow , with about 50 seeds .
These seeds are very small .
Like the size of poppy seeds .
I was n't feeling anything after the 50 seeds , so I jumped to 200 seeds .
I still was n't feeling anything , so I went to sleep .
The next day , I decided to take another shot at it .
I started off with about 200 seeds .
Waited about 2 hours and nothing was happening .
I then took about 600 more seeds .
I wait another 2 hours .
I was n't feeling anything , but when I saw myself in the mirror , my pupils were dilated almost to the size of my whole eyeball .
( eye doctors use atropine to dilate pupils ) .
I was getting mad because it was taking so long to start working , and I did n't even know if it was going to work , so I just downed about 900 more seeds .
Me and 2 of my friends start walking to a firehouse fair a few blocks away , to check it out .
I start feeling my motor skills decreasing .
When we get to the fair it is about 7 pm and we just sit down with a few friends for like an hour , just talking and watching the fair .
After about a half hour , I get up and start walking , my motor skills just keep decreasing , I think the ground is shifting under me , like in one of those funhouse type things .
I keep on tripping ( well , I am tripping ) but tripping over the shifting grounds .
So one of my friends and I decide to leave , because there are cops , and I was getting very messed up .
So we went to a park around the block .
We sit on a bench , and I decide do smoke a bowl of weed .
I am uncapable of packing the bowl , and I just get too tired to try anymore , so I put everything down , and going in a corner by some bushes .
I start feeling the leaves and taking bites out of some , while my friend is sleeping on the bench .
I dont know how long I was sitting by the bushes , but it seemed long and short at the same time .
I wake my friend up , and she wants to go home .
She does n't know my part of the neighborhood well , so she asks me to walk with her .
We start walking down the blocks .
I 'm just walking on the sidewalks , trying not to fall .
I start climbing mountains ( which were really just cracks in the sidewalk .
I then come across a mushroom on the grass .
It looked so amazing .
My friend yells to me , and when I look back , the mushroom is gone .
We keep walking .
We 've been walking in circles , I forgot where we were supposed to go , but we finally made it to my house , and we went our separate ways .
While I 'm at home in my room for awhile , I come out into the kitchen to get a drink .
My mother comes in and asks me who I was talking to in my room .
I tell her its my friend dan , who was one of the friends I had over earlier .
She tells me to ask him to leave , or she 'll call his parents , because its too late .
I actually thought it was daytime , but it was really 3 in the morning .
So I go back into my room , but I cant find him .
My mom follows me around the house looking for him .
I check in closets , in the basement .
I thought he was hiding .
I checked the backyard , and said there was a hole in the fence .
That he must have left through the back .
Now I go back in my room alone for a while .
My mom then comes in my room for some reason .
I tell her I cant sleep , because there are seeds all over my bed .
She asks me to show her what seeds , so I start picking up ' nothing ' very carefully , and putting ' nothing ' into my moms open hand .
She then tells me to go sleep in her bed , but I could n't in there , because there were seeds in her bed too .
So I go back into my room again .
After awhile , I go into the bathroom , and start playing with the hand soap dispenser bottle .
I would keep on putting it on different shelves , bring it into my room , and my mom would just keep moving it back .
Later that night , my mom finds me hysterically laughing at myself in the bathroom mirror , saying that there is 3 of me .
In the morning , I am still very out of my mind , so my dad tells me to get in the car .
We start driving , and my brothers follow behind .
I just thought that we were going on an outing .
We finally parked and reached a big building .
I told my brother I thought we were in California .
I then told my dad that I was a vampire as I sucked blood from my finger , which really was n't there .
When we got into a building , I was taken into a room .
It took me about 15 minutes to realize that I was in a hospital .
I started going nuts .
I started fighting guards .
It took about 5 guards and my brother to hold me down .
But I just submitted to them , because while the fight was going on , I saw a baby stroller in the room , and I accidentally kicked it , making me feel guilty , so I let go .
I was then given a shot of a tranquilizer , I forget what it was called , and was strapped down to a stretcher and taken into another room .
In this room , I could see out the open door , people that I knew from my school , but they were n't really there .
I then was seeing scorpion - like creatures crawling and flipping over each other on the walls .
I also thought I saw a laptop at the end of the stretcher , and thought it was mine , but I could n't get it , cause I was tied down .
I was then being pushed on the stretcher .
A hole opened up in the wall and I was taken through a secret passageway , in circles .
obviously that was n't real either .
But I was taken to the ICU .
There , the trip started getting harder .
I thought that I was in a school auditorium , and a game show was going on the stage .
And I saw a girl next to me that I fell in love with .
I felt the love through my body .
It was a blonde girl with no eyes .
She was also deaf and mute , with electricity running through her completely black mouth .
After a bunch of stuff I dont really remember , smoke canisters were thrown through windows in the auditorium , spewing smoke all over .
I then snapped out .
I was tripping for 3 days .
I blacked out for alot of the stuff , but my parents and brothers told me about some stuff that happened .
I was put in a straight jacket that had ties from head to toe .
I yelled and cursed at the doctors and nurses .
At one point they had me wear a diaper , even though I was n't going to the bathroom .
They did n't want to give me a catheter , because they were afraid of what might happen .
I had to be given baths .
I was treated like a baby , because I was completely out of my mind and did n't know what was going on .
My mom told me that when she went back home , she found a glass in the fridge with the top of a spray bottle in it .
Also , the top of the soap dispenser thing was missing , and my brother found it in a tissue box .
This was definately the most intense trip I ever had , and I will never forget it .
I might do it again , but not anytime soon .
I am growing it now , to save it for the future .
Overal , I ate about 1500 seeds .
and tripped for 3 days .
I did n't really know I was tripping .
I was just taken to a different world , and all the stuff that happened there was normal .
US military researchers are looking to build networks of small , low - power transmitter boxes which together can perform " surgical jamming " of digital signals - shutting down cellphones and sat nav receivers within an area " on the order of a city block corner " .
Watch out for the green bubbles
The new initiative is called Precision Electronic Warfare ( PREW ) .
It comes , of course , from our old friends at DARPA , where it 's their goal to give every double - edged sword a bleeding edge .
According to DARPA , in hardware terms PREW would consist of " an ad hoc sparse array consisting of multiple airborne and / or ground nodes ... robust , low cost , small size , weight and power distributed platforms " .
Each PREW node would be equipped with a highly - accurate clock synchronised with those aboard its fellows , perhaps one of the tiny ones developed for the Chip - Scale Atomic Clocks programme , and would probably be able to communicate with them as well .
It would also have " localisation " - ie a good idea of its location , presumably from GPS sat nav or some similar tech .
All these would merely be enabling accessories , however , allowing the PREW radio - cloud to use its " energy transmission " capabilities with unusual precision .
The 40 - plus nodes would be able to point and focus their jamming power on an area perhaps 100 m across - as DARPA says , a street corner - from as far as 20 km without affecting reception in adjacent areas .
Exactly what frequencies the PREW should be able to target is a secret , but DARPA offer a broad hint by saying that " target signals were chosen as representative of a range of signal classes , to include navigation , digital infrastructure - based communications , and digital non-infrastructure communications " .
Or in other words GPS sat nav , cellphone and CB - type radio bands .
And there 's another handy wrinkle :
For point - to - a - spot the general belief is that a closed - loop beacon approach will be needed to achieve the required accuracy .
The proposed system can utilize beacons that are within the node constellation , near the target area , or within the target area .
The beacon device can be a cooperative participant in the system or a device that is unaware that it is being used as a beacon .
In other words , the system would be able to lock onto your cellphone and hold you within a bubble of jamming no matter how you moved about , denying you any communications or navigation services .
If you were n't carrying a suitable marker beacon , one could be planted on you .
Presumably in time DARPA will also be able to make the street lights switch off as you pass , then switch on again once you move on .
Another application could see a bubble of sat nav denial wrapped around an enemy missile or autonomous vehicle , without affecting nearby US units ; or a given cell tower suddenly blotted out ; or you name it .
Interesting stuff , with the usual caveat that not many DARPA projects ever succeed .
There 's more from the federal warboffins here ( pdf ) . ®

Straw and Hemp Houses To Be Huff - and - Puff Proof Buildings of the Future
July 21st , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
Researchers from the University of Bath will be constructing a “ BaleHaus ” this summer made from prefabricated straw bale and hemp cladding panels .
The house will be a model for building carbon zero homes of the future .
And because straw and hemp efficiently absorb carbon dioxide while they grow , the buildings made from them might even have a negative carbon footprint .
[ social_buttons ]
The house is meant to be the ultimate green - friendly structure .
Straw can be grown locally and , being a byproduct of farming , is renewable , biodegradable and recyclable .
Hemp and straw also make good building materials due to their remarkably efficient insulating properties , which means energy needed to keep them cool or heated is minimal .
Best of all , they make cheap building materials , and with the money saved due to lowered energy costs , straw and hemp homes are practical as well as efficient .
The two story BaleHaus is to be built on the University of Bath campus and will be made using prefabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales or hemp and rendered with a breathable lime - based system .
The home will be closely monitored for a year after being built for its insulating properties , humidity levels , air tightness and sound insulation qualities .
Studies have already shown the low carbon potential of houses made of hemp .
Unlike in the U.S. , which is the only industrialized country which still outlaws the production of hemp , the infamous cannabis plant can be grown locally in the U.K. , and its use as a building material could bring an economic boost to local agricultural communities .
Some consumers might be reminded of the fairytale , “ The Three Little Pigs ” , where a big bad wolf easily blows down the straw - made house of one of the pigs , and proceeds to eat him .
Though in a world where the big bad wolf is global climate change , it might be straw houses that ultimately save us .

CBO Estimates 36 million will still be uninsured ten years from now under most robust Democratic Plan
The cloudy rhetoric of “ universal health care ” is being clarified with the first Congressional Budget Office initial scoring of a health care bill .
The two key issues of cost and coverage are not going to be solved with the health care reform being considered .
The CBO scored the Kennedy - Dodd proposal , the most robust of the reform proposals actually being considered , and the bottom line is that it will leave 36 million without coverage a decade from now .
That is not what the Democrats and Obama have been promising .
It is nowhere near universal coverage .
According to the CBO , “ Once the proposal was fully implemented , about 39 million individuals would obtain coverage through the new insurance exchanges .
At the same time , the number of people who had coverage through an employer would decline by about 15 million ( or roughly 10 percent ) , and coverage from other sources would fall by about 8 million , so the net decrease in the number of people uninsured would be about 16 million . ”
And , the Obama administration has sent word to Democrats to stop using the phrase “ universal coverage . ”
Lynn Sweet reports in the Chicago Sun -Times :
In discussing a ‘ public option , ’ Obama ’s message team is telling Democrats on Capitol Hill to avoid using the phrase ‘ universal coverage ’ because that phrase is often associated with a single - payer system , which is often associated with ‘ socialism , ’ which the Obama administration does not support .
The Obama team - approved language is instead to talk about ‘ guaranteed health care , ’ a phrase that is less polarizing .
Guaranteed health care is just another empty marketing phrase by the eloquent , teleprompter wordsmiths in the Obama administration .
Despite the new rhetoric there is no guarantee of health care in any of the proposals being considered .
The “ universal coverage ” phrase was always used by Democrats who opposed single payer as a phrase to confuse the voters .
Universal coverage sure sounds like it achieves the goal of single payer — providing health care for all .
But , it was always merely a marketing tool .
Now that the Democrats and Obama have kept single payer boxed up and removed from consideration they can abandon this PR phrase for fear of looking too “ socialist . ”
As to cost , the CBO reports $ 10 trillion in new expenses over ten years .
Yes , some will get lower premiums , but that is just a shifting of costs from premiums to taxes .
We will still be paying for wasteful and over - priced health care — still paying more per person than any country in the world — just out of a different pocket .
The failure to confront the waste of the multi-payer , profit - oriented insurance - based system ensures that costs will not be controlled .
Obama ’s Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told the New York Times that , “ The entire discussion has to be centered on controlling or reducing costs . ”
In fact , if the real goal were to reduce costs , single payer would have been the model they used .
But , the goal is not to control costs ; it is to preserve the profits of their donors .
Health professionals gave Obama $ 11,532,962 and the insurance industry donors gave the Obama campaign $ 2,211,348 .
The Obama administration ’s approach puts their interests ahead of the necessities of the American people and of the American economy .
In his speech to the AMA Obama made the point crisply , “ If we do not fix our health care system , America may go the way of GM — paying more , getting less and going broke . ”
But , the Democratic proposals do not really try to fix the broken system ; they just pour more tax dollars into it .
Obama ’s concern is borne out by the CBO .
In discussing the need to confront health care they point out : “ The federal budget is on an unsustainable path , primarily because of the rising cost of health care . ”
Shifting these costs from premiums to taxes does nothing to change this reality .
In fact it is likely to make federal budget deficits worse .
More than 80 members of the House of Representatives have co-sponsored a bill , HR 676 , which would provide coverage to all Americans — a real guarantee of health care , not teleprompter rhetoric — and that would really control costs .
Will Obama ever have the political courage to actually fight for what he knows is the answer ?
State senator Obama , circa 2003 , said , “ I happen to be a proponent of a single payer universal health care program . ” ( applause )
“ And that ’s what I ’d like to see .
But as all of you know , we may not get there immediately .
Because first we have to take back the White House , we have to take back the Senate , and we have to take back the House . ”
Well , the public has given the Democrats all three but Obama and the Democratic leadership have refused to even consider single payer .
Instead they fight for the interests of the insurance industry and falsely call it health care reform .
Mr. President , please show some political leadership — stand up for what you know is right .

Russians urge governor to save Fort Ross STATE PARK CLOSURES : Fort Ross
The fort is shaped like a square with a high redwood fence circling the chapel and buildings .
Fort Ross , a state park on the coast of California , is slated for closing .
The former Russian outpost is getting support from politicians and even the Russian government to keep it open to the public .

The Russians came back to Fort Ross on Thursday nearly two centuries after founding the coastal California settlement , but instead of spearing otters , they want to preserve a legacy .
Stunned upon learning that California might close Fort Ross , the Russian government dispatched its ambassador to the United States , Sergey Kislyak , to urge Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to save the picturesque wooden outpost from the state 's budget guillotine .
" It 's not my job to tell the government of California what to do with its budget , " he said while touring the fort - turned - park Thursday .
" But this place is wonderful proof that the U.S. and Russia have had a very rich , largely positive shared history .
We would like to see it remain open . "
The ambassador stopped short of offering cash to maintain the fort , which loses about $ 800,000 annually .
No decisions will be made , he said , until the state releases its closure list .
" But one can begin thinking of creating ways to save this place , " he said .
A spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger welcomed the Russian intervention .
" The governor understands that the budget cuts to state parks are difficult , " said Lisa Page , spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger .
" We are open to any creative ideas they ( the Russians ) may have , like public - private partnerships , to keep as many parks open as possible . "
As many as 100 California state parks will be closed as part of a deal signed by the governor last month to close a $ 24 billion state budget deficit .
The state plans to announce after Labor Day which parks will close , and Fort Ross is apparently on the list .
Meeting of dignitaries
The Russian ambassador visited the park with the Russian consul general from San Francisco , Vladimir Vinokurov , state park officials and other dignitaries .
Kislyak thanked California for its century of stewardship of the windswept fort , and he pleaded with the governor to spare the site , which he said holds significant cultural , historic and sentimental value for the Kremlin , Russians and Russian Americans .
Fort Ross was built in 1812 by Russian traders , hoping to grow food for Russian settlements in Alaska , trade with the Spanish in California , and collect otter pelts to sell at home and in China .
Russian settlement
At its peak , the settlement included a few hundred Russians , native Alaskans who accompanied them and local American Indians .
The busy settlement overlooking the Pacific included a Russian Orthodox chapel , orchards , a stockade , cannons and dozens of homes .
In 1841 , after the otter population had dwindled to nearly nothing and farming efforts had failed , the Russians sold the fort to John Sutter , who moved the livestock and some supplies to his own fort near Sacramento .
The fort and its 3,300 - acre environs were then used as a ranch until the 1970s .
The state bought the remaining fort buildings in 1903 as a historic park , gradually acquiring the surrounding land from the ranchers , the Call family , and rebuilding the structures that had rotted , burned or crumbled .
The only original building is the Rotchev House , a former manager 's home with 8 - inch - thick walls made of old - growth redwood .
In its heyday , Fort Ross was the height of luxury , said Sarjan Holt , administrator for the Fort Ross Interpretive Association .
The fort included pianos , wood - burning stoves from Russia , elegant furniture and glass windows - a far cry from the more rustic accommodations at the Spanish missions .
Global destination
" The Russians who came here were well educated and cultured , " she said .
" The history , the culture here , makes it a very important destination , not just for California but internationally . "
About 200,000 people visit Fort Ross each year , many of them Russians seeking signs of an earlier Russian foray into California .
The park is the 77th most visited in California .
Visitors on Tuesday said they would n't mind if the Russian government helped keep Fort Ross open .
" If they want to give us foreign aid , so what ? " said Wanda Eberle , a retiree from Virginia .
" We can give them free admission when they come . "
The request by Ban Ki-moon to meet with jailed Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been rejected during what the UN secretary general has called a " very tough " diplomatic mission .
Ban met with junta chief Than Shwe , the senior general in Naypyidaw , the administrative centre of Burma , also known as Myanmar , on Friday and requested a meeting with Suu Kyi face - to - face .
Ban said he was told the request was denied because Suu Kyi is still on trial .
He said he repeated his request , stressing its importance , and is waiting for another reply .
Suu Kyi , 63 , has been jailed for nearly 14 of the last 20 years .
The pro-democracy leader is on trial for allegedly breaking the terms of her house arrest in May by letting American John Yettaw stay in her lakeside Rangoon home for two days .
If convicted , Suu Kyi faces five years in jail .
Burmese officials announced Friday , after Ban arrived in the country , that her trial , which had been set to resume , has been adjourned until July 10 , when the defence 's final witness will take the stand .
Ban has said one of the key goals of his visit to Burma is to garner the release of all political prisoners , including Suu Kyi .
Ban is the first UN secretary general to meet with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate since her first period of detention started in 1989 .
The UN chief said he also wants to encourage the junta to resume dialogue with the opposition and to ensure conditions exist for credible elections in 2010 .
" I would like to help move your country forward and appreciate your commitment to moving your country forward , " Ban told Than Shwe ahead of their one - hour meeting .
Ban is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Gen .
Thein Sein before meeting with ethnic minority groups and leaders of opposition political parties , including Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy .
Refuse to relinquish power
Suu Kyi's opposition party won national elections in 1990 , but Burma 's generals refused to relinquish power .
Her trial has sparked international outrage from world leaders , including accusations that the ruling junta is trying to keep Suu Kyi in detention during elections it has planned for next year .
Ban said that he was " assured that the Myanmar authorities will make sure that this election will be held in a fair and free and transparent manner . "
Senior UN officials travelling with Ban called the trip a " highly risky " one for the secretary general , whose image would suffer if the junta ignores his demands — as it has repeatedly shunned global calls in the past for democratic reforms .
" This is going to be , I know , a very difficult mission , " Ban told reporters while en route to Burma .
" But at the same time , I know that to bring changes to Myanmar , political conciliation and democratization , we need to do our best . "

This makes it sounds more like an anti-pattern , as it appears to describe something that should be avoided .
While that is valid , it is also very strongly a pattern with firm prescriptive guides .
When you start seeing a " midlayer " you know you are in the target area for this pattern and it is time to see if this pattern applies and wants to guide you in a different direction .
In the Linux world , the term " midlayer " seems ( in your author 's mind and also in Google 's cache ) most strongly related to SCSI .
The " scsi midlayer " went through a bad patch quite some years ago , and there was plenty of debate on the relevant lists as to why it failed to do what was needed .
It was watching those discussions that provided the germ from which this pattern slowly took form .
The term " midlayer " clearly implies a " top layer " and a " bottom layer " .
In this context , the " top " layer is a suite of code that applies to lots of related subsystems .
This might be the POSIX system call layer which supports all system calls , the block layer which supports all block devices , or the VFS which supports all filesystems .
The block layer would be the top layer in the " scsi midlayer " example .
The " bottom " layer then is a particular implementation of some service .
It might be a specific system call , or the driver for a specific piece of hardware or a specific filesystem .
Drivers for different SCSI controllers fill the bottom layer to the SCSI midlayer .
Brief reflection on the list of examples shows that which position a piece of code takes is largely a matter of perspective .
To the VFS , a given filesystem is part of the bottom layer .
To a block device , the same filesystem is part of the top layer .
A midlayer sits between the top and bottom layers .
It receives requests from the top layer , performs some processing common to the implementations in the bottom layer , and then passes the preprocessed requests - presumably now much simpler and domain - specific - down to the relevant driver .
This provides uniformity of implementation , code sharing , and greatly simplifies that task of implementing a bottom - layer driver .
The core thesis of the " midlayer mistake " is that midlayers are bad and should not exist .
That common functionality which it is so tempting to put in a midlayer should instead be provided as library routines which can used , augmented , or ignored by each bottom level driver independently .
Thus every subsystem that supports multiple implementations ( or drivers ) should provide a very thin top layer which calls directly into the bottom layer drivers , and a rich library of support code that eases the implementation of those drivers .
This library is available to , but not forced upon , those drivers .
To try to illuminate this pattern , we will explore three different subsystems and see how the pattern specifically applies to them - the block layer , the VFS , and the ' md ' raid layer ( i.e. the areas your author is most familiar with ) .
Block Layer
The bulk of the work done by the block layer is to take ' read ' and ' write ' requests for block devices and send them off to the appropriate bottom level device driver .
Sounds simple enough .
The interesting point is that block devices tend to involve rotating media , and rotating media benefits from having consecutive requests being close together in address space .
This helps reduce seek time .
Even non-rotating media can benefit from having requests to adjacent addresses be adjacent in time so they can be combined into a smaller number of large requests .
So , many block devices can benefit from having all requests pass through an elevator algorithm to sort them by address and so make better use of the device .
It is very tempting to implement this elevator algorithm in a ' midlayer ' .
i.e. a layer just under the top layer .
This is exactly what Linux did back in the days of 2.2 kernels and earlier .
Requests came in to ll_rw_block ( ) ( the top layer ) which performed basic sanity checks and initialized some internal - use fields of the structure , and then passed the request to make_request ( ) - the heart of the elevator .
Not quite every request went to make_request ( ) though .
A special exception was made for " md " devices .
Those requests were passed to md_make_request ( ) which did something completely different as is appropriate for a RAID device .
Here we see the first reason to dislike midlayers - they encourage special cases .
When writing a midlayer it is impossible to foresee every possible need that a bottom level driver might have , so it is impossible to allow for them all in the midlayer .
The midlayer could conceivably be redesigned every time a new requirement came along , but that is unlikely to be an effective use of time .
Instead , special cases tend to grow .
Today 's block layer is , in many ways , similar to the way it was back then with an elevator being very central .
Of course lots of detail has changed and there is a lot more sophistication in the scheduling of IO requests .
But there is still a strong family resemblance .
One important difference ( for our purposes ) is the existence of the function blk_queue_make_request ( ) which every block device driver must call , either directly or indirectly via a call to blk_init_queue ( ) .
This registers a function , similar to make_request ( ) or md_make_request ( ) from 2.2 , which should be called to handle each IO request .
This one little addition effectively turns the elevator from a midlayer which is imposed on every device into a library function which is available for devices to call upon .
This was a significant step in the right direction .
It is now easy for drivers to choose not to use the elevator .
All virtual drivers ( md , dm , loop , drbd , etc. ) do this , and even some drivers for physical hardware ( e.g. umem ) provide their own make_request_fn ( ) .
While the elevator has made a firm break from being a mid-layer , it still retains the appearance of a midlayer in a number of ways .
One example is the struct request_queue structure ( defined in < linux / blkdev.h > ) .
This structure is really part of the block layer .
It contains fields that are fundamental parts of the block interface , such as the make_request_fn ( ) function pointer that we have already mentioned .
However many other fields are specific to the elevator code , such as elevator ( which chooses among several IO schedulers ) and last_merge ( which is used to speed lookups in the current queue ) .
While the elevator can place fields in struct request_queue , all other code must make use of the queuedata pointer to store a secondary data structure .
This arrangement is another tell - tale for a midlayer .
When a primary data structure contains a pointer to a subordinate data structure , we probably have a midlayer managing that primary data structure .
A better arrangement is to use the " embedded anchor " pattern from the previous article in this series .
The bottom level driver should allocate its own data structure which contains the data structure ( or data structures ) used by the libraries embedded within it .
struct inode is a good example of this approach , though with slightly different detail .
In 2.2 , struct inode contained a union of the filesystem - specific data structure for each filesystem , plus a pointer ( generic_ip ) for another filesystem to use .
In the 2.6 kernel , struct inode is normally embedded inside a filesystem - specific inode structure ( though there is still an i_private pointer which seems unnecessary ) .
One last tell - tale sign of a midlayer , which we can still see hints of in the elevator , is the tendency to group unrelated code together .
The library design will naturally provide separate functionality as separate functions and leave it to the bottom level driver to call whatever it needs .
The midlayer will simply call everything that might be needed .
If we look at __make_request ( ) ( the 2.6 entry point for the elevator ) , we see an early call to blk_queue_bounce ( ) .
This provides support for hardware that cannot access the entire address space when using DMA to move data between system memory and the device .
To support such cases , data sometimes needs to be copied into more accessible memory before being transferred to the device , or to be copied from that memory after being transferred from the device .
This functionality is quite independent of the elevator , yet it is being imposed on all users of the elevator .
So we see in the block layer , and its relationship with the elevator a subsystem which was once implemented as a midlayer , but has taken a positive step away from being a midlayer by making the elevator clearly optional .
It still contains traces of its heritage which have served as a useful introduction to the key identifiers of a midlayer : code being imposed on lower layer , special cases in that code , data structures storing pointers to subordinate data structures , and unrelated code being called by the one support function .
With this picture in mind , let us move on .
The VFS
The VFS ( or Virtual File System ) is a rich area to explore to learn about midlayers and their alternatives .
This is because there is a lot of variety in filesystems , a lot of useful services that they can make use of , and a lot of work has been done to make it all work together effectively and efficiently .
The top layer of the VFS is largely contained in the vfs_ function calls which provide the entry points to the VFS .
These are called by the various sys_ functions that implement system calls , by nfsd which does a lot of file system access without using system calls , and from a few other parts of the kernel that need to deal with files .
The vfs_ functions fairly quickly call directly in to the filesystem in question through one of a number of _operations structures which contain a list of function pointers .
There are inode_operations , file_operations , super_operations etc , depending on what sort of object is being manipulated .
This is exactly the model that the " midlayer mistake " pattern advocates .
A thin top layer calls directly into the bottom layer which will , as we shall see , make heavy use of library functions to perform its task .
We will explore and contrast two different sets of services provided to filesystems , the page cache and the directory entry cache .
The page cache
Filesystems generally want to make use of read - ahead and write - behind .
When possible , data should be read from storage before it is needed so that , when it is needed , it is already available , and once it has been read , it is good to keep it around in case , as is fairly common , it is needed again .
Similarly , there are benefits from delaying writes a little , so that throughput to the device can be evened out and applications do n't need to wait for writeout to complete .
Both of these features are provided by the page cache , which is largely implemented by mm / filemap.c and mm/ page - writeback.c .
In its simplest form a filesystem provides the page cache with an object called an address_space which has , in its address_space_operations , routines to read and write a single page .
The page cache then provides operations that can be used as file_operations to provide the abstraction of a file that must be provided to the VFS top layer .
If you look at the file_operations for a regular file in ext3 , we see :
const struct file_operations ext3_file_operations = { .llseek = generic_file_llseek , .read = do_sync_read , .write = do_sync_write , .aio_read = generic_file_aio_read , .aio_write = ext3_file_write , .unlocked_ioctl = ext3_ioctl , #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT .compat_ioctl = ext3_compat_ioctl , #endif .mmap = generic_file_mmap , .open = generic_file_open , .release = ext3_release_file , .fsync = ext3_sync_file , .splice_read = generic_file_splice_read , .splice_write = generic_file_splice_write , } ;
Eight of the thirteen operations are generic functions provided by the page cache .
Of the remaining five , the two ioctl ( ) operations and the release ( ) operation require implementations specific to the filesystem ; ext3_file_write ( ) and ext3_sync_file are moderately sized wrappers around generic functions provided by the page cache .
This is the epitome of good subsystem design according to our pattern .
The page cache is a well defined library which can be used largely as it stands ( as when reading from an ext3 file ) , allows the filesystem to add functionality around various entry points ( like ext3_file_write ( ) ) and can be simply ignored altogether when not relevant ( as with sysfs or procfs ) .
Even here there is a small element of a midlayer imposing on the bottom layer as the generic struct inode contains a struct address_space which is only used by the page cache and is irrelevant to non-page - cache filesystems .
This small deviation from the pattern could be justified by the simplicity it provides , as the vast majority of filesystems do use the page cache .
The directory entry cache ( dcache )
Like the page cache , the dcache provides an important service for a filesystem .
File names are often accessed multiple times , much more so than the contents of file .
So caching them is vital , and having a well designed and efficient directory entry cache is a big part of having efficient access to all filesystem objects .
The dcache has one very important difference from the page cache though : it is not optional .
It is imposed upon every filesystem and is effectively a " midlayer . "
Understanding why this is , and whether it is a good thing , is an important part of understanding the value and applicability of this design pattern .
One of the arguments in favor of an imposed dcache is that there are some interesting races related to directory renames ; these races are easy to fail to handle properly .
Rather than have every filesystem potentially getting these wrong , they can be solved once and for all in the dcache .
The classic example is if / a/x is renamed to /b/c/ x at the same time that /b/ c is renamed to / a/x / c .
If these both succeed , then ' c ' and ' x ' will contain each other and be disconnected from the rest of the directory tree , which is a situation we would not want .
Protecting against this sort of race is not possible if we only cache directory entries at a per-directory level .
The common caching code needs to at least be able to see a whole filesystem to be able to detect such a possible loop - causing race .
So maintaining a directory cache on a per-filesystem basis is clearly a good idea , and strongly encouraging local filesystems to use it is very sensible , but whether forcing it on all filesystems is a good choice is less clear .
Network filesystems do not benefit from the loop detection that the dcache can provide as all of that must be done on the server anyway .
" Virtual " filesystems such as sysfs , procfs , ptyfs do n't particularly need a cache at all as all the file names are in memory permanently .
Whether a dcache hurts these filesystems is not easy to tell as we do n't have a complete and optimized implementation that does not depend on the dcache to compare with .
Of the key identifiers for a midlayer that were discussed above , the one that most clearly points to a cost is the fact that midlayers tend to grow special case code .
So it should be useful to examine the dcache to see if it has suffered from this .
The first special cases that we find in the dcache are among the flags stored in d_flags .
Two of these flags are DCACHE_AUTOFS_PENDING and DCACHE_NFSFS_RENAMED .
Each is specific to just one filesystem .
The AUTOFS flag appears to only be used internally to autofs , so this is n't really a special case in the dcache .
However the NFS flag is used to guide decisions made in common dcache code in a couple of places , so it clearly is a special case , though not necessarily a very costly one .
Another place to look for special case code is when a function pointer in an _operations structure is allowed to be NULL , and the NULL is interpreted as implying some specific action ( rather than no action at all ) .
This happens when a new operation is added to support some special - case , and NULL is left to mean the ' default ' case .
This is not always a bad thing , but it can be a warning signal .
In the dentry_operations structure there are several functions that can be NULL. d_revalidate ( ) is an example which is quite harmless .
It simply allows a filesystem to check if the entry is still valid and either update it or invalidate it .
Filesystems that do n't need this simply do nothing as having a function call to do nothing is pointless .
However , we also find d_hash ( ) and d_compare ( ) , which allow the filesystem to provide non-standard hash and compare functions to support , for example , case - insensitive file names .
This does look a lot like a special case because the common code uses an explicit default if the pointer is NULL .
A more uniform implementation would have every filesystem providing a non-NULL d_hash ( ) and d_compare ( ) , where many filesystems would choose the case - sensitive ones from a library .
It could easily be argued that doing this - forcing an extra function call for hash and compare on common filesystems - would be an undue performance cost , and this is true .
But given that , why is it appropriate to impose such a performance cost on filesystems which follow a different standard ?
A more library - like approach would have the VFS pass a path to the filesystem and allow it to do the lookup , either by calling in to a cache handler in a library , or by using library routines to pick out the name components and doing the lookups directly against its own stored file tree .
So the dcache is clearly a midlayer , and does have some warts as a result .
Of all the midlayers in the kernel it probably best fits the observation above that they could " be redesigned every time a new requirement came along " .
The dcache does see constant improvement to meet the needs of new filesystems .
Whether that is " an effective use of time " must be a debate for a different forum .
The MD / RAID layer
Our final example as we consider midlayers and libraries , is the md driver which supports various software - RAID implementations and related code .
md is interesting because it has a mixture of midlayer - like features and library - like features and as such is a bit of a mess .
The " ideal " design for the md driver is ( according to the " midlayer mistake " pattern ) to provide a bunch of useful library routines which independent RAID - level modules would use .
So , for example , RAID1 would be a standalone driver which might use some library support for maintaining spares , performing resync , and reading metadata .
RAID0 would be a separate driver which use the same code to read metadata , but which has no use for the spares management or resync code .
Unfortunately that is not how it works .
One of the reasons for this relates to the way the block layer formerly managed major and minor device numbers .
It is all much more flexible today , but in the past a different major number implied a unique device driver and a unique partitioning scheme for minor numbers .
Major numbers were a limited resource , and having a separate major for RAID0 , RAID1 , and RAID5 etc would have been wasteful .
So just one number was allocated ( 9 ) and one driver had to be responsible for all RAID levels .
This necessity undoubtedly created the mindset that a midlayer to handle all RAID levels was the right thing to do , and it persisted .
Some small steps have been made towards more of a library focus , but they are small and inconclusive .
One simple example is the md_check_recovery ( ) function .
This is a library function in the sense that a particular RAID level implementation needs to explicitly call it or it does n't get used .
However , it performs several unrelated tasks such as updating the metadata , flushing the write - intent - bitmap , removing devices which have failed , and ( surprisingly ) checking if recovery is needed .
As such it is a little like part of a mid-layer in that it imposes that a number of unrelated tasks are combined together .
Perhaps a better example is md_register_thread ( ) and friends .
Some md arrays need to have a kernel thread running to provide some support ( such as scheduling read requests to different drives after a failure ) .
md.c provides library routines md_register_thread ( ) and md_unregister_thread( ) , which can be called by the personality as required .
This is all good .
However md takes it upon itself to choose to call md_unregister_thread ( ) at times rather than leaving that up to the particular RAID level driver .
This is a clear violation of the library approach .
While this is not causing any actual problems at the moment , it is exactly the sort of thing that could require the addition of special cases later .
It has often been said that md and dm should be unified in some way ( though it is less often that the practical issues of what this actually means are considered ) .
Both md and dm suffer from having a distinct midlayer that effectively keeps them separate .
A full understanding of the fact that this midlayer is a mistake , and moving to replace it with an effective library structure is likely to be an important first step towards any sort of unification .
Wrap up
This ends our exploration of midlayers and libraries in the kernel -- except maybe to note that more recent additions include such things as libfs , which provides support for virtual filesystems , and libata , which provides support for SATA drives .
These show that the tendency away from midlayers is not only on the wishlist of your author but is present in existing code .
Hopefully it has resulted in an understanding of the issues behind the " midlayer mistake " pattern and the benefits of following the library approach .
Here too ends our little series on design patterns in the Linux kernel .
There are doubtlessly many more that could be usefully extracted , named , and illuminated with examples .
But they will have to await another day .
Once compiled , such a collection would provide invaluable insight on how to build kernel code both effectively and uniformly .
This would be useful in understanding how current code works ( or why it does n't ) , in making choices when pursuing new development , or when commenting on design during the review process , and would generally improve visibility at this design level of kernel construction .
Hopefully this could lead , in the long term , to an increase in general quality .
For now , as a contribution to that process , here is a quick summary of the Patterns we have found .

Exercises
Fromme attempted to escape from prison in 1987
A follower of 1960s cult leader Charles Manson has been freed from jail after serving nearly 34 years for trying to kill then - President Gerald Ford .
Lynette " Squeaky " Fromme , 60 , was convicted in 1975 .
She was freed from the Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth , Texas , at about 0800 ( 1400 BST ) on Friday .
She was not involved in the 1969 Manson " family " murder of actress Sharon Tate .
Manson himself is serving life for murdering Ms Tate and eight others .
Fromme received a life sentence for pointing a gun at Mr Ford at an event in Sacramento , California .
Secret service agents managed to restrain Fromme and Mr Ford was unhurt in the incident .
She was the first person to be convicted under a special federal law governing attempted assaults on US presidents , established after the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy .
In 1987 , Fromme briefly escaped from the West Virginia prison where she was being held , saying she wanted to be closer to Manson .

The Holocaust occurred in the broader context of World War II .
World War II was the largest and most destructive conflict in history .
Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime envisioned a vast , new empire of " living space " ( Lebensraum ) for Germans in eastern Europe by the removal of existing populations .
The Nazi goal to strengthen the German “ master race ” resulted in the persecution and murder of Jews and many others .
When does a building transform from a shell into a work of art within itself ?
Can artists improve even beautiful architectural wonders , turning them into something more creative and meaningful ?
Some architectural art installations are done out of necessity because the work is simply too large to be contained .
Others use the building to make a political statement , to give value to an abandoned space or simply for the pure joy of it .
These 12 installations encompass the whole spectrum , making use of everything from the Sydney Opera House to a decaying factory .
Wrapped Reichstag by Christo
In 1995 , artists Christo and Jeanne - Claude wrapped the entire Reichstag building in Germany with more than 100,000 meters of fireproof polypropylene fabric .
The building , which housed the first parliament of the German Empire until it was severely damaged in 1933 , had stood in ruins for decades and became a symbol for a divided Germany .
The ‘ Wrapped Reichstag ’ installation was only up for two weeks , but drew five million visitors .
Onlookers described it alternately as ethereal and graceful during the day , but ominous at night .
Lighting Up the Sydney Opera House
It may seem ironic , and even a bit preposterous , to use a large amount of energy to light up the Sydney Opera House as a statement about global warming .
But musical producer Brian Eno ’s goal was to turn artists into advocates for action against climate change when he curated the Luminous Festival , a sound and light festival that involved images being projected onto the sails of the Opera House .
Eno told BBC News , “ … [ A]rtists can create a sense of what is cool and what is not , what is acceptable , exciting , timely …
I would like to see a future where artists think that they have a right to contemplate things like global warming . ”
Discarded Umbrella Installation at Channel 4 Building in London
Artist Stephanie Imbeau came up with a strikingly creative idea to win Channel 4 ’s BIG4 public art competition .
Her entry , ‘ Shelter ’ , was an installation that involved constructing blocks of illuminated discarded umbrellas .
Though unconnected , when viewed from a certain angle the blocks appeared as the number ‘ 4 ’ .
The installation stood in front of the Channel 4 building in London in March of 2009 .
Tentacle Building Installation
An artist calling himself ‘ FilthyLuker ’ installed inflatable octopus tentacles in the windows of an unnamed building in June of 2009 , making it appear as if the building is being devoured by a bright green kraken that somehow emerged from the sea and got stuck inside .
Erwin Wurm ’s House Attack
In 2006 , artist Erwin Wurm had an art exhibit at Austria ’s MUMOK ( Museum Moderner Kunst ) , displaying work that was often architectural in nature such as ‘ fat houses ’ .
Outside the building , the theme continued with an installation called ‘ House Attack ’ – an actual house imbedded in the museum ’s roof .
Inversion Tunnel House
People passing by this building in Houston may have wondered whether it had suddenly turned into a black hole , or was the setting of some kind of explosion that defies the laws of physics .
In fact , the strange tunnel was an art installation called ‘ Inversion ’ by Dan Havel and Dean Ruck , which was created just before the building was due to be torn down and replaced with a larger structure .
The tunnel actually goes all the way through the building , ending in a private courtyard .
Turning the Place Over by Richard Wilson
In Liverpool , a former Yates Wine Lodge building sat empty and decaying for years until Richard Wilson , one of Britain ’s most renowned sculptures , decided to make use of it for a project called ‘ Turning the Place Over ’ .
Wilson turned it into a piece of public art , cutting an oval from the exterior on one side and making it oscillate in three dimensions within the cutout .
The artist , whose work is often inspired by engineering and construction , used a giant rotator usually used in the shipping and nuclear industries to keep the façade revolving .
Reflecting Light at Clark Shoes Headquarters by ROSO
“ Light is only seen when reflected . ”
That is the observation that inspired an art installation called ‘ Light ’ by Studio ROSO for the Clarks Shoes headquarters in England .
The work , situated in the communal courtyard in the center of the office building complex , consisted of mirrors strung from one end of the courtyard to the other .
The strands of mirrors , organized into two ‘ beams of light ’ , create a dynamic , ever - changing space as the wind and light changes throughout each day and as seasons pass .
Crochet Gas Station
Jennifer Marsh , crochet artist and director of the International Fiber Collaborative , saw an ugly , abandoned gas station and realized she could use it as the setting of a unique art installation that calls attention to our dependence on oil .
Soliciting 3×3 foot squares from fiber artists all over the world , Marsh covered the entire building , along with two gas pumps , with the donated crochet squares .
The Defenestration Building by Brian Goggin
At an abandoned four - story building in San Francisco , furniture is leaping for its freedom from open windows – clocks poking their heads out and looking up at the sky , chairs making a run for it down the peeling brick walls and tables pitching themselves off the roof .
The project is called Defenestration , a word meaning “ to throw out of a window ” , and was created by 100 volunteers .
Artist Brian Goggin describes it on his website thusly : “ Located at the corner of Sixth and Howard Streets in San Francisco in an abandoned four - story tenement building , the site is part of a neighborhood that historically has faced economic challenge and has often endured the stigma of skid row status .
Reflecting the harsh experience of many members of the community , the furniture is also of the streets , cast - off and unappreciated . ”
1600 Empty Chairs
To some people , this art installation is nothing but a bunch of stacked cast - off chairs .
But to Doris Salcedo , each of the 1600 chairs precariously balanced upon each other between two buildings in Istanbul stands for a victim of mass violence in her home country of Colombia .
Salcedo wanted to commemorate anonymous victims , portraying their loss through empty chairs in a visual that resembles a mass grave .
The installation was created for the 8th Instanbul Biennale in 2003 .
Crossword Puzzle Apartment Building
The city of Lvov in Ukraine decided to give tourists an interesting enticement to visit : a crossword puzzle on the side of an apartment building that is completed by finding questions at major points of interests all over town .
Walking around the city , visitors collect questions at museums , monuments , theaters , fountains and other locations and write down their guesses .
During the day , the crossword puzzle is empty , but at night , special lights reveal the answers .
The first tall , skinny Ares I - X rocket is now more than half assembled at Kennedy Space Center 's Vehicle Assembly Building .
Last week , a host of new pieces were stacked onto the test rocket , putting it over the halfway mark , NASA announced in a blog post titled , " Really Taking Shape Now . "
The Ares I - X is set for an October 31 test flight , but along with the entire next - generation NASA Constellation program , its future is uncertain .
The Human Spaceflight Review , initiated by the Obama administration earlier this year , could recommend wholesale changes to NASA 's future .
Nonetheless , the program continues to soldier on , as can be seen from these construction photos .
Below , we see a custom - designed overhead crane , which places the components onto the stack .
These photos really give a sense of the scale of rocket , which will reach a height of 327 feet when it 's complete .
In about a month — just about the time the review committee submits its findings — the Ares I - X stacking process will be complete .

Death Bells Ring For India 's Dissident Websites
By Sevanti Ninan
16 June , 2009
The Hindu
The controversial Mr. A. Raja does not just preside over telecom , which the country ’s biggest industrialists are interested in .
He also presides over the lawmaking which governs the use of the Internet in India .
Surely that is something which deserves at least as much media vigilance as the awarding of telecom licences to companies ?
Last year , a few weeks after the Mumbai attacks in November , a Bill which had been sitting around in a Standing Committee since 2006 was hastily passed , without much debate in parliament .
The Information Technology ( Amendment ) Act , 2008 seeks to give teeth to existing laws on information technology and cyberspace .
Last month , shortly before Mr. Raja began his second stint , the Department of IT posted on the Internet the results of its labours in drafting rules for this Act .
Since the devil is in the details , the import of the Act resides in the rules .
These are still at the draft stage , you are invited to send your comments to the Government of India , which does this feedback exercise to show how democratic it is .
http://www.mit.gov.in/default.aspx?id=969
Here , then , is an idiot ’s guide to what Mr. Raja and his men are proposing to do , in the name of national security , safe Internet use , and suchlike .
a) Intercept email , under Section 69 of the Act
Who can give orders for such interception ?
Technically , only the Union Home Secretary or the Home Secretary at the state level , but in unavoidable circumstances also a Joint Secretary .
In further unavoidable circumstances — in an emergency ( not defined ) in a remote area ( not defined ) — a security officer of the rank of an Inspector Feneral of Police can order the interception .
They have to get it okayed in a week ’s time by a Home Secretary or Joint Secretary or cease intercepting .
What about laws protecting privacy ?
This provision circumvents those in the name of security .
b) Block websites and web content , under Section 69A
A designated officer of Joint Secretary - level is empowered to handle requests for blocking from departments or individuals .
He submits the request to an inter-ministerial committee of Joint Secretaries , including one from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting .
In an emergency , scrutiny by just the designated officer will do , and the final permission has to come from the Secretary , Department of Information Technology .
What can be the basis for a request to block ?
The Sovereignty or Integrity of India , the Defence of India , the Security of the State , Friendly Relations with Foreign States , Public order , and , for “ preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to above . ”
Apart from the fact that all of the above are open to interpretation , do note the “ preventing incitement ” bit .
In case somebody thinks you might provoke someone to do something , they can block your website .
What about a right to be heard before the blocking ?
There is none .
The job of Secretary , Department of Information Technology , suddenly becomes a pivotal one in the matter of freedom of expression .
He has the final say in any blocking .
Review of the decision ?
A committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary , GOI , needs to meet at least once in two months for that .
As a CERT - IN official said at a recent meeting when questioned about the inordinately long time taken for a review , “ Bahut cases hote , saab .
Cabinet Secretary khali nahin baithe hota . ”
His point was that overall there is a four - level scrutiny , and that so far blocking of web pages or sites has been very rare indeed , three to four cases in the last five years .
c ) Monitor and collect traffic data relating to a website , in the name of ensuring cyber security , and foiling cyber security incidents .
Under Section 69B .
d ) Set up an Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT - IN ) , whose constituency “ shall be the Indian cyber community ” , under Section 70B ( 1 ) .
If you plough through all the citizen - friendly sounding stuff that this team is supposed to do , you will hit upon this clause : “ For carrying out its functions prescribed in section 70 ( B ) of the Act , CERT - IN may seek information and give directions for compliance to the service providers , intermediaries , data centres , body corporate and any other person , as may be necessary . ”
This innocuous body can order your service provider to cough up any data it wants .
And what level of officer can do this ?
Any officer of CERT - IN , not below the rank of Deputy Secretary to the Government of India .
Again , the defence is that this clause only relates to cyber security .
The rules empowering CERT - IN are drafted by the organisation itself .
Talk of giving yourself powers because you are making the rules !
e ) Define the liability of Network Service Providers , under Section 79 .
This is a section for which the rules have not yet been posted , because there is hectic lobbying going on by industry .
It seeks to protect the companies that operate in India as Network Service Providers from being liable for any third party information , data , or communication link made available or hosted by them .
They are not liable so long as they “ do not initiate the transmission , select the receiver of the transmission , and select or modify the information contained in the transmission , and so long as they observe due diligence while discharging their duties under this Act . ”
But once they come to know of data posted on their servers which could be interpreted as violating the “ integrity of India , defence of India , friendly relations with foreign States ” bits and do not remove it , they become liable .
Who will be defined as a network service provider ?
What will be defined as due diligence ?
What will be the definition of an intermediary ?
Industry is lobbying with CERT - IN on these issues .
Sachin Pilot is the minister in charge .
But is civil society mounting enough of a fight to protect privacy , and prevent web content blocking without a prior right to be heard ?
Is it doing enough to oppose the extraordinary powers Mr Raja ’s ministry is arming itself with ?
You know the answer to that one .

Just past Barstow on Interstate 15 , Las Vegas - bound travelers can eye a tower resembling a lighthouse rising out of the desert encircled by more than 1,800 mirrors the size of billboards .
The complex is often mistaken for a science fiction movie set , but it is actually a power plant that once used molten salt , water and the sun ’s heat to produce electricity .
Now a storied rocket maker in Canoga Park and a renewable energy company in Santa Monica are hoping to take what they learned at the long - closed desert facility to build a much larger plant that could power 100,000 homes -- all from a mix of sun , salt and rocket science once believed too futuristic to succeed .
The Santa Monica - based energy firm SolarReserve has licensed the technology , developed by engineers at Rocketdyne .
Advertisement
“ Molten salt is the secret sauce , ” said SolarReserve President Terry Murphy .
It is one of at least 80 large solar projects on the drawing board in California , but the molten salt technology is considered one of the more unusual and -- to some energy analysts -- one of the more promising in the latest rush to build clean electricity generation .
“ It ’s actually something we ’ll likely see in a few years , ” said Nathaniel Bullard , a solar energy analyst with New Energy Finance in Alexandria , Va .
“ It ’s moving along in a nice way , and they have good capital behind it . ”
SolarReserve , which is financing and marketing the project , said it is working on agreements with several utilities to buy electricity generated from the plant .
It hopes to have several announcements in a few months that could help jump - start construction of the first plant , which would probably be on private land in the Southwest , Murphy said .

The company last fall secured $ 140 million in venture capital .
The plant could begin operating by early 2013 .
It would use an array of 15,000 heliostats , or large tilting mirrors about 25 feet wide , to direct sunlight to a solar collector atop a 600 - foot - tall tower -- somewhat like a lighthouse in reverse .
The mirrors would heat up molten salt flowing through the receiver to more than 1,000 degrees , hot enough to turn water into powerful steam in a device called a heat exchanger .
The steam , like that coming out of a nozzle of a boiling tea kettle , would drive a turbine to create electricity .
The molten salt , once cooled , would then be pumped back through the solar collector to start the process all over again .
“ The plant has no emissions , and if you have a leak or something , you can just shovel it up and take it home with you to use for your barbecue , ” Murphy said .

The molten salt can be stored for days if not weeks and then used to generate electricity at any time .
Many other solar technologies work only when the sun is shining .
Storing electricity in a battery works for cars and homes but not on a massive scale that would be needed to power thousands of homes .
“ You can put that into a storage tank that would look much like a tank at an oil refinery , ” Murphy said .
“ We can store that energy almost indefinitely . ”
While there are high hopes for the technology , some environmentalists have criticized solar - thermal plants for requiring vast tracts of land as well as precious water for generating steam and for cooling the turbines .
The array of the mirrored heliostats for the SolarReserve plant would take up about two square miles .
Transmission lines would also be needed to transport the power where it ’s needed .
With dozens of solar , wind and geothermal projects planned for California ’s deserts , some fear that this unique habitat will be destroyed .
Advertisement
But SolarReserve officials said that the plant would use one - tenth the amount of water required by a conventional plant and that mirrors will be “ benign ” to the environment .
The technology , with the exception of using salt , is similar to those that Rocketdyne engineers developed for the nation ’s more notable space programs .
At the sprawling Canoga Park facility , the engineers who came up with the SolarReserve technology also developed the power system for the International Space Station , the rocket engine for the space shuttle , and the propulsion system for the Apollo lunar module .
Rocketdyne ’s aerospace heritage stretches back to the earliest years of rocket development , when it was founded shortly after World War II to study German V - 2 rocket technology .
After becoming part of Rockwell International in the late 1960s , the company was sold to Boeing Co. in 1996 .
Advertisement
United Technologies bought the Rocketdyne unit from Boeing for $ 700 million in 2005 primarily for its expertise in rocket engines .
It did n’t know about the solar project until after the acquisition .
Now Rocketdyne believes it can generate $ 1 billion in revenue from making the components for the plant , including the tower that would collect the sun ’s concentrated heat from thousands of mirrors .
The solar collector in many ways is similar to the inside of a rocket nozzle that has to withstand thousands of degrees of heat , said Rick Howerton , Rocketdyne ’s program manager for concentrated solar power who previously worked on the space station program .
The solar - thermal technology was proved workable more than a decade ago at the Barstow pilot plant .
But the complex was shuttered in 1999 when the cost of natural gas fell to one - tenth of what it is today .

Also there was n’t as much concern for the environment then , Murphy said .
“ It was ahead of its time .
The market had n’t caught up to it . ”

Add Tom Daschle to the list of people who think that serious healthcare reform is simply not possible , and so instead we should all reach for the consolation prize of substanceless bipartisanship :
In an attempt at bipartisanship , three former majority leaders of the U.S. Senate , Tom Daschle , Howard Baker , and Bob Dole , offered their solution today to the biggest obstacle to achieving health care reform -- a public option .
" While I feel very strongly that consumers should have the choice of a national , Medicare - like plan , my colleagues do not .
. .
But we were concerned that the ongoing health reform debate is beginning to show signs of fracture on the public plan issue , so in order to advance the process of developing bipartisan legislation and to move it forward , it 's time to find consensus here , " Daschle said .
" We 've come too far and gained too much momentum for our efforts to fail over disagreements on one single issue , " he said .
If there 's no public option , what the hell is there to legislate ?
I 'm not being facetious , I 'm really asking .
What other " reforms " are they seriously thinking will make a bit of difference ?
I find the whole thing to be a farce -- if you 're not talking about a public option , you 're not seriously " reforming " squat , you 're just picking out new color schemes for your already burned - down house .
Case in point : California has a law saying you can't raise health insurance premiums more than a certain percentage each year .
So our insurance company , every year , " discontinues " our previous insurance plan , forcing us to choose a " new " one that 's almost exactly the same , but with a higher premium .
Since it 's a new plan , after all , it does n't count as raising rates on the old plan !
A scam , yes , but one of the countless ways that health insurance companies skirt laws wherever possible in order to squeeze every ounce of profit from your relative levels of health or illness .
In the NBC poll , 76 % of Americans wanted a public option to be made available .
That 's a mandate .
For small business and the self employed , finding insurance is a nightmarish experience , and finding affordable insurance is simply impossible , for some .
For large businesses , healthcare adds massive costs , representing a huge not - very - well - hidden tax on every aspect of labor .
The only major sources of opposition to a public option are the insurance companies , because they believe -- rightly -- that such an option would cut into their profits , and " free market " ideologues who simply believe that the government can't possibly do anything right if it does n't involve paving roads or shooting guns .
Without a public option , I 'd rather we stop the absurd talk of " reform " and recognize that any bill passed would mainly be for show , but if we were to seriously consider a bill without such an option , I think the one healthcare reform that would make a difference is to cancel govt health insurance for all senators , representatives , cabinet members , etc .
It 's been proposed many times , but I do think it 's long past time .
Have the very senators and representatives who are against public health insurance spend the next few years trying to get healthcare on their own like the rest of us -- waiting months to see doctors , having to comb through lists of doctors too see which specialists you are " allowed " to see , spending countless hours on the phone with insurance companies fighting over individual bills -- I absolutely believe you 'll have them socializing all of healthcare , no matter how much the goddamn lobbyists spend to woo them .
For most of us in the ranks of the self - employed or -- heaven forfend -- the wrong age bracket , it 's that infuriating .
Again , I point out -- 76 % of Americans want this " public option . "
That 's a mandate , as close as you can possibly get in red - blue - purple - whatever America .
The fact that we 're struggling to find 51 senators willing to do what the public demands , rather than what the insurance companies want , demonstrates how badly even three - quarters of America can be outnumbered by the interests of a single industry .
Of course the Republicans are n't going to go along .
They have refused to go along with anything , ever , period , and consider that a badge of honor .
Of course it 's going to be difficult to get Democrats who are beholden to the insurance industry to buck their lobbyists -- but that does n't mean they should easily be able to block what 76 % of the public is demanding .
Nobody said this was going to be easy .
So quit whining about " bipartisanship " , quit wringing your hands over how dreadfully difficult it 's going to be , and get on with it .
Solving America 's very large and very real health insurance crisis is more important , and even prominent Democrats are shrugging their shoulders in defeat before the first real shots have been fired .
When I was made the paper 's religious affairs correspondent by the editor in early 2000 , on my return from a five year posting as the paper 's European affairs editor in Brussels , I accepted the job reluctantly , as a demotion .
Stupidly , I could not see the job as much of a story for a paper like the Guardian .
I retained vestiges of my religious upbringing , as a Roman Catholic , but for various reasons , I had become largely unobservant – unlike my wife , a charismatic evangelical Anglican , and my children , being brought up in the evangelical tradition in defiance of Catholic teaching , because my wife is more devout than I am .
I am the son and grandson of mixed marriages and could remember my father going off to his church services in the local parish church ( and yet still being a good man ) while my mother dragged me and my brother and sister off to mass , where we could pray for the conversion of our " separated brethren " , such as my dad and the reconversion of England , which was clearly what God and the Virgin Mary , who saw the country as her dowry , would want .
The sense of a separate , slightly beleaguered and isolated identity was even a little thrilling back in the late 1960s , especially as I was taken out of prayers at my ( Anglican ) grammar school for a period until the notion of contamination by heresy came to seem too absurd and I fell in with all the rest .
Even our church services were virtually identical , as my father pointed out when he attended mass occasionally .
My mother though was markedly less keen about attending Anglican services and after she died when I was 28 , my faith started dying too .
My resentment about the Catholic church 's authoritarianism grew and my attendance dropped off .
The church did n't seem to have much to say about why a good woman like my mother should die a long , lingering , horrible death from cancer , or why it should subsequently hound into outer darkness the able and deeply caring parish priest , who had ministered devotedly to her , because he wanted to get married , to a former nun , as it happened .
But still , sneakingly , when I took the editor 's offer , I hoped my faith would return and I could appreciate the old belief .
I was nervous of my lack of theological training , but at least I knew the British faith background and traditions and the Bible stories – I was quite shocked to discover that many of my colleagues on the paper did not have even a folk - memory of those .
" What 's a cardinal ? " one senior desk editor asked as I attempted to explain a story .
" Who was Noah ? " an equally venerable colleague was asked when he told the desk about an archaeological dig at Mount Ararat .
My problem was , if everyone in religion was as ecumenical as I thought , I just could not see the story , or how to get it consistently in the paper .
I soon learned how wrong I was : religious differences were as marked as ever .
The thing that astounded me was the vituperation directed not at other faiths ( a degree of Islamophobia came later ) but at those who happened to disagree within the same faith communities .
You get evangelical publications denouncing " liberals " within the Church of England and claiming they are not really Christian , there are reactionary Catholic publications sneering similarly at modernists and attacking those who do not wish for a return of the Latin mass as somehow lesser beings .
Attitudes which might otherwise seem quaint , dated or toxic are given free rein : by and large churches have moved on from regarding black people as inferior ( though I did come across one British theologian writing that conservative Anglicans might have to choose a black bishop " even if he does look like the janitor " over a gay - supporting white one ) but as we know quite antidiluvian attitudes towards gay people and women still prevail , with an air of horrible self - righteousness and hypocrisy in some quarters .
What rankled most was the hypocrisy , the fact that the Bible 's scattered and random words on homosexuality were uncontestable for all time and yet , somehow , divorce – which Jesus himself appears from the Gospels to have condemned – was somehow only a minor and changeable transgression .
The fact that some of the evangelicals , such as Andrew Carey , journalist son of the former archbishop of Canterbury and one of the loudest and most sanctimonious cheerleaders against gay people holding positions in the church , is himself divorced and remarried ( by his father ) just added to my distaste .
The immortal words of former president Richard Nixon ( and the Simpsons ' Reverend Lovejoy ) come to mind : if the president says it 's legal , it 's not a crime .
That 's just the Anglicans .
Other Protestant sects are even worse : my prize for malignity going to the Jehovah 's Witnesses , whose leadership denies followers blood transfusions even in medical emergencies , on pain of being cut off from all fellowship even with relatives , because of some bizarre misreading of a solitary obscure Biblical text written in an age long before transfusions were possible .
Of course , the Watchtower leadership in Brooklyn do not deny transfusions to themselves ; they just do n't boast about it .
Do n't get me started on Catholicism .
A South American bishop was recently censured for excommunicating the medical staff who had carried out an abortion on a nine year - old child to save her life after she had been raped by her father , but the fact that he saw nothing wrong with his decision – he also excommunicated the child 's mother , though not her father – is a dazzling revelation of church attitudes that are all too common .
This is a dessicated lack of humanity and compassion and , if the church holds it , I am afraid I just can't agree , so I can not return to mass .
The evidence is that many other cradle Catholics share my view .
The church can well say it does not modify its views to circumstance , but we are equally at liberty to say that we walk away in the face of such heartlessness .
I gave up covering religion for the paper after seven years , partly because I felt I could no longer report dispassionately on such events , or even give a fair shake to those whose views seemed to me to be both deluded and malign .
" You must n't judge the church by some of the people within it , " my friend Jeffrey John , the dean of St Albans and the man forced to resign as bishop of Reading because he was gay and politely challenged the church 's position on homosexuality , told me when I gave up .
It 's true : I met many inspirational and noble figures and the Dawkinsite idea – shared by many responders on this site – that all religious believers are stupid , or deluded , or malign , is very far from the truth .
Of them all I 'd pick out Sister Helen Prejean , the Louisiana nun who befriends and comforts condemned prisoners and accompanies them even to the death chamber , showing love and compassion and companionship into their last moments , so that they are not alone .
She 's small and middle - aged and dumpy – physically not at all like Susan Sarandon , who portrayed her in the movie Dead Man Walking – but her life is a vivid demonstration of Christian belief in action .
She 'd still be a good woman if she did n't believe ; she might even do the same thing in her life , but it is undeniable that her faith informs and gives her the rationale for what she does .
A few weeks ago I was in hospital .
The only visitors I received who were not relatives were Christian ones : five in all , including two Catholic priests .
None of them tried to convert me – and I did n't stop the evangelical layman who asked if he could say a prayer over me – but I appreciated their brief visits even though I told them I was no longer a believer .
They were performing a charitable act , unselfishly and compassionately .
I did n't get any hospital visits from atheist visitors .
What might they have said to me : " This is as good as it gets , mate ? "
The fact that I am edging towards their camp – I guess I am at the agnostic stage – does not exactly cheer me .
It just makes me sad .
Hello Again , Chocolate Mousse
August 7th , 2009 | 72 Comments
One fine day in my not too distant past , I decided to spend my lunch hour milling around the Barnes and Noble .
Just a regular day , it was , with the usual rows of books , and the usual cappuccino slinging .
As I stood there , leafing through Poker for Dummies , my ears suddenly perked up .
It was the store announcer crackling over the loud speaker .
He was pleased to announce that in 15 minutes , Jacques Torres would be giving a demonstration and signing books in the main area .
Well , I ’ll be a monkey ’s uncle !
Needless to say , I did a little jig in the Crafts aisle before bee - lining to front and center .
I would get to watch the great Jacques Torres in action and , if I did n’t faint by the end , I ’d get to sample a dessert !
I was beside myself .
In those days , Jacques Torres was on PBS and I watched him fling profiteroles at the audience every Sunday .
My cheeks hurt from over - smiling .
Too bad that smile faded not 30 seconds later when Jacques revealed that he’d be demonstrating chocolate mousse .
Suddenly , an overwhelming drowsiness kicked in .
Chocolate mousse was so booooooring .
It was in every cookbook , on every menu .
Everywhere , like pigeons .
Anyone with a whisk and an apron could throw together chocolate mousse .
But I stayed in my seat , because when it ’s Jacques Torres , you stay in your seat .
He began talking and showing .
His moves were very calculated , like he did n’t have a gesture to waste .
He spoke of different types of sho - ko - laht , as he pronounced it , while he got his bowls in line .
The way he spoke was both entertaining and educational .
Those years on TV made him a good showman .
My eyebrow arched and now I was in .
A few things really made an impression .
One was that he favored Valrhona chocolate , but if stranded some place with extremely limited options , he would choose the everyday supermarket Dove brand .
He deemed it to be an acceptable substitute in a pinch .
Another thing that struck me was that when he started folding his whipped cream into the chocolate , he spun his bowl really quickly , as though it was a pottery wheel , and dug his spatula in with fervor , a fast chopping motion .
Someone from the audience pointed out that folding was supposed to be a delicate affair .
Yes , he said .
He was doing it “ delicately ” when compared with another kitchen technique : whipping .
Using a whisk is much more violent than using a spatula to incorporate something , he explained .
To this day , I fold like Jacques Torres .
In a few minutes , he ladled out the mousse and dropped a couple of raspberries over each sample .
Even though they were served in paper cups with plastic spoons , as soon as I had my first bite , I was hypnotized .
I closed my eyes and saw myself seated in his 4 - star restaurant , Le Cirque .
The silver spoon shone as I dipped it in the chocolatey cloud .
The texture was dreamy–so ethereal , so sensual , so refined–and yet the flavor was full , cloaking me in it ’s depth .
I never took chocolate mousse for granted again .
I ’ve noticed over time that most chocolate mousse recipes are essentially the same : melt chocolate , fold in cream .
That ’s why it ’s imperative that the chocolate be of excellent quality .
It ’s the difference between a mousse that bores and a mousse that stuns .
Here ’s a recipe that I ’ve had so long I ’m not sure of its origin , but I think it began in the New York Times .
In any case , it ’s had its share of tinkering and modifications .
I love the combo of milk chocolate and caramel used here , but feel free to substitute dark chocolate .
Here are some chocolate brands that make me want to get out of bed in the morning :
40 % Jivara Lactee Feves – Valrhona – 3 kg
45 % Grand Lait Minigrammes – Michel Cluizel – 11 kg
Whaddaya know ?
I go for the French stuff .
If you do a lot of baking , buying in bulk makes sense cost - wise , but if you do n’t want to buy a honking 5 lb box , these brands can often be found in the fancier supermarkets in more manageable 4 or 8 oz blocks .
I see Valrhona at Whole Foods all the time .
Milk Chocolate Caramel Mousse
makes 6 servings
recipe can be doubled
I used to be intimidated by the dry caramel method used here until I tried it .
Now I think it ’s far easier than the wet caramel method and will never go back !
The sugar does n’t crystallize .
1/3 cup ( 2.5 oz. ) granulated sugar
3 Tablespoons ( 1.5 oz ; 42 g ) unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups ( 12 fluid oz . ) heavy cream , divided into 1 cup ( 8 oz ) and 1/2 cup ( 4 oz )
4 oz . high quality milk chocolate
1. Just 4 happy ingredients !
2. Start by making the caramel : sprinkle a thin layer of sugar in a lightly colored - pan set over medium - high heat .
( A light pan will help you gage the color of the caramel . )
In a minute or 2 it starts to melt .
Do n’t bother to stir or anything .
Sprinkle more sugar .
The heat of the already melted sugar will start melting the new addition right away .
Keep adding until all your sugar is in .
This may take 2 or 3 additions .
It will melt quickly and the edges will color faster than the center .
Swirling the pan around helps get the sugar to caramelize more evenly .
In a few minutes , the sugar goes amber , like this :
3 . Now you must work quickly to avoid burning the sugar .
Sprinkle in the butter lumps , and whisk them in .
4. Now , add the 1/2 cup of cream , but GRADUALLY .
The cream will sputter and roil when it comes in contact with the hot sugar .
Some of the sugar will seize and harden a little , but keep whisking .
It will dissolve .
Here I added a small dribble of cream and whisked it in :
Then I added another dribble of cream and whisked again .
How about those angry bubbles ?
And the final addition of cream .
Ooooh , yeah .
Caramel , all whisked up and smooth .
Remove pan from heat and let it rest until we get to it .
5 . Meanwhile , take the remaining 1 cup of cream , and whip it to soft peak .
You can see trails in the cream , but it ’s still kind of droopy and does n’t hold a peak .
Pop this bowl of cream in the fridge to keep it chilled while we melt chocolate .
6 . Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil .
Turn the heat down to low , and rest a bigger bowl filled with your chocolate over said pot .
This is our faux double boiler .
If you have a real double boiler that ’s been waiting for this special occasion , use it now !
Do n’t let any water get into your chocolate or you will witness a grainy mess .
Gently let it melt , stirring occasionally to help it along .
Oooooh .
7 . Once it ’s completely melted , remove from the heat , and stir in the caramel .
You will notice the texture is mottled and dull , like this .
Do n’t stop here .
Grab a whisk , and work up some elbow grease .
You ’re trying to create an emulsion .
Whisk in a rapid , circular motion like you ’re trying to rev up an engine .
Start from the center and whisk outward , in concentric circles .
The mix should end up glossy and very smooth .
This will make the texture of the mousse luxuriously creamy .
8 . Make sure the contents are lukewarm or cooler .
( A chance to taste test , in my book . )
If the mix is still hot , let it sit until it ’s cool enough .
Scoop about 1/3 of the whipped cream into the bowl and gently fold it in .
This will help lighten the dense chocolate and ensure better incorporation of the whipped cream .
It does n’t have to be 100 % incorporated yet .
Add the rest of the whipped cream and gently fold that in too , just until all the cream is incorporated .
Here is the final mousse .
It ’s quite loose here , but still has body .
It looks like a very thick chocolate drink .
Pour it into ramekins or glasses and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow it to set up .
Diggin ’ in ..
As recently as September 2008 CBS reported that Special Forces struck Qaeda leadership in Pakistan .
The decision faced by Holder , whether or not to appoint a Special Prosecutor on torture , is of a different gravity altogether .
A weight of evidence keeps building which indicates torture was employed on innocent men , that it did n't work , and that it did n't prevent any attacks .
And it gets worse .
Bush 's own FBI Director Robert Mueller recently confirmed to the New York Times what he told Vanity Fair a year ago , that " to [ his ] knowledge " torture did n't prevent a single attack .
Former Legendary CIA Director William Colby has said that torture is " ineffective . "
Harper 's Magazine 's Scott Horton nows suggests there are two Eric Holders at war with each other :
Holder the good soldier who knows well the preference of his boss for prosecutions to not take place , and Holder the servant of the law who is aware that what he does now may determine what is likely to happen again .
It is becoming clear that such an investigation , if it happens , will not stop with a few low - ranking scapegoats .
Horton notes :
" President Obama ’s assurance to CIA officials who relied on the opinions of government lawyers in implementing these programs , an assurance that Holder himself repeated , would have to be worked in .
That suggests that the focus would likely be on the lawyers and policymakers who authorized use of the new techniques . "
And CIA whistleblower Ray McGovern writes this week :
the buck stops - actually , in this case , it began - with President Bush .
Senate Armed Services Committee leaders Carl Levin and John McCain on Dec. 11 , 2008 , released the executive summary of a report , approved by the full committee without dissent , concluding that Bush 's Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum " opened the door to considering aggressive techniques . "
What changed with Holder ?
Horton writes in " The Torture Prosecution Turnaround ? " :
Holder began his review mindful of the clear preference of President Obama ’s two key political advisers — David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel — that there be no investigation .
Axelrod and Emanuel are described as uninterested in either the legal or policy merits of the issue of a criminal investigation .
Their concerns turn entirely on their political analysis ... Holder initially appeared prepared to satisfy their wishes .
This attitude seemed to change after Obama 's speech at the CIA , when Emanual and Axelrod moved out front to say there would be no prosecutions .
According to Horton :
" In the days after Obama ’s speech at the CIA , both Axelrod and Emanuel insisted that the White House had made the decision that there would be no prosecutions .
According to reliable sources , that incensed Holder , who felt that the remarks had compromised the integrity both of the White House and Justice Department by suggesting that political advisers made the call on who would or would not be criminally investigated . "
To make things worse for the Bush administration , evidence is emerging that they can no longer even rely on exhibit A and B of the Torture Works theory , Al Zabudaya and Kalid Shiek Mohammed , the latter of whom is still confessing to everything short of being the real Boston Strangler .
I guess if I 'd been waterboarded 82 times I 'd be babbling too .
The FBI Special Agent who interrogated Abu Zubayda , recently breaking a 7 - year silence after reading the " torture memos , " wrote in the New York Times :
" One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based .
The first , dated August 2002 , grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high - ranking terrorist , Abu Zubaydah , on the grounds that previous methods had n’t been working .
The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use .
It is inaccurate , however , to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative .
Along with another F.B.I. agent , and with several C.I.A. officers present , I questioned him from March to June 2002 , before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August .
Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence ... This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career : traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives , uncovering plots and saving lives . "
Then there is the political risk to the Obama administration that Axelrod and Emanual have miscalculated , and that , in fact , the rest of the president 's agenda is hamstrung while a growing number of Americans call for existing laws to be enforced .
What is haunting Americans could be , in Washington jargon , " sucking oxygen " out of the debate , and " moving forward " is a pipe dream until pending business is dealt with .
Spontaneous and planned rallies calling for a Special Prosecutor are growing , not diminishing .
In addition , the worse revelations may be yet to come in the horrifying saga of what happened when , as Major General Anthony Taguba says :
[ a ] permissive environment [ was ] created by implicit and explicit authorizations by senior US officials to " take the gloves off " ...
President Jimmy Carter wrote that the Red Cross , Amnesty International and the Pentagon " have gathered substantial testimony of torture of children , confirmed by soldiers who witnessed or participated in the abuse . "
In " Our Endangered Values " Carter said that the Red Cross found after visiting six U.S. prisons " 107 detainees under eighteen , some as young as eight years old . "
And reporter Hersh , ( who broke the Abu Ghraib torture scandal , ) reported 800 - 900 Pakistani boys aged 13 to 15 in custody .
Journalist Seymour Hersh's ( who broke the Abu Ghraib scandal ) bombshell before the ACLU some years ago has been in a temporary slumber , as there is question as to whether the videotapes in possession of the Pentagon were among those claimed to be destroyed .
Destroyed or not , there is still the conscience of soldiers and agents who bore witness to contend with , as the reign of political terror against whistleblowers which characterized the Bush administration subsides .
Hersh said :
" Some of the worst things that happened you do n't know about , okay ?
Videos , um , there are women there .
Some of you may have read that they were passing letters out , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib ...
The women were passing messages out saying ' Please come and kill me , because of what 's happened ' and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It 's going to come out . "
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said at the time :
" The American public needs to understand , we 're talking about rape and murder here .
We 're not just talking about giving people a humiliating experience .
We 're talking about rape and murder and some very serious charges . "
History is just beginning to sort out the Bush era , with stubborn facts showing a resilience that Fox News talking points cannot , and more emerging .
Today , even among Republicans , it is difficult to find those who will embrace Richard Nixon , though for a while he was every bit the perceived victim of " left - wing hate " that Bush and Cheney are now .
Incredibly , to compare Nixon to Bush - Cheney is to do a deeply flawed man a disservice .
Nixon inherited Vietnam .
He did not orchestrate from whole cloth a campaign to link Saddam with 9/11 , and strenuously push to war despite the objections of his countrymen and the world .
Nixon spied on political enemies .
He did not use a tragedy to illegally spy on millions , the true numbers of which we still do not know because congress has never investigated .
It 's almost possible to feel sorry for the shifty , friendless Nixon .
It is less possible to feel so for the smirking Bush , who thought nothing of telling soldier 's families that war critics were saying that their loved ones " had died in vain . "
A compilation in November2008 of other evidence of alleged incidents involving children at the time recounts :
-- Iraqi lawyer Sahar Yasiri , representing the Federation of Prisoners and Political Prisoners , said in a published interview there are more than 400,000 detainees in Iraq being held in 36 prisons and camps and that 95 percent of the 10,000 women among them have been raped .
Children , he said , " suffer from torture , rape , ( and ) starvation " and do not know why they have been arrested .
He added the children have been victims of " random " arrests " not based on any legal text . "
-- Former prisoner Thaar Salman Dawod in a witness statement said , " [ I saw ] two boys naked and they were cuffed together face to face and [ a U.S. soldier ] was beating them and a group of guards were watching and taking pictures and there was three female soldiers laughing at the prisoners . "
-- Iraqi TV reporter , Suhaib Badr - Addin al - Baz , arrested while making a documentary and thrown into Abu Ghraib for 74 days , told Mackay he saw " hundreds " of children there .
Al - Baz said he heard one 12 - year - old girl crying , " They have undressed me .
They have poured water over me . "
He said he heard her whimpering daily .
-- Al - Baz also told of a 15 - year - old boy " who was soaked repeatedly with hoses until he collapsed . "
Amnesty International said ex-detainees reported boys as young as 10 are held at Abu Ghraib .
-- German TV reporter Thomas Reutter of " Report Mainz " quoted U.S. Army Sgt. Samuel Provance that interrogation specialists " poured water " over one 16 - year - old Iraqi boy , drove him throughout a cold night , " smeared him with mud " and then showed him to his father , who was also in custody .
Apparently , one tactic employed by the Bush regime is to elicit confessions from adults by dragging their abused children in front of them .
-- Jonathan Steele , wrote in the British " The Guardian " that " Hundreds of children , some as young as nine , are being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad ’s prisons ... Sixteen - year - old Omar Ali told the " Guardian " he spent more than three years at Karkh juvenile prison sleeping with 75 boys to a cell that is just five by 10 meters , some of them on the floor .
Omar told the paper guards often take boys to a separate room in the prison and rape them .
-- Raad Jamal , age 17 , was taken from his Doura home by U.S. troops and turned over to the Iraqi Army ’s Second regiment where Jamal said he was hung from the ceiling by ropes and beaten with electric cables .
-- Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) last June put the number of juveniles detained at 513 .
In all , HRW estimates , since 2003 , the U.S. has detained 2,400 children in Iraq , some as young as ten .
-- IRIN , the humanitarian news service , last year quoted Khalid Rabia of the Iraqi NGO Prisoners ’ Association for Justice ( PAJ ) , stating that five boys between 13 and 17 accused of supporting insurgents and detained by the Iraqi army " showed signs of torture all over their bodies , " such as " cigarette burns over their legs , " she said .
--
One boy of 13 arrested in Afghanistan in 2002 was held in solitary for more than a year at Bagram and Guantanamo and made to stand in stress position and deprived of sleep , according to the " Catholic Worker . "
Attorney General Holder is a man of conscience who now serves both President Obama and the law .
A Newsweek piece last week says he has no illusions that :
Such a decision [ to appoint a Special Prosecutor ] would roil the country , would likely plunge Washington into a new round of partisan warfare , and could even imperil Obama 's domestic priorities , including health care and energy reform .
Holder knows all this , and he has been wrestling with the question for months .
" I hope that whatever decision I make would not have a negative impact on the president 's agenda , " he says .
" But that ca n't be a part of my decision . "
There can be redemption for a nation which faces its past .
One that does not can only become more monstrous .
Call the Office of the Attorney General , " Appoint a Special Prosecutor " at ( 202 ) 353-1555 .
Then email the Justice Department .
Two separate reports ...
From Bloombeg : ‘ Underwater ’ U.S. Mortgages May Hit 48 % , Deutsche Bank Reports
The percentage of properties “ underwater ” is forecast to rise to 48 percent , or 25 million homes , as property prices drop through the first quarter of 2011 , according to [ Deutsche Bank ] analysts Karen Weaver and Ying Shen .
While subprime and Option ARMs are currently the worst cohorts with underwater borrowers , we project that the next phase of the housing decline will have a far greater impact on prime borrowers ( conforming and jumbo ) ...
By Q1 2011 , we estimate that 41 % of prime conforming borrowers and 46 % of prime jumbo borrowers will be underwater , a significant increase over the percentage of these borrowers in Q1 2009 .
The impact of this is significant given that these markets have the largest share of the total mortgage market outstanding .
Some 24 % of owner - occupied homes had mortgage debt that exceeded the values of those homes at the end of June , according to data from Equifax and Moody ’s Economy.com .
That number rises to 32 % when looking at the share of homeowners with mortgages that do n’t have equity left in their homes .
Overall , 16 million homeowners are “ upside - down ” on their mortgages , up from 10 million , or 15 % of owner - occupied homes , one year ago .
Nearly 10 % of owner - occupied homes now have mortgage debt with loan - to - value ratios of at least 125 % , and roughly half of those homes have mortgage debt with loan - to - value ratios of 150 % or more .
home
I guess Deutsche Bank did n't get the memo about house prices finding a bottom .
Note : Deutsche Bank estimates 26 % of homeowners are currently underwater , matching the data below from Economy.com .
And Deutsche Bank sees the next wave hitting prime borrowersm , from the report : From the WSJ : More Homeowners ‘ Upside Down ’ on Mortgages Mods wo n't help thesedebtowners .
Most mods just capitalize missed payments and expenses , and either lower the interest rate for a few years or extend the term leaving the homeowner underwater ( aka pretend and extend ) .
Although Deutsche Bank may be pessimistic on house prices , both reports suggests about 16 million homeowners are currently underwater , and probably another 5 + million have no equity .
SANTA ROSA , Calif . 
When Congress passed a new energy law two years ago , obituaries were written for the incandescent light bulb .
The law set tough efficiency standards , due to take effect in 2012 , that no traditional incandescent bulb on the market could meet , and a century - old technology that helped create the modern world seemed to be doomed .
But as it turns out , the obituaries were premature .
Researchers across the country have been racing to breathe new life into Thomas Edison ’s light bulb , a pursuit that accelerated with the new legislation .
Amid that footrace , one company is already marketing limited quantities of incandescent bulbs that meet the 2012 standard , and researchers are promising a wave of innovative products in the next few years .
Indeed , the incandescent bulb is turning into a case study of the way government mandates can spur innovation .
“ There ’s a massive misperception that incandescents are going away quickly , ” said Chris Calwell , a researcher with Ecos Consulting who studies the bulb market .
“ There have been more incandescent innovations in the last three years than in the last two decades . ”

Two birthdays and a going away party this weekend .
Gonna be a busy one .
Old underground burial chambers in a Devon city could be used to store the bodies of swine flu victims if the outbreak worsens , a council has said .
Exeter City Council has identified the empty catacombs in Bartholomew Street as a potential mortuary .
A council spokesman said it could turn to the plan if the crematorium and cemeteries could not keep up with funeral demands .
The 19th century burial chambers are normally a tourist attraction .
An Exeter City Council spokesman said : " As part of our overall planning for a range of possible scenarios we have looked at what we might do should the current crematorium and cemeteries within the city not be able to keep up with the need for funerals .
" We have some empty catacombs in an old cemetery in the city , off Bartholomew Street .
" These are 19th century underground burial chambers which are normally a tourist attraction .
" They can however be safely used for their original purpose and allow us to temporarily store bodies in the remote possibility that the need should arise . "
The former Scotland captain Barry Ferguson has launched an outspoken criticism of the Scottish Football Association , labelling their treatment of him " a joke " following the drinking and rude gesture scandal which led to him being banned from international duty last season .
Ferguson and Allan McGregor were involved in an all - night drinking session in the aftermath of Scotland 's 3 - 0 defeat by Holland in March .
Days later , the pair were photographed making two - fingered gestures while substitutes for the meeting with Iceland at Hampden Park .
Both players have been told they will not play for Scotland again but Ferguson , speaking extensively for the first time on the affair , remains upset with the way things were handled .
" If I could go back and change things I would , of course I would , " Ferguson explained .
" I should have gone to bed , and I should never have made the V - signs – when I see the pictures of that I feel so stupid .
I looked like a daft idiot and I should have known better .
But it was an error , a bad call .
" I made a mistake and people do that – I am a human being , not a robot and I made a costly mistake .
There was no roaming about the team hotel bumping into guests , fighting in the bar or urinating in swimming pools like people have claimed .
" The thing that rankles with me now is the way the SFA handled the entire situation – for me it was a joke .
I had played for Scotland 45 times , I had captained my country for years – and they sent a fax to [ the Rangers training ground ]
Murray Park saying that I would never play for my country again .
It was just the same statement they put out to the media , that was it .
" That just astonished me .
The machine starts to ring , and in comes a fax from Hampden for my attention telling me that I would no longer be picked , and neither would Allan .
" The people in the room just looked at each other in total disbelief – is that how something like that should be handled ?
No one has ever spoken to me from the Scotland set - up .
Not the manager , the chief executive , a PR guy , anyone .
" I was driving back into Murray Park after being sent home for a few hours and I heard on the radio that the SFA were going to ban me for life .
" I was in such a whirl that I was n't taking anything in – then a fax arrives and that was it , over ... no phone call , no anything .
That , for me , sums the SFA up .
They do n't know how to handle anything properly . "
Ferguson was also stripped of the Rangers captaincy and suspended by the club at the time of the affair .
He has since been sold to Birmingham City .
" What I would say is that Rangers handled the thing the right way , " he added .
" We sat face to face , I took my punishment and it was done properly .
I was n't happy , of course I was n't , but I knew why the club had acted the way they did and I just had to go away and try to deal with it .
" But the SFA ?
That was a shambles for me .
Then I hear a few days later [ the SFA chief executive ] Gordon Smith saying on the radio the door might not be closed , we could still play and all that sort of stuff .
That sums it up for me , the left hand never knows what the right hand is doing in that place . "

Theis a statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 , announcing that the Thirteen Colonies then at war with Great Britain were no longer a part of the British Empire .
Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson , the Declaration is a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War .
The birthday of the United States of America — Independence Day — is celebrated on July 4 , the day the wording of the Declaration was adopted by the Congress .
Congress issued the Declaration in several forms .
The first published version was a typeset broadside printed by John Dunlap , which only listed the names of John Hancock and Charles Thomson as signers .
In 1777 , Congress issued the Goddard Broadside , which listed all of the signers .
What became the most famous version of the Declaration was a handwritten copy signed by the delegates , known as the engrossed version , which is on display in the National Archives in Washington , D.C .
The Declaration of Independence is the first of the three Charters of Freedom along with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .

In most of the world when a person works long hours without pay , it is referred to as “ slavery ” or “ forced labor . ”
For white people this process is referred to as an internship and is considered an essential stage in white development .
The concept of working for little or no money underneath a superior has been around for centuries in the form of apprenticeship programs .
Young people eager to learn a trade would spend time working under a master craftsman to learn a skill that would eventually lead to an increase in material wealth .
Using this logic you would assume that the most sought after internships would be in areas that lead to the greatest financial reward .
Young
White people , however , prefer internships that put them on the path for careers that will generally result in a DECREASE of the material wealth accumulated by their parents .
For example , if you were to present a white 19 year old with the choice of spending the summer earning $ 15 an hour as a plumber ’s apprentice or making $ 0 answering phones at Production Company , they will always choose the latter .
In fact , the only way to get the white person to choose the plumbing option would be to convince them that it was leading towards an end - of - summer pipe art installation .
White people view the internship as their foot into the door to such high - profile low - paying career fields as journalism , film , politics , art , non-profits , and anything associated with a museum .
Any white person who takes an internship outside of these industries is either the wrong type of white person or a law student .
There are no exceptions .
If all goes according to plan , an internship will end with an offer of a job that pays $ 24,000 per year and will consist entirely of the same tasks they were recently doing for free .
In fact , the transition to full time status results in the addition of only one new responsibility : feeling superior to the new interns .
When all is said and done , the internship process serves the white community in many ways .
First , it helps to train the next generation of freelance writers , museum curators , and director ’s assistants .
But more importantly , internships teach white children how to complain about being poor .
So when a white person tells you about their unpaid internship at the New Yorker , it ’s not a good idea to point out how the cost of rent and food will essentially mean that they are PAYING their employer for the right to make photocopies .
Instead it ’s best to say : “ you earned it . ”
They will not get the joke .
The next time you open a bottle of beer , do n't just chug the brew - take a look at the logo on the label .
Ever wonder who St. Pauli Girl actually is ?
Or why there 's the mysterious number " 33 " on Rolling Rock beer bottles ?
Read on .
Neatorama takes a look at the Stories Behind 7 Famous Beer Logos :
St. Pauli Girl : Probably Not Just a Waitress
Photo : safoocat [ Flickr ]
What 's not to like about the St. Pauli Girl ?
She 's blonde , big bosomed , and brings us big frothy mugs of beer !
But what most people do n't realize is that she 's not exactly just a waitress .
Yep , St. Pauli is the famous red light district of Hamburg , Germany .
In 1977 , St. Pauli Girl Beer started to choose a spokesmodel to represent the beer brand and appear on the popular St. Pauli Girl poster .
In 1999 , they started using Playboy magazine playmates as the girl ( the 2008 St. Pauli Girl is Irina Voronina ) .
Here 's the gallery of St. Pauli Girls from 1977 to 2007 : http://www.stpauligirl.com/pastgirls.php
Pabst Blue Ribbon
This one 's pretty straightforward .
PBR was originally named Best Select , then Pabst Select and finally Pabst Blue Ribbon , named because the practice of tying blue ribbons around the beer bottleneck from 1882 until 1916 .
Pabst advertisement from 1911 ( Source )
Rolling Rock 33
The mysterious ' 33 ' has been on the label of Rolling Rock since the Latrobe Brewing Company brewed its first batch in 1939 , but what does it actually stand for ?
Theories about the origin of the cryptic ' 33 ' , some undoubtedly hatched in bar arguments , range from the year 1933 ( the year Prohibition was repealed ) , how many steps it took to walk from the brewmaster 's office to the brewing floor , the number of the racing horse on the label , and even the highest level of Freemasonry ( 33rd degree ) .
According to James Tito , the former CEO of Latrobe Brewing , the number ' 33 ' may actually be an accident .
When the founders of the company came up with the slogan
Rolling Rock -
From the glass lined tanks of Old Latrobe , we tender this premium beer for your enjoyment as a tribute to your good taste .
It comes from the mountain springs to you .
someone wrote ' 33 ' at the end to indicate the number of words , but the bottle printer mistakenly incorporated it into the label graphic .
They decided to keep the 33 instead of having to scrap and replace the bottles .
Even though the slogan had been changed several times in the history of Rolling Rock , the company had made sure to use the same number of words .
( Source - see argument against this reasoning within )

Heineken : the Friendly 'e '
The logo of Heineken is rather simple : it consists of the five - pointed red star and the word " Heineken " in green , but there 's something remarkable about it : Alfred Henry ( Freddy ) Heineken , the grandson of the founder of the company , Gerard Heineken , helped develop the company 's own typeface ( common today , but rare back then ) .
He insisted that the 'e ' in the logo should look friendlier .
Indeed , the three letters 'e ' in the logo are slightly tilted backwards to make it seem that they are smiling .
Guinness : Harp of Brian Boru
Arthur Guinness brewed his first stout in 1759 , it took Guinness over 100 years later to select its logo - the harp of Brian Boru - a gaelic harp in Ireland 's heraldic emblem and a symbol of Irish unity , not to mention the Euro coin .
By the way , Ireland is the only country in the world with a musical instrument as a national emblem .
Brian Boru was the king of Ireland that ruled from 1002 to 1014 and protected and / or freed - depending on who you ask - the Irish people from the Vikings .
The harp named after him , however , was actually much , much older .
According to Celtic myth , the gaelic harp was owned by the Dagda , a king / god / father - figure , that can summon the seasons .
There 's actually a real instrument named the harp of Brian Boru .
It 's one of three surviving medieval harps dating from the 14th or 15th century and is on display at Trinity College Dublin .
By the way , if you are named O'Brien or O'Brian , then you 're a descendant of King Brian Boru - so a toast ( Guinness , of course ) is in order !
Stella Artois : the Horn
Stella Artois was launched as a Christmas beer in 1926 - its name is a combination of the latin word for " star " and Sebastian Artois , a brewmaster in the Den Hoorn Brewery ( founded 1366 ) in Louvain , Belgium .
The logo of Stella Artois beer reflects the beer 's origin - Den Hoorn is Dutch for " The Horn , " and the now - defunct brewery lives on as the horn prominently displayed on the top of the label of every bottle of Stella Artois beer .
The fancy frame around the name is also in the style of Flemish architecture in the city .
Bass Red Triangle
(L) Bass & Co's Pale Ale , the very first trademark registered in the UK ( 1876 ) at the Intellectual Property Office ; ( R ) current logo
Bass Pale Ale 's Red Triangle logo may be simple , but it 's pretty darned special : it 's the very first trademark registered in Britain .
When trademark registration law took effect on January 1 , 1876 , a Bass employee was sent to wait overnight outside the registrar 's office in order to be the first in line to register a trademark the next morning .
Bass & Co. Brewery got the first two trademarks , the first being the Bass Red Triangle for their pale ale and the second the Bass Red Diamond for their strong ale .
Bass is also the most frequently featured beer in fine arts .
Bottles of Bass beer can be seen in Manet 's 1882 painting Bar at the Folies - Bergère .

Bonus : Old Milwaukee 's Swedish Bikini Team
Okay , so this is n't exactly about beer logos - but brewers often advertise their beers in outrageous manners , and there 's nothing quite as outrageous as the notorious Old Milwaukee 's Swedish Bikini Team :

Ironically , there 's nothing Swedish about the Swedish Bikini Team - the women were all played by American actresses wearing platinum blonde wigs !

“ He was n’t so satisfied with life here , ” Ms. Zhang said of her son .
“ He was so tired here , and there was n’t so much money . ”
Not a day went by that they did not miss their hometown , Ms. Zhang said .
But until this past winter , they had never returned for a visit .
They wanted to save the cost of train tickets .
They live in bare concrete rooms on the ground floor of an apartment block opposite the market .
The kitchen has a makeshift two - burner stove a few feet from the parents ’ bed .
Most of their neighbors are fellow settlers from Henan and Sichuan .
At the market , about three - quarters of the 200 vendors are from those two provinces , the parents said .
A handful of Uighurs sold fruit or raw mutton .
“ Relations with the Uighurs were pretty good , ” Ms. Zhang said .
“ There was a mutton stall beside the cart where my son sold fruit .
On nights when my son did n’t want to bring his fruit home , he would ask the Uighur neighbor to keep the fruit inside his stall . ”
This past winter , the family took the nearly 40 - hour train ride home for the first time .
The parents had arranged for Mr. Lu to marry a 23 - year - old woman from home .
The couple had photographs taken : Mr. Lu in a white turtleneck lying beside his bride - to - be in front of a beach backdrop ; the smiling couple sitting on a white bench , each holding teddy bears in their laps .
The family returned to Xinjiang after scheduling the wedding for the end of this year .
On Sunday , as on any other day , Ms. Zhang , her son and a young cousin pushed four carts to the market .
Mr. Lu’s father had gone to another province to buy fruit wholesale .

The attendees , nearly all born well after John Lennon died , are screaming and clapping like schoolgirls , clearly in the throes of Beatlemania .
At the end of the video presentation , the two surviving flesh - and - blood band members , Ringo Starr , 69 , and Paul McCartney , 67 , take the stage for a surprise appearance .

The Beatles : Rock Band Trailer
On September 9 , after three years of ardent courtship , tech wizardry , and dizzying legal acrobatics , MTV Games is releasing The Beatles : Rock Band , a multiplayer title spanning the group 's entire career .
The launch of the game ( to be released the same day as a 12 - album remastered CD box set ) marks the first time the Beatles tunes will be legally available digitally .
The game will include 45 tracks to kick things off , followed by additional releases for purchase via MTV 's download - to - console service .
It 's an extraordinary coup for MTV .
For years , the Beatles have been the refuseniks of rock and roll , turning down all entreaties , including well - publicized offers from Apple and Microsoft , to make their 24 - album catalog — currently available only on vinyl , cassette , and CD — accessible online .
The band 's resistance is as curious as it is costly : Apple Corps , the company it founded in 1969 as a tax shelter , has undoubtedly missed out on millions of dollars in online sales , causing some fans to find illicit ways to get Beatles music .
Yet the band remains one of the best - selling musical acts ever .
The release of the Beatles ' 1 , a remastered compilation album , has sold more than 28 million copies worldwide .
In April , McCartney was one of the headline acts at the hipster music festival Coachella , strumming a string of Beatles classics to thousands of under - 30 music fans .
So , after the Beatles turned away such desirable suitors as Apple and Microsoft , how did MTV persuade the group to make its digital debut via videogame ?
For starters , the money .
While music industry revenue streams are shrinking , videogames offer long - term growth , with a larger chunk of profits for the copyright holder than , say , a standard deal with iTunes .
Activision 's rival game franchise , Guitar Hero , for instance , has sold 35 million discs , generating more than $ 1 billion in sales , with acts like Metallica and Aerosmith cutting fat deals for their band - name versions .
It 's also a matter of control .
Apple Corps is hyper - vigilant about the integrity of the tunes and the threat of piracy .
( In 1987 , when EMI licensed " Revolution " to Nike , Apple Corps fought unsuccessfully to block the deal . )
With Rock Band , users can stream or download songs only through their game console — no importing to laptops or MP3 players .
With this unprecedented deal , the execs at MTV Games ( and parent company Viacom ) are banking on the Beatles version of the already successful Rock Band franchise to give the fading network a boost .
" Rock Band is a place we 've built for people to gather , " says Judy McGrath , CEO of MTV .
In other words , The Beatles : Rock Band is rebooting MTV 's original concept : getting kids to enjoy music through their TV sets .
It all began on a secluded beach .
In late 2006 , Van Toffler , president of MTV Networks , took his family to a small Caribbean island for a much - needed vacation .
It had been a rocky year for Toffler .
His longtime friend and colleague Tom Freston had been ousted as CEO of Viacom , and MTV was struggling for ratings .
Toffler had created MTV 's videogame division in 2005 as part of his larger effort : to expand the network everywhere its audience convened , be that via mobile phones , the Internet , or videogames .
One of his boldest moves was purchasing Harmonix , the game development company behind Guitar Hero , to create a similar title for MTV .
It was risky : Harmonix would have to compete against its own best - selling game — which is owned by Activision — and hope to catch lightning in a bottle twice .

A few days after he and his family arrived , Toffler was invited to lunch by Planet Hollywood founder Robert Earl and ended up sitting next to George Harrison 's 31 - year - old son , Dhani .
Harrison mentioned being exhausted from a late - night bout of Guitar Hero .
When Toffler told him about the MTV purchase of Harmonix , Harrison 's face lit up : " You know what would be cool .
If you made a game that featured the whole band . "
Toffler was shocked .
Harrison had no way of knowing it , but Harmonix was toiling away on Rock Band , which was building on that very idea .
Toffler 's wheels began spinning .
It seemed too insane to contemplate , but what if MTV could get the Beatles on the new game ?
It would give MTV an advantage over Activision ; Rock Band could blow Guitar Hero off the stage .
Toffler returned to MTV's New York offices eager to pursue the prospect .
He set up a meeting between Harrison and Alex Rigopulos , cofounder and CEO of Harmonix .
When Rigopulos arrived at Harrison 's home in Venice , California , he was elated to shake hands with the son of rock royalty and anxious about pitching the outrageous scheme .
" Would n't it be incredible to make a Beatles game ? " Rigopulos asked .
To his surprise , Harrison eagerly agreed .
Soon , Harrison began lobbying his mother , Olivia , and the other Apple Corps shareholders : McCartney , Starr , and Yoko Ono .
His enthusiasm was contagious :
In summer 2006 , Rigopulos and Paul DeGooyer , senior VP of MTV's game division , flew to LA to present a Rock Band prototype to Olivia Harrison and Starr , who loved the game .
DeGooyer did a repeat performance for Ono's son Sean Lennon .
Rigopulos and DeGooyer still had to meet with McCartney — a task not unlike scoring a sit - down with the Pope .
" You do n't schedule a meeting with Paul , " Rigopulos says , laughing .
" You just drop everything and come when he has time for you . "
In August 2007 , the pair got the call .
They flew to London to meet with McCartney at EMI 's famous Abbey Road Studios .
DeGooyer and Rigopulos strapped on their plastic instruments and kicked out the jams .
McCartney was friendly and listened closely to their pitch .
" We were relieved , " Rigopulos recalls .
" He seemed genuinely interested . "
Still , McCartney remained noncommittal .
Upon their return to New York , the duo discovered why : Apple Corps was interested in a Beatles version of Rock Band only if it used songs spanning their entire career , a demand that posed considerable — perhaps insurmountable — technical challenges .
" They may have thought we would never come back , " Rigopulos says .
" They thought it was a polite way of saying thanks but no thanks . "
Determined , Harmonix pushed forward , offering to craft a sample demo as a means of clinching the deal .
To produce a song for Rock Band , however , Harmonix requires access to an original multitrack recording , in which individual instruments are put down on separate channels .
But in the early ' 60s , when the Beatles were cutting classics like " I Want to Hold Your Hand , " the band recorded multiple instrumental parts on a single track .
Isolating McCartney 's bass from Harrison 's guitar was no easy feat .
Further complicating matters , Apple Corps had given the team only hissing , low - bitrate audio files , which required extra time and care .
But they did get a little help from a friend .
Jeff Jones , CEO of Apple Corps , suggested they turn to Giles Martin , the son of longtime Beatles producer George Martin , for help .
Martin had just completed remixing a series of Beatles tracks for the 2006 album Love ( featured in a popular Cirque du Soleil show ) and was intimately familiar with the band 's master tapes .
" The stars just aligned , " DeGooyer recalls .
" It turned out Giles was n't booked at that time , and he had the trust and confidence of the Beatles . "
Martin had discovered a way to isolate the individual instruments and voices using software developed by Cedar , a company based in Cambridge , England .
Originally created for audio forensics , the software allowed Martin and the Harmonix team to zero in on the exact frequencies of McCartney 's vocals , for instance , and filter out the rest .
After weeks in Abbey Road Studios , they disassembled five songs — enough to make the demo .
Meanwhile , the first version of Rock Band was released in late 2007 , quickly becoming a hit .
In a savvy move , MTV made Rock Band as much a sales platform as a videogame , releasing 6 to 10 tracks a week that could be downloaded for a few bucks a pop .
David Bowie , Radiohead , Metallica , and the Clash signed on .
While overall sales of the game disc lagged behind Guitar Hero's , sales of downloadable tracks now outpace those offered by Activision .
In February 2008 , Rigopulos , Martin , and DeGooyer presented their five - song game demo to the Harrisons , Ono , and Starr .
They got the thumbs - up .
Next was McCartney .
After they played the demo for him in his London office , McCartney gave them a sprig of lavender in a glassine envelope as a parting gift .
Did they have a deal ?
Was that McCartney 's idea of a handshake ?
DeGooyer and Rigopulos returned to the US and waited .
Not long after , they got McCartney 's blessing .
The Harmonix team had the band ; now they needed the rock .
Licensing music for games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band is a fairly complicated procedure .
Gamemakers pay a chunk of cash upfront to several parties to license both the master recording and the publishing rights to the underlying song .
Licensing the Beatles , however , is trickier .
The recording rights belong to the band 's longtime label , EMI .
Most of the publishing rights , on the other hand , are held by Sony / ATV ( a joint venture with the late Michael Jackson ) .
Complicating matters even further , additional publishing rights for certain tunes are held by Harrissongs , an independent entity set up by George Harrison , as well as by Starr 's publishing company , Startling Music .
And that 's just behind the music .
In order to develop the game 's digital doubles , MTV had to license the artists ' likenesses from Apple Corps , which meant appealing to the Beatles and their descendants — famous for conflicting views on how to manage the Beatles brand — to reach an agreement .
On top of that , the company had to obtain separate rights for any materials it wanted to use for the game 's marketing .
After resolving the legal aspects , reviewing the demos , and considering a late - breaking offer from rival company Activision , the Beatles officially teamed up with MTV .
On October 30 , 2008 — almost two years after the first meeting on the beach — MTV and Apple Corps issued a statement that the Beatles were coming to Rock Band .
The announcement was met with disbelief and envy from the music industry and game companies alike .
With the deal complete , Harmonix could finally bring all its resources to bear on the project itself .
The September 9 release was less than a year away , and although Martin and Rigopulos had figured out how to marry the Beatles ' music to the Rock Band format , the developers still had a long way to go .
The original Rock Band let players assume the role of a generic rocker and gradually gain experience and a bigger repertoire , thus accessing more fans , cooler clothes , bigger venues , a larger entourage , and all the other accoutrements of rock - and - roll stardom .
" Right away , we realized this would n't work for the Beatles , " Rigopulos says .
" They had all that stuff — fans , money , stardom — almost from the beginning . "
Tiburon may install license plate cameras Crime fighting

Welcome to Tiburon .
Click .
Your presence has been noted .
The posh and picturesque town that juts into San Francisco Bay is poised to do something unprecedented : use cameras to record the license plate number of every vehicle that crosses city limits .
Some residents describe the plan as a commonsense way to thwart thieves , most of whom come from out of town .
Others see an electronic border gate and worry that the project will only reinforce Tiburon 's image of exclusivity and snootiness .
" I personally do n't see too much harm in it , because I have nothing to hide , " commodities broker Paul Lambert , 64 , said after a trip to Boardwalk Market in downtown Tiburon on a recent afternoon .
" Yet , " he said , " it still has the taint of Big Brother . "
Tiburon 's camera idea is a marriage of technology , policing and distinct geography .
Situated on a peninsula , Tiburon 's hillside homes and waterfront shops are accessible by only two roads , allowing police to point the special cameras known as license plate readers at every lane that leads into and out of the town of 8,800 .
The readers , which use character recognition software , can compare plates to databases of cars that have been stolen or linked to crimes , then immediately notify police of matches , said Police Chief Michael Cronin .
If someone burglarized a Tiburon home at 3 a.m. one morning , he said , detectives could consult the devices and find out who came to town in the hours before - and who rolled out soon after .
' Very low - key '
" It 's very low - key , " said Town Manager Peggy Curran .
" The whole point of license plates is that people can be identified by them . "
If the Town Council gives final approval , Curran said , officials hope to install the readers on Tiburon Boulevard and Paradise Drive by late fall .
Tiburon plans to spend grant funds on the project and ask two other governments that could benefit from it to contribute to an expected price tag of $ 100,000 - the city of Belvedere , a bump of land on the southeastern edge of Tiburon , and Marin County .
Cronin called it a sound investment .
He pointed to a frustrating twist in Tiburon crime : Residents feel so safe that they do n't lock their cars and homes .
In all of 2007 and 2008 , Tiburon recorded 196 thefts , 37 burglaries and a dozen stolen cars .
The chief said every alleged thief who was arrested in those years was from outside Tiburon .
Finding suspects
Once the street cameras are installed , Cronin said , hunting a burglary suspect could be easier .
" We 'll look for a plate that came and went , " he said .
" That 's going to give us a very short list to work on . "
Detectives could then check to see if any of the cars has been linked with crimes in the past .
Between 300 and 400 cars use Tiburon Boulevard to travel in or out of the town from midnight to 6 a.m. on weekdays .
" It 's much more efficient than having an officer sit on the boulevard , watch passing cars and guess who might be a burglar , " Cronin said .
Nicole Ozer , who directs policy on technology for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California , is n't as supportive .
She called the cameras a " needle in a haystack " approach that may waste money , invade privacy and invite unfair profiling .
" To be under investigation simply because you entered or left Tiburon at a certain time is incredibly intrusive , " Ozer said .
" Innocent people should be able to go about their daily lives without being tracked and monitored . "
City leaders promise to prevent abuses .
Information on which cars enter and leave town will not be available to the public , they said , and will be erased within 60 days .
Police officers will be granted access to the information only during an investigation .
License plate readers have exploded in popularity in recent years , but Tiburon would be one of the first to mount them at fixed locations - and perhaps the very first to record every car coming or going .
California Highway Patrol officials have put the readers on 18 cruisers and at four fixed locations .
CHP officers have seen a huge increase in recoveries of stolen cars since the devices were installed starting in August 2005 , the agency said .
Devices help CHP
Through December , officials said , the CHP had used the devices to recover 1,739 cars and arrest 675 people .
San Francisco gave the devices to police as well as parking control officers , allowing them to track cars parked for too long in one spot .
Some cities use the cameras to assess anti-congestion tolls on motorists , while casino bosses get an alert when a high roller - or a cheater - pulls in .
Outside Tiburon 's Boardwalk Market , where a flyer in the window offered a $ 2,000 reward for the return of a stolen Pomeranian , residents seemed split on the plan .
Robin Pryor , 66 , of Belvedere said the most important issue was whether the cameras made people safer .
" It 's just like locking your door , " Pryor said .
" If they have reason for it to bother them , they should n't be coming in . "
But Fred Mayo , 62 , who lives in Tiburon and owns a travel agency in Mill Valley , said the cameras would invade privacy .
" Where does it end ? " Mayo asked .
He referred to the crime blotter in the local newspaper , which listed two incidents recently of kids tossing water balloons at cars , and noted , " It 's not like Tiburon 's a high - crime area . "

( CNN ) -- Monica Conyers , Detroit 's embattled City Council president pro tempore , pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to commit bribery , a federal court representative in Michigan told CNN .
Detroit City Council member , Monica Conyers , admits accepting bribes to sway a $ 1.2 billion contract vote .
Conyers , 44 , admitted accepting bribes in exchange for her vote to sway the City Council to approve Synagro Technologies Inc. 's $ 1.2 billion contract in 2007 .
It 's unclear when Conyers , the wife of U.S. Rep.
John Conyers , began her relationship with Synagro , but court papers say she received money from Synagro until December 2007 .
Conyers voted in favor of the wastewater treatment contract on November 20 , 2007 , the same day she received an envelope filled with cash from Detroit businessman Rayford Jackson , court papers say .
Jackson pleaded guilty to providing Conyers with the money .
He had been a paid consultant of Synagro .
On December 4 , 2007 , Conyers received another envelope of cash from Jackson in a McDonald 's parking lot , said Terrence Berg , the U.S. attorney from the eastern district of Michigan .
" She was the swing vote in this deal , " Berg said .
" She used her power to get the deal done , and she acknowledged that . "
The mood was somber at Conyers ' office on Friday , an official there told CNN .
A few office workers cried .
They found out about the developments through news reports , said Denise Tolliver , Conyers ' deputy chief of staff .
" We 've been going through this for a while , " Tolliver said .
" Reporters would ask us questions about anonymous sources , and we just did n't believe them . "
Office workers were preparing for an afternoon meeting with City Council President Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr. later Friday .
According to state law , Conyers will have to forfeit her seat , Tolliver said .
Cockrel said there 's language in the law that makes it unclear whether she needs to forfeit her seat immediately or after sentencing
" It hurts the City Council 's image , for sure , " Cockrel said .
" But we need to remember , this is only one member of the council .
You can't paint the entire council with the same brush . "
For a seven - month period in 2008 , Cockrel replaced former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to two counts of obstructing justice .
During that time Cockrel terminated the city 's contract with Synagro because of rumors circulating about bribes , he said .
Conyers faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison , according to prosecutors .
Synagro would not comment on Conyers ' plea , but a spokeswoman said , " We have cooperated fully with the federal investigation and will continue to do so . "

Your blog isclose to home on health care and taxes , I feel like I could be a poster child .
I have been " through the looking glass over the past 5 years .
Especially under Bush , but it concerns me that Obama has not stood fast to reverse those policies .
I have and had an injury that caused me to be completely out of work for 3 years ... and I 'm still recuperating from a rib / ligament injury that makes it tough to breathe ... sometimes impossible , until it resolves during a given day .
In fact , for the first 3 years , I had such difficulty getting off of our living room floor , the only place I could breathe comfortably ( and only on my right side ) .
In the first 3 years , 2004 - 2007 , I was in one of the nation 's “ Top 10 ” hospital systems .
( I came to find that rankings are based on financial income , not patient outcomes . )
They were happy to do multiple standard MRI 's , scans and so forth , though never finding the problem , and often making fun of me because it was outside their realm .
The insurance companies were happy to pay for the many MRI 's , CT scans , and a multitude of ( unhelpful ) drugs they had me on .
While this was going on , I had to stop working and was housebound for those 3 years .
While not claiming disability , and while taxes to the very wealthy were being cut , I got audited for " being a hobby " because I could not work .
I produced my hundreds of pages of medical records .
Amazing .
And fortunately , my records , as they always are , were immaculate .
Still , I had to hire lawyers for $ 10 k to fight it .
I won ; the IRS decided that , over a 3 year period , Iowe for mileage : $ 200 , because they did n't want to " could n't be wrong " -- or had to find money anywhere they could ... just not from the wealthy .
I actually did n't , but paid it .
I also heard from many middle income friends during that year who were also being audited for the first time in their entire lives .
( It was my first , too . )
By the way ...
I was not able to write off my legal fees for that fight ... but let 's not stop there !
I found a doctor who was an osteopath for the Pirates and Indians baseball teams , who started a very new procedure ( and who , unlike many -- not all -- docs , still goes to school half of his time to keep up ) that included help from the massage therapists for the Steelers who noticed my swollen back .
The doctors at my famous medical center never touched me once in 3 years , although they ran many many tests , before telling me to live with being disabled .
The massage therapists unwound the 3 years of muscle spasms , allowing the doctors for the Pirates to find the real injury , a ligament that was stretched , which holds in a thoracic rib .
His treatment was to centrifuge my blood to the white blood cells ( PRP therapy ) and reinject it into the ligament to re-tighten it , which the other doctors said was not doable .
It worked IMMEDIATELY .
My insurance company ( Blue Cross ) approved it ... then , after I had it done , withdrew approval , leaving me with a $ 1200 bill .
( The same procedure was used on Hines Ward for this year 's superbowl by this doctor , and it was big news ) .
I 've had it done again , with pre-approval -- then had it denied after the process -- leaving me with a bill again .
Much of this of course would go on credit cards , as surprise medical and legal ( IRS battle ) bills can ... and my massage is never covered although it is the only thing that helps .
Because of this , I am on my feet and working ... but paying out of pocket for the treatments .
Insurance wo n't cover it , although they are still happy to cover any more MRI 's and medications I would want ( although they do not help ) .
But let 's not stop .
On the move from my former city to my current city , our current home , we actually made some money on our house sale in a down market by not being greedy and not overpricing .
We paid offof our credit cards / medical bills , got great credit , and enough for a down payment on a house here in our new city .
Given the current difficulties in the market , we never use our credit card , and found a nice house in our new town .
However , I continue to have to pay for the only procedures which help me ( although they 'll pay for any drugs and MRI 's I get without any question ) ... and our new house ?
Well , the loan has been re-sold 3 times since June 1st of this year ( after the banks were bailed out for doing just this ) in a month by the mortgagors '...
Bank of America to Chase to ironically , Fannie Mae . I say " ironically " re : Fannie Mae , as we would haveto have gotten our original loan with them , because a loan with them allows us to forego mortgage insurance , an additional several hundred dollars per month .
But we were told we were ineligible .
Yet , they were happy to endwith the loan ... and we still have to pay the extra mortgage insurance .... each one sends in notes asking for payments , saying they are the ones to get the payment and a late payment will incur a penalty -- even with good credit and wanting to make the payment to the proper people !
So the banks surely have not learned a lesson .
It required a lot of time on our part to determine which of the companies saying “ Me ! No.. ME ! ” actually was due the payment .
Meanwhile , my new bank in my new hometown started a new policy of only allowing a certain number of transfers between accounts ... both with reasonable sums in them ... before they levy the equivalent of an overdraft fee , though neither are overdrawn or even close to being overdrawn .
And they have instituted a policy that only clearsof checks I deposit ... even from accounts in the same bank , which caught me by surprise , causing a few overdrafts in one week when the change was made .
But in the scheme of things a few hundred dollars is small , even though it all took place in the 10 days after they instituted the new policy without informing us about it .
They also say this is a federal policy , using that as the reasoning .
It was n't an issue previously .
I wrote you this long note because I think your blog is both good and powerful ; I feel as though things are upside down and not being remedied and I feel like we are currently living in Wonderland ... or as the Red Queen said ...
" We 're painting the rosestoday ... " ( Oh , and we never ever use credit cards anymore -- zero balance -- and have changed banks and started fresh with the new one .
And we enjoy our new home thoroughly . )
Hope you 're well .. and perhaps this capsulizes modern times in one storyA footnote ... of all people , former Bush Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill ( also former CEO of Alcoa ) who was forced out under Bush for being rational , has started a new company I feel is very valuable .
It 's sole purpose is to rank hospitals based on patient outcomes , and not on revenue , as they currently are .
Not surprisingly , the hospitals are showing reluctance to adopt his policies or work with his new company , but he may be a good person for President Obama to consult as he reaches across the aisle to the last few pragmatic Republicans .

Just ask the guy who had to stand at the corner of Leesburg Pike and International Drive in Tysons Corner , Va. , this morning .
You know , the guy wearing the sign that said , " I CHEATED .
THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT . "
A man who identified himself as William Taylor of Centreville , Va. told a passerby that he cheated on his wife -- and she found evidence of it on his cell phone .
So the wife allegedly doled out a rather creative punishment :
He had to stand at the intersection during morning rush , wearing the handmade sign .
We have n't quite decided if this is a publicity stunt for some wacky YouTube channel or a ratings - driver for a morning radio station .
But if it 's true , we like it .
We. Are. Amused .
People reported seeing him as early as 9 a.m. , and his presence was discussed on several of D.C. 's morning radio shows .
Taylor said his wife texted him a little before 11 a.m. and said he'd been out there long enough .
He removed the sign and skedaddled .
Leesburg Pike in Tysons Corner is one of the most traffic - clogged arteries in the area , making for maximum viewing pleasure .
Hope it was worth it , buddy .

Abstaining from alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of depression according to a new study published in Addiction journal .
It has long been recognised that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to poor physical and mental health .
However , there has been mounting evidence that low levels of alcohol consumption may also be associated with poor mental health possibly due to abstainers having other health problems or being reformed heavy drinkers .
The study utilised data from the Nord - Trøndelag Health Study ( HUNT Study ) based in Norway .
This provided information on the drinking habits and mental health of over 38,000 individuals .
Using this data the authors were able to show that those individuals who reported drinking no alcohol over a two week period were more likely than moderate drinkers to report symptoms of depression .
Those individuals who additionally labelled themselves as " abstainers " were at the highest risk of depression .
Other factors , such as age , physical health problems and number of close friends could explain some , but not all of this increased risk .
The authors also had access to reported levels of alcohol consumption 10 years prior to the main survey .
This showed that fourteen percent of current abstainers had previously been heavy drinkers , but this did not explain all of the increased risk of depression amongst abstainers .
The authors conclude that in societies where some use of alcohol is the norm , abstinence may be associated with being socially marginalised or particular personality traits that may also be associated with mental illness .
It should also be noted that alcohol use is associated with many physical health problems , with excessive alcohol consumption being estimated to contribute to over 33,000 death in the UK each year and many more injuries .
The current guidance is for men to drink no more than three to four units each day , and women to drink no more than two to three units .

A change that became an establishing character moment for Miss Piggy : in one of her earliest appearances , the script called for her to slap Kermit over some disagreement .
Frank
Oz , however was having trouble trying to do a convincing - looking slap .
He eventually got frustrated and had her karate - chop Kermit with a wild yell .
The rest is history .
More of a meta example , but it still fits .
During pre-production for Muppets Tonight , the performers started fooling around with random characters to work out characters for the show .
When Bill Baretta started singing with the Johnny Fiama puppet , no one was listening , so Brian Henson picked up a random monkey puppet and yelled at everyone to listen to Johnny .
This resulted in the character of Sal .
Sesame Street is known to do this with their " Muppet and Kid " segments , in which the Muppet asks the kid something and they reply .
In the most well - known of the bunch , Kermit was supposed to sing the ABC 's with a little girl .
Only the child decided to have her own little joke by shouting " Cookie Monster ! " at various points in the song .
Jim Henson played along with it , creating one of the funniest moments in the show 's history .
.
A more dramatic example from Thunderbirds : while filming the climactic landing sequence of " Trapped In The Sky " , the string holding one of the Elevator Cars onto the rolling road suddenly snapped , causing it to veer out of control and crash .
Special effects director Derek Meddings was so impressed by the realism of the crash that he convinced the Andersons to rewrite the script to incorporate it , adding a shot of the out - of - control Elevator Car crashing into a parked aircraft .
Radio
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy :
The comically anguished scream presented as " this recording of a man being put into the Vortex " is actually a recording of Simon Jones reacting to a piano lid smashing his fingers .
In an earlier episode , the Golgafrincham B Ark has " tired TV producers " aboard .
This was supposed to be " Tri - D TV producers " , but the scripts were misprinted and the production team thought the new line was just as good as the original .
During the episode " TV Documentary " of The Navy Lark there 's been a Running Gag about Leading Seaman Riddle being called to the Bridge but he never turns up .
During the climax the messenger says that he realises where Riddle has been all this time .
" I'm Reading Seama - " [ audience explodes with laughter and the actor stumbers for a short while ]
" I'm Leading Seaman Riddle ! " [ audience cheers ]
In " Bleak Expectations " Anthony Head , in the role of Gently Benevolent , is pretending to be an American named Harlan J Trashcan and suing Pip Bin over the royalties for the invention of the bin .
Part way through the court scene he had trouble getting back into his ( very , very obviously fake ) American accent after two other characters had been speaking .
In the process of attempting to get into the accent he says " sorry , ca n't get the accent " .
This was left in , along with the slightly odd sounds he made trying to get the accent back , and is not remotely out of place ( nor is it at all surprising that Pip still does not immediately realise what 's going on ) .
Roleplay
During the DC Nation Olympics Arc , it was completely unintentional for Hades to actually kill Arsenal .
The intent by the plot - runner and Hades - mun was just to get him high , removing him from the fight .
The fact the Roy player ran with it and made Hades simulate a heroin overdose completely changed the ending , prompting the Sadistic Choice the Greek Gods would force on Donna later .
Survival of the Fittest : Less funny than dramatic , but Brittanny Ashworth 's death in V2 .
The character 's handler said , in an OOC note at the end of his first post with her , " Anybody after a kill feel free to take a shot at her . "
Of course , somebody interpreted this a bit too literally , godmoding the character 's death at the hands of his villain character .
After a little debate , it was left in .
Also , an important part of V3 character 's Adam Reeves ' backstory revolves around him having his lip torn by a fish - hook hold in a fight .
It was suggested the culprit of this injury was the older brother of Maxie Dasai .
The more the handlers thought about the idea , the better it sounded , and it was simply thrown in .
AJCO : While building the original facility for the roleplay sets , A_J 's player ( the aptly named AJ ) accidentally dug through into bedrock , exposing the endless blackness underneath the Minecraft world .
She created a lab room around it , and many RPs later the Void is the most important plot point of the whole series .
A_J 's distinctive Black Eyes of Evil also came about when Pythosblaze , Frances ' player , drew her first fanart of A_J and misinterpreted AJ 's badly - shaded skin as having completely black eyes .
AJ rolled with it , and it was explained in - RP as one of the side - effects of continuous exposure to the Void .
Similarly , Breyos ' and Dell 's players both drew Vinnie with pointy ears when they were meant to be a human , and Vinnie 's player Cameo decided to keep it and explain it as plastic surgery due to dramatic bullying on their home planet .
Some elements of We Are All Pokémon Trainers were created simply because someone did something random and the rest decided it was good enough to throw in .
Examples include : Jane 's inexplicable Southern accent at the beginning of the RP being explained as a Hoennese ( In particular Mossdeep ) accent .
Champloo , Dune 's Lucario , decided to make a batch of super - chocolaty brownies .
It was suggested that , do to the sheer endorphin - releasing goodness of that much chocolate , they should be able to reduce a Shadow Pokemon 's shadow gauge .
This is eventually how Vega the Drilbur purified .
A decent part of the plot of Ruby Quest occurs because Weaver took a few of /tg / 's silly and / or unexpected suggestions seriously .
When somebody asked to put a severed hand up a pneumatic mail chute , up the hand went , and it was later used to reveal that Ruby used to be murderously violent .
When /tg/ wanted to bash their way through puzzles , those puzzles were very quickly solved .
When /tg / directed Ruby to lick the Fleshy Prototube , they discovered it tasted bad .
When the players voted to save Jay , three people escaped the Metal Glen instead of two .

The New Threat to Oil Supplies : Hackers
Earlier this year , a sullen , 28 - year - old contractor in California was charged in federal court with sabotaging the computerized controls on oil - rig sitting off the coast , allegedly out of spite for not being hired full time .
Prosecutors say the contractor hacked into a shore - to - rig communications network that , among other functions , detected oil leaks .
He caused thousands of dollars worth of damage , they charge , though , fortunately , no leaks .
A research team from the SINTEF Group , an independent Norwegian think tank , recently warned oil companies worldwide that offshore oil rigs are making themselves particularly vulnerable to hacking as they shift to unmanned robot platforms where vital operations — everything from data transmission to drilling to sophisticated navigation systems that maintain the platform ’s position over the wellhead — are controlled via wireless links to onshore facilities .
The usual threat of a takeover of the massive oil platforms is in the form of seaborne raiders ; Britain ’s Royal Marines commandos still regularly train for hostage rescue on rigs that dot the North Sea .
But now , according to SINTEF scientist Martin Gilje Jaatun , with the advent of robot - controlled platforms , a cyberattacker with a PC anywhere in the world can attempt to seize control of a rig , or a cluster of rigs , by hacking into the " integrated operations " that link onshore computer networks to offshore ones .
" The worst - case scenario , of course , is that a hacker will break in and take over control of the whole platform , " Jaatun said .
That has n’t happened yet , but computer viruses have caused personnel injuries and production losses on North Sea platforms , he noted .
Today , most new oil - field discovery , such as off the coasts of Brazil and Nigeria , occurs in deep ocean waters .
Work on the massive metal platforms towering hundreds of feet above the ocean is notoriously dangerous for the " roughnecks , " and specialized labor costs , not to mention feeding , providing care , and keeping fleets of helicopters and boats on standby to evacuate rig crews in the event of fire or hurricanes , is hugely expensive for oil companies ; hence , the move to robot - operated platforms .
Although the newest oil rigs , which cost upward of $ 1 billion apiece , might be loaded with cutting - edge robotics technology , the software that controls a rig ’s basic functions is anything but .
Most rely on the decades - old supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) software , written in an era when the " open source " tag was more important than security , said Jeff Vail , a former counterterrorism and intelligence analyst with the U.S. Interior Department .
" It ’s underappreciated how vulnerable some of these systems are , " he said .
" It is possible , if you really understood them , to cause catastrophic damage by causing safety systems to fail . "
The list of potential cyberattackers includes ecowarriors aiming to jack up an oil firms ’ production costs , extortionists drawn to oil firms ’ deep pockets , and foreign governments engaging in a strategic contest for ever more scarce global oil reserves , Vail said .
Insurgents , such as Nigeria ’s Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , which is waging a war against oil firms operating in that country ’s waters , could hire mercenary cyberwarriors to mount full - scale assaults on rigs in the delta .
Despite obvious network vulnerabilities , oil firms have not made security a priority , said SINTEF ’s Jaatun , " leaving many of us feeling like ‘ chicken little ’ chirping on that the sky is about to fall . "
This is the first in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s post is about an admittedly small , but I still think kind of nice , change coming with ASP .
NET 4.0 : clean , simple , web.config files .
You ’ll encounter this improvement the first time you do a File -> New Project within Visual Studio 2010 and create an empty ASP.
NET 4.0 Web application ( which is why I thought it might be appropriate to - do as the first post ) .
Web.config files in .NET 3.0 and 3.5
Over the last few releases , the web .config files within new ASP.
NET projects have steadily increased in size .
For example : the default web.config file that is added to a new web project in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 is now some 126 lines long , and contains everything from tag definitions to definitions of handlers and modules to be included in the ASP .
NET HTTP pipeline .
This increase in size is because .
NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5 use the same CLR and machine .
config configuration file as those shipped with .
NET 2.0 – and simply add and update assemblies in the framework when they are installed .
To avoid the risk of us accidentally overwriting customized settings within the original 2.0 machine .
config on the machine , we did n’t register the tag definitions , handlers and modules that shipped with the new ASP .
NET functionality that came with the .NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5 versions .
Instead , we defaulted to having new projects register these settings within the application ’s local web.config file instead .
This was safer – but caused the web.config files to increase and become more complicated and harder to read .
Web.config files in .NET 4
. NET 4 includes a new version of the CLR , and a new .NET 4 specific machine .
config file ( which is installed side - by - side with the one used by .NET 2 , .NET 3 and .NET 3.5 ) .
The new .NET 4 machine .config file now automatically registers all of the ASP.
NET tag sections , handlers and modules that we ’ve added over the years , including the functionality for :
ASP.NET AJAX
ASP.NET Dynamic Data
ASP.NET Routing ( which can now be used for both ASP .
NET WebForms and ASP.
NET MVC )
ASP.NET Chart Control ( which now ships built - into ASP.
NET V4 )
What this means is that when you create a new “ Empty ASP. NET application ” project in VS 2010 , you ’ll find that the new default application - level web.config file is now clean and simple :
The first config section above just tells ASP.
NET to enable debugging by default for the application , and indicates the version of .NET that Visual Studio should target when it provides intellisense ( VS 2010 supports multi-targeting – and the intellisense within the IDE will automatically vary depending on which version of the framework you are targeting ) .
The second config section indicates whether to use “ integrated ” mode when running the ASP.
NET application within IIS7 – which controls whether to run ASP .
NET HttpModules for all requests within the application or just for the ASP.
NET specific URLs .
We enable this by default at the application level web.config file for new applications – since for compatibility reasons the default IIS7 setting registered at the machine - wide is to run modules only for ASP .
NET URLs ( and not for all requests ) .
Summary
The simplified web.config file in .NET 4 is an admittedly small change – but I think a nice one nonetheless , and one which makes the default experience when you create a new ASP .
NET application a little cleaner and more approachable .
In the posts ahead I ’ll be delving into many of the more substantial improvements coming with ASP .
NET 4 . ( as well as a few more of the “ small but nice tweaks ” coming too )
Hope this helps ,

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Down the drain : $ 1.2 trillion .
That 's half of the $ 2.2 trillion the United States spends on health care each year , according to the most recent data from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers ' Health Research Institute .
What counts as waste ?
The report identified 16 different areas in which health care dollars are squandered .
But in talking to doctors , nurses , hospital groups and patient advocacy groups , six areas totaling nearly $ 500 billion stood out as issues to be dealt with in the health care reform debate .
Too many tests
Doctors ordering tests or procedures not based on need but concern over liability or increasing their income is the biggest waste of health care dollars , costing the system at least $ 210 billion a year , according to the report .
The problem is called " defensive medicine . "
" Sometimes the motivation is to avoid malpractice suits , or to make more money because they are compensated more for doing more , " said Dr. Arthur Garson , provost of the University of Virginia and former dean of its medical school .
" Many are also convinced that doing more tests is the right thing to do . "
" But any money that is spent on a patient that does n't improve the outcome is a waste , " said Garson .
Some conservatives have suggested that capping malpractice awards would help solve the problem .
President Obama does n't agree ; instead , his reform proposal encourages doctors to practice " evidence - based " guidelines as a way to scale back on unnecessary tests .
Those annoying claim forms
Inefficient claims processing is the second - biggest area of wasteful expenditure , costing as much as $ 210 billion annually , the PricewaterhouseCoopers report said .
" We spend a lot of time and money trying to get paid by insurers , " said Dr. Terry McGenney , a Kansas City , Mo. - based family physician .
" Every insurance company has its own forms , " McGenney said .
" Some practices spend 40 % of their revenue filling out paperwork that has nothing to do with patient care .
So much of this could be automated . "
Dr. Jason Dees , a family doctor in a private practice based in New Albany , Miss. , said his office often resubmits claims that have been " magically denied . "
" That adds to our administrative fees , extends the payment cycle and hurts our cash flow , " he said .
Dees also spends a lot of time getting " pre-certification " from insurers to approve higher - priced procedures such as MRIs .
" We 're already operating on paper - thin margins and this takes times away from our patients , " he said .
Susan Pisano , spokeswoman for America 's Health Insurance Plans , said " hundreds of billions " of dollars can be saved by standardizing procedures and using technology -- something the White House has mentioned as a key to health care reform .
" For that to happen , we need the technology , " she said .
" Doctors and hospitals must adopt the technology , and we have to develop rules for exchanging of information between doctors , hospitals and health plans . "
Pisano said the industry is launching a pilot program later this year that will allow physicians to communicate with all health plans using a standardized process .
Using the ER as a clinic
More insured and uninsured consumers are getting their primary care in emergency rooms , wasting $ 14 billion every year in health care spending .
" This is an inappropriate use of the ER , " said Dee Swanson , president of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners .
" You do n't go to the ER for strep throat . "
Since emergency rooms are legally obligated to treat all patients , Swanson said providers ultimately find ways to pass on the cost for treating the uninsured to other patients , such as to those who pay out - of - pocket for their medical care .
Dees also took issue with consumers who do n't get primary care for their diabetes or blood pressure on a timely basis , hence finding themselves in the ER .
" Going to the doctor for strep throat would cost $ 65 - $ 70 .
In the ER , it 's $ 600 to $ 800 , " he said .
The $ 787 billion stimulus bill signed passed by President Obama earlier this year allocates $ 1 billion for a wellness and prevention fund , including $ 300 million for immunizations and $ 650 million for prevention programs to combat the rapid growth in chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes .
Medical " Oops "
Medical errors are costing the industry $ 17 billion a year in wasted expenses , something that makes patient advocacy groups irate .
" Do we have a good health IT system in place to prevent this ? " asked Kim Bailey , senior health policy analyst with consumer advocacy group Families USA .
Bailey suggested that processes such as computerized order entry for drugs and use of electronic health records ( EHR ) could help ensure that patients get the correct dosage of medications in hospitals .
The stimulus bill calls for the government to take a leading role in developing standards by 2010 to facilitate the adoption of health information exchanges across the system , including patient electronic health records by 2014 .
Obama has repeatedly said that the use of technology in the health sector will help boost savings , enhance the coordination of care and reduce medical errors and unnecessary procedures .
Going back to the hospital
Bailey suggested that processes such as computerized order entry for drugs and use of electronic health records ( EHR ) could help ensure that patients get the correct dosage of medications in hospitals .
Discharging patients too soon is a " huge waste of money , " said Swanson .
" This happens a lot with elderly patients who are discharged prematurely because of insurance , bed unavailability or ageism , " she said .
Many times , patients also do n't follow instructions for care after discharge .
" So complications arise and they are readmitted in a week , " Swanson said .
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates the cost of preventable hospital readmissions at $ 25 billion annually .
Among the reform plans , one proposal being considered is for Medicare to potentially penalize hospitals who readmit patients within 30 days of discharge .
You forgot to wash your hands !
Those ubiquitous dispensers of hand sanitizer are in hospitals for a reason : PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that about $ 3 billion is wasted every year as a result of infections acquired during hospital stays .
" The general belief is that hospitals are getting much better in managing this than they have in the past , " said Richard Clarke , CEO of Healthcare Financial Management Association , whose members include hospitals and managed care organizations .
Something as simple as hand - washing often can reduce the problem .
" Sometimes doctors are the most difficult people to convince to do this , " said Clarke .
" The challenge here is that patients sometimes come in with infections which then spread in the hospital . "
The stimulus bill signed by Obama earlier this year includes $ 50 million for reducing health care - associated infections .
Other areas of waste identified in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report included up to $ 493 billion related to risky behavior such as smoking , obesity and alcohol abuse , $ 21 billion in staffing turnover , $ 4 billion in prescriptions written on paper , and $ 1 billion in the over - prescribing of antibiotics .
Man collapses with ruptured appendix ... three weeks after NHS doctors ' took it out '
After weeks of excruciating pain , Mark Wattson was understandably relieved to have his appendix taken out .
Doctors told him the operation was a success and he was sent home .
But only a month later the 35 - year - old collapsed in agony and had to be taken back to Great Western Hospital in Swindon by ambulance .
Mark Wattson , 35 , from Swindon may have been the victim of botched surgery after he had to have his appendix removed twice
To his shock , surgeons from the same team told him that not only was his appendix still inside him , but it had ruptured - a potentially fatal complication .
In a second operation it was finally removed , leaving Mr Wattson fearing another organ might have been taken out during the first procedure .
The blunder has left Mr Wattson jobless , as bosses at the shop where he worked did not believe his story and sacked him .
Mr Wattson told of the moment he realised there had been a serious mistake .
' I was lying on a stretcher in terrible pain and a doctor came up to me and said that my appendix had burst , ' he said .
' I could n't believe what I was hearing .
I told these people I had my appendix out just four weeks earlier but there it was on the scanner screen for all to see .
' I thought , " What the hell did they slice me open for in the first place ? "
' I feel that if the surgery had been done correctly in the first place I would n't be in the mess I am today .
I 'm disgusted by the whole experience .'
Mr Wattson first went under the knife on July 7 after experiencing severe abdominal pain for several weeks .
He was discharged but exactly a month later he had to dial 999 after collapsing in agony .
Mr Wattson was readmitted to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon after his appendix ruptured
Following the second operation his incision became infected and he was admitted to hospital for a third time for treatment .
He said : ' I had a temporary job at a sports shop but when I took in two medical certificates saying I had my appendix out twice they did n't believe me .
' Now I 'm helpless .
I can't go out and find a job , I can't go to interviews , I can barely walk and am in constant pain .
Before the first operation they told me I had to have my appendix removed and when I woke up afterwards they said it had been a complete success .
' But then I keeled over in agony one month later and when they did some tests at the hospital we could see the appendix was still there on the scans .
' As far as I was aware they took my appendix out and no one told me any different .
' I have no idea what they did take out , but I want to find out what went wrong . '
A spokesman for Great Western Hospital confirmed that a representative had met Mr Wattson and that an investigation had been started .
He was unable to confirm what , if anything , was removed in the first operation .
Paul Gearing , deputy general manager for general surgery at Great Western Hospital NHS Trust , said : ' We are unable to comment on individual cases .
' However , we would like to apologise if Mr Wattson felt dissatisfied with the care he received at Great Western Hospital . '

August 2009 --
The critical lack of quality and affordable health care is devastating for African Americans .
Twice as likely as whites to go without health insurance , African Americans suffer chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes at an escalating rate .
The root of the problem is not inferior Black — or better white — health care .
It is first and foremost a class issue , exacerbated for Blacks and Latinos because of the institutional racism that still permeates society .
Only the wealthy can afford “ the best medical care in the world ” .
Everyone else ’s care is rationed by the employer or private plans that each can afford to buy , or if uninsured , by the use of “ free ” clinics and emergency rooms .
The debate over the broken US health - care system and what to do about it is one of life and death .
Stubborn facts
The facts do n’t lie .
The United States is the only industrialised country that refuses to provide health care for all its citizens on principle .
Health care is considered a privilege , not a right .
The words “ preventive care ” and “ cradle to grave ” are demonised as “ socialistic ” and anti-capitalist — against the American way of life .
Unlike hundreds of billions spent on US wars of occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan , the cost to provide quality health coverage for all Americans is considered “ too expensive ” .
The “ right ” of the insurance monopoly , the drug industry and organised doctors ’ partnerships to make profits off the backs of sick people is a foundation principle of the free market health - care system .
The false charge that US President Barack Obama is a “ socialist ” is a cheap appeal to the “ market fundamentalism ” with which US society is permeated .
Further , the persistent appeal to the right wing ’s white , racist base about Obama not being “ one of us ” exposes the deep racial undercurrents in the country .
The target today is health care ; tomorrow another issue .
Obama ’s stance , articulated during the presidential debates where he said he considered health care “ a right not a privilege ” , put him on a collision course with the insurance industry and their hired hands in Congress .
The conservatives reject the French , British and other European models where health care is provided by the government directly or the insurance industry is highly regulated like a public utility .
Hatred for government programs that actually help the common citizen is fundamental to their free - market philosophy .
Sixty years and still waiting
It ’s not new .
In the 1940s the same forces fought US President Harry Truman ’s call for national health care .
In the 1960s President Ronald Reagan , the hero of the conservative movement , led the charge against “ socialised medicine ” .
In a series of recordings , Reagan attacked a government - run health - care system for the elderly ( Medicare ) as being the sure - fired road to socialism .
Reagan and the Republican Party aggressively opposed the establishment of Medicare .
Every Republican voted against the bill that established the program .
The result ?
Thanks to Medicare most retirees have better health care than younger citizens who ca n’t afford high insurance premiums .
In fact , fewer than 10 % of Americans with Medicare coverage say they do n’t like it .
Not surprisingly , the right refuses to openly call for its elimination even as they attack universal health care .
The Veterans Administration ( VA ) is another successful government - run health program .
It provides a program that is superior to most private for - profit plans .
Yet it came under attack by President George W. Bush , who sought to gut the VA and shut hospitals .
This was only stopped by scandal when the public learned how veterans were not getting the treatment they expected .
The problems with Medicare and veterans ' care are mainly about money , as privatisation hawks seek to starve the programs to get the private sector back .
Both Medicare and the VA programs provide better health care than the private sector — and , significantly , equal care to all racial and social groups .
With the profit motive taken away by the government , the service is more “ socialised ” .
The limitations of these programs are primarily due to Congressional attempts to underfund them , not administrative inefficiencies that are comparable to the private sector and much cheaper to taxpayers .
These two government programs could be the basis to build fair medical coverage and provide universal care .
Most importantly , they show how a government solution could begin to close the racial gap in the type of care provided to Blacks and Latinos .
Racial and class gap
A myth of the health - care system is that it may be broken , but treats African Americans and whites equally .
In reality Blacks and Latinos are nearly 50 % of the 48 million uninsured , and the least likely to be insured .
This racial gap is rooted in the history of institutional discrimination that the rise of the talented African - American middle class does not negate .
The problems of health care for African Americans are interlocked with race and class .
In a 2005 article entitled , “ The Consequences of Being Uninsured for African Americans ” , Gail C. Christopher , the former vice - president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies Office of Health , Women and Families and current vice - president for health at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation , wrote :
National surveys have consistently confirmed the simple and primary reason why people are uninsured — they cannot afford to purchase health insurance if their employers do n’t offer and pay for health insurance .
Compared to white Americans , studies show that African Americans are less likely to work in jobs that make health insurance available , they are less likely to be offered health insurance , and they are less likely to take it when offered .
Just 53 % of African Americans get insurance through work as compared to 72 % of white Americans ....
African Americans constitute 12 % of the overall population but 16 % of the uninsured .
53 % of African Americans earn less than 200 % FPL [ Federal Poverty Level ] as compared with 25 % of white Americans .
20 % of African Americans are uninsured compared to 12 % of white Americans ; [ and ] 24 % of African Americans are covered by public insurance ( Medicaid ) as compared with 16 % of white Americans .
The situation is even more pronounced today in the deepest recession since the 1930s .
African - American official unemployment rate is twice that of whites .
“ Of the estimated 48 million American adults who spent any time uninsured in the past year , 67 percent were families where at least one person was working full time ” , according to the Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey in its 2006 report .
Further , “ Two of five ( 41.1 % ) working age Americans with incomes between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 a year were uninsured for at least part of the past year . ”
“ African Americans ” , adds Christopher , “ have higher incidence of chronic disease such as diabetes , high blood pressure , and obesity ; health status outcomes will reflect constrained access to healthcare services .
For example , heart disease mortality rates for nonelderly adults are twice as high for African Americans as for white Americans .
The infant mortality rate for African Americans — 15 % in high school and 14 % post - high school — is almost one - third higher than the next ethnic group and more than twice as high as for white Americans . ”
Even when they can pay for medical coverage and the high insurance premiums , African Americans and Latinos can be excluded if afflicted with diabetes , high blood pressure and other diseases because of the “ pre-existing condition ” clause in all health insurance polices .
There is no such thing as a safe job or career with paid health insurance for life , as auto workers have recently learned .
An aging unemployed worker with a pre-existing condition simply can’t purchase affordable health care .
How to win
The fight to win health care for all against the big insurers , pharmaceuticals and the American Medical Association lobbyists requires mass public pressure .
What 's missing are street mobilisations in Washington DC and across the country to take on the anti-reform right .
Reliance on friendly politicians has never worked .
Tweaks to the health insurance industry may help a few , but will not provide millions of uninsured and under insured Americans the urgent and preventive health care they need .
African Americans and Latinos — already worse off — will continue to receive inferior care with the resultant premature deaths from preventable diseases and treatable illnesses .
While President Obama ’s moderate “ public option ” plan may be better than what exists , the status quo alliance will oppose any changes to the system that takes away control from the private insurance companies .
The disagreement between Obama and the conservatives , including the self - named “ Blue Dog ” Democrats , is a diversion from the real debate the country needs : how to solve the discriminatory treatment of Blacks and Latinos and achieve universal health care for all Americans .
A key lesson of history is that universal health care will not be won by waiting for Obama or Congress .
Lyndon B. Johnson did n’t create Medicare in the 1960s ; it came as a by - product of the social upheavals led by the civil rights movement , which also won historic civil rights and voting rights legislation .
Unless a new mass movement is built to win universal health care , true reform is impossible .
Extra -parliamentary action is what ’s needed to break the status quo and impose change on the system .
We can't be bothered to walk up a few flights of stairs , balk at the idea of running to catch a bus and would rather snooze than have sex with our partners , according to a report published today .
Despite a huge government push to encourage healthy living , Britons are lazier than ever , concludes the study conducted by Nuffield Health , a not for profit health organisation .
One in six people would rather watch a TV programme they did n't like than leave the sofa to change the channel if their remote control was broken .
A third ( 36 % ) of the 2,000 adults surveyed for the study said they would not run to catch a bus and more than half ( 59 % ) would not walk up two flights of stairs to reach their office , choosing instead to take the lift .
More than half of dog owners ( 52 % ) did not walk their dogs , and two - thirds ( 64 % ) of parents admit to always being too tired to play with their children .
The laziness epidemic appears to have spread to the bedroom , with almost three - quarters ( 73 % ) of couples saying they regularly do not have enough energy at the end of the day to have sex , with more than half ( 58 % ) blaming a lack of fitness .
Glasgow is the laziest city in the UK , with 75 % of people admitting they do n't get enough exercise , followed by Birmingham and Southampton in joint second place with 67 % ; Bristol is in third with 64 % , and London in fourth .
Bristol , Leeds , Newcastle , Norwich , Manchester and Cardiff make up the rest of the top 10 .
It appears Britons are paying little heed to the government 's Change4 Life campaign – which encourages people to " eat well , move more , live longer " – but may be motivated by more superficial concerns .
Almost a third ( 28 % ) of respondents would be prepared to exercise more if they felt it would make them more attractive .
A whole generation is in danger of becoming too unfit to perform rudimentary tasks , said Dr Sarah Dauncey , medical director of Nuffield Health .
" Ready meals , remote controls and even internet shopping are all contributing to a dangerously lazy and idle Britain .
The nation has fallen into a vicious circle of laziness that we must stop , " she said .
SPIRIT OF THE KING ELVIS SHOW IN WORCESTER
Towards a Richer GUI : The TabControl , Splitter & the PictureBox
IronPython & Windows Forms , Part XI
Note
This is part of a series of tutorials on using IronPython with Windows Forms .
Introduction
In this tutorial series so far we have covered some basic controls and background issues like setting attributes and GUI layout .
In this article we 'll be looking at a few more sophisticated controls .
Like much of the Windows Forms API , this can be done with remarkably little and clear code .
It almost feels Pythonic .
Unlike normal Python programming style , the dotnet convention is to create controls with an empty constructor and then set properties on the control .
Boiler Plate
Like previous entries we 're going to need some boilerplate to create the form and start the application loop .
To refresh your memory we 'll start with the boilerplate : import clr
clr .
AddReference ( ' System. Windows .
Forms ' )
from System .
Windows .
Forms import Application , Form
class MainForm ( Form ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
Form .
__init__ ( self )
self .
Show ( )
Application .
EnableVisualStyles ( )
form = MainForm ( )
Application .
Run ( form )
All this does is create and show a form .
The PictureBox
In order to illustrate the TabControl we 'll display images in different tabs .
To do this we 'll use the PictureBox Class .
We 'll need the PictureBoxSizeMode Enumeration , this tells the PictureBox how to position the image .
In order to provide the image , we 'll need the Image Class and its FromFile method .
The Image class lives in the System .
Drawing assembly .
The bare code will look something like : import clr
clr .
AddReference ( ' System. Windows .
Forms ' )
clr .
AddReference ( ' System .
Drawing ' )
from System .
Windows .
Forms import PictureBox , PictureBoxSizeMode
from System .
Drawing import Image
image = Image .
FromFile ( pathToFile )
pictureBox = PictureBox ( )
pictureBox .
SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode .
StretchImage
pictureBox .
Image = image We 'll be using DockStyle .
Fill to make the picturebox fill its parent control .
This makes the full code : import clr
clr .
AddReference ( ' System. Windows .
Forms ' )
clr .
AddReference ( ' System .
Drawing ' )
from System .
Windows .
Forms import (
Application , DockStyle , Form , PictureBox , PictureBoxSizeMode
)
from System .
Drawing import Image
pathToFile = ' images/greenlake.jpg '
class MainForm ( Form ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
Form .
__init__ ( self )
image = Image .
FromFile ( pathToFile )
pictureBox = PictureBox ( )
pictureBox .
SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode .
StretchImage
pictureBox .
Image = image
pictureBox .
Dock = DockStyle .
Fill
self .
Controls .
Add ( pictureBox )
self .
Show ( )
Application .
EnableVisualStyles ( )
form = MainForm ( )
Application .
Run ( form )
Using the greenlake image , this results in : Because we set DockStyle .
Fill and PictureBoxSizeMode .
StretchImage resizing is handled automatically .
The TabControl TabControls allow you to reduce the complexity of GUIs by dividing it into several pages that can be selected by clicking on the tabs .
The TabControl is the container into which you place multiple TabPages .
The TabPage itself is an empty container control into which you can place more GUI components .
The order of the tab pages in the TabControl .
TabPages collection reflects the order of tabs in the TabControl control .
To change the order of tabs in the control , you must change their positions in the collection by removing them and inserting them at new indexes .
The tabs are part of the TabControl , but you set the text on them by setting the Text property on the TabPage .
The TabPages property is a TabPageCollection which has such useful methods as Add , Clear , Remove and Insert .
You set the location of the tabs using the Alignment Property on the TabControl and the TabAlignment enumeration .
Assuming we have already initialised a PictureBox , the code to create a TabControl and add a TabPage containing the image looks like this : tabControl = TabControl ( )
tabControl .
Dock = DockStyle .
Fill
tabControl .
Alignment = TabAlignment .
Bottom
tabPage = TabPage ( )
tabPage .
Text = ' SomeImage '
tabPage .
Controls .
Add ( pictureBox )
tabControl .
TabPages .
Add ( tabPage )
The SplitContainer The SplitContainer is another control which , when used in the right place , can greatly augment an HCI .
A splitter divides an area of a GUI into two parts , with a draggable bar that divides them .
It can be a vertical bar or a horizontal bar depending on the Orientation you set ( Using the Orientation Enumeration ) .
You can set controls in the two panels it contains with the Panel1 and Panel2 properties .
We 'll spice up the GUI in our example by having two tabcontrols dividedby the split container .
If we setup a method called setupPanel to add a TabControl to a panel , then setting up a splitter is very simple : self .
image1 = Image .
FromFile ( pathToFile1 )
self .
image2 = Image .
FromFile ( pathToFile2 )
splitter = SplitContainer ( )
splitter .
Orientation = Orientation .
Vertical
splitter .
Dock = DockStyle .
Fill
self .
setupPanel ( splitter .
Panel1 , self . image1 )
self .
setupPanel ( splitter .
Panel2 , self . image2 )
self .
Controls .
Add ( splitter )
Like any other control , we can handle events on the SplitContainer .
Lets add some fun by changing the orientation of the splitter on a double click .
The event we need is DoubleClick .
In case you 've forgotten how to use dot net events from IronPython , we define a function or method which takes sender and event arguments .
We then add in place ( += ) it to the event on the control .
The sender is the control that caused the event .
def SwapOrientation ( sender , event ) :
if sender .
Orientation == Orientation .
Vertical :
sender .
Orientation = Orientation .
Horizontal
else :
sender .
Orientation = Orientation .
Vertical
splitter .
DoubleClick += SwapOrientation
The last meeting between these two teams ( November 27th , 2005 ) was played at the Meadowlands , where the Saints secured a rare road win , improving to 3 - 9 on the season .
The Jets loss was their sixth straight of the season – falling to 2 - 9 .
Aaron Brooks threw three touchdown passes securing the Saints win 21 - 19 , breaking the teams six game losing streak .
The win by the Saints would be their last that season as they continued to struggle losing the next four games , ending the season at 3 - 13 .
This of course set in motion the Brees and Payton era that we all enjoy now .
The Saints would bounce back strong the next season reaching the NFC championship game .
Next Meeting : Sunday , October 4th , 2009
Location : Louisiana Superdome
Series Leader : The Saints evened the series against the Jets in their last meeting , bringing the all time series to 5 - 10 .
Offensive Keys To Success :
The Jets defense was no slouch last season , but the addition of Rex Ryan as head coach can only make them better .
They ranked a pedestrian 29th against the pass , allowing 235 yards a game .
On the flip side they were solid against the run ranking 7th , allowing only 95 yards a game .
See where I am going with this ?
The Saints need to let their best player do what he does best , throw the football .
Payton needs to let Brees throw the ball early and often .
The Jets have made no real improvement in the secondary so Brees should have a monster day .
Although Rex Ryan may have a few tricks up his sleeve .
Defensive Keys To Success :
Gregg Williams will need to rally the troops against the Jets.
New York has a trio of talented runners in Thomas Jones , Leon Washington , and rookie Shonn Greene .
The Saints must find way to keep these runners in check and stop the run .
The Jets are going to try to run the ball straight down their throats .
It looks like the Jets coveted first round pick , Mark Sanchez , may be the signal caller going into this game .
Sanchez is a talent for sure , but one I think the Saints new secondary can handle .
Williams hybrid defensive scheme should dial up enough pressure to keep the young quarterback guessing .
Game Stats From Last Meeting : Stats
Prediction : The Saints played lights out last season at the Dome and I figure they can secure the win against the Jets there .
I wo n’t say what I think the score will be , I want you Saints fans out there to tell me .

By the Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation
May 5 , 2009 --
The fledgling republic of Nepal seems to be standing on the verge of a new phase of civil war .
Chief of Army Staff ( CoAS ) Rookmangud Katawal had been asked by the civilian government to explain why he had continued military recruitment despite the government 's halt order and reinstated eight brigadier - generals who had been retired by the defence ministry .
Backed by its foreign patrons and right - wing parties in the country , the military high command openly defied the authority of the elected government .
The government responded by removing General Katawal , who refused to accept this and the government ’s decision was then illegally overturned by President Ram Baran Yadav , of Nepalese Congress party .
With its coalition partners in government refusing to support the United Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) [ UCPN ( M ) ] , Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ( Prachanda ) announced that he had no choice but to resign .
Both New Delhi and Washington had been mounting a strong pressure on the sovereign Nepali government not to remove their trusted CoAS , who was doggedly resisting the integration of the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) with the national army as agreed in the peace accord .
Senior Maoist leader and Finance Minister Baburam Bhattarai was perfectly right in his sarcastic comment that , " The so - called democratic forces specially headed by the so - called democrats in New Delhi have been dictating their patrons in Kathmandu to side with the army and fight against the democratic forces " .
We denounce in strongest possible terms the brazen foreign intervention and demand that it must be stopped immediately and for good .
We believe the abolition of the monarchy requires not just the removal of the King but a thorough restructuring of all organs of the state including the army , judiciary and bureaucracy .
In this context we consider it very unfortunate that the UCPN ( M ) and the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) [ CPN ( UML ) ] could not arrive at an understanding on sacking the most powerful remnant of the monarchial order .
Only a firm political unity of the main left forces on such matters could provide a solid core around which the required consensus in the coalition government could be built up .
As things stand now , the fragile consensus has broken down and the apparent process of a peaceful transition to People 's Power has proved deceptive .
From a Marxist viewpoint this was not unexpected and we are confident that , led by the communists of Nepal , the brave people will once again rise to the occasion and overcome all obstacles to carry the democratic revolution through to the end .
Meanwhile , progressive and left organisations around the world have condemned the Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav ’s actions and foreign intervention while noting that the Nepalese army is infamous for its human rights abuses , including murder , torture and rape and has a history of coups against civilian governments .
The top ranks of the army recently admitted to planning a fresh coup against the current elected government !
These organisations have demanded upholding of the peace accord and democracy for which the majority of the Nepalese people and poor people in particular had voted for the CPN ( M ) .
The Democratic Socialist Perspective ( from Australia ) has said in a statement posted on its website –" The removal of the Maoists from government is nothing less than a coup .
It reveals the real situation in Nepal — that despite its democratic mandate for change , the Maoist - led government is being prevented by the old elite from implementing such change . "
It further stated that the " … military high command , backed by right - wing parties tied to the country ’s elite , has openly defied the authority of the elected civilian government , led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist " and " the UCPN - M ’s proposals for a peaceful and democratic pro-poor transformation of Nepal that were endorsed at the ballot box have been frustrated by opposition within the parliament , the state and even the coalition government . "
There is nothing more terrifying to the ruling classes globally than the sight of a people winning power .
The right - wing forces in Nepal are counting on the support of foreign powers , especially the United States and the right - wing forces in India .
The Progressive Nepali Forum in Americas ( PNEFA ) has urged the Supreme Court to nullify the President Yadav ’s unconstitutional action and restore civilian supremacy .

Short on luck : Meet Koda the miniature horse ... who was also born a dwarf
He is so tiny , visitors often assume he 's a stuffed toy .
Standing at 59 cm tall , if Koda the horse wants an equal he has to turn to the vetinary cat for company .
The ' American miniature ' horse - who suffers the double - whammy of being born a dwarf - has had a bout of health problems caused by his size , but he is now recovering and enjoying the life of a pampered pet .
Koda is so small that he is often mistaken for a battery - operated soft toy
With a neigh and a meow : Koda , the tiny American Miniature horse , takes a stroll with someone his own size - in this case the Yarrambat Veterinary Hospital 's cat
The cheeky ' American miniature ' horse was always meant to be small but at birth vets soon realised he was dinky even for his breed .
' He was no bigger than a cat , ' said his vet Andy Lynch .
' He was diagnosed as a dwarf soon after birth . '
Koda 's condition is rare and Lynch is amazed that he 's still alive and kicking at 13 - months - old despite a torrent of health problems .
Brave Koda has had lots of surgery to correct his stumpy , buckled legs but that has n't helped his peculiar face .
His lower jaw juts out and he has bulging eyes , upturned nostrils and a wrinkled nose .
' He had a punky look , a fuzzy forelock and his mane stuck up like a mohawk , ' Dr Lynch said .
Koda comes up to Rocky the horse 's knees
After the surgeries Koda looks set to live a long and fruitful life
Koda 's poor health prognosis left Dr Lynch with little doubt he should be put down .
But veterinary nurse Karen Stephenson , 23 , was astounded by the resilience and spirit of the pint - sized pony .
' I 'd never seen a miniature horse and I just thought him amazing , ' she said .
' I fell in love with him as soon as I saw him and thought he deserved a go at some good quality life , so I took him on . '
Dr Lynch has performed about £ 5,000 worth of leg surgery on Koda , but his total vet 's bill is expected to top £ 15,000 .
The next step is extensive dentistry to remove protruding adult teeth that wo n't fit in his little mouth .
He has recovered well from every operation so far .
' He 's very brave and takes his medicine like a little man , ' said Dr Lynch .

A masked gunman slipped into a community center for gay teenagers in Tel Aviv and sprayed the room with automatic rifle fire late Saturday , killing two people and wounding at least 10 in what activists called Israel ’s deadliest crime against homosexuals .
Police set up roadblocks in central Tel Aviv and launched a citywide search for the assailant , who fled on foot .
Witnesses said the gunman was dressed in black and apparently acted alone .
Police said the motive was unclear .
The crime shook the freewheeling coastal city , which has a reputation as a relatively tolerant place for gay people , and focused criticism on Israel ’s ultra-Orthodox religious community for calling homosexuality an “ abomination . ”
Or Gil , a 16 - year - old who was wounded in the attack , told the newspaper Haaretz from his hospital bed that the gunman appeared quietly in the small basement room about 10:40 p.m. during a weekly gathering of teens .
They were listening to music and sharing experiences with discrimination .
Advertisement
“ I thought it was a joke at first , but he immediately opened fire , ” Haaretz ’s website quoted Gil as saying .
“ People took cover under the bed and tables , but there were no screams .
It ’s a small place .
. . .
Once you ’re inside there ’s nowhere to run . ”
The wounded struggled or were carried up a staircase to the street .
“ We saw a woman running toward us covered in blood , ” Adi Shimoni , a patron at a nearby cafe , told Israel ’s Channel 10 television .
“ We saw the gunman flee .
He was wearing what looked like a ski mask . ”
Shimoni said he rushed into the center and saw “ many wounded and a lot of blood . ”
Advertisement
Authorities identified the dead as a 24 - year - old male counselor and a 17 - year - old girl .
Two of the wounded were listed in critical condition early today .
Tel Aviv Police Chief Shahar Ayalon said there had been no recent threat against the 15 - year - old center or its patron , the Tel Aviv Gay and Lesbian Assn .
He said it was unclear whether the shooting was a hate crime , adding that “ all avenues of investigation are open . ”
Israel ’s internal security minister , Yitzhak Aharonovitch , said he believed the attack may have had a “ homophobic ” motive .
He said police have stepped up security around other potential targets associated with the gay community .
Despite officials ’ uncertainty about the motive , gay activists said they had no doubt their community was targeted .

“ This is undoubtedly the worst incident aimed at the gay community in Israel , ” said Nitzan Horowitz , the only openly gay member of Israel ’s 120 - member parliament .
“ It has the characteristics of a hate crime , of someone who attacked to blindly strike out at every person on the spot . ”
Gay community members converged on the site with placards and candles early today for a spontaneous rally .
Many demonstrators accused Shas , the ultra-Orthodox religious party , of inciting the killings .
Ultra-Orthodox Jews , who wear black religious garb , have inveighed against gays and Shas has worked in parliament to limit their legal rights .
“ Their blood is on your hands , ” one placard read .
Shas ’ parliamentary delegation issued a statement calling for the attacker to be found and put on trial .
“ Murder is , of course , against the Torah ’s path and every attack is a contravention of the religion of Israel , ” it said .

Gay life in Israel has tentatively emerged from underground over the last two decades .
The Jewish religious establishment frowns on open displays of homosexuality , and gay groups have fought to gain acceptance .
Although same - sex marriage is forbidden in Israel , the courts have ordered the government to recognize such unions performed abroad .
Like nearly every Israeli Jew , gay men and lesbians are drafted into the army and given an opportunity to advance up the ranks .
Violent attacks on homosexuals in Israel have been scattered , relatively rare and often punished .
In 2005 an ultra-Orthodox Jew was convicted of stabbing three marchers in Jerusalem ’s gay pride parade .
He was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
In Tel Aviv , gays have found a more tolerant atmosphere than in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities .
That , Israeli officials said , made Saturday ’s shooting all the more upsetting .

“ These teenagers came to this center to talk to one another and receive help , ” said Yaniv Weisman , chairman of the Israeli Gay Youth Organization .
“ This was supposed to be a safe place for them . ”

It it widely known that in June the treasury made accounting changes to its Treasury Auction process that likely boosted the amount of indirect bidders ( considered a proxy for foreign interest ) .
From a Reuters article :
" The Treasury 's changes , contained in a June 1 entry to the Federal Register , relate to what it considers a " guaranteed bid . "
Under the previous arrangement , once a primary dealer offered securities at a pre-specified level to its customer , that bid was considered to be the dealer 's own .
The matter was technical enough to confuse even industry veterans .
" We are not precisely sure what this all means , " said Ward McCarthy , managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton , New Jersey .
" We spoke with some very seasoned market players with decades of experience on dealer trading floors who were similarly unsure what to make of the contents of the Federal Register .
...
The Treasury was not immediately available for comment . "
-----------
Cue to the sale of 5 year treasuries on July 29 :
Bloomberg : " Indirect bidders bought 36.7 percent of the five - year notes , down from 62.8 percent of the securities at the June sale , the highest since December 2004 . "
----------
So ... after a magical and massive increase in ' indirect bidders ' in June ( which qualmed market fears that foreign interest was waning ) , we go back to " normal " levels of ~ 35 % ...
Unfortunately , thanks to the accounting obfuscation we have come to rely upon from our friends at the Fed & Treasury & Co. , the already elusive ' foreign interest ' is further enshrouded in mystery .
We do n't really know if foreign interest is up , down or stagnant from its level one year ago .
We do know , however , that experts widely attributed the massive increase in ' indirect bidders ' in June largely to the accounting manipulation change and not likely due to vastly increased foreign interest .
So , ceteris parabis , could we not at least hypothesize that the fall from 62.8 % to 36.7 % in indirect bidders represents quite a significant fall in foreign interest ?
Oh what am I saying , I 'm sure my fears are irrational and unfounded .
Our Dear Leaders ( Fed & Treasury ) have already proven themselves to be bastions of accounting consistency .
True believers in ' tellin ' it like it is .'
I mean , it 's not like the Fed abused hedonic adjustments and geometric averaging to downwardly adjust the CPI to rationalize the government 's desire to pay out less for social security .
Or conveniently neglects millions of people in unemployment statistics .
Or uses dollar swaps and liquidity programs to fudge the dollar 's exchange rate .
Okay , nevermind .

SAN FRANCISCO --
Americans continue to pull away from organized religion , but the rate of departure previously reported may not have been as abrupt as originally thought , according to research to be presented at the 104th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association .
Sociologists Michael Hout and Claude S. Fischer of the University of California , Berkeley , find that the previous estimate of a doubling during the 1990s of the proportion of Americans with no religion probably started earlier than 1991 and doubled over a 14 - or 15 - year period .
New data suggest that the trend continued through 2008 , likely fueled at least partially by the growing number of Americans who were raised with no religion .
The current investigation revisits the researchers ' April 2002 American Sociological Review article , " Why More Americans Have No Religious Preference : Politics and Generations , " using data from the General Social Survey fielded between 1973 and 2008 .
The General Social Survey is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center and funded by the National Science Foundation .
According to the new data , 93 percent of Americans believe in God ; a figure unchanged since 1988 .
The group that increased was the group Hout and Fischer call " unchurched believers , " those people who believe in God but report no religion .
" If you think of organized religion as having two parts -- the organized part and the religious part -- the church - leavers ' quarrel is with the organized part , " said Michael Hout , professor of sociology at the University of California , Berkeley , and the lead author of the study .
As originally reported in 2002 , Hout and Fischer assert that politics continue to play a role in the increase in those reporting no religion preference .
The sociologists note a parallel between the rising rates of non-religious Americans and the number of mentions of the " religious right " in press coverage in the past nearly four decades .
Political liberals and moderates are much less likely to report a religion now than in 1988 ; almost all political conservatives identify with a church now as they did twenty years ago .
" Invoking religion to promote a conservative social agenda may energize conservative members , but it alienates political moderates and liberals , " Hout said .
" The result has been a significant decrease in the fraction of American adults identifying with an organized religion . "
Americans expressed stronger anti-religious feelings in 2008 than in 1998 .
For example , two - thirds of adults agreed that " religion brings more conflict than peace " in 2008 compared with just one - third in 1998 .
Similarly more Americans described themselves as " non-religious " in 2008 than in 1998 .
Among the rising number of Americans who cite no religious preference , those who believe in either God or the afterlife outnumber those with no beliefs .
In addition , the number of religiously affiliated non-believers declined sharply between 1973 and 2008 .
###
Hout and Fischer will present the research , " The Politics of Religious Identity in the United States , 1974 - 2008 , " on Sunday , Aug. 9 , at 8:30 a.m. PDT , in the Hilton San Francisco at the American Sociological Association 's 104th annual meeting .

About the American Sociological Association
The American Sociological Association ( www.asanet.org), founded in 1905 , is a non-profit membership association dedicated to serving sociologists in their work , advancing sociology as a science and profession , and promoting the contributions to and use of sociology by society .
If you ’ve ever been curious exactly how America produces the cheapest and “ safest ” food on the planet , but not quite believed all the hype that fuels the empty advertising slogans on your television , then Food , Inc. promises to be the film that explains why there ’s a serious disconnect between food propaganda and reality .
In exactly 93 minutes , director Robert Kenner manages to slice down to the bone the many myths of the U.S. food system in a riveting documentary that exposes how a handful of corporations determine what our nation ’s children eat and how America ’s addiction to cheaper , faster , and larger portions has managed to shorten the average lifespan of the next generation for the first time since the Black Plague .
Helping Kenner make his point are leading food journalists Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan , who take us on a tour of how food is really produced in America and not the sanitized , red barn , picket fence logos that have become ubiquitous in today ’s grocery stores .
Unfortunately , the way food is grown , slaughtered and processed today owes more to mechanized practices honed during the industrial revolution and the audience quickly learns that the corporate food industry is desperate to keep the American public in the dark about their unsavory practices .

“ There is this deliberate veil , this curtain that ’s drawn between us and where our food is coming from .
The industry does n’t want you to know the truth about what you ’re eating because if you knew , you might not want to eat it , ” says Eric Schlosser , the bestselling author of Fast Food Nation who also co-produced the movie .
Instead of roaming freely out in green fields , as these animals have for thousands of years , today ’s cattle are confined to giant feedlots while chickens , turkeys and hogs are crammed into factory farms , where disease and antibiotic resistant bacteria rage through the system of industrial animal confinements .
The High Cost of Cheap Food
The film opens with a voiceover from Michael Pollan , whose books , The Omnivore ’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food have become foundational tomes for the growing food movement .
Pollan calmly leads viewers down the aisles of an immaculate grocery store , rattling off facts about America ’s food system that are greatly at odds with the pristine image that U.S. food companies are anxious for American consumers to swallow .
“ The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000 , ” Pollan says , brilliantly painting the picture of today ’s food marketing schemes , which Pollan calls a “ pastoral fantasy . ”
“ There are no seasons in the American supermarket .
Now there are tomatoes all year around .
Grown halfway around the world .
Picked when it was green and ripened with ethylene gas , ” says Pollan .
For those unsure what exactly is wrong with that reality , the rest of the film succinctly explains the high cost that the cheapest food system in the world has had in wrecking havoc on human health , the nutritional quality of food , the livelihoods of family farmers , the safety of farm workers , rural communities and the environment .
While this has all been covered vividly before by both Pollan and Schlosser , Kenner manages to condense exactly what is wrong with the American food system in just the amount of time it takes the average American to gobble up a giant tub of artery choking buttered popcorn and slurp down a vat of the nation ’s favorite soda , chock full of high fructose corn syrup , a cheap commodity sweetener which has been indicated as a leading cause of America ’s obesity epidemic and the rise of type II diabetes .
The industrialization of the American food system takes the stage as the leading villain in Food Inc. , which shines a bright light on the handful of corporations , Smithfield , Tyson , Cargill , ADM and Monsanto , that have centralized all segments of production , fulfilling the winner takes all mantra of 20th century capitalism .
The direct consequences of the intersection of the corporate , financial and political power of America ’s food system are demonstrated through the heartbreaking stories of a woman whose 2 - year - old son died from eating a contaminated burger , a low - income Hispanic family that have to pass up eating vegetables because they can only afford to eat fast food and a Maryland chicken farmer who is forced out of farming because she could no longer afford to be tied to a system that treats farmers like serfs while all the profits funnel up to multinational corporate agribusinesses .
Unfortunately , these stories are not uncommon , happening every day across America .
For those looking for the brighter side of the food story , Food Inc. shows Gary Hirshberg , who started Stonyfield Farms with 7 cows in the early 80s , and now brings organics to the masses by partnering with Wal - Mart , the largest seller of groceries in America .
In stark contrast to Hirschberg ’s warm embrace of mega corporations , is Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms , the grass - based Virginia farmer of Omnivore ’s Dilemma fame .
While Hirschberg brings Wal - Mart executives on a tour of one of Stonyfield ’s small dairy farms , Salatin shows visitors the synergy of his small - scale sustainable farm based on a pasture rotation system , which mimics nature ’s patterns rather than rely on the petrochemicals of industrial agriculture .
Overall , there ’s something in this movie for everyone , from the beginner and the policy wonk , to learn exactly how the food on their plate gets there and why the current system is badly in need of reform .
Fortunately for viewers , Kenner did his homework .
Food Inc. is another nail in the coffin for industrial ag , which is now continually on the run as their bad practices are finally catching up to them .
If you only see one film this year , Food , Inc. is that movie .
In many ways , it can be seen as the antidote to America ’s obesity epidemic .
So drop that burger and fries and get to the theater !
Starts in select theaters June 12th , check here for more details .
-- Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer , writing in dissent
SEIU Gets Threatening Phone Call : “ You ’re Gonna Come Up Against The Second Amendment ”
An official with SEIU , which has been sending members to town halls to counterbalance the Tea Party brigade , sends over this audio of a phone call the union received on its central voicemail system , threatening to teach union officials a thing or two about “ the Second Amendment ” …
The call seems to refer to reports today to scuffles in St. Louis between SEIU members and town hall rowdies .
“ I suggest you tell your people to calm down , act like American citizens , and stop trying to repress people ’s First Amendment rights , ” the caller says .
“ That , or you all are gonna come up against the Second Amendment . ”
More in a bit .
Update : Brian Beutler reports that an anti-health care reform organizer is explicitly calling on the troops to “ carry ” and if SEIU members get disruptive , to “ hurt them . ”
For all those years the Supreme Court was smart enough to steer clear of a definition of just what right " to keep and bear arms " the Second Amendment refers to .
( Never mind that blather about " a well - regulated militia . "
We wanna go bang ! )
Then in blundered the Mad - Dog Activist Justices , surely less qualified to venture into such tricky territory than any incarnation of the Court in modern history , and laid the foundation for the violent thuggery now being threatened by the lunatics of the Insane Right .
As yesterday on The Plum Line : Now what 's really creepy here is the way the New Armed Legions of the Far , Far Right have literally everything upside down : who 's suppressing free speech , who 's fomenting revolution , who the Nazis are ( there 's nothing being done by the American Right , either politically or tactically , that was n't developed and perfected by the Nazis , allowing for the advances in technology that today 's fascists loons can avail themselves of ) , who 's not only threatening but beginning to commit violence .
Diane , from the clip , is 100 percent wrong in every diseased word she utters .
She of course is the one threatening murder on behalf of the cadres of violent right - wing sociopaths who hate everything this country stands for and are prepared to use any means available to them to institute the fascists dictatorship they lust for .
I think it 's safe to guess that on the issues Diane imagines worth descending into an orgy of violence over , she is 100 percent misinformed .
Susan died tonight ( August 5 ) at 7:25 pm .
It was a hard , long day , and Susan fought right to the end , for much longer than anyone would have thought she could .
My mom , my sisters Kellene and Jodi , and my Brother - in - Law Rocky were all here to support my family as Susan passed away .
I ’ll have more to say soon , but consider this .
Susan inspired me to expand the focus of my blog from nothing but bike - related jokes to a serious and pitched fight against cancer .
Then she inspired 500 + of you to join Team Fatty , the largest LiveStrong Challenge Team there has ever been .
And Team Fatty has raised close to more than $ 500,000 — a record amount .
Susan ’s part in the battle is over , but she did n’t lose .
She led the charge .
She showed the rest of us how to fight : with determination , focus , creativity , and outrageous endurance .
Now it ’s up to the rest of us to Fight Like Susan .
The World of Warcraft forums are buzzing with complaints from players claiming that their accounts have been suspended because of chargebacks filed against them by a company that they have no connection with .
The problem , though , is that the company behind the charges is unresponsive to complaints , and many players do n't know what to do in order to get their accounts re-authorized unless they pay these bills .
According to the thread , multiple players have received the following message when trying to figure out why their account is currently inaccessible : " Access to the World of Warcraft account ********* , has been temporarily disabled due to a chargeback filed against the account 's past payment (s ) which were billed to a telephone number via PaymentOne . "
PaymentOne is a payment service provider , and has a system in place to bill players ' ISP accounts for their WoW subscriptions .
Chargebacks are normally used as a method of consumer protection — a last line of defense against shady retailers .
Effectively , a consumer will dispute a charge on their debit / credit card statements and the issuing bank or credit card company will forcibly return the disputed funds to the person .
Exactly why and how these chargebacks were applied to the aforementioned accounts has yet to be determined , but they 've caused the accounts to have negative balances with Blizzard , which has led to their suspension until the issue is resolved .
The main problem with this claim , though , is that many of the players have never used PaymentOne or signed up for the company 's services ; some others have , but most of their accounts with PaymentOne were used over a year ago and were canceled a while ago .
Posts in the forum thread show that Blizzard is willing to discuss the unauthorized charges , but there have n't been any definite results from pursuing this course of action yet .
Even stranger , though , is multiple posts stating that users have contacted their phone companies / broadband providers and are told that they have no chargebacks on their account .
A quick Google search shows this is n't the first time that allegations of fraud and unexpected charges have been leveled against the company .
Another major frustration is that PaymentOne seems unwilling to help players reach a solution that does n't involve simply paying these unathorized charges .
Posts on the thread state that they 've either been hung up on when they call the company or are transferred back to Blizzard .
Two calls to PaymentOne seeking a comment resulted in being placed on permahold and then being disconnected .

Sheila Bair has moved with impressive alacrity to shutter failed small and medium - sized banks .
But she is still held hostage by the too - big - to - fail four .
Over the last eight days , her agency has been particularly busy , handling the two largest bank failures of the year .
Last Friday it was Colonial Bank , today it will be Guaranty Bank .
With $ 25 billion and $ 14 billion of assets respectively , Colonial and Guaranty are the sixth - and 10th - largest failures in the history of the FDIC .
Still , they pale in size compared to the biggest banks .
Bank of America Merrill Lynch , which had $ 2.3 trillion of assets at the end of the second quarter , is nearly 100 times larger than Colonial .
JPMorgan Chase , with $ 2.1 trillion , and Citigroup , with $ 1.8 trillion , are nearly as big .
Wells Fargo had $ 1.3 trillion , 100 times more than Guaranty .
These amounts do n’t include hundreds of billions of dollars of off - balance sheet assets .
Yet even Colonial and Guaranty are large enough to give the FDIC indigestion .
Its deposit insurance fund had just $ 13 billion as of March 31 .
The 56 failures since then will cost it an estimated $ 16 billion , including nearly $ 3 billion for Colonial .
( That amount excludes Guaranty – the FDIC should provide an estimate for those losses later today . )
It ’s an unsettling thought if you have money in a bank .
Officially , FDIC backs $ 4.8 trillion worth of deposits .
If you include “ temporarily ” insured deposits , the total is $ 6.3 trillion .
Yet the insurance fund protecting these deposits is going broke .
Soon , the FDIC may have to draw on its credit line at Treasury .
It ’s not surprising , given the sorry state of the Deposit Insurance Fund and the gargantuan heft of the big four , that FDIC is taking a bifurcated approach to bank resolutions .
Bair has moved decisively to close small and medium - sized banks .
With the monsters , she not only assisted in their bailouts — providing federal insurance for their debt even as she already insures their deposits — she also sponsored their continued growth — putting WaMu in the hands of JPMorgan and pushing Wachovia into the arms of Wells Fargo .
Not that she had much choice .
The biggest banks are far too big for her to resolve .
One way to measure this is deposits in failed banks as a percentage of GDP .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
In 1934 , the worst year for bank failures during the Depression , the total was 6.4 percent .
In 1989 , the most expensive year for the FDIC during the S&L scandal , it was 2.5 percent .
Last year , the figure was 1.6 percent .
But the 2008 figure excludes Citi , BofA and Wachovia , which properly should be dumped in the failure bucket .
Citi and BofA were goners without bailouts while Wachovia failed and fell into the arms of bailout recipient Wells Fargo .
When you include those three , deposits in failed banks jump to 15.7 percent of GDP for 2008 .
The FDIC , which was created to protect society from deposit runs , is no longer able to fulfill its mission because the biggest banks have grown far beyond its grasp .
That ’s why these banks need to be downsized dramatically .
A tax on assets is a good idea , but not enough .
To break them up , Washington should limit the deposits in any single bank to a threshold far below what the big four currently hold .
Upside down house
An installation of an upside down house in Trassenheide Germany was opened to the public two weeks ago and was designed by Polish partners Klaudiusz Golos and Sebastion Mikuciuk for the Edutainment exhibition company .
( Pics )
People who have visited the house reported feeling dizzy and disorientated .
An interesting alternative view of every day items and the designers did a great job with the interior .
Similar buildings have been designed upside down before but only from the exterior .

BACK in the autumn of last year , Ehud Olmert , then Israel 's fading prime minister , and Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinians ' more durable president , were astonishingly close to a peace deal .
Judging by an interview with Mr Olmert published in Newsweek in June , after he had given up his post , they appeared to have been only a whisker apart — though Mr Abbas has since called the gap “ wide ” .
But it is worth spelling out what Mr Olmert says he offered , in an account that other senior Palestinians have pretty much verified .
For it starkly shows what both sides need to do to clinch the deal — and how feasible it is .
According to the report , Mr Olmert offered the Palestinians nearly 94 % of the West Bank as the basis of their would - be state , plus land swaps of Israeli territory to make up the difference , amounting to nearly 6 % , plus a safe - passage road - corridor to link Gaza with the West Bank .
Mr Olmert is said to have also offered to internationalise the sovereignty of the “ holy basin ” of Jerusalem — principally , the Western ( “ Wailing ” )
Wall , which is sacred to Jews , and the al - Aqsa mosque ( the Dome on the Rock ) above it that is revered by Muslims .
The city of Jerusalem , by implication , would be shared as a capital of both states , with the Palestinian one on the east side , the Israeli one on the west .
Finally , perhaps most controversially , Mr Olmert says he offered to let a small number of Palestinians return to the lands in Israel from which they or their forebears had fled after the Jewish state was founded in 1948 .
That did not , says Mr Olmert , amount to a “ right of return ” .
The number who would go back to Israel was “ smaller than the number the Palestinians wanted ” .
Although Mr Abbas put a different slant on the offer , they were groping towards what some diplomats say might be a mutually acceptable formula : an acknowledgment of the Palestinians ' right of return that would largely be symbolic , rather than a passport for millions .
Elsewhere , a figure of 30,000 returning Palestinians has been informally mooted .
If drawing borders is the simplest problem and the mechanisms for sharing Jerusalem the most complex , the argument over the Palestinians ' right of return may well be the thorniest of all , because if huge numbers of Palestinians returned , Israel would no longer be a predominantly Jewish state .
A formula has been aired whereby the number could go up or down , year by year , in sync with Israel 's population .
Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel 's present prime minister , seems to want to be more rigid than Mr Olmert was , by insisting as a precondition for talks that the Palestinians drop their claim to a right of return and that they formally acknowledge Israel as a “ Jewish state ” .
But for the Palestinians this would pre-emptively destroy the hope even of a symbolic statement by Israel acknowledging the “ catastrophe ” ( nakba , in Arabic ) , as they term it , that befell them when Israel was created .
Moreover , the Palestinians fear that , if they gave in to Mr Netanyahu on this score , that might undermine the rights of Israel 's Arab citizens , who make up a fifth of Israel 's population .
Mr Abbas , who does not deny the nub of the account , felt unable to sign on , especially as Mr Olmert was already on his way out of government .
Besides , on the question of the map , which was perhaps the most dramatic of the various near - breakthroughs , Mr Olmert would not , he says , actually let him have a copy .
Moreover , the entire negotiation that followed the meeting at Annapolis in late 2007 , under the aegis of President George Bush , was “ poisoned ” , in the words of the chief Palestinian negotiator , by Israel 's refusal to stop building Jewish settlements in the West Bank .
Recently it was reported that the number of Israeli settlers there ( excluding the 190,000 Jews who now live in what used to be Arab East Jerusalem ) had surpassed 300,000 .
The figure has doubled in a dozen years .
The longer the Israelis continue to settle the West Bank , and to cut roads through it that can often be used by Israelis only , the harder it will be to create a workable Palestinian state on contiguous land rather than a series of cantons criss - crossed by Israeli roads connecting settlements .
Moreover , Israel 's security barrier already fences off more than 9 % of the West Bank , according to a recent UN report .
The longer the settlers have to dig in , the harder it will be to displace them under a final agreement .
Those toxic settlements
Hence Barack Obama 's concentration on squeezing Mr Netanyahu into stopping the settlements ' building and expansion , including what is known as “ natural growth ” to cater for burgeoning settler families .
In the past few weeks the Israeli leader has been trying to wriggle off Mr Obama 's hook , with suggestions of a moratorium ( of perhaps three to six months ) , with permission to finish buildings already under construction .
The Palestinians , however , still say they will not resume talks unless all settlement - building stops , as Mr Obama has demanded .
At least Mr Obama has persuaded Mr Netanyahu to concede the principle that the Palestinians should have a state of their own , something he had resolutely opposed in public .
However , since the Israeli prime minister spat out the words “ Palestinian state ” ( prefixed by “ demilitarised ” ) just once in a speech in mid-June , he has shown scant enthusiasm for bringing one into being .
A number of his close friends say there is no chance of it happening , anyway .
In a telling vignette in July , Benzion Netanyahu , the prime minister 's 100 - year - old father , a historian and leading ideologue of the Israeli “ Revisionist ” school that promotes the idea of a Greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river , confidently assured Israelis in a television interview that his son had set conditions for the Palestinians that he knew they could never accept .
By insisting that they recognise Israel as a Jewish state as a precondition for talks , Israel 's prime minister has already demanded more of the Palestinians than Mr Olmert did .
Mr Netanyahu has also gone on to declare that they must recognise Jerusalem as Israel 's undivided capital .
This contradicts the Palestinians ' passionate belief that the eastern ( and once overwhelmingly Arab ) part of the city would be their own state 's capital .
Indeed , on the question of stopping the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank , Mr Netanyahu 's government has insisted it will continue to sanction “ natural growth ” across the Israeli - occupied territory .
It will also encourage the continuing expansion of Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem .
This , in turn , makes life more irksome for Palestinians from that part of the city , because of the rigorous and intrusive Israeli controls they are subjected to .
All the same , even if Mr Netanyahu is bent on building settlements , he has been rattled by Mr Obama 's apparently equal determination to stop him .
It is the first time in nearly two decades that an American president has twisted Israel 's arm so hard .
It is possible that something close to a freeze will be agreed on with Mr Obama 's envoy , George Mitchell .
After Mr Netanyahu met him this week , he agreed to halt a building project in East Jerusalem .
If the Palestinians can be convinced that settlement - building has “ stopped ” ( Mr Obama 's word ) , peace talks may yet resume .
Who speaks for Palestine ?
Yet the Palestinians ' own divisions may well be deep enough to prevent progress .
For it is widely acknowledged , at least outside Israel , that no deal between Israelis and Palestinians will stick unless it is endorsed both by the Islamists of Hamas and by its secular rival , Fatah , the movement led by Yasser Arafat until his death in 2004 , when he was succeeded by Mr Abbas .
The two groups are at loggerheads , despite the efforts of Egypt and others to bring them together in a unity government .
This would , among other things , accept all prior agreements of the Palestine Liberation Organisation , the national umbrella movement , with Israel — including recognition of it ( see article ) .
In 2006 Hamas defeated Fatah in a general election , getting 44 % of the votes to 41 % , winning a large majority of seats in the Palestinians ' parliament .
But because Hamas refused to recognise Israel or disavow violence , its government was isolated by Israel , with the endorsement of America and a Quartet of countries and organisations , including the UN , the EU and Russia .
A year - and - a - half later , after a short - lived spell in coalition with Fatah , Hamas violently took over the Gaza Strip .
Complaining about the countless rockets that the Islamist group was firing into Israel , last December Mr Olmert 's outgoing government launched a fierce assault on Gaza , which left at least 1,200 Palestinians and a dozen Israelis dead .
But Hamas 's control over the territory has not wavered .
In the past few weeks , blood between the Palestinian rivals has been as bad as ever , with Hamas arresting scores of Fatah people in Gaza , while Fatah returned the compliment in the West Bank .
Each side is accused of torturing its prisoners .
Yet , as Mr Obama changes the mood and raises expectations , prominent Palestinians on both sides realise that only if they accommodate each other will they have a chance of getting a state for themselves .
Amid massive doubts , Fatah insists it is about to hold a party congress in Bethlehem , on the West Bank , to produce a more dynamic leadership ; it would be Fatah 's first such event in 20 years .
In January the Palestinians are due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections .
Pollsters , who have not always been accurate in their predictions of Palestinian voting , say Fatah should win .
A recent poll gave it 35 % to Hamas 's 19 % .
The Islamists may be even less popular in Gaza , where some blame them for the grievous suffering under Israel 's continuing blockade .
Mr Abbas might win the presidency against Hamas 's Gaza - based prime minister , Ismail Haniyeh .
But if Marwan Barghouti , a charismatic Fatah man now in an Israeli jail , could run , he would handily beat them both .
He would also have a better chance of conciliating Fatah and Hamas — and a better one of striking a deal with an Israeli government .
The two - state idea will not come to fruition , certainly not in the next few years , unless the Israeli government sincerely wants it to , and unless Palestinian leaders settle their own differences in the interests of their people .
Mr Mitchell knows this .
Mr Obama probably knows it too .
Mr Olmert , who came closer to a deal than anyone realised , was once a Greater Israel man .
Some say Mr Netanyahu may be persuaded to follow his predecessor down the same path .
Many Palestinians once believed that time was on their side and that Israel would one day disappear .
Now even Hamas seems to concede that Israel is there to stay .
Large majorities of Israelis and Palestinians now want two states , side by side .
It is still possible that one day they will get their way .
UPDATE
Is US Chief Information Officer ( CIO ) Vivek Kundra a Phony ?
This is the sort of question you might ask after trying to actually verify his supposed MS in Information Technology from the University of Maryland , College Park campus .
The registrar has no record of it .
After initially posting this article the degree has cropped up apparently at the nearby University Campus in 2001 .
This was found by Nextgov .
Com .
But his degree in biology has yet to appear as his record shows a degree from College Park Campus for Psychology and nothing more .
I have queried the White House for clarification and still have received no response .
The internet has answered the MS question .
But other issues remain .
Regarding a number of interesting and questionable facts , most in regard to Kundra ’s bio .
The most ridiculous is his assertion that he was formerly a CEO of Creostar .
While records for this company are hard to come by a small Dun & Bradstreet service did turn up the following information : there was indeed a Creostar in Arlington , VA .
It was founded in 2004 with the contact being Vivek Kundra .
The last record for the company ( online ) showed sales of $ 67,000 with one employee – apparently Kundra , the CEO .
Click to enlarge
In fact the only job that I could find within the various Kundra bios was that of a Sales Manager and / or a VP of Marketing at a software firm called Envincible .
It was sold in 2004 , the same time Kundra set up Creostar .
Envincible was a small security software company that sold to Exostar .
Note how Kundra used a similar name with Creostar .
Most revealing is a bio of Kundra that was redacted from the Washington , DC municipal site .
Luckily it was archived by the web sweeper Archive.org .
In that bio Kundra added even more icing to his University of Maryland career saying he “ served as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Maryland , teaching classes on emerging and disruptive technologies . ”
In a conversation he had with Om Malik he confirms having a teaching job at the University College .
I have not verified it , but it ’s probably true .
On that old bio he also said he “ was with SAIC , providing consulting services at the Health and Human Services ( HHS ) .
His work focused on growing SAIC ’s $ 1 billion business at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
Kundra has worked on the World Cities Alliance initiative to advance business and economic development in Arlington , Zurich , Paris , Berlin , and Wales .
Within the private sector , he worked with multiple clients to build operations in the United States , Canada , and India . ”
He finishes with “ He received his master ’s in information technology and his bachelor ’s in psychology and biology from the University of Maryland . ”
The biology bachelor ’s comes and goes from his bio , but the University has no record of his biology degree either .
I first suspected something was fishy about this fellow by listening to him on CSPAN where he simply did not sound like someone who studied computers or technology .
His common referrals to Twitter and Google Docs as some sort of high - tech breakthroughs and a way to save money and empower the public stemmed from pure cornball pop culture and the blogosphere , not from computer science or Information technology .
During one of his testimonies before a Congressional committee he even talked about the future being something like the Star Trek holodeck .
His clichés and commentary was that of a 18 year - old blogger who just got their first Macintosh .
And his sketchy background was disconcerting .
It included a 1997 bust for stealing shirts from JC Penny ’s and the later bust of his former staff by the FBI at the DC office during a bribery investigation .
But , to be honest about it , and despite the possible fraudulent bios and non-existent degrees , the kicker for me was that even if he was squeaky clean he has no business being the USA CIO controlling billions and billions of dollars in government contracts .
He has n’t done anything to warrant this appointment .
There are no great policy papers .
There are no books .
There is no invention .
There is nothing but vague tech positions in city and state governments .
How does this make him a “ techno - whiz ” as he was portrayed by the New York Times ?
It took him six years to get a simple undergrad degree in psychology !
Was it just because he uses Facebook and likes Twitter ?
So what have we got so far from this person ?
Well , for starters we are looking at the Recovery .gov website that will cost the taxpayers around $ 18 million .
This news was released recently .
What websites costs $ 18 million ?
And that ’s with no warrantee .
The incredibly popular Digg.com , one of the most advanced news gathering sites in the world was initially coded from scratch for between $ 1200 - 2500 according to one of its founders .
Tools to develop fancy websites have improved drastically over the years and now it costs less for fancy sites , not more .
So where is the $ 18 million going ?
I can assure you that people who pay attention bugged out their eyeballs at a website expense of $ 18 million .

The emergence of Kundra is something that needs more research .
There is some indication that Kundra got his jobs in Virginia after being recommended by Aneesh Chopra another professional bureaucrat in Virginia who was apparently his friend from campaign work .
On one blog there is a pic of Chopra and Kundra at a boxing match with Indian bigwig Shudkaer Shenoy .
The photo was taken in 2008 before either of the two men began with the Obama administration .
Since then Chopra was given the job as USA Chief Technology Office ( CTO ) .
It would be logical to assume that Kundra managed to get his buddy Chopra the CTO job despite the fact that Chopra ’s technology background is essentially nil .
According to the Chopra bio he ’s really never done much outside of government committee work .
His academic background shows a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard University ’s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997 .
He graduated with a B.A. from The Johns Hopkins University in 1994 .
There is virtually nothing about him anywhere on the net .
He has zero technology background except for perhaps using an iPOD , and he is now the country ’s Chief Technology Officer .
This seems to be a team of self promoters working together .
But exactly how they can be given these jobs along with responsibility for actual technology decisions that involve billions of US taxpayer dollars is incredible .
And if Kundra has indeed pumped up his bio with BS , then what does that say about the Obama administration in general .
After all , this guy was highly promoted by Obama himself .
But who is noticing ?
While the country is focused on health care protests and other distractions , this sort of betrayal of the public trust must be going on at many levels .
I just happened to spot this and with the help of some researchers , namely John Stec , we quickly dug up these anomalies while they were still on the Web .
Where was the mainstream media ?
Where was the right wing media ?
Is anyone doing due diligence on these important appointees holding the purse - strings to billions ?
Apparently not .
This lack of oversight in the public interest does n’t get any better when you look to the technology community itself .
You ’d think they would be able to spot a phony a mile away .
Nobody seemed to notice .
In fact the opposite was true as many tech mavens gushed over both men .
But why ?
They each have little to show except odd bragging about supposed improvements to this and that .
It ’s all vague .
Where are the documents ?
The papers ?
The reports ?
They both apparently show up at a lot of meetings and conferences .
I have to assume they are quite the charmers .
Look at this excerpt from the USA Today announcement for Aneesh Chopra :
“ The response to Chopra is resoundingly positive .
Craig Newmark ( of Craig ’s List ) says Chopra is ‘ really good for the country . ’
Eric Schmidt said in a statement ( via WSJ ) , ‘ Aneesh built one of the best technology platforms in government in the state of Virginia . ’
John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins said ( also via WSJ ) , ‘ Aneesh is an inspired appointment .
His smarts and experience in technology , health care and investing will serve us well . ’
Tim O’Reilly is ga- ga over the choice calling Chopra ‘ a rock star ’ and says , ‘ We could n’t do better . ’”
Really ?
We could n’t do any better ?
Or do all these guys just think that Obama can do no wrong ?
O’Reilly , a publisher of books about computer programming , in particular , went into a euphoric fugue with a laundry list of rationales , all clichéd and dubious including classic fuzzy - headed groupthink nonsense such as : “ Chopra grasps the power of open source software , Web 2.0 , user - participation , and why it ’s better to harness the ingenuity of a developer community than to specify complete top - down solutions . ”
OK .
Am I supposed to down a whiskey now ?
On his website O’Reilly admits that Chopra is very charismatic .
I hope there is some real explanation for what is going on here .
I hope the University of Maryland can find Kundra ’s records and show he taught there .
I hope he has a biology degree from Maryland .
And I hope Kundra can produce some records for his CEO tenure at Creostar indicating that it became a multimillion dollar company that was somehow ignored by Hoovers and D&B once it became successful .
I hope the both of these men are not just drinking buddies taking advantage of dummies .
I hope .
We did uncover the MS from a related campus with a different record keeping system .
That ’s a start .

According to news reports , the Obama administration  which seemed , over the weekend , to be backing away from the “ public option ” for health insurance  is shocked and surprised at the furious reaction from progressives .
Well , I ’m shocked and surprised at their shock and surprise .
A backlash in the progressive base  which pushed President Obama over the top in the Democratic primary and played a major role in his general election victory  has been building for months .
The fight over the public option involves real policy substance , but it ’s also a proxy for broader questions about the president ’s priorities and overall approach .
The idea of letting individuals buy insurance from a government - run plan was introduced in 2007 by Jacob Hacker of Yale , was picked up by John Edwards during the Democratic primary , and became part of the original Obama health care plan .
One purpose of the public option is to save money .
Experience with Medicare suggests that a government - run plan would have lower costs than private insurers ; in addition , it would introduce more competition and keep premiums down .
As we approach the eighth anniversary of 9/11 consider this paradox .
In the post 9 - 11 years the scientific evidence for disbelieving the official government story has mounted incredibly .
And the number of highly respected and credentialed professionals challenging the official story has similarly expanded .
Yet , to the considerable disappointment of the international 9/11 truth movement , the objective fact is that there are no widespread , loud demands for a new government - backed 9/11 investigation .
The 9/11 truth movement is the epitome of a marginalized movement , one that never goes away despite not achieving truly meaningful results , which in this case means replacing official lies with official truth .
What has gone wrong ?
Akin to the definition of insanity , the hallmark of entrenched but marginalized movements is that they continue to pursue exactly the same strategy and tactics that have failed to produce solid results .
They indulge themselves with self - delusion , defensive thinking and acting as if the world at large must surely and finally wake up , see the light and embrace the Truth .
Years and , potentially , decades go by , but this quixotic status quo remains embedded , as if set in intellectual concrete .
There is no brain tumor to blame .
Nor any mass hypnosis of true believers to prove .
There is just monumental disinterest among the dominant culture , political establishment and the broad public that is far more engaged with other issues , problems and movements .
The 9/11 truth movement , at best , gets meager public attention when it is derided and insulted , used as an example of persistent conspiratorial insanity .
Make no mistake ; I concluded a few years back , after using my professional engineering and materials science background to study the evidence , that the official government story is a lie .
As a former full professor of engineering , I firmly believe that elements of the US government were involved with contributing to ( not just allowing ) the 9/11 tragedy , but that does not necessarily eliminate the role of those terrorists publicly blamed for the events .
Science , logic , evidence and critical thinking told me this .
Who should we blame for the failure of the 9/11 truth movement to fix the historical record and , better yet , identify those in the government who turned 9/11 into an excuse for going to war , getting them indicted , prosecuted , and punished for their murderous acts ?
It is too easy to blame the mainstream media and political establishment for refusing to demand and pursue a truly comprehensive and credible independent scientific and engineering investigation .
President Obama with his tenacious belief in looking forward , not backward , exemplifies a national mindset to avoid the painful search for truth and justice that could produce still more public disillusionment with government and feed the belief that American democracy is weak at best , and delusional at worst .
Marginalized movements always face competition for public attention .
There are always countless national issues and problems that feed new movements and distract the public .
There have been many since 9/11 , not the least of which was the last presidential campaign and then the painful economic recession , and now the right wing attacks on health care reform .
The 9/11 truth movement illustrates a total failure to compete successfully with other events and movements .
This can be explained in several ways .
The 9/11 movement has not been able to articulate enough benefits to the public from disbelieving the official government story and pursuing a new investigation .
What might ordinary Americans gain ?
Would proof - positive of government involvement make them feel better , more secure , and more patriotic ?
Apparently not .
In fact , just the opposite .
By its very nature , the 9/11 issue threatens many things by discovering the truth : still less confidence in the US political system , government and public officials .
Still more reason to ponder the incredible loss of life and national wealth in pursuing the Iraq war .
In other words , revealing 9/11 truth offers the specter of a huge national bummer .
Conversely , it would show the world that American democracy has integrity .
The second explanation for failure is that the truth movement itself is greatly to blame .
It has been filled with nerdish , ego- centric and self - serving activists ( often most interested in pushing their pet theory ) unable to pursue strategies designed to face and overcome ugly , challenging realities .
The truth movement became a cottage industry providing income and meaning for many individuals and groups feeding the committed with endless websites , public talks , videos , books and paraphernalia .
They habitually preach to the choir .
Applause substitutes for solid results .
In particular , it embraces the simplistic ( and obviously ineffective ) belief that by revealing technical , scientific and engineering facts and evidence the public and political establishment would be compelled to see the light .
Darkness has prevailed .
Proof of this are the views expressed days ago on the truth movement by Ben Cohen on the Huffington Post : “ I have done some research on the topic , but stopped fairly quickly into when it dawned on me that :
1 . Any alternative to the official account of what happened is so absurd it simply cannot be true .
2 . No reputable scientific journal has ever taken any of the ‘ science ’ of the conspiracy seriously .
3 . The evidence supporting the official story is overwhelming , whereas the 9/11 Truthers have yet to produce a shred of concrete evidence that members of the U.S. government planned the attacks in New York and Washington . ”
Similarly , in the London Times James Bone recently said a “ gruesome assortment of conspiracy theorists insists that the attacks on the US of September 11 , 2001 were an inside job .
It is easy to mock this deluded gang of ageing hippies , anarchists and anti-Semites . ”
Truthers continue to face a very steep uphill battle .
A common lie about the truth movement is that there have been no credible scientific articles in peer reviewed journals supporting it .
But those opposing the truth movement will and do find ways to attack whatever scientific evidence is produced and published .
It takes more than good science and facts for the movement to succeed .
Besides the movement having too many genuine crackpots ( possibly trying to subvert it ) , a larger problem is what has been missing from it : effective political strategies .
Besides pushing scientific results and more credible supporters , it did nothing successful to make a new 9/11 investigation a visible issue in the last presidential campaign .
It did nothing effective to put pressure on a new , Democrat controlled congress to consider legislation providing the authorization and funding for a new , credible investigation .
It seems that people who want to blame the government are often unable to also see the political path forward that requires the government to fund a new investigation .
To its credit , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth does have a petition aimed at Congress , demanding a new investigation , but has fewer than 5,000 signers .
The petition effort in New York City to get a new investigation is commendable , with just under 75,000 signers , but national action is needed .
Pragmatically , both efforts are unimpressive compared to other campaigns seeking political action .
To get both media attention and political support the movement needs a hundred times more documented supporters , willing to do a lot more than sign a petition .
The tenth anniversary of 9/11 will come fast .
The opportunity is making 9/11 an issue in the 2012 presidential campaign .
The least delusional and defensive in the truth movement should think deeply and seriously on what needs to change to accomplish the prime goal : having an official investigation that compels most people and history to accept the truth , no matter how painful it is , including the possibility that it finds no compelling evidence for government involvement .

The method save ( ) returns " theend " String .
This is the name of the next view .
No page flow definitions in faces - config.xml are required .
The MessageView managed bean instantiates and directly exposes the HelloMessage entity :

public class HelloMessage {
public final static String findAll = " com.abien.leancomp.business.message.entity.HelloMessage.findAll " ;

The actual business logic is implemented in a @ Stateless no-interface view EJB 3.1 :
@ Stateless
public class MessageService {
@PersistenceContext
Entity Manager em ;
public void save ( HelloMessage hm ) {
this.em.persist( hm ) ;
}
public List< HelloMessage > getMessages ( ) {
return this.em.createNamedQuery(HelloMessage.findAll).getResultList( ) ;
}
}
The MessageService manages the EntityManager and cares about transactions .
Interestingly : the overall amount of code can be reduced with the introduction of a single EJB 3.1 .
You can use JSF 2 without EJBs , but then you will have to manage the persistence and transactions manually - what will result in significantly more code .
You could expose the same EJB 3.1 as a RESTful service .

CAP Action Senior Fellow Elizabeth Edwards testifies before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law , Committee on the Judiciary United States House of Representatives .
Read the full testimony .
Chairman Cohen and members of the subcommittee , thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the problems individuals face when they cannot afford health insurance or health care .
We are in the middle of a great national debate on health care .
For the first time in more than 15 years , we are truly trying to fix the broken health care system — and deal with the twin problems of the status quo , skyrocketing health care costs and the millions of Americans living without health coverage .
As Congress and the administration wrestle with the big picture and the very important details , it will be critically important to ensure that health reform guarantees that coverage and care will be affordable for Americans of all incomes .
I know that the committee is particularly interested in the financial hardships that many Americans experience due to health care costs .
As Dr. Woolhandler will note , medical expenses are a major factor in a majority of bankruptcy filings .
People with poor or no health insurance coverage and a significant health problem are particularly likely to accrue considerable medical debt — and thus are particularly vulnerable to bankruptcy .
Yet when they reach bankruptcy court , the bankruptcy trustee has little ability and little incentive to address the underlying factors that have led to medical debt and medical bankruptcy , including insurance company denials and aggressive collection efforts by medical debt collectors .
Medical debt is , of course , a symptom of larger problems in our health care system — and the solution to medical debt and medical bankruptcy is real health reform that results in affordable , reliable health coverage and affordable health care for all Americans .

Pa. Gunman ' Hell - bent ' on Killings , Had 4 Guns Police say George Sodini made two " practice runs " before massacre , left notes .
Aug. 5 , 2009 -- The Pennsylvania gunman who killed three women and injured nine others when he opened fire in a fitness center Tuesday before taking his own life made two " practice runs " just hours before the massacre , investigators said today .
Police also said the gunman , 48 - year - old George Sodini , also made a phone call to an unidentified person and " had a conversation " before he slipped into a dance class at the LA Fitness club with four handguns and began shooting .
Police say he used two 9 - millimeter automatic pistols and fired 36 shots inside the class of around 30 women .
He then used a .45 caliber revolver to take his own life .
An unused .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol was later found in Sodini 's pocket , police said .
" In our opinion , there was nobody in that club that could have done anything that could have prevented Sodini from committing this act , " Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said .
" He was hell - bent ...
He just had a lot of hatred in him . "
Police found two typed notes in Sodini 's bag at the scene , each reflecting his extreme frustration and depression with women .
He complained of " never having spent a weekend with a woman " -- a theme shared in chilling blog posts reportedly written by the shooter .
Click here to read the full text of George Sodini 's blog .
Sodini entered the gym using his membership card around 11 a.m. Tuesday and then left , Moffatt said .
He came back around 7:40 p.m. and left again .
He returned at 7:56 p.m. and began shooting .
Sodini had apparently targeted the " Latin impact " dance class that was under way when he opened fire .
" He had the class schedule with that class circled , " Moffat said .
Contrary to earlier reports , police do not believe that Sodini had a personal relationship with anyone in the class , Moffatt said .
Three women , 46 - year - old Heidi Overmier , 49 - year - old Elizabeth Gannon and 39 - year - old Jody Billingsley , were killed in the attack , according to the Allegheny coroner 's office .
Sodini's Aug. 3 online diary entry , which included a date of death , was full of disturbing musings about religion and his plans for the attack .
He noted that he had n't had a drink since 2:30 on Friday as part of his preparation .
" Total effort needed .
Tomorrow is the big day .
Unfortunately I talked to my neighbor today , who is very positive and upbeat .
I need to remain focused and absorbed COMPLETELY , " the diary read .
" Last time I tried this , in January , I chickened out . "
The diary also indicated that Sodini had n't had sex since 1990 and that his so - called " practice papers " -- details about the planning of the attack -- are welcome to be published afterward because " maybe all this will shed insight on why some people just cannot make things happen in their life , which can potentially benefit others .
" Maybe soon , I will see God and Jesus .
At least that is what I was told .
Eternal life does NOT depend on works .
If it did , we will all be in hell , " Sodini apparently wrote , before adding later , " I was reading the Bible and The Integrity of God beginning yesterday , because soon I will see them . "
Jen Malley told " Good Morning America 's " Chris Cuomo that she was in the Latin dance class at LA Fitness Tuesday when the shooting started .
It 's a class she takes every week with friends .
" It was the most terrifying experience of my life , " she said .
" I 've never been so scared . "
Penn .
Gov. Ed Rendell commented on the blog during a news conference saying " someone with those psychological barriers or challenges in my judgement should n't be in possession of multiple semi-automatic weapons . "
" If you look at the blogs ; this gentleman had severe mental problems .
He had a deep and abiding hatred for women , " Rendell said .
Sodini was the registered owner to at least three of the four guns he used in the attack .
Survivor : Sodini Shooting ' Was Just a Blur '
Malley said she did n't see Sodini enter the room but said she felt a presence of " someone who did n't belong there . "
Then the room went dark .
" Everyone was just screaming so loud .
At first I did n't even think shots were being fired , " she said .
" It was so surreal . "
Then , as she realized what was happening , Malley and her friends found their way out of the room , guided by the lights in other parts of the gym .
" I just ran as fast as I could , " she said , adding that she went back to make sure her best friend was behind her .
" It was just a blur from there . "
Blog Entries Detail Shooter 's Problems With Family , Women , Alcohol
On Monday , the day before the shootings , Sodini gave what might be the closest thing to his reason for the attacks .
" The biggest problem of all is not having relationships or friends , but not being able to achieve and acquire what I desire in those or many other areas , " the blog reads .
" Everything stays the same regardless of the effert ( sic ) I put in .
If I had control over my life then I would be happier .
But for about the past 30 years , I have not . "
Sodini had apparently been planning the attack for some time , even writing that he put off his original plan until after November 's 2008 presidential election , in a rambling entry that complains black men have their choice of the best white girls .
He tried again in January and May , according to the blog , but " chickened out . "
The Jan. 6 entry said he even brought the loaded gun to the gym .
Roberta Kozel , who co-owns a tanning salon that Sodini frequented as recently as Saturday , said she was shocked to learn he was the shooter .
" He did n't seem like a violent person , " Kozel told ABCNews.com .
" He seemed like a typical class nerd .
He was a little odd but you could never figure out what it was . "
Sodini asked the receptionist at the salon out for a date , but she " did n't take him seriously , " Kozel said .
A lengthy New Years
Eve entry in the online diary lists his family members by name and , in some cases , address .
He described his older brother Michael Sodini as a bully -- the " kind of guy you actually loved to hate . "
He described his mother as the " Central Boss " warning , " Do n't piss her off or she will be mad and vindictive for years . "
Various blog entries detail his worry about losing his job and having to re-enter the job market , as well as his troubles with alcohol .
A May 5 entry -- the day of his second attempt to launch an attack on the gym -- notes that he stopped to buy a bottle of Jack Daniels , his first drink in 20 years .
Gym Shooter Ambushed Class Full of Women
A woman in the class of about 30 , who identified herself as Nicole , told WTAE that the class had started about 10 minutes before gunfire erupted .
" He looked out of place in a class full of women , " according to the witness , who said the man put his bag down , turned the lights off and opened fire .
Ron Fleeher told WTAE Channel 4 Action News that the gunman held down his niece before shooting her .
" My niece said a couple bullets went past her head and [ the gunman ] leaned down , straddled her and shot her in the shoulder , " he said .
Sources close to the investigation told ABC News that multiple guns were used in the attack , including one that was registered to Sodini .
Collier Township Police Chief Tom Devin told reporters that he believed the shooter committed suicide at the scene .
Moffat said that the man did not say a word upon entering the gym nor when walking into the dance studio .
" He walked right into the room where the shootings occurred as if he knew exactly where he was going , " he said .
The floor was littered with shell casings and blood , according to surviving witnesses .
A local hospital treated five women who were shot multiple times , reported WTAE .
Four have been upgraded to " serious " condition and one has been released from the hospital , Moffatt said .
Health Club Members ' Shaken ' by Gym Shooting Spree
LA Fitness gym staff told WTAE that it was a busy night health club at the time of the shooting , with about 100 people inside .
Witnesses said people inside the gym took off running amid the gunshots .
Lauren Dooley , 26 , told the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette , that she had been running on a treadmill , listening to her iPod when the chaos broke out .
" I saw people flying off the treadmills , hitting the ground " for cover , Dooley said .
" We crawled through the fire escape , and I sprinted out the back . "
" I turned around there was one girl shot in the thigh and one girl shot in the back , " Branson Holly , a witness inside the gym at the time of the shooting told WTAE .
" I 'm still shaken because I was in spinning class and it could have been my class . "
Many heard the sounds of gunfire , others actually saw shots being fired in the darkened room .
" The lights were off , and I could see flashes in the dark , " said Jared Frederick , a witness .
Debi Wozniak told The Associated Press that she is normally a regular at the weekly Latin impact dance exercise class .
She says she missed the class Tuesday , but her sister , Joann Gazzam , had attended .
Gazzam told Wozniak that a man came in through the glass double doors , walked to the back of the room and set down the bag .
She said he began looking through his bag and pulled out and began shooting .
" She told me , ' Debi , I seen everything , oh my God , I seen everything .
I seen him pull out the guns , " ' Wozniak said .
ABC News ' Emily Friedman and Stephen Splane contributed to this report .
NBC caught a man outside the NH town hall with a gun strapped to his leg .
It appears to be legal as long as it's not concealed in Portsmouth .
And get this .
He 's on private property and if the owner of the property consents then he can carry the cannon on his leg .
What 's weird about that is the private property is a church .
A man of GOD thinks it 's swell to let this man carry a loaded weapon on church grounds .
What would Jesus think ?
Carlos :
You 're saying a guy has a gun in the open and we already know there are concerns about every president 's safety , but certainly this president ... and the guy 's just being allowed to stay there , is that right ?
Allen : The Chief of Police , I just asked him because I was amazed too , but apparently the law allows this man to be here as long as the gun is not concealed , it is registered to him apparently and he's on private property on a church ground ...
Do you think anybody would be allowed to be near President Bush who had a huge gun strapped on his leg ?
I doubt that , but this is the country the right wing wants us to live in .
And if Sen. John
Thune had his way , it would n't matter what NH law said if the state that this man came from did let you walk around with a gun .
Unbelievable .

Rosicky pulled on an Arsenal shirt for the first time in 18 months as his team kicked off their pre-season programme with a draw at Barnet .
The Czech international hobbled off during an FA Cup tie against Newcastle on January 26 , 2008 and has overcome plenty of obstacles on his long road back to fitness .
The 45 minutes he got under his belt at Underhill was the best news of the day .
The result was n’t so heartwarming - although that hardly matters at this time of the year .
Sanchez Watt set up Andrey Arshavin for the opening goal three minutes before the break but Ismail Yakubu headed an equaliser on the stroke of half - time .
Nacer Barazite , one of 10 half - time substitutes , restored Arsenal ’s lead in spectacular fashion but Elliott Charles struck with eight minutes left to earn Barnet a creditable draw .
Rosicky ’s return was the big news before kick - off but he was not the only mouth - watering name in the Arsenal line - up .
New signing Thomas Vermaelen made his debut , William Gallas returned from his own lengthy lay - off and Arshavin also started .
There was plenty for a packed Underhill to savour in the July sunshine .
This trip to Barnet has been a staple of Arsenal ’s pre-season diet for the past decade and it gives Wenger ’s side the opportunity to shake off some summer cobwebs before the hard work starts at their training camp in Austria .
Arsenal , sporting their new blue away kit , started briskly .
Arshavin dragged a shot past the near post inside 90 seconds and then forced Will Viner into a save from the acutest of angles .
Watt tried to snaffle the rebound but his effort was blocked .
Rosicky , captain for the day , was heavily involved in the opening exchanges and , needless to say , his first touch was greeted with a huge roar .
Most of the 5,099 crowd craved a goal from the Czech and were almost sated when Arshavin slipped Rosicky in with a deft pass inside the box .
Viner rushed out to smother .
The Barnet keeper was by far the busier .
After eight minutes Rosicky found Wilshere on the left and the 17 - year - old whipped a ball across to Watt .
His first touch took him inside his marker but Viner pushed away the striker ’s fierce effort .
After a frenetic first 15 minutes , the pace eased off – hardly surprising given the time of year .
Barnet , full of endeavour , started to compete .
Yannick Bolasie , quick and tricky , was their most fruitful outlet .
Paul Furlong , 40 , was his very senior partner up front but the former Chelsea striker gave Vermaelen a good battle .
The Dutchman wo n’t meet a more experienced opponent this season and he stood up well to his first test in English football .
Strong in the air , composed on the ball – Vermaelen looks the part .
The chances dried up as the tempo dropped but , having regained their breath , Arsenal stepped up a gear towards the end of the half .
Watt emerged from two sliding challenges to release Wilshere on the left six minutes before the break .
He cut inside and waited for support before finding Arshavin .
The Russian teed up Rosicky but his left - foot strike flew wide .
Three minutes later , Arsenal were ahead .
This time Watt raced down the left and he cleverly delayed his cross before putting the ball on a plate for Arshavin at the far post .
The Russian finished high into the net from close range .
You might not have fancied Barnet to bounce back from that but they conjured up an equaliser with the last touch of the half .
Danny
Hart whipped in an inviting free - kick from the left and centre - back Yakubu climbed highest to power a header beyond Manuel Almunia .
As expected it was all - change at half - time – with the exception of Vermaelen .
He stayed on for the second half and was joined by 10 new players : Craig Eastmond , Luke Ayling , Jay Simpson , Barazite , Thomas Cruise , Gilles Sunu , Francis Coquelin , Conor Henderson and Jay Emmanuel - Thomas .
Early evidence that Wenger is already building a team around his new signing !
It took just four minutes for Arsenal to regain the lead and they did it in some style .
Barazite , back from a season - long loan at Derby , was forced away from the penalty area by a crowded Barnet defence but found space to arrow a shot into the top corner from 20 yards .
Remarkably it was the third year in succession that Barazite has scored in this fixture .
Emmanuel - Thomas clipped a free - kick just over as the young Gunners asserted themselves but , once again , a frantic opening spell was followed by a more mundane passage of play .
Hart raised the temperature with a thumping shot from 25 yards which stung Mannone ’s hands and Arsenal responded in kind as Emmanuel - Thomas played in Simpson , but .his goal - bound effort was blocked .
Arsenal looked in control but they were pegged back again with eight minutes left when Charles popped up inside the box to find Mannone ’s bottom corner .
Emmanuel - Thomas squandered a chance for an instant riposte when he slid the ball just wide after breaking clear of the Barnet back line .
And so Arsenal had to settle for a draw , but that was not the story today .
Welcome back , Tomas Rosicky .

‘ I sing and play the guitar , ” Kurt Cobain once said , “ and I ’m a walking , talking bacterial infection . ”
Is it any wonder the good citizens of Aberdeen , Wash . , have always had mixed feelings , some loving , some reminiscent of stepping on shards of glass , when it comes to claiming the Nirvana front man as one of their own ?
Fifteen years after the suicide that ended the legendary musician ’s drug - fueled life at age 27 , Aberdeen has the title of one of Cobain ’s songs , “ Come as You Are , ” posted at the entrance to town .
The local museum offers a walking tour map of important locales from his childhood .
And an unofficial park has been established next to the bridge under which Cobain hung out and wrote songs .
Then a few weeks ago , a granite plaque of Cobain sayings was installed at the park .
Not only the one about the infection -- that was Kurt being Kurt -- but also the one about how “ drugs are bad for you , they will . . . you up , ” using a word the Aberdeen Daily World described as “ the F bomb . ”

Lines were drawn .
“ I ’m no prude , but I do n’t think that ’s the kind of thing we want to see on city property , ” said Bill Simpson , mayor of this down - on - its - luck logging and fishing town .
“ I do n’t like that word .
The city pays thousands of dollars a year just to remove it from our parks -- painting and sandblasting , ” City Councilman Jerry Mills said .
Others argued Cobain ’s frank warning about drugs was a good thing to convey to young people .
Advertisement
“ The majority of the people who are going to make their way down there , it ’s not like that ’s the first time they ’re ever going to see that word , ” said Councilman Paul Fritts , co-founder of the official Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee .
Amid the dust - up , the masonry company that had etched the offending word in the granite etched it out , or at least the last three letters .
Then on Wednesday , the City Council voted unanimously to accept the revamped monument .
Officials also OKd the table , benches and memorial signs that former lumber mill worker Tori Kovach had installed on city property at the base of the bridge , next to his home .
It is perhaps a testament to the enduring spirit of grunge rock that lingers in this town that someone almost immediately penciled in the missing letters .
Advertisement
“ A concession has been made to those with genteel sensibilities .
And hopefully that will placate them .
Everyone else thinks it ’s either sad or hilarious , ” Kovach said .
The 66 - year - old retiree , bald and bespectacled , lives with his wife and a long - haired dachshund in a carefully restored historic riverfront house filled with antiques and bric - a - brac .
By his own admission , Kovach does n’t fit the profile of the typical Nirvana fan .
He was n’t , he said , until he listened to some of the band ’s acoustic arrangements and realized that the young man reviled as a druggie and reprobate by many among Aberdeen ’s older generation also was an accomplished artist .

“ Kurt had his issues with being from here .
He came from a broken home .
There are certain facets of his life that resonate with mine , ” Kovach said .
“ When I heard his music , some of it just seemed to me to be a kind of guttural crying out .
An expression of angst to some degree , and rebellious anger .
And in - your - face nonconformity that just appealed to me .
He was a musical genius to a degree . ”
Once he began listening to the music , Kovach said , he knew the bridge was a special place : A Nirvana album released two years after Cobain ’s 1994 death is called “ From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah ” -- a reference to the river that runs through Aberdeen -- and one of Cobain ’s songs commemorates the hours he spent there .
Over the years the small park Kovach erected has become a destination for visitors from as far away as Australia and Japan .
Others around Aberdeen are following Kovach ’s lead .

Don Sucher , who owns a “ Star Wars " - themed souvenir shop downtown , has set up a “ Kurt Cobain Information Center ” with photos , news articles , maps and Cobain action figures .
The police chief said he ’s thinking of posting Cobain ’s mug shot from a 1985 graffiti arrest outside the police station with a small plaque for tourists .
A local winery is releasing a “ Pinot Noirvana ” and donating some of the profits to the memorial committee ’s proposed youth center .
“ I think our city , over the past 15 years regarding Kurt Cobain , has really missed the boat , ” Fritts told the council .
“ And I think a youth center that reaches out to youth more like him is a step in the right direction . ”
Kovach is thinking of erecting a statue of Cobain holding a steel guitar at the bridge park .
But he worries about “ punk purists ” who say Cobain would roll over in his grave if he became a park statue .
Maybe it should be simply a guitar on a pedestal ?
“ That way , I would n’t have to spend my nights at the window with a pair of binoculars , ” Kovach said , “ wondering if somebody was going to take a baseball bat and smash the heck out of the thing . ”

The ocean is warming about 50 per cent faster than reported two years ago , according to an update of the latest climate science .
A report compiling research presented at a science congress in Copenhagen in March says recent observations are near the worst - case predictions of the 2007 report by the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
In the case of sea - level rise , it is happening at an even greater rate than projected - largely due to rising ocean temperatures causing thermal expansion of seawater .
Released last night at the European Policy Centre in Brussels , the report says ocean temperatures are a better indicator of global warming than air temperature as the ocean stores more heat and responds more slowly to change .
Report co-author Will Steffen , executive director of the Australian National University 's Climate Change Institute , said the top 700 metres of the ocean had warmed by about 0.1 degrees over the past half - century .
Clichés are poison .
They seep into our language like defoliants , pesticides that reside in our imagination , slowly destroying our power to express ourselves by dehumanising language , by industrialising speech .
Newspaper and television reporting are to blame .
We are all guilty .
So why do we insult you , reader ?
And why do you put up with this ?
Some of this claptrap has been around for years .
Catholics are always " devout " , Protestants ( the Northern Ireland version , at least ) inevitably " staunch " .
Bitterly hostile antagonists are always " foes " or " arch - foes " .
New dictatorial laws – the new press laws in Iran , for example – are always " draconian " ( poor old Draco ) , while secret policemen ( the Gestapo , the Shah 's Savak , the Afghan Khad , the Syrian mukhabarat , the present - day Iranian Etelaat ) are always " dreaded " .
Needless to say , the Israeli secret police – who also torture and murder – tend to be " elite " or ( my favourite ) " second to none " .
The point about all these words , of course , is that we do not use them in conversation .
We never ask a Catholic if they are " devout " or describe a vexatious next - door neighbour as an " arch - foe " .
If we are discussing the Syrian secret service , nobody says : " Yes , they 're fairly dreaded , are n't they ? "
We just do n't talk like that .
Alas , we have been given a new set of tranquillisers to use on our fellow human beings .
Unable to ask our friends if they are religious – a gross infringement of our privacy , of course – we ask them if they are " faith - based " .
" NO , BY CHRIST ! " is my reply .

I notice that most Muslims are now described by us reporters as " practising " , though I 'm still not sure what that means .
That the men go to the mosque five times a day ?
Or say their five daily prayers at home ?
That their wives wear hijab ?
Or , mini-skirted , just believe in God ?
Or are they preparing to be suicide bombers ?
Note how we never refer to " practising " Christians – probably because there are n't many left .
Christians , I mean .
No , a " practising " Muslim is also a code word for " terrorist " – just as the accusation of being " pro-Palestinian " means that the accused is actually a supporter of terrorism .
Likewise " pro-Israeli " has become a synonym for " Zionist " or " anti-Arab " .
The same goes for less sinful clichés .
In real life , do we really call borders " porous " – even when , like the Durand line which divides Afghanistan from present - day Pakistan , few of the people living on the frontier believe it 's real ?
In ordinary conversation , do ever refer to " iconic " or " defining moments " , even though speech - writers like to sprinkle them around the lexicon of third - rate politicians ?
Indeed , politics provides some of our most woeful clichés .
Presidents and prime ministers like to demonstrate " soft power " – a descendant of the old " hitting above our weight " – when they are not on the " campaign trail " .
I have a special " AAAAAGH " for " campaign trail " .
It was presumably coined in the United States ( the " trail " being a giveaway ) but it now applies to any election anywhere on earth .
MPs or US senators or French presidents are always " fighting for their political life " , their arguments often " compelling " .
Which means what , exactly ?
Every newly inaugurated American president since Truman , it appears , has " hit the ground running " .
Last week , in a self - regarding address which I had the misfortune to attend , our dear Lord Chancellor and Justice Minister , Jack Straw , invented an entirely new word : " justicability " .
His audience of Australian lawyers was as bemused as I was by such claptrap .
Is the political descendant of Sir Thomas More – he of Utopia and a head loss to Henry VIII – trying to persuade us he 's an intellectual ?
Sometimes , clichés turn into real speech .
How many times have we heard UN officials , business leaders and US generals – always keeping an " anxious eye " on " seemingly intractable " problems – tell us that " time is of the essence " ?
When Middle East leaders – either " hawks " or " doves " or " moderates " or " conservatives " – speak , their words often escape " under the radar " of us Westerners .
I wo n't go into " war - torn " – yes , Afghanistan , it 's pretty war - torn right now , is n't it , we might say to a friend – or " embattled " , but some clichés are like glue .
Not long ago , I wanted to write about a South - west Asian country that was so shattered by war and corruption that it was no longer economically viable .
I knew the old cliché : " poverty - stricken " .
But I wanted to express myself clearer , so I wrote that the country was – quite literally – " poverty - broken " .
But of course , a sub-editor changed it back to " poverty - stricken " .
He wanted to keep within the cliché code .
Poverty - broken was offensive because it did not fit into the dictionary of clichés , that essential volume – it is in our brains , not in our libraries – that is supposed to safeguard all journalism from unorthodoxy .
I love new clichés , however , albeit for only a few days .
One of Italian prime minister Berlusconi 's latest women is now described by journalists , I notice , as a " high - end prostitute " .
Who dreamed up ' high - end ' ?
Her pimp , I suspect .
It means , presumably , that she 's very expensive and thus available only to men with money and power .
And be sure that we shall never – ever – refer to " low - end prostitutes " , a phrase that would dehumanise " sex workers " .
But wait – the cliché has already begun to sink into our subconscious .
A reader of Canada 's National Post , writing a letter to the editor , last week described the newspaper as a " high - end publication " – which , I suppose , tells you a lot about the paper .
So do we just sit back and roll about in this shitty language ?
After all , it 's not " rocket science " , is it ?
Tanks may " roll " but the guns will always " fall silent " .
Now back to Canada for a moment .
In New Brunswick , it seems , parents are not amused with the new French " immersion " course offered their children in local schools .
Apparently , they are not actually taught the French language any more , merely told about France while , occasionally , an anglophone teacher drops by the classroom to sing a French song to the kids .
" Experiential modules " is what their teachers call these courses .
Modules indeed .
Justicability I suppose .
And as his Liege Lord Henry would have said of Jack Straw and his friends : " Off with their heads . "
Realtime Worlds has revealed that urban MMO APB will not require a monthly subscription , as a keen - eyed Eurogamer reader found out .
" The actual price for the game itself is still under discussion but we 'll keep you up to date .
We can confirm that APB will not require a monthly subscription , " the APB website FAQ reads .
APB launches next spring on PC .
There will be no Linux or Mac conversions , and the likelihood of the Xbox 360 version appearing looks slim : " We 're evaluating opportunities for a console port of APB but theres nothing concrete to announce at the moment , " the FAQ adds .
We heard at E3 earlier this year that APB was " being developed for Xbox 360 " , although no further details were offered .
APB is a great big online cops and robbers game , where you pick a side , adorn yourself with tattoos and fight in 100 - player rumbles .

The natives are restless .
The third shot of the  Second American Revolution  has been fired .
History is being made .
But just as with the first two shots , the third shot is not being heard .
America is seething .
Not since the Civil War has anything like this happened .
But the protests are either being intentionally downplayed or ignorantly misinterpreted .
The first shot was fired on April 15 , 2009 .
Over 700 anti-tax rallies and  Tea Parties  erupted nationwide .
Rather than acknowledge their significance , the general media either ignored or ridiculed both protests and protestors , playing on tea bagging  for its sexual innuendo .
Initially President Obama said he was unaware of the tea parties .
The White House later warned they could mutate into something unhealthy . 
Shot # 2 was fired on the Fourth of July , when throngs of citizens across the nation gathered to again protest taxation without representation . 
And as before , the demonstrations were branded right - wing mischief and dismissed .
The third volley , fired in early August , was aimed point blank at Senators and House members pitching President Obamas health care reform package to constituents .
In fiery town hall meetings , enraged citizens shouted down their elected representatives .
It took a strong police presence and / or burly bodyguards to preserve a safe physical space between the politicians and irate townspeople .
The White House and the media have labeled protestors  conservative fringe elements ,  or as players in staged events organized by Republican operatives that have been egged on by Fox news and right - wing radio show hosts .
In regard to this latest wave of outbursts , health industry interests opposed to any reform are also being blamed for inciting the public .
But organized or spontaneous is not the issue .
While most protestors exhibit little grasp of the complex 1000 page health care reform document ( that nary a legislator has read either ) , their emotion is clearly real and un-staged .
Rightly or wrongly , the legislation is regarded as yet another straw on the already overloaded camels back .
A series of gigantic , unpopular government - imposed ( but taxpayer - financed ) bailouts , buyouts , rescue and stimulus packages have been stuffed down the gullet of Americans .
With no public platform to voice their opposition , options for citizens have been limited to fruitless petitions , e-mails and phone calls to Congress all fielded by anonymous staff underlings .
Now , with Congress in recess and elected representatives less than a stones throw away , the public is exploding .
The devil is not in the details of the heath care reform , the devil is the government mandating health care .
Regardless of how the plan is pitched or what is being promised , to the public the legislation is yet another instance of big government taking another piece out of their lives and making them pay for it ; again telling them what they can or cannot do .
Though in its early stages , the  Second American Revolution  is underway .
Yet , what we forecast will become the most profound political trend of the century  the trend that will change the world  is still invisible to the same experts , authorities and pundits who didnt see the financial crisis coming until the bottom fell out of the economy .
Trend Forecast : Conditions will continue to deteriorate .
The global economy is terminally ill .
The recession is in a brief remission , not the early stages of recovery .
Cheap money , easy credit and unrestrained borrowing brought on an economic crisis that cannot be cured by monetary and fiscal policies that promote more cheap money , easy credit and unrestrained borrowing .
Nevertheless , Washington will continue to intervene , tax and exert control .
Protests will escalate and riots will follow .
Fourth Shot of the  Second American Revolution :
While there are many wild cards that could light the fuse , The Trends Research Institute forecasts that if the threat of government - forced Swine Flu vaccinations is realized , it will be the fourth shot .
Tens of millions will fight for their right to remain free and unvaccinated .
Editorial Note :
The power of the Internet and new technologies is inexorably fermenting the  Second American Revolution . 
However widespread and emotionally charged , had the tax rallies , tea parties and healthcare reform protests occurred in years past , they might have been covered by the local media , but might not have made national headline news and thus would have died stillborn .
Thank you for supporting LRC with your online orders
Now , with the ubiquitous camera - equipped cell phone , universal access to YouTube , and millions of twitters and tweets , the uprisings cannot be ignored , contained , managed , spun or edited down .
The revolutionary fervor will prove contagious .
Can anything stop it ?
Trend Forecast : Before the momentum of the  Second American Revolution  becomes unstoppable , it could be derailed through some false flag event designed to deceive the public , or a genuine event or crisis capable of rallying the entire nation behind the President .
In a worst - case scenario , according to Trends Research Institute Director , Gerald Celente ,  Given the pattern of governments to parlay egregious failures into mega - failures , the classic trend they follow , when all else fails , is to take their nation to war . "
A false flag attempt , a genuine crisis , or a declaration of war , may slow the momentum of the  Second American Revolution ,  but nothing will stop it .
Gerald Celente is founder and director of The Trends Research Institute , author of Trends 2000 and Trend Tracking ( Warner Books ) , and publisher of The Trends Journal .
He has been forecasting trends since 1980 , and recently called  The Collapse of '09 . 

We are rich enough .
Economic growth has done as much as it can to improve material conditions in the developed countries , and in some cases appears to be damaging health .
If Britain were instead to concentrate on making its citizens ' incomes as equal as those of people in Japan and Scandinavia , we could each have seven extra weeks ' holiday a year , we would be thinner , we would each live a year or so longer , and we 'd trust each other more .
Epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett do n't soft - soap their message .
It is brave to write a book arguing that economies should stop growing when millions of jobs are being lost , though they may be pushing at an open door in public consciousness .
We know there is something wrong , and this book goes a long way towards explaining what and why .
The authors point out that the life - diminishing results of valuing growth above equality in rich societies can be seen all around us .
Inequality causes shorter , unhealthier and unhappier lives ; it increases the rate of teenage pregnancy , violence , obesity , imprisonment and addiction ; it destroys relationships between individuals born in the same society but into different classes ; and its function as a driver of consumption depletes the planet 's resources .
Wilkinson , a public health researcher of 30 years ' standing , has written numerous books and articles on the physical and mental effects of social differentiation .
He and Pickett have compiled information from around 200 different sets of data , using reputable sources such as the United Nations , the World Bank , the World Health Organisation and the US Census , to form a bank of evidence against inequality that is impossible to deny .
They use the information to create a series of scatter - graphs whose patterns look nearly identical , yet which document the prevalence of a vast range of social ills .
On almost every index of quality of life , or wellness , or deprivation , there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country 's level of economic inequality and its social outcomes .
Almost always , Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable " low " end , and almost always , the UK , the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable " high " end , with Canada , Australasia and continental European countries in between .
This has nothing to do with total wealth or even the average per-capita income .
America is one of the world 's richest nations , with among the highest figures for income per person , but has the lowest longevity of the developed nations , and a level of violence - murder , in particular - that is off the scale .
Of all crimes , those involving violence are most closely related to high levels of inequality - within a country , within states and even within cities .
For some , mainly young , men with no economic or educational route to achieving the high status and earnings required for full citizenship , the experience of daily life at the bottom of a steep social hierarchy is enraging .
The graphs also reveal that it is not just the poor , but whole societies , from top to bottom , that are adversely affected by inequality .
Although the UK fares badly when compared with most other OECD countries ( and is the worst developed nation in which to be a child according to both Unicef and the Good Childhood Inquiry ) , its social problems are not as pronounced as in the US .
Rates of illness are lower for English people of all classes than for Americans , but working - age Swedish men fare better still .
Diabetes affects twice as many American as English people , whether they have a high or a low level of education .
Wherever you look , evidence favouring greater equality piles up .
As the authors write , " the relationships between inequality and poor health and social problems are too strong to be attributable to chance " .
But perhaps the most troubling aspect of reading this book is the revelation that the way we live in Britain is a serious danger to our mental health .
Around a quarter of British people , and more than a quarter of Americans , experience mental problems in any given year , compared with fewer than 10 per cent in Japan , Germany , Sweden and Italy .
Wilkinson and Pickett 's description of unequal societies as " dysfunctional " suggests implicit criticism of the approach taken by Britain 's " happiness tsar " Richard Layard , who recommended that the poor mental health of many Britons be " fixed " or improved by making cognitive behavioural therapy more easily available .
Consumerism , isolation , alienation , social estrangement and anxiety all follow from inequality , they argue , and so cannot rightly be made a matter of individual management .
There 's an almost pleading quality to some of Wilkinson and Pickett 's assertions , as though they feel they 've spent their careers banging their heads against a brick wall .
It 's impossible to overstate the implications of their thesis : that the societies of Britain and the US have institutionalised economic and social inequality to the extent that , at any one time , a quarter of their respective populations are mentally ill .
What kind of " growth " is that , other than a malignant one ?
One question that comes to mind is whether the world 's most equal developed nations , Japan and Sweden , make sufficient allowance for individuals to express themselves without being regarded as a threat to the health of the collective .
Critics of the two societies would argue that both make it intensely difficult for individual citizens to protest against the conformity both produced by , and required to sustain , equality .
The inclination to dismiss or neuter individuals ' complaints may , Wilkinson and Pickett suggest , go some way towards explaining the higher suicide rates in both countries compared with their more unequal counterparts .
Those who feel wrong , or whose lives go wrong , may feel as though they really do have no one to blame but themselves .
What Japan and Sweden do show is that equality is a matter of political will .
There are belated signs - shown in the recent establishment of a National Equalities Panel and in Trevor Phil lips 's public pronouncements on the central place of class in the landscape of British inequality - that Labour recognises that its relaxed attitude to people " getting filthy rich " has come back to bite it on the rear .
Twelve years in power is long enough to reverse all the trends towards greater social and economic stratification that have occurred since 1970 ; instead they have continued on their merry way towards segregation .
Teenage pregnancy rates have begun to rise after a period of decline ; there is a 30 - year gap in male life expectancy between central Glasgow and parts of southern England ; and child poverty wo n't be halved by next year after all ( though it would n't make as much difference as making their parents more equal ) .
There are times when the book feels rather too overwhelmingly grim .
Even if you allow for the fact that it was written before Barack Obama won the US presidency on a premise of trust and optimism , its opening pages are depressing enough to make you want to shut it fast :
" We find ourselves anxiety - ridden , prone to depression , driven to consume and with little or no community life . "
Taking the statistics broadly , they may be correct , but many readers simply wo n't feel like that .
However , the book does end on an optimistic note , with a transformative , rather than revolutionary , programme for making sick societies more healthy .
A society in which all citizens feel free to look each other in the eye can only come into being once those in the lower echelons feel more valued than at present .
The authors argue that removal of economic impediments to feeling valued - such as low wages , low benefits and low public spending on education , for instance - will allow a flourishing of human potential .
There is a growing inventory of serious , compellingly argued books detailing the social destruction wrought by inequality .
Wilkinson and Pickett have produced a companion to recent bestsellers such as Oliver James 's Affluenza and Alain de Botton 's Status Anxiety .
But The Spirit Level also contributes to a longer view , sitting alongside Richard Sennett 's 2003 book Respect : The Formation of Character in an Age of Inequality , and the epidemiologist Michael Marmot 's Status Syndrome , from 2005 .
Anyone who believes that society is the result of what we do , rather than who we are , should read these books ; they should start with The Spirit Level because of its inarguable battery of evidence , and because its conclusion is simple : we do better when we 're equal .
• Lynsey Hanley 's Estates : An Intimate History is published by Granta
By Robert Samuelson - August 10 , 2009
" The status quo is unsustainable for families , businesses and government . "
-- President Obama , June 13
WASHINGTON --
One of the bewildering ironies of the health care debate is that President Obama claims to be attacking the status quo when he 's actually embracing it .
Ever since Congress created Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 , health politics has followed a simple logic : Expand benefits and talk about controlling costs .
That 's the status quo , and Obama faithfully adheres to it .
While denouncing skyrocketing health spending , he would increase it by extending government health insurance to millions more Americans .
Just why this approach is perennially popular is no secret .
Health care is viewed as a " right . "
Promoting it seems " moral . "
Cost controls suggest dreaded " rationing . "
So there 's a powerful bias toward expansion .
History is unambiguous .
Originally , Medicare covered only the 65 - and - over population .
In 1972 , Congress added the disabled , now about 15 percent of beneficiaries , notes Diane Rowland of the Kaiser Family Foundation .
It also covered dialysis for kidney failure .
In 2003 , Congress created a drug benefit .
Along the way , other services ( hospice care , mammograms ) were added .
Medicaid -- the federal - state program for the poor -- is the same story , says Rowland .
Initially , it covered mainly people on welfare , as defined by states .
Gradually , eligibility broadened .
Now , children 6 to 18 in households under the poverty line ( $ 22,050 for a family of four ) get it .
Congress also set higher limits ( 133 percent of the poverty line ) for pregnant women and children under 6 .
In 1997 , Congress created the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) to expand coverage further .
Meanwhile , open - ended reimbursement by government and private insurance has ballooned health spending despite repeated pledges to " contain " costs .
For example , health payments for individuals rose from less than 1 percent of federal spending in 1965 to 23 percent in 2008 .
Obama would perpetuate this system .
No president has spoken more forcefully about the need to control costs .
Failure , he 's argued , would expand federal budget deficits , raise out - of - pocket health costs and squeeze take - home pay ( more compensation would go to insurance ) .
All true .
But Obama 's program would do little to reduce costs and would increase spending by expanding subsidized insurance .
The House legislation would cut the uninsured by 37 million by 2018 , estimates the Congressional Budget Office .
The uninsured get care now ; with insurance they 'd get more .
" You'd be adding a third medical entitlement on top of Medicare and Medicaid , " says James Capretta , a top official at the Office of Management and Budget from 2001 to 2004 .
Just imagine what the health care debate would be like if it truly focused on controlling spending .
For starters , we would n't be arguing about how to " pay for " the $ 1 trillion or so of costs over a decade of Obama 's " reform . "
Congress would n't create new benefits until it had disciplined the old .
We'd be debating how to trim the $ 10 trillion , as estimated by CBO , that Medicare and Medicaid will spend over the next decade , without impairing Americans ' health .
We 'd use Medicare as a vehicle of change .
Accounting for more than one - fifth of all health spending , its costs per beneficiary , now about $ 12,000 , rose at a dizzying average annual rate of 8.5 percent a year from 1970 to 2007 .
( True , that 's lower than private insurers ' rate at 9.7 percent .
But the gap may partly reflect cost - shifting to private payers .
When Medicare restrains reimbursement rates , hospitals and doctors raise charges to private insurers . )
Medicare is so big that shifts in its practices spread to the rest of the delivery system .
But changing Medicare , and through it one - sixth of the U.S. economy , requires more than a few demonstration projects of " comparative outcomes " research or economic incentives .
What 's needed is a fundamental restructuring .
Fee - for - service medicine -- Medicare 's dominant form of payment -- is outmoded .
The more doctors and hospitals do , the more they get paid .
This promotes fragmentation and the overuse of services .
We should move toward coordinated care networks that take responsibility for their members ' medical needs in return for fixed annual payments ( called " capitation " ) .
One approach is through vouchers ; Medicare recipients would receive a fixed amount and shop for networks with the lowest cost and highest quality .
Alternatively , government could shift its reimbursement of hospitals and doctors to " capitation " payments .
Limited dollars would , in theory , force improvements in efficiency and effective care .
We 're not having this debate .
To engage it would require genuine presidential leadership , because , admittedly , these proposals would be hugely controversial .
Medicare recipients -- present and future -- would feel threatened .
Existing doctor - patient relationships might be disrupted .
Spending limits would inspire fears of short - changed care .
Hospitals , doctors and device manufacturers would object .
Obama took a pass .
He simply claims that his plan will do things it wo n't .
What he 's offering is an enlarged version of the status quo that , as he says , is already unsustainable .
Nestled between sand hills about five kilometres from their homes , about 150 residents from a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory are continuing to protest at a makeshift camp against poor housing conditions and the federal intervention .
The community of Ampilatwatja , about 300 kilometres north - east of Alice Springs , is frustrated about overflowing septic tanks in their government - owned , overcrowded houses .
As health worker Eileen Bonney explains , the protest camp is a welcome break from the housing in town .
" Everything toilet 's leaking and all that and sink , " she said .
Ms Bonney , who pays rent to Northern Territory Housing , says her floor is often flooded with raw sewage and she has been asking to have it fixed for months .
The Territory Government yesterday said it had freed up $ 70,000 in funding to send in a plumber to fix seven septic tanks .
The plumber was due to arrive this morning .
The Barkly Shire , which manages the houses , said the plumber was supposed to pump out the tanks earlier this week , but the plumber 's truck broke down on the way there .
Community members are also calling for an end to the Northern Territory Emergency Response , which they say has made them feel ashamed .
They are sick of being treated like children , they say .
' Feeling shame '
Banjo Morton , an ex stockman , says he has chosen to abandon his community because he is sick of income management , which sees part of welfare payments to Indigenous people in the Territory quarantined for essential provisions , such as food and clothing .
" I been feeling shame because they take away our rights , " Mr Morton said .
The protesters have requested the Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister visit their community as soon as possible .
Barkly Shire president , Rosalie Kunoth Monks , wants immediate action on the housing conditions in the Ampilatwatja community .
She says she is glad the issue of maintenance and services has come to a head .
" Welcome to the real world .
This is the reality , " she said .
Ms Kunoth Monks says her pleas for assistance in the past have all been ignored by the Northern Territory and Federal Governments .
" Now the neglect that has gone on from the inception of these homelands has to be addressed now , even before we start talking about super towns and so forth . "
She says many people in the Barkly Shire live in tin sheds and humpies and they are paying rent to the Northern Territory Government .
A significant increase in funding to the maintenance of houses is necessary , she says .
" That 's the only way we can address the derelict situation that we find that is called ' housing ' .
" They are no less than tin sheds .
" That 's not only at Ampilatwatja , that 's right throughout . "
The Indigenous Health Minister , Warren Snowdon , who is also the federal Member for Lingiari , says the Territory Government is acting quickly to rectify the sewage problem .
" I think it would be most unfortunate if people abandoned their homes once they 've been , once the issue of the sewage has been addressed , " he said .
" I think they should be encouraged to move back to their homes .
" However , I do n't deny them the opportunity , and nor should they be denied the opportunity , to express their views , however strongly they are held about the issue of the Emergency Response . "

Manuel Almunia has suggested that defender Kolo Touré pushed for his £ 14 m transfer to Manchester City because he was " bored " with life at Arsenal and " tired of being with the same people every day " .
" He needed a change , " said Almunia , the goalkeeper , " and you could see it in his face .
Kolo was not really happy in his last period at Arsenal . "
Touré submitted a transfer request in January , only to withdraw it and , upon joining City , he said that the move had been in the making for six months .
He admitted that he did not get along with William Gallas , his central defensive partner at the Emirates , and Arsène Wenger , the Arsenal manager , said that there was nothing he could have done to keep Touré because the 28 - year - old centre - half had wanted the move .
Almunia will now watch the club's £ 10 m summer signing Thomas Vermaelen attempt to form a partnership with Gallas , although Wenger admitted that if Philippe Senderos completes his proposed switch to Everton , he could make a move for Fulham 's centre - half Brede Hangeland .
" Of course , I have heard about Arsenal 's interest , " said Hangeland , who has yet to sign the new contract he has been offered at Craven Cottage , " but I am very happy at Fulham . "
" I was surprised by Kolo leaving , " Almunia continued .
" He was a big part of Arsenal , one of the greatest players that we 've had over the last few years .
When I see him in the papers wearing a City shirt , it 's very strange for me .
When you are with players for many years , you get to know them very well , you know how they play and communicate with them really well .
" But now we have to work with different people .
We have a new central defender in Thomas Vermaelen and we have to cope with this .
In football , people come and go .
It 's part of life .
" Kolo lived through great times at Arsenal .
He won the league as part of a great team , the Invincibles .
But when you are at any place for a long time , you sometimes need a change and to change your way of life , the city where you live , the team - mates you see every day .
Maybe he was a bit bored , a bit tired of being with the same people every day , in the same atmosphere . "
Almunia insisted , however , that the same wanderlust had not gripped the captain Cesc Fábregas , who is coveted by a host of leading European clubs .
" With Cesc , the same could happen but he still has a lot more to offer Arsenal [ whereas ]
Kolo gave everything to Arsenal and won titles , " said Almunia .
" We 'll see the best of Cesc this season and he will help us to win something .
Then he will be completely happy to be here and he will do what he wants to do . "
Vermaelen played in Arsenal 's first four pre-season friendlies and he looked composed , albeit against limited opposition .
Although he stands at less than six feet tall and , as such , will not add much needed height to the team , Almunia believes that he will be powerful in the air .
" He might not be really tall , but he has a very good jumping capacity and he 's very good with his head , " said Almunia , at an event to mark Arsenal 's selection of the Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital and , specifically , their lung function unit , as the club 's charity of the season .
" He looks a very good player and now , he has to show how good he is .
He 's still a bit shy in the dressing room but that 's normal when you come to a new place .
" At the beginning of last season , we had tall people and we still had some problems .
It 's not about height , it 's about attitude .
You have to face the ball properly and be focused on the game every single minute . "

Advertisement Lance Armstrong 's new cycling squad Team Radio Shack will make its debut at the 2010 Tour Down Under in January .
The seven - time Tour de France winner is recruiting a new team for the 2010 Tour after coming out of retirement to ride for Astana in this year 's race .
Armstrong , 37 , finished third after a battle with team - mate Alberto Contador , who took overall honours in Paris .
The testicular cancer survivor intends to use the Tour Down Under to help boost awareness of his cancer work .
" We are going to go back to South Australia with the Tour Down Under , based on the fact that it's a great race , great community , " said Armstrong .
Armstrong was joined by more than 1,000 cyclists for a ride around Dublin " Looking forward to going for the first race of the season with Team Radio Shack , the first race of all time for Team Radio Shack , and continue the work , continue the global mission , the global campaign . "
Armstrong will compete as a cyclist , runner and triathlete in events around the world , including the 2010 Tour de France .
At the final day of Armstrong 's global cancer summit in Dublin , South Australia Premier Mike Rann said he was thrilled to have the cyclist return .
" We are delighted to be able to announce that Lance and Team Radio Shack will be coming back to Adelaide , back to South Australia to participate in the Tour Down Under , " stated Rann .
" We were thrilled when Lance made his comeback after retirement in South Australia and we 're even more thrilled that he 's coming back again . "
The 2010 Tour Down Under takes place from 17 - 24 January .
Armstrong took part in the Tour of Ireland - pulling out on the final circuit on Sunday in heavy rain with no chance of winning - before attending the cancer summit .
606 : DEBATE
If Armstrong was to make the perfect TDF team for 2010 , who would you pick ?
Legendofthedevil
And he admitted he was shocked by the large turnout for his impromptu ride around Dublin 's Phoenix Park on Tuesday .
More than 1,200 cyclists rode from across the Irish capital to join the impromptu spin announced on Twitter .
" I was surprised , but also very flattered that hundreds and hundreds , if not more than a thousand , showed up , on 10 hours notice , " added Armstrong .

Turkeys have caught swine flu in Chile
The discovery of swine flu in birds in Chile raises concerns about the spread of the virus , the UN warns .
Last week the H1N1 virus was found in turkeys on farms in Chile .
The UN now says poultry farms elsewhere in the world could also become infected .
Scientists are worried that the virus could theoretically mix with more dangerous strains .
It has previously spread from humans to pigs .
However , swine flu remains no more severe than seasonal flu .
Safe to eat
Chilean authorities first reported the incident last week .
Two poultry farms are affected near the seaport of Valparaiso .
Juan Lubroth , interim chief veterinary officer of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , said : " Once the sick birds have recovered , safe production and processing can continue .
They do not pose a threat to the food chain . "
Chilean authorities have established a temporary quarantine and have decided to allow the infected birds to recover rather than culling them .
It is thought the incident represents a " spill - over " from infected farm workers to turkeys .
Canada , Argentina and Australia have previously reported spread of the H1N1 swine flu virus from farm workers to pigs .
Dangerous strains
The emergence of a more dangerous strain of flu remains a theoretical risk .
Different strains of virus can mix together in a process called genetic reassortment or recombination .
So far there have been no cases of H5N1 bird flu in flocks in Chile .
However , Dr Lubroth said : " In Southeast Asia there is a lot of the ( H5N1 ) virus circulating in poultry .
" The introduction of H1N1 in these populations would be of greater concern . "
Colin Butter from the UK's Institute of Animal Health agrees .
" We hope it is a rare event and we must monitor closely what happens next , " he told BBC News .
" However , it is not just about the H5N1 strain .
Any further spread of the H1N1 virus between birds , or from birds to humans would not be good .
" It might make the virus harder to control , because it would be more likely to change . "
William Karesh , vice president of the Wildlife Conservation Society , who studies the spread of animal diseases , says he is not surprised by what has happened .
" The location is surprising , but it could be that Chile has a better surveillance system .
" However , the only constant is that the situation keeps changing . "

First up sorry for the delays on posting this section .
Of course those people who can remember when I posted quarterly may consider this early .
The next section of Caroline will be delayed until the short story " Iron Maiden " is finished and published .
This is the name of the " Bureaucrat in Bondage " story .
That means that there is still time to enter the competition .
If some minor functionary has made your life hell send me his name and the reason he pissed you off .
At the end I will pick two male and two female candidates and use them to generate composite names for the two victims of the story .
The winners will have the story mailed directly to them and with a nifty text editor you could make it a customised revenge fantasy of your very own !!!!
This section is dedicated to Hunter Rose who has been a great help during the past couple of years .
Not only has he provided the BISH images that accompany most of the story sections , he has also frequently reposted the story when I 've been unavailable .
This section contains some ideas we spoke about nearly two years ago .
I hope he likes what I did with it .

Tom Quin ============================================================
First up we now have an FTP site thanks to the people at the English Palace BBS .
The previous Caroline sections can be got from http://www.palace.com and are placed in the newusers library ( ie the public part of the board ) .
No associated images this time though there will be before this section goes on the web .
Still no news on the website .

Captured Caroline . by Quin ======================
Chapter 11 : " French Lessons " =========================
I wandered into the kitchen thinking again of Maggie 's predicament .
She 'd always been impulsive , liable to go off and do strange things for no good reason .
This would n't be the first time I 'd been forced to bail her out when things got out of hand .
An image of her bound and gagged flittered through my mind and I was suddenly and unexpectedly hard .
Wow !
On one level I realized it was wrong ; here was a long time friend in an embarrassing and potentially dangerous situation .
I should n't be getting off on it but it was such a turn on I simply could n't help myself .
I could imagine her lying there , wrists raw from her frantic struggles , body coated in sweat .
At first she would have been too embarrassed to call for help -- after all she would n't want the neighbors to find her like this .
But as she tired and that knot of fear grew in her gut , she would have abandoned any thought for her dignity .
After all , survival is of primary importance .
I suppose she would have tried screaming first , but the gag was so tight I 'd had problems hearing her close to a phone .
Then as her neighbors started to leave for work and she could hear them passing her door , I could imagine her desperate attempts to attract their attention -- the thrashing about , the gagged screams too quiet to be heard , then finally that desperate , frantic phone call .
The drama of it appealed to me .
The reality , the danger , it was like our little adventure of last night .
There had been something , perhaps her look of humiliation in the slut outfit , or the risk of discovery in the elevator , that had given the experience more of a kick .
Whatever it was , it seemed to be missing from my relationship with Caroline .
Do n't get me wrong ; nothing in my life compared with the immense thrill of the kidnapping .
The first time I 'd raped Caroline as she lay there bound and helpless --- when I 'd felt her struggles , heard her gagged moans I 'd been in ecstasy , but after that it had started to become a little tame .
I still got a huge kick out of just having her .
She was young , sexy , beautiful and completely in my power .
I was in control freak heaven .
I could degrade her anyway I liked ; I was the one with the Power .
It was the ultimate geek 's fantasy .
I had a pretty blonde cheerleader tied up in my basement .
Yet strangely enough , bondage sex with my real prisoner did not seem as real as my little act with Maggie .
I think it 's lack of spontaneity .
Although I keep Caroline bound and gagged most of the time , it 's mainly for show .
She spends her days locked behind an armored door in a sound - proof room ; escape is impossible and the bonds are overkill .
I thought again of Maggie lying helplessly in her room .
In her case the bonds were real , the cuffs constrained her , the gag stole her voice and any chance of rescue .
And that rescue is so tantalizingly close .
. .
I looked at my watch .
Two hours I 'd told Maggie .
Two hours if I 'd been ready in my car .
Two hours if I did eighty all the way and dodged the state troopers .
Two hours if I did n't have a slave to feed .
She would understand my lateness , I was sure .
Then a strange thought struck me .
Suppose I was killed in a car accident on my way to save Maggie ?
I realized immediately that both girls would be doomed .
Maggie would eventually be found when the police searched her apartment , but Caroline ?
Caroline would die of starvation alone and helpless and the chances were her body would never be found .
Strangely , I found the thought thrilling ; to think that two other human beings were so dependent on me that they would die if I did .
What a feeling of Power !
Caroline . . .
To be honest , I could n't think about Caroline without feeling a little numb .
I can't really say that I was emotionally drained ; I am by nature and training an analytical person , and emotion does n't come easily to me .
But the horrors of that attic room continued to haunt me as I started the coffee and began to prepare breakfast .
I forced myself to analyze the situation in depth , going backwards and forwards over a tale that seemed more and more incredible .
Last night when she had first told me the story , I had believed her completely .
But now in the cold light of day I started to doubt .
I suppose I did n't want to believe that a father could do this to his own daughter , and instead I started to wonder if this was some elaborate hoax .
At first I could n't see a motive for such a flagrant lie .
Then the cynical part of my brain found a reason -- to somehow shame me into freeing her .
Of course , that must be it !
I could almost imagine her lying there alone in the dark , concocting a story loaded with all the abhorrent images her psych training had taught her .
She was just trying to manipulate me , trying to escape .
Happy to find an explanation , I started to pick holes in her story .
One thing hit me immediately ; surely such torture as she had described would leave scars , huge horrible scars like in the movies .
No scars meant no torture , which meant she was playing me for a sucker !
Suddenly I felt very angry .
I wanted to go down there and introduce her to the lash , help put that added bit of realism into her story .
. .
Then I wondered just why the lying bitch should have a breakfast when poor Maggie was all alone and helpless .
Alone and helpless .
. .
Then , an evil thought struck me .
My old accomplice Fate had once again delivered me a wonderful opportunity , if I chose to take it .
Of course it would be expensive , but as I 'd pointed out to Caroline taking a slave was far from cheap .
As the plan started to form , a gut - level thrill went through me , and I started putting together a list of things I 'd need .
I was tempted to forget about Caroline and let the bitch fend for herself , but in the end I relented and decided to make her a health drink for breakfast .
After all , I did want to put her on a diet and I 'd already decided to give her low residue foods while I was away in Seattle .
The image of a helpless Maggie flashed through the window of my mind .
Yes , it would be worth it .
My hand shook as I took some Gatorade and a box of protein powder and loaded up the blender .
For my plan to work I needed to get to Boston * fast * .
Fortunately , I knew a way .
All I needed to do was make a few phone calls and find something for Caroline to do this morning .
The calls were the easy part .
Traveling as much as I do has a few advantages , one of which is that lots of hotel chains and car rental agencies see you as a valued customer .
They 're more than willing to provide an extra service for you , rather than lose you to a more compliant competitor .
Fifteen minutes later and everything was ready .
Now all that was left was Caroline .
I went downstairs with the protein shake and a flask of coffee .
I paused at the table and retrieved some new clothes and restraints .
Then I crumbled a contraceptive pill into her coffee cup and topped it up .
So far she had n't noticed anything wrong , and soon I 'd start ordering her to take it , adding her reproductive ability ( or inability , as it were ) to the things under my obvious control .
She was still asleep when I went inside .
I was tempted to shake her awake and have it out with her right then , but common sense finally fought through .
Instead of waking her , I put the cup on the dresser and bent down to examine her naked crotch .
I had been right about the stubble -- she would need a shave soon -- but of more interest to me were her pussy lips .
Very gently , so as not to disturb her , I examined the folds .
Even in the dim light , I could see a series of irregular pockmarked scars about a sixteenth of an inch from the edge .
As I looked closely at the tiny pits , I felt my stomach turn .
Any doubts I still had evaporated as those scars , so exactly like the ones from a hypodermic , told me that the " butterfly board " was real .
Gently I examined the other side , noticing the corresponding marks that showed how the needle had gone right through the delicate membranes .
Above me , she moaned , her tongue darting quickly across her other lips .
There was already the suggestion of moisture in her cunt from my handling of her pussy lips , and her nipples had started to harden again .
Then I realized what agony it must have been for her ; to be this sensitive and for him to do * that . *
I was n't surprised that she 'd told him about Josh -- in a similar situation , I 'd have done anything to stop the pain .
I felt a momentary flash of guilt for having doubted her , so I reached over and gently stroked her cheek .
She woke slowly , smiling as she attempted to stretch then found that she could n't .
For an instant she seemed puzzled , then she remembered .
Her eyes flickered open .
I smiled at her .
" Time to wake up , lazy bones . "
Surprisingly , she smiled back .
" Hi Master . "
" Not yet , but the day is still young , " I said flippantly , and slapped her bottom .
I helped her up and we went through the coffee and toilet ritual .
She seemed happy ; our first therapy session together appeared to have relaxed her .
I knew that she had n't told me everything , though .
Her story had stopped soon after Josh 's death , with three whole years of horror left .
One thing I did find out last night was that the Reverend Conway could pack a lot of suffering into a year .
The thing I most wanted to know was how she 'd escaped .
Had she run away ?
Did that explain her destitute condition and lack of letters home ?
I needed to know before I posted something out of character to her family and gave the game away .
Still , that could wait .
She seemed much better than last night and I started to feel happier with the idea of leaving her alone for a while .
I led her into the dungeon and removed the posture collar from her neck , replacing her old collar .
After I chained her to the table I removed the rest of the single sleeve and smiled again .
" Ok , get naked ! "
She did n't hesitate , stripping off the remaining latex in moments .
I circled her body , admiring her slim athletic build and small but perfect breasts .
I had come to appreciate just what a find she was and I could understand why any man would kill to keep her .
I tossed her some leather cuffs which she put on without comment .
To put on the ankle cuffs , she put one foot at a time on the bondage chair and bent over , and I took the opportunity to look at her back carefully .
The lines were faint , so faint that I was n't surprised I had missed them .
These were not the vivid scars so beloved of Hollywood , and I suspected that Conway had been very careful to ensure that all tell - tale wounds healed properly .
Yet faint as they , were the scars were there .
It was more support for her story .
By now she was waiting expectantly , so I handed her the shake .
" What 's this ? " she asked , looking at the concoction with some distaste .
" Breakfast , " I said .
" Michael Jordan 's secret recipe .
Denis would * kill * to know what 's in it . "
She looked blank .
" Not a big basketball fan then ? " I asked .
Again getting no reply I went for the less subtle approach .
" Just drink it , slave .
It 's all the meal you 're getting this morning . "
" Why ?
Have I upset you in some way ? " she asked , almost fearfully .
" Because if I did I 'm sorry . . . "
" No , it 's just healthier than the cooked breakfast .
Now drink the fucking shake ! "
She chugged it down .
I got the feeling that she was trying to avoid any confrontation , which suited me fine .
Most of the last few days had revolved around her , a situation that could n't continue if I wanted to keep working .
Now was the obvious time to acquaint her with the lowliness of her new position ; that as a slave , she was just a possession like any other and had only a limited influence on my life .
Once the shake was finished I clipped her wrists to her collar and began to dress her .
First up came a black leather bondage belt .
This was about three or four inches wide with rings equally spaced around it .
It had buckles on the front and a small catch , and after tightening it firmly about her narrow waist I locked it in place with a padlock .
She did n't struggle or even comment -- cuffs , gags and chains were a part of her life now , and I think she 'd started to accept that .
Once the belt was locked in place I helped her on to the table and used cord and straps to tie her down .
As before , I strapped her with her legs parted and her pussy exposed .
I wished I had the time to shave her twat again but I had a lot to do and the clock was ticking .
Once Caroline was secure I reached over and took a packet from the table .
The packet took some opening as it was designed to keep its contents sterile .
After a struggle I finally got it open and was able to remove the catheter .
This was a small hollow tube surrounded by an inflatable surgical balloon .
I looked for a reaction but it was obvious she did n't recognize it .
She was still wearing the training harness , so after a little thought I reached over and pushed the ball against those cherry lips .
She opened immediately and I pushed the gag in , loosely fastening it just enough to hold it in place .
Then , using a small jar of lube , I greased the end of the catheter and parted her pussy lips .
Her clit had already started to swell and as I gently pushed it out of the way her whole body trembled .
Very carefully , I placed the catheter against her urethra and pushed .
A muffled squeal erupted from the far end of the table , and her hips quaked as her body fought against the imprisoning bonds .
The thin tube slid home into her bladder , and I slowly inflated the balloon the small amount needed to seal it in place .
Then I removed the pump and waited for her to calm down .
Needless to say this took a while , but eventually she was ready for the next stage .
I call the device a McGuffin .
It 's a small oval piece of latex a little bigger than a woman 's labia .
One side is plain , and the other is studded with electrodes and small piezo - electric buzzers .
This particular one had been designed for use with the catheter and had a small hole between the cluster of electrodes for the clit and those for the rest of the pussy .
Sliding it down the tube , I gently moved it into best contact .
At the other end of the table the moans started again .
Once it was in position , I sealed it in place using surgical tape , then released Caroline .
She stood a little uncertainly ; it must be odd for a woman to suddenly find a pipe between her legs , and she struggled a bit more than usual as I covered the arrangement with a special pair of spandex pants .
I used a locking belt to fasten the pants in place then started to apply electrodes to her breasts .
She struggled and moaned into the gag as I stuck a couple of other McGuffins on top if each nipple .
I finished up with an spandex athletic bra just like those in the shops except modified to lock in place .
Then I removed the gag .
" What are you doing . . . Master ? "
" Careful , slave .
You almost bought yourself a punishment ! "
Her eyes were wide .
" Is n't this a punishment ? " I laughed and kissed her forehead .
" Why , have you done anything wrong ? "
She thought for a while .
" Not as far as I know . "
" Then why should I punish you ? "
It seemed straightforward to me , but then Conway had never needed a reason to punish her .
I smiled .
" I have to go somewhere and I need to keep you busy while I 'm gone .
Trust me , all will be revealed ! "
She squirmed .
" That thing .
. .it's uncomfortable . "
" Yep , it is . "
I pushed her back onto the table and locked a pair of shoes with sensible heels on her dainty little feet .
Realizing she was n't going to get any sympathy , she pouted for a while , then seemed to realize that she was ungagged and could talk .
She looked up .
" Master ? " she asked softly .
I stopped for a moment .
" Yes slave ? " " Can we talk about your mother ? "
I was puzzled but willing to play along .
" I suppose so . "
" Do. . . do you love your mother ? "
That caught me by surprise .
To be honest , my mother was a bit of a bitch .
While my father was tending the store , she 'd ruled our household like a petty tyrant .
When it had become clear that I was .
. . different . . . she had pushed me towards greater and greater academic achievement .
If for some reason I did n't jump a grade or score better than anyone else on a test , she wanted to know why .
Thinking back on it , if it had n't been for my grandfather 's gentle but firm insistence on letting me have some free time to myself , I do n't believe I would have had a childhood at all .
It was my belief that most of my problems with women had come from her ; my desire for sexual dominance , my status as a power freak , was a subconscious backlash against her total domination of my childhood .
" Of course I love her , " I said , and it was true .
After all , you 'd have to be really screwed up not to love your mother .
She gulped a bit .
" If something .
. . bad was going to happen to her , something you could prevent , you 'd do it , right ? "
I attached the leash to her collar and led her over to part of the dungeon near the cell .
" Yes , " I said .
Caroline seemed to prefer straight answers .
The floodgates opened .
" Please , you have to let me go or he 'll kill her , " she begged .
" He 'll kill my mother ? "
Needless to say , I was shocked .
" NO !
He 'll kill my mother ! " she wailed .
I stopped .
" When did we start talking about your mother ? " I said , sounding confused .
In the back of my mind I could imagine the laugh track , like this was some weird sitcom .
In my head I could almost hear the intro -- ' New this fall , the hilarious new show " Master and Slave , " coming soon on NBC !
Richard Cody , successful author , kidnaps a girl and keeps her in his basement -- you 'll be rolling with laughter as he tries to keep this fact secret from friends and family , often with hilarious results ! '
" Perhaps if you start again , " I said smoothly .
" Who 's going to kill who and why ? "
She took a deep , halting breath .
" Momma wanted me to go to college , but at first my father would n't let me , " she said .
" Then she talked him around , but he said he was going to call me every week .
If I ran away or if he found out I 'd told anyone , he 'd kill her and then himself - - " " How could he find out ? " I asked , annoyed .
" That 's stupid , he can't be keeping track of you all the time . "
She shook her head .
" He has friends in the police , lodge buddies , he says they 'd warn him if the police started getting interested in him .
He 'll do it , I know he will ! "
So she had n't escaped him .
She was still as much his prisoner now as she had been in that attic .
Conway still had her on a tight leash ; only the nature of the chain and its length were different .
While I could believe that he had contacts in local law enforcement and even see how they might tip him off , there was no way he could have everything covered .
Then I looked at Caroline and saw the fear in those blue eyes , and I realized it did n't have to make sense as long as * SHE * believed it .
Still , I was intrigued enough to want to know more .
" So he let you leave town on the understanding that he was to know where you are and that you were to keep quiet about the things he did , " I said .
She nodded and looked down .
I reached over and forced her to look at me .
" What if he were to order you back ? "
She sniffed .
" I had to come at once . "
" He specifically told you that ? "
She nodded again .
" He said that if I disobeyed , it would be Momma who was punished because it was her idea . "
Somehow I did n't think he would limit the punishment to just the mother .
So he 'd let Caroline go .
Suddenly , the alarm bells in the back of my mind were on overload .
One thing I 'd learned was that he did nothing without a reason , and I knew for sure was that whatever that reason was , it had n't been to please his slave wife .
No , if Charles Conway had allowed Caroline out of town then he had something in mind and from experience it was n't going to be pleasant .
Conway 's plans tended to be pretty straight - forward .
He did n't mislead or bluff ; instead , he relied on using his position in the local community to best effect .
I was sure that had the Conways not been the family of the local minister , someone would have spotted the abuse long before now .
But then , as Caroline had said , who would suspect the nicest man in town ?
Hell , even I 'd thought she was lying .
I guess people just do n't want to believe something like that .
I analyzed the problem .
I could see no obvious benefit for getting her out of town , but then I did n't have all the data he did .
However I knew there was a reason and it would be obvious from Conway 's point of view .
Then something else popped into my head .
" Hey , wait a minute !
If he 's told you that he intends to call you back , then what was that ' offer ' of yours ? "
" My offer was good . "
" Bullshit !
If he called you back to Iowa , how could you have been my slave here ?
You lied , you little bitch . "
She flushed .
" I do n't think he 'll call .
I 've been away almost eight months and I 've been able to avoid going home even during vacations .
He has n't said anything .
I 'm almost free . "
I shook my head .
" No you 're not .
He 's just played out the line a little , that 's all .
He has every intention of reeling you back . "
A look of fear crossed her face .
" Oh no .
I mean , he would n't - -" " He would , " I said harshly .
" My guess is he was going to do it soon , otherwise he'd have given you some more money . "
" I do n't see . . . "
" You 're on a scholarship , right ? "
She nodded .
" What is it , a hundred percent of tuition costs ? "
She nodded again , a worried look spreading across her face .
" And he pays for your rent , food and things .
I mean , he gives you money for that . "
" Yes , " she whispered .
" Let me tell you what 's happened and you correct me if I 'm wrong .
He 's never really given you enough to live on , so it 's always been a struggle .
He 's said something about working your way through college builds character .
He has n't worried when your grades have suffered as a result .
Recently , he 's sent you even less money , and he 's been making noises about coming for a visit . "
By now the look of alarm had turned almost to panic .
" Next month .
But how . . . "
" I 'm afraid it 's obvious .
He 's coming to get you to take you back , " I said .
Her face filled with horror .
" Back . . . "
" Probably straight back to the attic , so that he can purge you of any independent thoughts . "
" NO ! " she shrieked .
" Please God , NO !
I 've left , I 'm independent .
Never again !
Oh , God , never again ! "
" You never left , " I said sadly .
" He wanted you out of the way for some reason .
He never had any intention of letting you finish that course . "
I continued to lead her gently towards the far corner of the dungeon .
" You see , if you fail or he brings you back , the tuition fee will be wasted but he does n't care because he 's not paying it .
The maintenance fee is something he * does * pay , which is why he 's keeping it as cheap as possible .
That 's why he never gave you enough money , and he has n't sent you any more because he knows you wo n't be needing it .
Besides , he figures you may fear the attic more than what he 'll do to Momma , so the less money you have , the less chance there is that you 'll run . "
The tears streamed down her face .
" No ! " she screamed , " you 're just saying that so you do n't have to let me go !
He could n't . . .* I can't ! * "
I looked her in the eye .
" Slave , I do n't have to let you go .
Even if he was intending to flay your mother alive , it 's no skin off my nose . "
I winced at the subconscious pun .
" What I mean is , I 'm the only one who has no problem being honest with you because I * know * what you 're going to do . "
" And that is ? " " Exactly what * I * tell you , " I said .
She looked down deep in misery .
By now we had come to the far corner and a couple of items which were covered by dust sheets .
Still sniffing , she looked at them with some trepidation , probably thinking they were some arcane torture device .
And in fact she was right , as she saw when I pulled the sheet aside .
I 'd seen this thing on a late night infomercial about a year ago .
It was an exercise machine that looked like a cross between a bicycle and a rowing machine .
You sit on it and while your legs turn some pedals your arms pull the handles towards you .
I used it successfully until I moved into the house and had access to a dedicated multigym , at which point I moved the machine down here .
Of course , I had to modify it for its use as a slave trainer .
First , I welded extra cross members to the frame , to strengthen it and make sure it could n't collapse .
Then I added some mounting points for restraints .
Finally I attached some accelerometers and tension gauges so that the computer could monitor its use .
She looked stunned .
" I said you needed exercise , " I said cheerfully .
" Please no !
We need to talk about Momma . . . I need to talk . "
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't have time .
Now do what you 're told or I 'll find something even more uncomfortable to keep you occupied . "
She lowered her head and sobbed once , then nodded .
I removed the gag trainer and helped her on to the machine .
I fastened her right wrist to a small length of chain attached to the handles .
I needed to leave one hand free for drinking , so I made sure it was n't her ' good ' one .
Finally she spoke .
" Why did he let me go if he was going to bring me back ? "
" He has a reason , " I said .
" The fact that we can't figure it out does n't mean it does n't exist . "
" But my Momma said - - " " She said what she wanted to believe , or what * he* wanted her to believe .
Ask yourself this : how could she persuade him to do anything not in his own interest ?
Can she withdraw sex ?
Can she go away ?
Can she even have a fight with him ? "
" I never thought . . . I mean , I was just so happy to be leaving . "
By now I 'd fastened the bondage belt to chains coming from the seat so that she could n't stand up .
Then as she sat thinking , I used small chains to secure her feet and ankle cuffs to the pedals .
Once she was strapped down I started with the rest .
I attached a small box to the back of the bondage belt .
This had a number of wires which I connected to the electrodes on her body and to the McGuffins .
She sobbed a little .
" I 'll never get away , ever . "
" You are away , " I said lightly , " and you 're never going back . "
She looked at me , her eyes full of a curious mixture of hope and fear .
" But my Momma ? " " I have an idea , " I said .
" But it will require your complete co-operation . "
" Anything , " she said .
" You said that before and did n't mean it . "
" To save my Momma , anything ! " she said firmly .
" Good girl , " I said , smiling .
Always praise the slave when she does well .
I put a sweat band on her left wrist and showed her the small table with the water containers on it , then made the final connections .
I fastened a small hose to the end of the catheter that poked through the pants .
This ended in a bucket behind the machine .
I got her to pee and confirmed that there were no leaks and that the amber liquid flowed easily into the container .
Finally , it was time for the final piece .
I showed her the light weight VR helmet before I put it on her so that she was n't too frightened .
I 'd modified the basic unit quite a bit to ensure that it could n't be removed or tampered with , but in essence it is similar in design to the ones Sega sells .
The only real technical difference was that it uses a flat CRT rather that an LCD module .
After I told her what it was for , she seemed happy for me to strap it on her .
The helmet would display a crude VR environment for her to cycle through .
The virtual course was divided into sections .
If she made the sections on time , the McGuffins would reward her with a little sexual stimulation .
Failure meant a shock .
At random intervals she would hear my voice giving her some new instructions .
Obedience meant reward , and she figured out what happened if she disobeyed .
Happy that she was set , I kissed her cheek for luck and started the program .
Once she was started , I looked at my watch and cursed .
My schedule was slipping .
Locking the dungeon door behind me I ran upstairs .
First up was the utility room and the pile of dirty clothes from the last week .
Rooting around , I finally found the sweats I 'd worn during the kidnapping .
As I hoped they smelt of old sweat and dirt , with perhaps a hint of Caroline 's perfume .
There was still a ski mask in the pocket which I 'd intended to wear .
I thought again of how I rushed out and took her .
I must have been insane .
I opened one of the closets and got out a huge duffel bag .
When I 'd been working through the kidnapping I 'd toyed with the idea of carrying Caroline out of her apartment block in this .
I 'd come to the conclusion that it could work but would look so unusual that it was bound to be remembered .
So the idea was discarded , but I 'd kept the bag .
In went the sweats , some sneakers and a couple of rolls of duct tape .
Charging through into the kitchen I added some Saran wrap and a small pile of Ace bandages .
Last stop was my office .
I found the DAT recorder straight away but could n't find a blank tape .
Searching my desk drawers , I finally found one and as an unexpected bonus a bottle of a cheap and very nasty aftershave someone had bought me one Christmas .
Everything went into the bag .
As a final thought I threw in my Powerbook and portable printer .
As I did n't have time to change out of my master 's outfit of shirt and leather pants , I pulled on my favorite leather flying jacket so that at least my clothes matched .
Still cursing the clock , I charged to the back of the house and waited by the back door .
By now Caroline would be part through the first section .
Soon she would be getting her first taste of the obedience test .
Not being a cruel man I 'd decided to help her out .
Every time my voice gave her an order the helmet would briefly flash the word " OBEY , " driving the command subliminally into her subconscious mind .
She was so suggestible , I was certain she would make a good subject .
By the time I came home her mind would be a little closer to being mine .
I was still thrilling at the thought of it when the helicopter landed on the back lawn .
I grabbed the duffel bag , locked the door and ran out .
I climbed in .
" Mr Cody ? " the pilot asked .
The guy looked like the chopper pilots you see on TV -- short haircut , aviator shades , baseball cap and a huge pair of headphones .
" Yes , " I bawled , trying desperately to be heard .
He offered his hand .
" Bob Wilson -- I 'll be your pilot today . "
He showed me how to fasten the harness .
I put on the headset he gave me and was relieved when the wall of sound subsided .
" I was told you want to go to Boston ? "
" Yes , a panic business meeting .
I need to get there ASAP . "
" Understood , Mr Cody .
ASAP is the only way we work around here . "
Bob seemed a pleasant enough fellow .
I got the feeling that perhaps some of his customers were n't that comfortable flying , as he had this patter worked out where he gave a running commentary on everything he was doing .
He kept cracking jokes and making light of the fact that we were shooting cross country at better than 100 miles an hour .
For the most part I let him talk while mentally building up checklists of things to do .
I was so distracted that it seemed like no time before we were setting down at a small private airfield just outside Boston .
Thanking Bob and giving him a generous tip for his speed , I started across the grass towards the control tower .
Nearby a pretty brown haired girl stood near the driver 's side door of a Chevy mini van .
Her blue blazer and sensible gray skirt identified her as a representative of a well known rental agency .
I was looking at the grass for most of the time in order to shield my head from the wash of the departing helicopter , and when I looked up I got a shock .
For an instant I thought the girl was gagged ; it seemed that a large red ball had been pulled between her teeth .
As I got closer I realized it was just imagination .
She smiled and stepped forward , offering her hand .
" Mr Cody .
I must say you know how to make a spectacular entrance . "
I looked her over .
She was perhaps three or four years older than Caroline , with large , almost luminous gray eyes .
She wore her hair in a business - like shoulder - length bob .
Her makeup was conservative , except perhaps for her lipstick which was a shocking red .
Suddenly I realized what had just happened -- the color was the same as the one Caroline used , one I 'd deliberately picked to match the red of her ballgag .
Mental association , or something more ?
In that split second I checked out her ring hand , the state of her shoes and her name badge .
Her name was Penny Jackson , she was single and quite junior in the company , which was probably why she was delivering cars to the middle of nowhere .
" I 'm afraid I 'm in a bit of a hurry , Penny , " I said warmly .
" Do you have the agreement ? " " Oh yes , sorry . "
She smiled again and I watched as her pupils dilated slightly .
Penny was young and easily impressed .
I was probably the closest thing to a celebrity she 'd ever met , and if I was interested I was sure I could score quite easily .
We went though the formalities with little difficulty , since membership has its privileges and a platinum card speaks very loudly .
I offered her a lift back to Boston but with some regret she pointed to another car parked nearby with a bored looking young man behind the wheel .
Still , I took her business card so that I could arrange pickup later , then I threw the duffel bag in the back and headed for town .
On the way in I daydreamed ; pretty little Penny bound , gagged and struggling .
Penny and Caroline , girl to girl .
Of course any thoughts I had of adding her to my little harem were just a fantasy , although the thought of a brunette to round out my collection was quite tempting .
With some difficulty I refocused on Maggie .
It was now over an hour since I received the call , but my two hour estimate had been very optimistic , something Maggie would have realized .
Bottom line was that I could now reach her apartment long before she was expecting me .
Now was time to finalize the plan .
The core idea of the plan was fairly simple : Maggie is bound and helpless in her apartment waiting the two or more hours it will take for Richard Cody , her trusted friend , to speed to her rescue from the backwoods of darkest New England .
However , before he gets there she has an unexpected visitor in the form of a sneak thief who happens upon her as he 's turning over her apartment .
There she is , helpless and in a sexually provocative position with a complete stranger .
Well , not exactly a complete stranger .
. .
The reason I 'd rushed to Boston was so that I could play the intruder .
Maggie was fairly smart and being a practical joker herself she was likely to smell a setup .
I was hoping that the ' stranger ' arriving so early -- long before I could be expected to show up -- would sell it to her .
Unfortunately I was likely to blow the plan the moment I opened my mouth .
I 'm fairly good at accents but the basic tone of my voice remains the same .
I experimented with different voices as I fought the traffic but it was still no good .
Then I had a revelation .
If I were a foreigner , then I might stand a better chance of pulling it off .
Broken English with a scattering of foreign words and expressions might just disguise my voice enough .
In addition , it gave me a good excuse not to say that much in English .
I speak six languages , four fairly fluently .
The obvious choice was Spanish but I knew that Maggie spoke it too and could probably spot my accent .
Russian would be good , especially with all the news coverage the Russian Mafia have been getting lately .
The problem was , Maggie knew I spoke Russian .
In the end I settled on French ; internally it made more sense anyway , what with Quebec only a few miles to the north .
I would be a French Canadian burglar , down in Boston to pull a few jobs before heading north again .
I practiced the accent , trying hard to lower my voice a little .
In my mind he started to form , taking on more and more substance as I worked out a back story .
I stopped and wondered if she deserved it , but the twenty - first birthday thing had only been one of the awful practical jokes she 'd pulled on me and payback was long overdue .
I checked into a mid-priced motel about three blocks from Maggie 's apartment building .
I had a reservation so things went relatively smoothly .
I shot the guy on the desk a line about needing a quiet place to work in and a large tip got me a room in the next block with no neighbors .
With time now a factor , I went inside and got set up .
For the most part this involved getting changed into the sweats I 'd brought , slapping on some of the aftershave and recording a couple of things on the DAT machine .
I placed a call to Maggie 's department at the university and told them that she had a bad headache and would n't be in today .
They accepted it easily , since her job was pure research with few teaching commitments .
I unloaded the things I would n't need from the duffel bag and set off .
I had a copy of Maggie 's key , an arrangement that dated from the time I lived in Boston .
I do n't know if she even remembered giving it to me but it would make things a lot easier .
Like the night before , I entered the basement car park and found Maggie 's space .
Then I hoisted the duffel bag over my shoulder and headed to the lift .
The trip up was uneventful and this time there were no interruptions apart from the hideous muzac they seemed to play during the day .
I reached Maggie 's floor without disturbance and was relieved to find that the corridor outside her apartment was empty .
Pausing outside , I deliberately fumbled with the lock for a few minutes .
I can actually pick locks , a skill I learned at MIT , but it took some time and though I wanted to give the impression I was breaking in , I did n't want to chance her neighbors calling the cops .
Finally , I inserted the key in the lock and waited .
I had the ski mask in my pocket and I could have put it on , but again knowing my luck someone would come past right then .
I took a deep breath .
If Maggie had decided to tie herself in the living room then all this trouble and expense would be for nothing .
Gently , I opened the door and went inside .
The room was dark as the drapes were still drawn , and it took a few minutes for my eyes to adjust .
By the dim light of the one working lamp , I could see that the room was pretty much as I 'd left it last night .
Maggie was n't there .
Taking the DAT machine from my pocket I quickly rewound the tape , deliberately making noise as I circled the room .
When the tape was rewound and I was sure that any occupant of the apartment had heard me , I pushed play and set the machine on the coffee table .
A shaft of light shone from beneath the bedroom door .
As I drew closer , I could hear faint movement inside .
I took another deep breath , pulled on the ski mask and quietly opened the door .
Maggie lay on the bed .
When she heard the door open , she made a supreme effort to sit up .
She was dressed in the hooker outfit I 'd bought her , all shiny leather and PVC .
As she managed to face the door , I realized that the ski mask was unnecessary .
Her eyes were covered with the light padded blindfold I 'd bought .
Her mouth chewed on the ballgag , and she groaned and thrust her crotch up into the air , making suggestive little mewing noises .
Then I realized that she had no way to measure time .
To her it must have seemed like several hours since the call .
She obviously thought it was me and her waving hips were a clear invitation .
As I got closer I admired her handiwork .
She had used a good part of the cord I 'd bought to tie her ankles to a broom handle as an improvised spreader bar .
Her wrists were pinioned behind her back , I assumed with the handcuffs .
A small length of yellow cable came through a gap at her zipped crotch and ended in a small battery box .
" Hummmph , " she moaned .
" Merde ! " I knew immediately that I 'd hit the right tone perfectly .
Maggie stiffened .
As I 'd intended , she was surprised by the response .
The first part of convincing her I was a stranger had begun .
I muttered a few things in French about who had done this and what was going on .
Getting no indication of comprehension , I felt it was safe to come closer .
Hearing me , she started struggling in earnest but it was obvious she was n't going anywhere .
For my imaginary stranger , the French Canadian burglar , there was only one question : " Etes-vous seule ? " I demanded .
" Hummphh . . . UM Iee Eeee . " " Pardon ? " " Hummm . " " Oui ....... le baillon !
Errr , Mademoiselle . . . you must promise .
No noise , oui ? "
She paused , then nodded so I reached behind her head and released the strap .
As with Caroline , I left it dangling around her neck .
" Water , " she croaked , so I poured a glass from the jug by her bedside and held it to her lips .
She drank greedily for a few seconds , then started sniffing near my sleeve .
The smell of sweat and cheap cologne hung in the air .
This was not a Cody smell , and yet another part of my deception was established .
I put the glass down and we waited a while , the room quiet but for the insistent sound of the off hook telephone .
Reaching down , I picked it up from the floor and replaced the handset , then noisily placed the phone back on the bedside table .
She jumped and ' looked ' around nervously .
I felt she was starting to buy my act .
" Please can you untie me ? " she asked , twisting her shoulders around so as to get her bound hands as close to me as possible .
I could see I 'd been right about the handcuffs .
I could also see what a struggle she 'd had .
The once glossy surface of the PVC gloves near her wrist had been worn away .
In fact , the cheap gloves had been what had kept her prisoner ; they had slipped during her struggles but only enough to stop any chance of her working her wrists free of the cuffs .
" C'est . . . it is impossible , handcuffs .
No key , eh ? "
" The key is on the bed somewhere . "
I looked and after a while I found it under a pillow .
She seemed to sense this because she thrust her arms towards me .
I reached down to the cuffs -- and closed them an extra click .
" What are you doing ? "
Her voice had that edge of panic that I liked .
" My job , " I said off handedly and reached for the gag .
" No please . . . who are you ? "
At last , the question I 'd been waiting for .
" How you say -- le cambrioleur ? " " I 'm sorry ? " " Le burglar ...?
My gloved hand covered her mouth just as she was about to scream .
A faint shriek came out and she struggled wildly but her position was hopeless .
I grabbed the ball and started to bring it up to her mouth ; a gagged Maggie could ask no questions and so reduce the amount of talking * I* needed to do .
Sensing I was about to silence her again she started struggling and shaking her head .
For my own reasons I would need to work on the gag soon anyway so I decided that " le cambrioleur " should have a change of heart .
" Mademoiselle , please . "
She stopped struggling .
" I will leave . . .le baillon ? "
I tugged at the strap until she realized what I was trying to say .
" The gag ? " " Oui .
No baillon if you quiet until I am gone . "
She understood and nodded .
I removed the gag from around her neck and pocketed it .
Then I started to noisily search the rooms .
Maggie did n't have much , almost all her unspectacular pay went towards the future purchase of her dream house .
In addition she was a bit of an intellectual elitist and shunned such items as a TV .
Consequently , her apartment had little a burglar would find interesting .
But I stayed in character and searched the place methodically while she struggled on the bed .
Two things I did check was the availability of Saran Wrap in the kitchen and that she had bandages in the bathroom cabinet .
I had brought my own , but I did n't want to give the game away by using something unusual that she knew was n't in the house .
" Please , " she called .
" I need the toilet ? "
That was good because I needed her to go anyway , so with much gallic swearing I undid the spreader .
I found the rope looser than I expected -- she was probably only minutes away from freeing her legs .
I gathered up the loose cord and tied it to the leather collar she wore and using it as a leash guided her to the bathroom .
I reached between her legs and opened the zipper and was rewarded by the smell of hot pussy .
Removing the vibrator , I noted the dampness of her crotch .
She turned a bright beet root color from the embarrassment but the sight of her erect nipples as they pushed through the peepholes in the leather cups gave the game away .
The little slut was getting turned on !
Like Caroline , she seemed to get quite uncomfortable having me watch while she peed , but in the end she had to put up with it .
Then I dried her and led her back to the bedroom .
" Please , you should leave now , my boyfriend will be back soon . "
I grunted .
" This boyfriend , he tie you ? "
She turned red again .
" Yes , it 's a sex game , you know ?
He only stepped out for some cigarettes .
He 'll be back soon . "
I let the sentence hang in the air a while as if I was considering it .
" Non , you lie .
If boyfriend tie , * he* would have key . " " But - - " I placed a gloved finger to her lips .
" Shussh ! " I took her head and forced her to nod and then shake .
" Just this , eh ? "
She nodded .
" Magnetoscope , stereo ? "
She shook her head .
" You have jewels ?
A safe ? "
She shook her head again .
I went through her purse checking credit and cash cards .
" The cards , tell me the numbers ! "
She stiffened .
I knew one of these was the dream house account and contained almost all the money she had made in her life .
I had the feeling that she would n't give me that without a fight .
Pursing her lip , she shook her head .
" C'est la vie ! " I said and stuffed the gag back into her mouth .
She complained , but there was little she could do .
She fought a little when I removed the thigh high boots and tied her ankles to the bed , but the blindfold kept her from seeing just what I had planned .
I went to the linen closet and removed what I needed .
At the first touch of the feather duster against the bare soles of her feet she gave a strange little gurgling sound .
Soon the room was full of muffled laughter .
She thrashed around as much as the bonds allowed and the first tears started to creep from behind the blindfold .
I was glad she 'd used the toilet because by now I was sure she 'd lost all body control .
I 'd left the zipper open and gradually started moving the duster up her legs , against her thigh , her pussy lips .
She went crazy in a strange flux between being tickled and turned on .
Her gagged voice begged for mercy but I was relentless , working her over until all the fight had been laughed out of her .
The duster danced over her body , driving her more and more wild , pushing her way beyond any reasonable limit .
Then when she was almost completely out of her mind I stopped .
" Enough ? " I asked .
She nodded weakly .
I removed the gag and asked for the PIN numbers and the amounts in the accounts .
She seemed drained and strangely submissive .
I noted the information for later .
The figures for her main account were not that impressive ; she always transferring any excess to the house account .
However the dream house account was different .
I could n't tell if she was lying but the amount seemed about right .
I made a point of whistling when she gave the balance .
While she was weak I asked other questions like where she worked and how much she could take out of the accounts in a week .
I think she was too far gone to see where this was heading and gave fairly truthful answers .
While this was going on I was wrapping an Ace bandage around the ball of the gag making it larger .
In the back of my mind a counter that had started when I entered her apartment was counting down .
Then the knock came .
We both jumped , but in my case it was to clamp a hand over her mouth .
Then from outside the room my voice said , " Maggie ?
Are you all right ? "
She stiffened , then started to struggle in earnest , trying to throw me off .
I clamped my hand harder over her mouth as she continued to scream .
Then the voice continued .
" Maggie , listen , I need to find the super and get him to open the door .
I 'll try and keep him out of there but there may be nothing I can do -- is that all right ? "
She screamed into my hand .
" Look , I can't hear you .
I 'll be fifteen , twenty minutes tops , okay ? "
That had sold it to her .
I think half of her suspected it was a joke and that I was the Frenchman .
To some extent she had played along .
Now , thanks to the recording on the DAT player , she had heard me outside and suddenly in her mind she was alone and helpless with a stranger .
She struggled as I forced the enlarged gag into her mouth and pulled the strap tight .
The bandage covered ball was a real mouth filler and her screams were reduced to almost nothing .
She must have realized this because she stopped screaming at once and just lay there trembling .
I went to the duffel bag and got out more bandages , the duct tape and the plastic wrap .
Looking at the small pile of discarded cord I suddenly had an idea .
Quickly I fashioned a device I 'd learned about in books .
When I tied the cord around her waist she did n't seem to notice , being more concerned with chewing the ball .
Even when I pulled one end between her legs she did n't understand .
Still , she would find out more in a second .
Taking the roll of Saran Wrap I went to work .
She struggled as I wound the Saran Wrap around her legs .
As I wanted to be able to bend her knees I carefully left them unwrapped but continued with her thighs .
Then I rolled her over and did the same with her arms pulling her shoulders back and thrusting her breasts out in the process .
Her struggles became weaker as she had less and less to work with .
When I went over the Saran Wrap with the duct tape she became even more helpless .
As I used the tape to secure the tops of her arms to her torso , the fight left her .
She just lay there as I hog - tied her , though she showed some interest when I took the rope between her legs and secured part of it to her wrists .
As a crotch rope this was a masterpiece .
Two parallel cords held apart by a massive knot ran either side of the pussy holding the lips open and exposing the clit .
A third rope passed between them , deliberately passing tightly through the pussy and bringing several rough knots in contact with her nub .
It was this rope that was bound to her wrists and it took her no time to realize that she could vary the pressure and move the knots over her sensitive bud with the little hand movement she had left .
However , she also found out how frustrating it was ; while almost any movement brought some stimulation , getting enough to make a real difference would take a lot of effort .
Still , her ' struggles ' again became quite animated and the smell of hot pussy started to fill the room .
We both knew that a line had been crossed .
This was the first overtly sexual thing the " Burglar " had done .
Before now he had been content to keep her quiet while her searched for valuables , now he was making it clear that he had found something of value between her legs .
Maggie shivered and moaned , though it was hard to tell if this were fear or anticipation .
I stroked her cheek .
" You like , Mademoiselle ? "
She shook her head defiantly .
I looked down and saw her hard little nipples where they poked through the peepholes .
They told another story .
I brushed a hand over her exposed clit , felt the moisture and heard a muffled gasp .
" You little flower says different , eh ? " She turned away .
As she was n't saying much I did n't feel too bad strengthening the gag a little .
As I 'd done with Caroline I covered the lower part of Maggie 's face entirely with duct tape , criss crossing her mouth and sealing the ball in place .
Then I wound a tight bandage over the top , squeezing her cheeks in and reducing her moans to whispers .
The tweaked nipple test showed that she was effectively muzzled and the partial mummification had robbed her of her ability to move .
Opening the duffel bag up on the bed next to her , I rolled her inside .
Then she suddenly realized what I had in mind .
She screamed but I could barely hear it even this close and her struggles only succeeded in rubbing that frustrating crotch strap against her exposed pussy .
Even as I was pulling the bag closed around her I could tell that she was more intent with getting off than getting free .
I put the slut boots into the bag , together with some of her more slutty street clothes and a little makeup .
After all , Maggie would need something to wear later .
Besides , it helped make the bag appear less body shaped .
" Mademoiselle , ecoute !
We will leave now before your friend returns .
You will be my guest for a few days only . "
I took the knife I 'd used to cut the saran wrap and teased her neck with the point .
She stiffened and the cold steel touched her skin .
I moved the knife away .
" Trouble me and I have a knife , comprendre ? "
She nodded and I zipped the bag closed .
She was quite heavy and I was glad I did n't have to carry her any distance .
Throwing her over my shoulder I went out into the living room .
Quickly pocketing the DAT I went over to the door and opened it a crack .
The corridor outside her apartment seemed quiet enough .
I was so caught up with the thrill of it all that for a moment I forgot I was wearing the ski mask .
I snatched it off and stuck it in my pocket then , trying to move a loosely as possible so as to disguise the weight of the bag , I ambled towards the elevator .
It seemed to take forever to arrive and even before the doors opened I could hear the voices inside .
Maggie had heard them too because I could hear the gagged moans close to my ear .
It was a 50/50 chance which way they would turn on leaving the elevator but there were fewer apartments to the left so I quickly darted to that side and waited , my heart in my throat as Maggie continued to squirm behind me .
The door opened , and they turned right , two guys dressed like they were back from jogging .
Before the doors closed I 'd dashed inside .
I doubt they even knew I was there .
I held my breath as we neared the lobby .
Some elevators automatically stop and open at the lobby even if they have n't been called .
The last thing I wanted was for the doors to open and there be a dozen people waiting , especially as right now I had the biggest hardon in my life .
Fortunately , that did n't happen and the elevator continued to the basement car park .
Maggie was struggling as much as she could and trying desperately to scream , but her cries were ineffective .
I doubt they could have been heard more that a few feet away .
Still , her weak struggles did shift some of her weight and made her difficult to hold .
I staggered over to the mini van and used the famous self - opening side door to get the struggling bundle into the back seat .
I strapped her down with a couple of lap belts , then pushed the seat as far forward as I could .
Climbing inside I moved the driver 's seat hard back , trapping Maggie in a small padded box formed from the seats .
The van had tinted windows so no one could see in through the sides , and arrangement of the seats hid her from oncoming traffic .
I was careful in positioning the bag ; when opened , it would be easy to see her face , and tits and cunt were strategically close to the gap between the front seats for easy access .
In fact , when we were out of the garage I felt comfortable enough to open the bag and look at my captive .
I was relieved to see she was breathing normally , and though most of her face was covered the little moans she made told me of her appreciation of the crotch strap .
Though I had a room a few blocks away I decided to give Maggie an adventure and plotted a route that would take me out of the city via the Tobin Bridge .
After the bridge , Highway 1 heads north and I suppose it could be an eccentric way of heading for the Canadian border .
The important thing was that it had toll booths and Maggie would hear the sound and know we were leaving town .
I think there was construction because there were jams on the approach to the bridge and I had to keep stopping .
Still , I had Maggie 's compliant if not necessarily willing body to play with as I waited .
I stroked and teased listening to the little sounds that she was making and smelling the perfume of her hot pussy .
For a few blocks I played tag with a little red open top with an out of state license plate reading MISS T .
I do n't know if this was a pun on Misty or if she was some beauty pageant winner but the car 's owner was a real looker and knew it .
She was in her early twenties , with fluffy blonde hair , dark glasses and an attitude that needed serious adjustment .
I accidentally blocked her way at an intersection and at the next block she deliberately cut me up .
Five minutes later we were parked side by side and she looked over at me like I was dirt .
I smiled and she tossed her head back again making it clear she did n't want my company .
I had my hand down between the front seats playing with Maggie 's nipples and listening to her muffled protests .
My hand drifted down and played with the crotch strap , Maggie moaned some more , but despite the window being open Miss T heard nothing .
She continued to pretend to ignore me while I thrilled with the knowledge that she would never know I had a helpless girl bound and gagged on my back seat .
At the lights she squealed away , gaining perhaps a car length on me for her trouble .
I smiled , thinking just how easily it could be Maggie in the little sports car and Miss T on my back seat .
Finally we reached the bridge .
The tolls are automated so there was little chance of detection , and soon I was the other side of the river .
I did a large circle using Highway 28 , imagining Maggie 's despair and desperation mounting with every mile .
I zipped up the duffel bag and stopped at a gas station to get some chocolate .
The place was quiet but there were enough people around for Maggie to hear and try to contact .
Needless to say , no one noticed anything wrong .
I headed back towards Boston with the biggest hardon in history , and a helpless captive ready to satisfy it .
The traffic was better on the way back in and in no time I was at the motel .
I zipped up Maggie 's bag in case a passerby looked through the driver 's window , and opened the door to the room .
I spent a moment drawing the drapes against inquisitive eyes then brought Maggie inside .
She was in quite a state .
Her body was covered in sweat , hair plastered down to her skull .
Her erect nipples were poking through the peepholes in the corselet and seemed a little red .
I could only assume that she had been using the rough fabric of the bag to maximum effect .
Needless to say her clit was engorged .
I had almost expected friction burns but apparently there was more than enough lubrication .
As I eased her out of the bag , she started floundering about like a fish out of water .
For a moment I thought that she was struggling to escape but then I realized the truth , she was trying for an orgasm .
I sat and watched the valiant struggle .
She came close on a number of occasions but finally she fell back , exhausted and frustrated .
I smiled , thinking how strange it was that reality so closely followed art .
I had got the design of the crotch strap from a trashy bondage novel about a white slaver .
After capture he fits one to all of his ' recruits ' in order to prevent escape .
The idea was that any attempt to struggle causes sexual stimulation which distracts the victim , causing them to fail to get free .
Though Maggie could not possibly get free the strap was having a similar effect .
She would struggle and build up her level of excitement , but only being able to nose breathe she was unable to get off before oxygen debt forced her to stop .
She panted and shivered .
Ready if not exactly willing , she waited for her kidnapper to take her .
I smiled .
She would have to wait a little longer .
Using the knife I cut her legs free .
Instead of the kicking I 'd expected , she pushed down , thrusting her shaved crotch upwards .
The little slut was begging for it , but I would not oblige just yet .
I improvised a modified hogtie using tape and cord .
First I taped both ankles together with each foot against the opposite calf .
This forced her legs open into a rigid triangle with knees horizontal and out of the way .
It left her pussy exposed and gave her no way to protect it .
Then I bound the ankles to the wrists , making her body rigid and reducing her movement to virtually nothing .
She moaned and struggled but could do nothing more .
Satisfied that she was under control , I removed the gag .
As expected she wanted water first so I placed the glass to her lips and let her drink just enough to take the edge off her thirst .
Then I turned her so that her head was over the side of the bed and undid my fly .
She knew what was coming and lay quietly while I explained the penalty for biting .
As it turned out I need n't have worried .
The gag had strained her jaw muscles to the point where I doubt she could bite anyway .
Needless to say , it was n't the worlds greatest blow job .
I did consider punishing her for bad technique but there seemed little point since she was physically unable to do better .
Finally I came , though it was more through my efforts than hers .
I forced her to swallow , then moved her into the center of the bed .
I spent a few minutes stripping the sodden bandage off the ball gag while she worked on putting her jaw in order .
We both finished about the same time , and I pushed the ball against her lips .
" Please no , " she begged .
" Oui , " I said .
" I must go to le Banque . "
" Bank ?
Please no !
That 's all I have ! "
Her voice was panicked .
" That is all right , mademoiselle , it is all I need ! "
" Please , " she said thrusting her chest outwards .
" I have other things I could offer . . . "
I laughed , a gravelly , hearty sound that surprised even me .
" Do not worry , mademoiselle , I will taste those fruits on my return . "
She struggled but the result was a foregone conclusion .
I tightened the gag strap and left her alone in the dim motel room .
I did n't go far , just out to the car to use my mobile phone .
First , I called my accountant who I hoped could help with the problem of Caroline 's mother .
We talked hypothetically about a couple of ideas I 'd had and he confirmed what I needed to know .
Now I knew that my plan stood a chance , I called around and talked to a number of other friends to arrange meetings .
Finally I called a fine Deli I knew and ordered the makings for dinner .
It was then I made the mistake .
I 'd been eating a bar of the chocolate while I made the calls and finished up quite thirsty .
As it was too early to arrive back at the room , I decided to go in search of the Coke machine that motels always have .
The first machine I found was broken so I went further afield .
. .
As I walked back towards my block with my 3 cans of coke and some ice , a movement caught my eye .
She was young , very young -- sixteen , maybe seventeen at most , dressed in the brown uniform of a maid .
In her arms she carried a huge pile of towels almost as tall as she was , in her hand was a key and she was heading for my room .
She ignored my shouts and as she got closer to my door I realized I had no option .
Bursting into a sprint I closed on her .
I was lucky -- fumbling with the towels , she dropped the key .
But for that , she would have been in the room long before I reached her .
As it was , I made it just as she opened the door .
Perhaps I should have been an actor -- despite the danger , I stayed in character .
" Mademoiselle , what are you doing ? "
I demanded , pointing to the ' do not disturb ' sign I 'd hung on the door .
I was acutely aware that Maggie was just feet away and could probably be heard easily with the door open .
The girl looked at the sign , and for the first time I noticed her olive skin and those dark brown eyes .
" Perdon , " she said .
" No hablo ingles ! " A moan emerged through the open doorway and the little Spanish girl moved forward curiously .
Quickly and as gently as I could , I reached forward and closed the door .
I could still hear faint sounds from inside , but the gag was good enough to prevent Maggie from drawing too much attention .
I knew she could probably hear us clearly and I knew she could speak Spanish so in the worse accent I could manage I asked , " Habla usted frances ? "
" Oui , " she said with a smile .
Immediately there was a bond between us .
We were both foreigners now .
" Tres bien ! " I smiled .
" Mademoiselle .
Je suis fatigue .
Je ne voudrais pas ma chambre a ete faite . "
I tapped the ' do not disturb ' sign for good measure .
She blushed .
" Excusez - moi Monsieur . "
Then she hurried away .
Relieved , I opened the door .
A Spanish girl who spoke French but no English ?
I wished I 'd had the time to know more .
Of course , a real desperado would probably have pushed her inside and tied her up as well .
Still , I 'd dealt with it in a way consistent with my character , and I was sure Maggie was none the wiser .
Putting down the supplies I removed the gag .
" You lie ! " I accused .
" The number was no good ! " " Please no .
I told you the truth . "
" The card , it has gone . "
" The machine ate my card ? "
Her voice was a strange mixture of panic and relief .
" Oui !
I have lost one day .
I have nothing !
Comprendez - vous ? "
" Yes , but what can I do ? " I waited a while as if he was weighing up his options .
Then I reached over and pushed the gag firmly into her mouth .
Fumbling for the phone , I made a number of calls to my house and talked to the answering machine .
For Maggie 's benefit , I made out that I was talking to someone at the other end .
The first ten calls were entirely in French and after the first Maggie gave up trying to alert the person at the other end of the phone and waited patiently .
Then I sprang the eleventh on her .
" Bonjour , John .
Comment ca va ?
Bien .
Listen I have something special .
Non , a woman .
Oui la prostituee .
. .how you say , a hooker ? "
Maggie raised an muffled objection but I ignored her .
" The bitch ripped me off . . . stole my money .
. .oui. . .non I caught her .
She is my guest .
. .oui . I need to get my money back before I go 'ome to Quebec . . . exactement !
I think the same .
. .oui. . . anything you like for two hundred dollars .
Oui ?
Tres bien !
A tout a l'heure .
. .oui! Au revoire . "
Maggie moaned and struggled as I made the next four calls in English .
Each was approximately the same .
I claimed she was a hooker that had stolen money from me and offered to sell her ass for two hundred bucks in order to make my money back .
Each call varied a little and I gradually filled in the details , assuring one party that she would be blindfolded or telling another she was an accomplished liar .
The setup was obvious -- sometime later tonight Maggie was going to be gang - banged by fifteen guys at two hundred dollars a head .
She would be bound and blindfolded , gagged for much of the time but even when she could speak she would be unable to persuade them to stop .
I noisily flicked through the pages of a book .
" Fifteen men a night ?
That is three thousand .
In a week . . . "
Maggie moaned , in a week she would have fucked over a hundred guys .
" Do not worry Mademoiselle , we will ' ave the money soon , non ? "
Her nipples were hard , her pussy damp .
Maggie could only orgasm with a man when forced and soon fifteen guys were going to have their way with her .
She 'd be fucked , sucked , groped and I 'd made it clear that she could be used in anyway those men wanted .
I watched the crotch rope as it rubbed against her clit .
This gag allowed a little mouth breathing so she got a little closer before she exhausted herself .
I made an excuse about needing to go to buy condoms so that my friends would n't catch something from her slut cunt .
I offered to get her a drink before I left and she nodded .
I expected her to beg to be released when I ungagged her .
I thought she 'd threaten and whine .
But instead she surprised me .
" For God 's sake , " she moaned .
" Fuck me , Cody ! " " Mademoiselle , I am - - " " Cut the French crap , Cody , and just fuck me , okay ?
Do what you like , whip me , degrade me but for God sake let me cum ! "
I paused while I thought what to do next .
My original plan still had about ten more minutes left to run .
" Cody , please .
. . fuck my pussy , you bastard .
If you want to , then use me like a whore , just be quick . . . "
In the end I gagged her just to end the obscenities .
Then , still in character , I mounted her .
I told her she would be my whore , that the fifteen guys would use all of her holes , would fuck her beyond exhaustion , would cum all over her body .
I told her she would be powerless , bound and gagged , unable to stop them as they took what they wanted , unable to stop them from degrading her and making her lower than the cheapest whore .
Then I told her that she 'd like it , or at least she 'd pretend to because that way they would stop beating her and that would mean she could get some sleep .
Before the next fifteen guys arrived . .
.
All through this she struggled and screamed and fought and when I finally cut the crotch rope and entered her she was more than ready .
The hogtie was a masterpiece , giving her no way to stop my penetration , making her more powerless , less guilty .
I still believe she orgasmed fifteen times , once for each imaginary rapist , for each imaginary violation .
Even gagged she made more noise than I would have liked and I only hoped the little Spanish girl was n't in the next room .
Finally spent , I collapsed on her and there we stayed ' till I we recovered our strength .
Then I removed her gag and blindfold .
She blinked and smiled .
" Hi , Cody . " " Okay .
When did you know ? "
" Know what ? "
" That it was me ? " " I 've always known , " she said , a little bemused .
" But I wore sweats and --" She smiled .
" It was very good , Cody .
Wonderful , in fact .
You were so convincing I almost thought it was real on a couple of occasions .
In fact , if you had n't worn the cologne I gave you last Christmas , I could have panicked and really thought it was real .
Very subtle clue by the way -- a masterstroke ! "
I was suddenly very glad that I had n't said the aftershave was cheap and nasty .
She continued , " Coming early was good , too .
In fact you almost caught me out .
If you had n't done that key fumbling thing outside the door , you 'd have caught me in the living room .
As it was , I did n't really get chance to tie my ankles properly . "
" Whoa , wait a minute .
You mean you only tied yourself up when I arrived ? "
" Of course .
What kind of idiot do you take me for ?
You do n't really think I 'd be stupid enough to tie myself up and not be able to get loose . "
" But the gloves ? " " Nice touch , I thought .
Well , you kept saying they were cheap and nasty and I agree .
I was planning to get better ones so I could afford to sacrifice these . "
" So this whole thing was a setup ? " I demanded .
" You were n't really tied up at all ? "
The silly cunt grinned at me .
" Nope .
I just woke up with an itch this morning and I knew you were too busy to come if I asked , so -- " " You incredible bitch ! " " The one and only . " I stared at her .
Then it was my turn to grin .
" Okay .
So I 'm a sucker and I bought it .
Now you 'll have to do something for me . "
" No , I do n't , " she pouted .
" You got off on it , too , big time .
I never realized what a power freak you are .
If I did n't lean in the other direction I might even fight this Elizabeth chick for you ! "
" Flattery will get you nowhere , " I said .
" And you do owe me - * big time . * "
She rolled her eyes .
" Fine .
So what do you want ? "
" You , to be my slave for one evening of my choosing .
No limits , no veto , nothing .
You do what I say , fuck what I say and the only acceptable answer is " yes , master . "
Understand ? "
She pouted again .
" Why should I agree to this ? "
" Two reasons , " I said .
" One , you 'll get off on it big time .
And two , you say no and I push this gag back into your lying little mouth and leave you here for the maid to find . "
She thought for a while .
" Okay .
But only for * one* evening . "
" Agreed , " I said and started to free her .
Already my mind was working on the plans to fulfill my deepest fantasy ; to have both my slaves helpless and available at the same time .
Still , as an aging population wrangles with how to gracefully face the certainty of death , the moral and economic questions presented by palliative care are unavoidable :
How much do we want , and need , to know about the inevitable ?
Is the withholding of heroic treatment a blessing , a rationing of medical care or a step toward euthanasia ?
A third of Medicare spending goes to patients with chronic illness in their last two years of life ; the elderly , who receive much of this care , are a huge political constituency .
Does calling on one more team of specialists at the end of a long and final hospital stay reduce this spending , or add another cost to already bloated medical bills ?
Dr. O’Mahony and other palliative care specialists often talk about wanting to curb the excesses of the medical machine , about their disillusionment over seeing patients whose bodies and spirits had been broken by the treatment they had hoped would cure them .
But their intention , in a year observing their intimate daily interactions with patients , was not to limit people ’s choices or speed them toward death .
Rather , Dr. O’Mahony and his colleagues were more subtle , cunning and caring than their own words sometimes suggested .
An Escort for the Dying
They are tour guides on the road to death , the equivalent of the ferryman in Greek myth who accompanied people across the river Styx to the underworld .
They argue that a frank acknowledgment of the inevitability of death allows patients to concentrate on improving the quality of their lives , rather than lengthening them , to put their affairs in order and to say goodbye before it is too late .
Dr. O’Mahony , 41 , went to medical school in his native Dublin , straight out of high school .
He intended to go into oncology .
But during training at a prominent cancer hospital in New York , he changed his mind as he saw patients return to the hospital to die miserable deaths , hooked to tubes , machines and chemotherapy bags until the end .
“ In Ireland , and I think most other places , it would be very much frowned upon , ” he said .
Sandy - haired , a wiry marathon runner , Dr. O’Mahony is the sixth of eight children ; his father is a university professor devoted to preserving Gaelic as a second language , and his mother a painter .
When he was 3 , his brother , who had cerebral palsy , died at age 4 .
His awareness of his parents ’ helplessness , burnished through years of family conversations , helped steer him to palliative care , he said .
Following his early retirement as a detective from the San Francisco Police Department , John Ferguson - Scottie to his friends - becomes obsessed with two women in succession , those obsessions which trouble his long time friend and former fiancée , Midge Wood , a designer of women 's undergarments .
The first is wealthy and elegant platinum blonde Madeleine Elster , the wife of his college acquaintance Gavin Elster , who hires John to follow her in Gavin 's belief that she may be a danger to herself in thinking that she has recently been possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes , Madeleine 's great - grandmother who she knows nothing about , but who Gavin knows committed suicide in being mentally unbalanced when she was twenty - six , Madeleine 's current age .
The second is Judy Barton , who John spots on the street one day .
Judy is a working class girl , but what makes John obsessed with her is that , despite her working class style and her brunette hair , she is the spitting image of Madeleine , into ... Written by Huggo

There were numerous suggestions given to the Department of Transportation for how to destroy a car turned in so the engine never pollutes again .
Our favorite was " drilling a hole in the engine block " with , we 're guessing , a giant diamond - tipped drill .
As lovers of cars , the method they decided on feels far more cruel but is probably just as effective .

The prescribed and approved method of disabling a car according to law involves replacing the engine 's oil with sodium silicate , more commonly known as liquid glass .
When the car is run with a mixture of water and sodium silicate the liquid quickly evaporates and the solids are left behind , causing most of the oiled surfaces to seize and break .
As you can see in the video above , the results are fairly horrific .
You can actually hear this car scream .
In fact , if you watch all the way , you 'll see it spout up its last bit of oil before it breathes its last breath .

China cuts US Treasury holdings in June
( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2009-08-18 10:45
NEW YORK : China reduced its holdings of US Treasury debt in June by the biggest margin in nearly nine years , according to a US Treasury Department report issued on Monday .
China cut its net holdings by 3.1 percent to $ 776.4 billion in June from $ 801.5 billion in May , the report says .
This is also the first large - scale reduction of US Treasury debt by China so far this year .
However , its June holdings were still larger than April 's $ 763.5 billion and $ 767.9 billion in March , according to the statistics of the Treasury Department .
Reuters data show the drop in China 's Treasury holdings in June was the biggest percentage reduction since a 4.2 percent cut in October 2000 .
On the other hand , Japan , the second - largest holder of US Treasury securities , increased its holdings to $ 711.8 billion in June from $ 677.2 billion in May .
The United Kingdom , the third largest holder , also increased its holdings to $ 214 billion in June from $ 163.8 billion , a surge of 30.6 percent .
Egypt is trying to persuade people to live in the desert
By Ayisha Yahya
BBC , World Service
It has been assumed that global warming would cause an expansion of the world 's deserts , but now some scientists are predicting a contrary scenario in which water and life slowly reclaim these arid places .
They think vast , dry regions like the Sahara might soon begin shrinking .
The evidence is limited and definitive conclusions are impossible to reach but recent satellite pictures of North Africa seem to show areas of the Sahara in retreat .
It could be that an increase in rainfall has caused this effect .
Farouk el - Baz , director of the Centre for Remote Sensing at Boston University , believes the Sahara is experiencing a shift from dryer to wetter conditions .
" It 's not greening yet .
But the desert expands and shrinks in relation to the amount of energy that is received by the Earth from the Sun , and this over many thousands of years , " Mr el - Baz told the BBC World Service .
" The heating of the Earth would result in more evaporation of the oceans , in turn resulting in more rainfall . "
But it might be hard to reconcile the view from satellites with the view from the ground .
While experts debate how global warming will affect the poorest continent , people are reacting in their own ways .
Droughts over the preceding decades have had the effect of driving nomadic people and rural farmers into the towns and cities .
Such movement of people suggests weather patterns are becoming dryer and harsher .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned recently that rising global temperatures could cut West African agricultural production by up to 50 % by the year 2020 .
But satellite images from the last 15 years do seem to show a recovery of vegetation in the Southern Sahara , although the Sahel Belt , the semi-arid tropical savannah to the south of the desert , remains fragile .
The fragility of the Sahel may have been exacerbated by the cutting of trees , poor land management and subsequent erosion of soil .
Namibia
The broader picture is reinforced by studies carried out in the Namib Desert in Namibia .
For the last few years there has been higher than average rainfall
Mary Seely
Gobabeb research centre
This is a region with an average rainfall of just 12 millimetres per year - what scientists call " hyper-arid " .
Scientists have been measuring rainfall here for the last 60 years .
Last year the local research centre , called Gobabeb , measured 80 mm of rain .
In the last decade they have seen the local river , a dry bed for most of the year , experience record - high floods .
All this has coincided with record - high temperatures .
" Whether this is due to global change or is a trend anyway , it 's hard to distil actually out of the [ data ] but certainly we 've had record highs of temperature , " said Joh Henschel , director of Gobabeb .
" Three years ago we had the hottest day on record , 47 degrees Celsius . "
The mean annual evaporation is several hundred times higher than the actual rainfall .
This is an intense environment .
Fluctuation His colleague Mary Seely agrees .
" Deserts and arid areas always have extremely varied rainfall , " she said .
" You would have to look at a record of several hundred years to maybe say that things are getting greener or dryer .
For the last few years there has been higher than average rainfall .
Life can be extremely harsh in the Namib desert " That said , there is even greater variability in the rainfall and the weather patterns than there has been in the past . "
Though positioned on the Atlantic coast , the rain that falls on the Namib desert actually comes from the Indian Ocean , having travelled across Africa .
It is therefore hard to explain an increase in rainfall without accepting that higher temperatures globally are causing shifts in established patterns .
The thing these scientists are most keen to work out is what is man-made change and what is natural fluctuation .
Since 1998 the centre has observed a steady but unmistakable trend of rising levels of C02 .
They are sure this increase has not been caused locally , since Gobabeb is in a pristine , isolated part of the world with no local sources of pollution .
This is a change that comes about on a global level .
Manufacturing green Meanwhile , elsewhere on the continent , things are moving at a faster pace .
Global warming may be greening the desert in small , barely measurable ways but , in parts of Egypt , the greening is being advanced in an artificial way , and on an industrial scale .
Egypt has an expanding population and water is becoming an ever more a precious resource .
Waiting to find out if the deserts are greening is not a realistic option .
Remote sensing - radar - imaging from space - began in 1981 and showed scientists what was going on under the Saharan sand .
The aquifer , a collection of reservoirs trapped underground between layers of permeable rock , was studied and mapped for the first time .
Tapping into this supply has meant deserts areas can , with skill and judgement , be transformed into farmable land .
Thank to the work of people like Mr el - Baz , the greening of the desert is happening in Egypt in a controlled way .
Out of the newly irrigated desert we now see the commercial growing of oranges , limes and mangoes .
Further , the Egyptian government is actually sponsoring people to settle in the desert to farm , using the water supply they can now tap into and pump out from under the sand .
The programme is part of an ambitious and controversial plan to reclaim 3.4 million acres of desert .
The trend in other parts of the continent may be a migration of people into the cities and away from arid and semi-arid places , but in Egypt , where the desert is undeniably getting greener , the reverse is true .

Mass opposition has surged since the June 28 coup .
Photos from Honduran Resists .
By Felipe Stuart Cournoyer
August 8 , 2009 --
The people of Honduras have now suffered more than 40 days of military rule .
The generals ’
June 28 coup , crudely re-packaged in constitutional guise , ousted the country ’s elected government and unleashed severe , targeted and relentless repression .
Grassroots protests have matched the regime in endurance and outmatched it in political support within the country and internationally .
Its scope and duration is unprecedented in Honduran history .
Popular resistance is the main factor affecting the international forces attempting to shape the outcome of the crisis .
It weighs heavily on the minds of the coup ’s authors and their international backers .
As Eva Golinger has convincingly documented , the United States took part in conceiving , planning and staging the coup ( see www.chavezcode.com ) .
US ambassador in Tegucigalpa Hugo Llorens coordinates a team of high - ranking US and Honduran military officials , and creatures from the old Bush administration , using the Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) US airforce base .
But when the army assaulted President Zelaya ’s house , machine guns blazing , kidnapped him and dumped him – still in pajamas – in Costa Rica , this forged unprecedented unity in Latin America and the Caribbean against the coup regime and enraged hundreds of thousands within the country .
Latin American unity
In the first days after the coup , it appeared that the whole world was coming out against the Honduran generals and their civilian front men .
ALBA – the nine - nation Bolivarian alliance initiated by Venezuela and Cuba – took the initiative in uniting Latin American governments around a common stand .
Nicaragua ’s capital , Managua , became the temporary capital of ``Our America ’’.
Many Latin American presidents knew only too well that they could also suffer Zelaya ’s fate .
Argentina ’s Cristina Fermandez devoted her entire speech to this theme at the Organization of American States ( OAS ) general assembly , which took a unanimous stand against the golpistas ( coup makers ) .
That was followed quickly by a UN General Assembly meeting , convened by its president Father Miguel d’Escoto ( a veteran Nicaraguan Sandinista leader ) , which also passed a unanimous resolution repudiating the coup and recognising Zelaya as the legitimate president of Honduras .
Faced with this reality , the US government hastened to portray itself as a key opponent of the military takeover and a supporter of Zelaya ’s return .
It was politically urgent for US President Barack Obama ’s regime , not only in Latin America but domestically , to disclaim involvement in the coup .
There has been much speculation that Obama may disagree with his government ’s duplicitous policy on the coup .
That can of course not be excluded .
But what counts for the people of Honduras and their supporters is not Obama ’s possible private opinions but his government ’s actions .
Its walk betrayed its pronouncements .
The US has not acted to cut the legs out from under the coup regime .
It could topple the coup with a five - minute phone call that includes a few bottom - line dollar figures .
Its words , as time has shown , were mainly those of deceit and the manipulation of different forces acting on the Honduran crisis .
Main aims of the coup
Washington staged the coup to promote a number of closely interacting aims :
To strike a blow at the ALBA alliance , by taking out its assumed “ weakest link ” – Honduras and its government headed by Zelaya .
prepare for an assault on revolutionary Venezuela , prefaced through the announcement of new US military bases that will convert Colombia into a gigantic aircraft carrier and platform for staging hostile operations against ALBA countries , with Ecuador and Bolivia also high on the list .
Toprepare for an assault on revolutionary Venezuela , prefaced through the announcement of new US military bases that will convert Colombia into a gigantic aircraft carrier and platform for staging hostile operations against ALBA countries , with Ecuador and Bolivia also high on the list .
To “ take back ” Honduras and again use it as a platform to strike against leftwing presidencies and mass movements in Guatemala , El Salvador and Nicaragua , and to demoralise and discourage the grassroots ’ support for disobedient or defiant regimes .
To test Latin America ’ s turbulent waters for a revival of coup making in Latin America and the Caribbean .
This involves attempting to re-inspire and regroup rightwing supporters in both political and military spheres across the hemisphere .
It also took a measure of where the powerful Catholic Church would fall .
A free Bible if you guess right .
To probe South America ’ s “ soft underbelly ” – mainly Brazil and Chile – to see if they were amenable to a deal , or at least if their silence could be purchased .
This involves an effort to drive a wedge between the ALBA alliance and so - called centre - left regimes ( Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay , Uruguay and Chile ) .
Since then , a lot of water has gone down the Rio Coco ( between Honduras and Nicaragua ) .
The coup regime threatened to become a millstone around Washington ’s neck and hinder its renewed drive to find leverage and points of support , especially in South America .
Hence Washington ’s efforts for plausible denial with no qualms about letting the golpistas hang out to dry if necessary .
Events over the past months have shown some success for Washington , but mainly on the international level .
Latin American unity , for example , is now being sorely tested by the provocative decision to place US military air and naval bases in Colombia .
While both Brazil and Chile have reluctantly bowed down before the argument that the issue is a " sovereign " decision for Colombia , others including Bolivia , Nicaragua , Ecuador , Uruguay , Venezuela and Cuba have denounced the measure .
An effective resistance
Meanwhile , the Honduran resistance has had immense impact on the population , the regime , the national and regional economy and international opinion .
This outcome is horrifying to the local ruling class and to Washington .
The Honduran economy is in tatters .
Estimates indicate that import - export activity is down by 60 per cent .
Zelaya reported in a press conference in Mexico City that more than 200 road barricades had been erected , most of them heavily repressed by the army in an attempt to keep produce moving .
Public schools have not functioned since the coup because of teachers ’ strikes and student boycotts .
Health workers have maintained a long strike and many other work centres have been hit by shorter strikes and slowdowns .
The de facto government has been unable to meet payrolls and profits of the ten ruling families are starting to dry up .
Adidas , Nike and GAP – flagships of the maquila [ sweatshop ] sector – have urged the US government to accelerate Zelaya ’s return because its products are not being exported .
They are suffering losses in the millions of dollars .
The crisis is also hitting Nicaraguan and El Salvadoran import - export enterprises that depend on the northern Honduran port of Cortés for commerce with the eastern and southern US and with Europe .
Yet despite stiff resistance and surprises on the international front , de facto President Roberto Micheletti’s “ government ” has not collapsed .
Its main weapon , aside from Catholic Church sermons and a virtual monopoly control over media , has been targeted killings and arrests of unarmed protesters , who take nothing into their actions but conviction , courage and picket signs .
Disappearances and torture are selectively carried out , the right to free movement permanently violated , curfews often lengthened .
The regime has now moved to close down Globo Radio , the only station that has dared to oppose the coup and support Zelaya as the country ’s legitimate president , and give the resistance a voice .
It was still on air as of August 6 .
Hundreds of supporters have surrounded it with defence guards .
If the regime hangs on , it will likely also close down TV Cholusat Sur ( Channel 36/34 ) , which works hand - in - glove with Globo .
The Arias Plan
The plan of Costa Rica ’s President Oscar Arias for surmounting the coup and restoring “ stability ” to Honduras is misnamed .
It should be called the “ Obama - Clinton - Lula Plan ” .
Santiago O'Donnell , regular journalist for Argentine Pagina 12 , wrote on July 26 that the Arias Plan was traced out in a Moscow meeting between Brazil ’s President Luiz Inacio Da Silva ( “ Lula ” ) and Obama .
" Lula wanted Zelaya to return but Obama did n't want him to stay on , so they agreed in Moscow that Zelaya should return but remain " [ without any real power ] -- see ``Made in Washington ’’.
The plan 's unstated intent was to marginalise Zelaya from any real power and block any possible return to office in the future .
And , above all , to debilitate the mass resistance movement .
The two presidents met again at the G - 8 summit in Italy .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chose Arias , whose skills in serving imperialism won him a Nobel Peace prize , to host talks between the Zelaya government ( - in- exile ) and the coup leaders .
He " mediated " in San José between representatives of " both sides " .
With the OAS pushed out of the picture , the talks moved away from the demand for the immediate and unconditional return of Zelaya , to a framework of conditional and delayed return ( and ipso facto , the conditioned and delayed retirement of the de facto regime ! ) .
The talks began as a means to delay Zelaya ’s return and to buy time for the coup regime , in the hope it could stabilise its rule within the country .
Zelaya accepted the plan as a basis for discussion .
But talks soon collapsed , because the coup regime categorically rejected Zelaya ’s return as president .
A second attempt by Arias failed for the same reason .
Zelaya then turned away from the Arias exercise and again focused on building the resistance and on diplomatic outreach .
His government in exile operates mainly on the Honduran - Nicaraguan border ( Ocotal ) and at the Honduran embassy in Managua .
Impact of resistance
Mass opposition has surged , inspired by Zelaya ’s attempts to return via the Nicaraguan border and by the effective work done by Xiamara Castro de Zelaya , his wife , within the country .
This had its effect .
Obama came out with another more pointed reiteration of the US stand that the coup regime had to accept Zelaya ’s return through the San José - Arias path .
Brazil and Mexico backed this stance , as did OAS general secretary Jose Miguel Insulza .
The coup regime has continued to defy this course .
On the heels of Obama 's statement , Insulza , Arias and Spain ’s vice - president Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega proposed sending an OAS ministerial - level delegation to Honduras to try to convince the military regime to accept Zelaya 's return and perhaps try to extract more teeth from Zelaya .
Coup leader Micheletti says he would accept such a delegation only if no ministers from ALBA countries are included .
The mission will arrive on August 11 .
It is made up of the foreign ministers of Argentina , Mexico , Canada , Costa Rica , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic , accompanied by José Miguel Insulza of the OAS .
Meanwhile , Zelaya has agreed to major concessions .
He has accepted the principle of a national unity government , whose main task would be to stabilise the country , get the economy moving again , restore services such as education and health and organise the November national elections .
In essence , Zelaya ’s team feels it has no choice but to accept returning as a hand - tied regime with major figures involved in the coup .
The authors of the Arias Plan hope this will leave the ruling class and the army with significant leverage to politically defeat the mass movement and the Zelaya current in the coming elections .
That is not certain .
At a press conference in Mexico during a state visit , Zelaya sent a message to Washington and other hemispheric governments – either golpismo ( coup making ) by the extreme right will be contained or Latin America ’s left - wing guerrillas will be reborn .
He again asserted the people ’s right to and the possibility of insurrection under conditions of military dictatorship .
To the grassroots
Anyone who leaves the mass movement out of their calculations may come up short .
The resistance movement has emerged as a new force , much more sophisticated and powerful than before June 28 .
Greater unity between mestizo , Indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples augurs well .
Their international ties are more varied and stronger .
Activists have been through a great school of class struggle of the most acute nature and brutal form .
The Zelaya current itself is not the same as it was before the coup .
There is every possibility that the interim period , with or without Zelaya ’s return , can be used to mature and consolidate this movement and to build its capacity to take on the ruling class in the electoral process and the ongoing battle of for the hearts and minds of the great majority of the nation .
The next day of action is August 11 , when feeder marches from all over Honduras will converge on the industrial centre San Pedro Sula and the capital Tegucigalpa .
Hondura 's National Resistance Front Against the Coup d'Etat has appealed for simultaneous solidarity protests around the world on that day .
The outcome depends , above all , on the capacities of the grassroots to remain on guard and active in the political struggle .
Their activity will likely unfold under the twin banners of an election campaign and building support for convoking a constituent assembly .
Anti-imperialist fighters will do well to keep their focus on defending the mass movement and its leaders in Honduras and the goal of continental unity against imperial domination .
The Honduran coup of June 28 was an imperial dress rehearsal for the coup instigators across Latin America .
The coup is also school for the Hondura ’s grassroots movement .
Hondurans , no matter the short - term twists and turns among contending forces , will never be the same .

The rest of Circuit City ’s intellectual property , including the firedog brand and a database of 30 million customer contacts , is going on the auction block Aug. 18 .
And it may reap more than the $ 14 million that the Circuit City name fetched at auction earlier this year .
Massachusetts - based advisory firm Streambank set a deadline of Aug. 11 for bids , and the auction will be held at a law office in New York the following week .
The intellectual property for sale includes the trademarks , website and toll - free numbers for Circuit City ’s installation and technical support service firedog .
Also up for sale are trademarks and websites associated with TradingCircuit.com , the company ’s former auction platform for returned and exchanged merchandise .
Registrations and trademarks tied to various private label products owned by Circuit City will also be sold to the highest bidder .
But the prized item up for bid is Circuit City ’s customer and transaction database , which includes information on 30 million contacts collected from 2003 through 2009 .
“ It ’s essentially a mailing list , ” said Gabe Fried , managing partner and founder of Streambank .
“ There is enough information there for marketing people to sort of cull the list to find their targets , ” Fried said .
Fried did n’t say how much they expected to get from the auction , and there is no minimum bid .
In May the company auctioned off the CircuitCity.com domain and company trademark to Systemax Inc. for $ 14 million plus a minimum of $ 3 million in royalties over three months .
“ We ’re hoping firedog gives Circuit City a run for the money , ” said Fried .
“ We ’re optimistic we will have a competitive auction . ”
David Urban , interim dean of the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business , said he expects the auction to generate a great deal of interest , particularly the customer contact list .
“ If you are an electronic retailer of any type , that would be a goldmine to have , ” said Urban .
“ Any kind of retailer that is interested in having ready - made consumers who have purchased electronics at some point in the recent past would be interested . ”
Urban did n’t say how much he thought such a database might be worth .
There may be some limitations on what the buyer of the list can do with the information .
A consumer privacy ombudsman will be appointed by the bankruptcy estate to confirm that the sale and use of the information does not violate any of the privacy policies in place .
“ Customers can rest assured the privacy ombudsman will make sure these names are only made available to certain similar businesses offering similar products , ” said Fried .
One potential bidder could be hhgregg , an Indianapolis - based electronic retailer that has been taking over abandoned Circuit City stores across the country and also honored Circuit City gift cards when the company went bankrupt last November .
Hhgregg announced recently they planned to open three stores in Richmond .
VCU marketing professor Van Wood said the firedog brand is also an attractive buy .
“ The firedog idea , which was quickly copied by Best Buy , was really great .
For folks who had problems with their computers and installing equipment , it was a godsend , ” said Wood .
In his opinion , the firedog brand could be worth even more than the Circuit City name .
“ That part of the brand name is still really solid , ” said Wood .
“ For Circuit City , it will be a long time before the brand name has the cache it did before it left a bad taste in people ’s mouths . ”
Wood said he would n’t even be surprised if Best Buy was interested .
He said they could benefit by either offering it as an alternative service to their existing support division , Geek Squad , or by keeping competition at bay .
“ It would be a strategically competitive move by them , ” Wood said .

“ Buried within the October 3 , 2008 bailout bill was a provision permitting the Fed to pay interest on bank reserves .
Within days , the Fed implemented this new power , essentially converting bank reserves into more government debt .
Now , any seigniorage that government gains from creating bank reserves will completely vanish or be greatly reduced . ”
A lmost everyone is aware that federal government spending in the United States is scheduled to skyrocket , primarily because of Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
Recent “ stimulus ” packages have accelerated the process .
Only the naively optimistic actually believe that politicians will fully resolve this looming fiscal crisis with some judicious combination of tax hikes and program cuts .
Many predict that , instead , the government will inflate its way out of this future bind , using Federal Reserve monetary expansion to fill the shortfall between outlays and receipts .
But I believe , in contrast , that it is far more likely that the United States will be driven to an outright default on Treasury securities , openly reneging on the interest due on its formal debt and probably repudiating part of the principal .
To understand why , we must look at U.S. fiscal history .
Economists refer to the revenue that government or its central bank generates through monetary expansion as seigniorage .
Outside of America ’s two hyperinflations ( during the Revolution and under the Confederacy during the Civil War ) , seigniorage in this country peaked during World War II , when it covered nearly a quarter of the war ’s cost and amounted to about 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
By the Great Inflation of the 1970s , seigniorage was below two percent of federal expenditures or less than half a percent of GDP .
This was partly a result of globalization , in which international competition disciplines central banks .
And it also was the result of sophisticated financial systems , with fractional reserve banking , in which most of the money that people actually hold is created privately , by banks and other financial institutions , rather than by government .
Consider how little of your own cash balances are in the form of
government - issued Federal Reserve notes and Treasury coin , rather than in
the form of privately created bank deposits and money market funds .
Privately created money , even when its quantity expands , provides no
income to government .
Consequently , seigniorage has become a trivial source of revenue , not just in the United States , but also throughout the developed world .
Only in poor countries , such as Zimbabwe , with their primitive financial sectors , does inflation remain lucrative for governments .
For more on hyperinflations , bank reserves , and central banks , see Hyperinflation , Money Supply , and Federal Reserve System in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
The current financial crisis , moreover , has reinforced the trend toward lower seigniorage .
Buried within the October 3 , 2008 bailout bill , which set up the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , was a provision permitting the Fed to pay interest on bank reserves , something other major central banks were doing already .
Within days , the Fed implemented this new power , essentially converting bank reserves into more government debt .
Fiat money traditionally pays no interest and , therefore , allows the government to purchase real resources without incurring any future tax liability .
Federal Reserve notes will , of course , continue to earn no interest .
But now , any seigniorage that government gains from creating bank reserves will completely vanish or be greatly reduced , depending entirely on the differential between market interest rates on the remaining government debt and the interest rate on reserves .
The lower is this differential , the less will be the seigniorage .
Indeed , this new constraint on seigniorage becomes tighter as people replace the use of currency with bank debit cards and other forms of electronic fund transfers .
In light of all these factors , even inflation well into the double digits can do little to alleviate the U.S. government ’s potential bankruptcy .
What about increasing the proceeds from explicit taxes ?
Examine Graph 1 , which depicts both federal outlays and receipts as a percent of GDP from 1940 to 2008 .
Two things stand out .
First is the striking behavior of federal tax revenue since the Korean War .
Displaying less volatility than expenditures , it has bumped up against 20 percent of GDP for well over half a century .
That is quite an astonishing statistic when you think about all the changes in the tax code over the intervening years .
Tax rates go up , tax rates go down , and the total bite out of the economy remains relatively constant .
This suggests that 20 percent is some kind of structural - political limit for federal taxes in the United States .
It also means that variations in the deficit resulted mainly from changes in spending rather than from changes in taxes .
The second fact that stands out in the graph is that federal tax revenue at the height of World War II never quite reached 24 percent of GDP .
That represents the all - time high in U.S. history , should even the 20 - percent - of - GDP post - war barrier prove breachable .
Graph 1 . Federal Outlays and Receipts as a Percent of GDP , 1940 - 2008 ZOOM
Compare these percentages with that of President Barack Obama ’s first budget , which is slated to come in at above 28 percent of GDP .
Although this spending surge is supposed to be significantly reversed when the recession is over , the administration ’s own estimates have federal outlays never falling below 22 percent of GDP .
And that is before the Social Security and Medicare increases really kick in .
In its latest long - term budget scenarios , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , not known for undue pessimism , projects that total federal spending will rise over the next 75 years to as much as 35 percent of GDP , not counting any interest on the accumulating debt , which critically varies with how fast tax revenues rise .
However , the CBO ’s highest projection for tax revenue over the same span reaches a mere 26 percent of GDP .
Notice how even that “ optimistic ” projection assumes that Americans will put up with , on a regular peacetime basis , a higher level of federal taxation than they briefly endured during the widely perceived national emergency of the Second World War .
Moreover , once you add in the interest on the growing debt because of the persistent deficits , federal expenditures in 2083 , according to the CBO , could range anywhere between 44 and 75 percent of GDP .
We all know that there is a limit to how much debt an individual or institution can pile on if future income is rigidly fixed .
We have seen why federal tax revenues are probably capped between 20 and 25 percent of GDP ; reliance on seigniorage is no longer a viable option ; and public - choice dynamics tell us that politicians have almost no incentive to rein in Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
The prospects are , therefore , sobering .
Although many governments around the world have experienced sovereign defaults , U.S. Treasury securities have long been considered risk - free .
That may be changing already .
Prominent economists have starting considering a possible Treasury default , while the business - news media and investment rating agencies have begun openly discussing a potential risk premium on the interest rate that the U.S. government pays .
The CBO estimates that the total U.S. national debt will approach 100 percent of GDP within ten years , and when Japan ’s national debt exceeded that level , the ratings of its government securities were downgraded .
The much ( unfairly ) maligned credit default swaps ( CDS ) in February 2009 were charging more for insurance against a default on U.S. Treasuries than for insurance against default of such major U.S. corporations as Pepsico , IBM , and McDonald’s .
Because the premiums and payoffs of the CDS on U.S. Treasury securities are denominated in Euros , the annual premiums also reflect exchange - rate risk , which is probably why , with the subsequent modest decline in the dollar , CDS premiums for ten - year Treasuries fell from 100 basis points to almost 30 .
But you can make a plausible case that CDS underestimate the probability of a Treasury default since such a default could easily have far reaching financial repercussions , even hurting the counterparties providing the insurance and impinging on their ability to make good on their CDS .
Surely the purchasers of the U.S. Treasury CDS have not overlooked this risk , which would be reflected in a lower annual premium for less - valuable insurance .
Predicting an ultimate Treasury default is somewhat empty unless I can also say something about its timing .
The financial structure of the U.S. government currently has two nominal firewalls .
The first , between Treasury debt and unfunded liabilities , is provided by the trust funds of Social Security , Medicare , and other , smaller federal insurance programs .
These give investors the illusion that the shaky fiscal status of social insurance has no direct effect on the government ’s formal debt .
But according to the latest intermediate projections of the trustees , the Hospital Insurance ( HI - Medicare Part A ) trust fund will be out of money in 2017 , whereas the Social Security ( OASDI ) trust funds will be empty by 2037 .
Although other parts of Medicare are already funded from general revenues , when HI and OASDI need to dip into general revenues , the first firewall is gone .
If investors respond by requiring a risk premium on Treasuries , the unwinding could move very fast , much like the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union .
Politicians will be unable to react .
Obviously , this scenario is pure speculation , but I believe it offers some insight into the potential time frame .
The second financial firewall is between U.S. currency and government debt .
It is not literally impossible that the Federal Reserve could unleash the Zimbabwe option and repudiate the national debt indirectly through hyperinflation , rather than have the Treasury repudiate it directly .
But my guess is that , faced with the alternatives of seeing both the dollar and the debt become worthless or defaulting on the debt while saving the dollar , the U.S. government will choose the latter .
Treasury securities are second - order claims to central - bank - issued dollars .
Although both may be ultimately backed by the power of taxation , that in no way prevents government from discriminating between the priority of the claims .
After the American Revolution , the United States repudiated its paper money and yet successfully honored its debt ( in gold ) .
It is true that fiat money , as opposed to a gold standard , makes it harder to separate the fate of a government ’s money from that of its debt .
But Russia in 1998 is just one recent example of a government choosing partial debt repudiation over a complete collapse of its fiat currency .
Admittedly , seigniorage is not the only way governments have benefited from inflation .
Inflation also erodes the real value of government debt , and if the inflation is not fully anticipated , the interest the government pays will not fully compensate for the erosion .
This happened during the Great Inflation of the 1970s , when investors in long - term Treasury securities earned negative real rates of return , generating for the government maybe one percent of GDP , or about twice as much implicit revenue as came from seigniorage .
But today ’s investors are far savvier and less likely to get caught off guard by anything less than hyperinflation .
To be clear , I am not denying that a Treasury default might be accompanied by some inflation .
Inflationary expectations , along with the fact that part of the monetary base is now de facto government debt , can link the fates of government debt and government money .
This is all the more reason for the United States to try to break the link and maintain the second financial firewall .
We still may end up with the worst of both worlds : outright Treasury default coupled with serious inflation .
I am simply denying that such inflation will forestall default .
Still unconvinced that the Treasury will default ?
The Zimbabwe option illustrates that other potential outcomes , however unlikely , are equally unprecedented and dramatic .
We cannot utterly rule out , for instance , the possibility that the U.S. Congress might repudiate a major portion of promised benefits rather than its debt .
If it simply abolished Medicare outright , the unfunded liability of Social Security would become tractable .
Indeed , one of the current arguments for the adoption of nationalized health care is that it can reduce Medicare costs .
But this argument is based on looking at other welfare States such as Great Britain , where government - provided health care was rationed from the outset rather than subsidized with Medicare .
Rationing can indeed drive down health - care costs , but after more than forty years of subsidized health care in the United States , how likely is it that the public will put up with severe rationing or that the politicians will attempt to impose it ?
And do n’t kid yourself ; the rationing will have to be quite severe to stave off a future fiscal crisis .
Other welfare States have higher taxes as a proportion of GDP , with Sweden and Denmark in the lead at nearly 50 percent .
Can I really be confident that the United States will never follow their example ?
Let us ignore all the cultural , political , and economic differences between small , ethnically - unified European States and the United States .
We still must factor in the take of state and local governments , which , together with the federal government , raises the current tax bite in the United States to 28 percent of GDP , only five percentage points below that of Canada .
Recall that the CBO projects that federal spending alone for 2082 will reach almost 35 percent of GDP , excluding rising interest on the national debt .
Thus , if taxes were to rise pari passu with spending , the United States might be able to forestall bankruptcy with a total tax burden , counting federal , state , and local , of around 45 percent of GDP — 15 percentage points higher than the combined total at its World War II peak , higher than in the United Kingdom and Germany today , and nearly dead even with Norway and France .
However , if there is any significant lag between expenditure and tax increases , the increased debt would cause the proportion to rise even more .
Furthermore , this estimate relies on the CBO ’s economic and demographic assumptions about the future , along with the assumption of absolutely no increase in state and local taxation as a percent of GDP .
More - pessimistic assumptions also drive the percentage up .
Even conceding that federal taxes might rise rapidly enough to a level noticeably higher than during World War II overlooks an important consideration :
All the social democracies are facing similar fiscal dilemmas at almost the same time .
Pay - as - you go social insurance is just not sustainable over the long run , despite the higher tax rates in other welfare States .
Even though the United States initiated social insurance later than most of these other welfare States , it has caught up with them because of the Medicare subsidy .
In other words , the social - democratic welfare State will come to end , just as the socialist State came to an end .
Socialism was doomed by the calculation problem identified by Ludwig Mises and Friedrich Hayek .
Mises also argued that the mixed economy was unstable and that the dynamics of intervention would inevitably drive it towards socialism or laissez faire .
But in this case , he was mistaken ; a century of experience has taught us that the client - oriented , power - broker State is the gravity well toward which public choice drives both command and market economies .
What will ultimately kill the welfare State is that its centerpiece , government - provided social insurance , is simultaneously above reproach and beyond salvation .
Fully - funded systems could have survived , but politicians had little incentive to enact them , and much less incentive to impose the huge costs of converting from pay - as - you - go .
Whether this inevitable collapse of social democracies will ultimately be a good or bad thing depends on what replaces them .
Rural couples are allowed two children under China 's family planning laws
Dozens of baby girls in southern China have reportedly been taken from parents who broke family - planning laws , and then sold for adoption overseas .
An investigation by the state - owned Southern Metropolis News found that about 80 girls in one county had been sold for $ 3,000 ( £ 1,800 ) .
The babies were taken when the parents could not pay the steep fines imposed for having too many children .
Local officials may have forged papers to complete the deals , the report said .
Unpopular policy
Parents in rural areas are allowed two children , unlike urban dwellers who are allowed one .
But if they have more than that , they face a fine of about $ 3,000 - several times many farmers ' annual income .
The policy is deeply unpopular among rural residents , says the BBC's Quentin Somerville in Beijing .
Nearly 80 baby girls in a county in Guizhou province , in the south of the country , were confiscated from their families when their parents could not or would not pay the fine , Southern Metropolis News said .
The girls were taken into orphanages and then adopted by couples from the United States and a number of European countries .
The adoption fee was split between the orphanages and local officials , the newspaper said .
Child trafficking is widespread .
A tightening of adoption rules for foreigners in 2006 has proved ineffective in the face of local corruption .
Details are a bit light on this one , but thanks to a tipster and some chatter we picked up on the interblogs , it looks like Radio Shack may be about to undergo a pretty noticeable rebranding .
The above image was taken from a terminal within a store , and while it 's not completely clear if this is a short - term promotional push or long - term strategy ( apparently the company will remain Radio Shack on the corporate side ) , our tipster says that in - store signs will reflect the change this week , and storefront signage will begin to be reworked as " The Shack " sometime later this year .
When you think about it , it makes perfect sense -- radios are n't exactly considered cutting edge these days , and from the sounds of things , the store is about to launch a full assault on the mobile space , bringing T - Mobile into the fold this month , and attempting to cover the gamut on cellphone reselling .
Still , we 're not sure " The Shack " is the right direction ... unless they wanted us to immediately picture a remote location where very , very bad things happen .
Apparently we 're not the only ones talking about this -- someone has added detailed info on the rebranding to the company 's Wikipedia page .
According to the writeup , the switch will kick off with celebrations " in San Francisco and New York featuring ' 14 foot tall laptops ' streaming the images from their webcams from one city to the other , live music in both locations , as well as television coverage of the event . "
Uh , okay !
Guess they were n't kidding .
Here 's the promo page on Radio Shack 's site .
Thanks Ellis D.!
Fuzzing 101 Detailed Primer
Description :

Fuzzing is the process of sending intentionally invalid data to a product in the hopes of triggering an error condition or fault .
These error conditions can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities .
The idea behind fuzzing is simple - programmers generally code and test software only for a limited set of inputs which they would expect to face in normal operation of the software .
Thus invalid inputs which the programmer never expected to be given , can trigger bugs .
These bugs might be further exploitable to execute code or to crash the system .
Fuzzing tries to recreate an environment where the superset of all possible input combinations is given to a software and its behavior is observed for crashes and other exceptions .
The video series below is a detailed primer on the art of Fuzzing by Mike Zusman of the Intrepidus Group .
Mike takes us through the basics of fuzzing , different kind of fuzzers and the whole process / methodology to be followed in fuzzing .
The process of fuzzing consists of the following steps : 1. Identify the targets2 .
Identify the inputs which are to be fuzzed3 .
Generate fuzzed data4 .
Execute the fuzzed data5 .
Monitor for exceptions6 .

When I saw that headline , I had to wonder if this is another one of those exaggerated stories that Commenters pounce on me for .
But it 's Sibel Edmonds , who usually sounds reasonable and very credible .
I report , you decide :
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds dropped a bombshell on the Mike Malloy radio show , guest - hosted by Brad Friedman ( audio , partial transcript ) .
Sibel Edmonds on the Mike Malloy Show , hour 1
Sibel Edmonds on the Mike Malloy Show , hour 2
In the interview , Sibel says that the US maintained ‘ intimate relations ’ with Bin Laden , and the Taliban , “ all the way until that day of September 11 . ”
These ‘ intimate relations ’ included using Bin Laden for ‘ operations ’ in Central Asia , including Xinjiang , China .
These ‘ operations ’ involved using al Qaeda and the Taliban in the same manner “ as we did during the Afghan and Soviet conflict , ” that is , fighting ‘ enemies ’ via proxies .
As Sibel has previously described , and as she reiterates in this latest interview , this process involved using Turkey ( with assistance from ‘ actors from Pakistan , and Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia ’ ) as a proxy , which in turn used Bin Laden and the Taliban and others as a proxy terrorist army .
The goals of the American ’ statesmen ’ directing these activities included control of Central Asia ’s vast energy supplies and new markets for military products .
The Americans had a problem , though .
They needed to keep their fingerprints off these operations to avoid a ) popular revolt in Central Asia ( Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan ) , and b ) serious repercussions from China and Russia .
They found an ingenious solution :
Use their puppet - state Turkey as a proxy , and appeal to both pan-Turkic and pan-Islam sensibilities . [...]
According to Sibel :
This started more than a decade - long illegal , covert operation in Central Asia by a small group in the US intent on furthering the oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex , using Turkish operatives , Saudi partners and Pakistani allies , furthering this objective in the name of Islam .
Sibel has famously been dubbed the most gagged woman in America , having the State Secrets Privilege imposed on her twice .
Her 3.5 hour testimony to the 9/11 Commission has been entirely suppressed , reduced to a single footnote which refers readers to her classified testimony .
In the interview , she says that the information that was classified in her case specifically identifies that the US was using Bin Laden and the Taliban in Central Asia , including Xinjiang .
In the interview , Sibel reiterates that when invoking the gag orders , the US government claims that it is protecting ” ’ sensitive diplomatic relations , ’ protecting Turkey , protecting Israel , protecting Pakistan , protecting Saudi Arabia … ”
This is no doubt partially true , but it is also true that they are protecting themselves too , and it is a crime in the US to use classification and secrecy to cover up crimes .
As Sibel says in the interview :
I have information about things that our government has lied to us about … those things can be proven as lies , very easily , based on the information they classified in my case , because we did carry very intimate relationship with these people , and it involves Central Asia , all the way up to September 11 .
Summary
The bombshell here is obviously that certain people in the US were using Bin Laden up to September 11 , 2001 .
It is important to understand why : the US outsourced terror operations to al Qaeda and the Taliban for many years , promoting the Islamization of Central Asia in an attempt to personally profit off military sales as well as oil and gas concessions .
The silence by the US government on these matters is deafening .
So , too , is the blowback .

A new rice plant has been developed which grows " snorkels " when exposed to floods .
A paper in the journal Nature , describes how the plant elongates rapidly in response to being submerged .
One of the scientists , Motoyaki Ashikari from Nagoya University in Japan , said " the impact is huge " .
It could also boost the production of rice in Asia and Africa , where up to 40 % of crops are subject to flash floods or deep water .
" People cannot plant any crops in the rainy season , because the crops drown and die in the floods , " said Mr Ashikari .
Writing in Nature , Laurentius Voesenek describes how the Japanese scientists discovered the " snorkel " genes in flood - tolerant rice , and introduced them to more sensitive high - yield rice .
" Snorkels " grow as hollow tubes from parts of the plant called internodes , preventing it from drowning .
When the floods arrive , the super rice plants can grow up to 25 cm per day .

Largest Red Light Camera Program In World Faces Widened Corruption Probe
Redflex loses red light camera contract in Chicago , Illinois following investigation into corruption .
The Australian Securities Exchange allowed trading to resume on Redflex stock this morning .
On Thursday , the photo enforcement firm had requested a trading halt to prevent a massive sell - off as news leaked of a widening corruption probe in Chicago , Illinois .
The Chicago Tribune ’s report that a city official apparently took bribes from the company in the form of luxury trips and sporting tickets was confirmed by an official investigation .
On Friday , Redflex received notice from the city that it will “ not be considered a responsible bidder ” for the red light camera contract that comes up for renewal on July 31 .
That means the firm will lose 384 cameras , the single largest red light camera contract in the world .
The news hit Redflex hard .
In 2012 , the company reported a net profit before tax of $ 21.3 million .
It announced Monday the figure through December will drop to $ 5.5 million or possibly less as legal costs mount .
As the firm paid $ 6.2 million in tax last year , that means the firm could post a loss for the year .
Redflex fortunes have depended heavily on the Windy City , which generated 13 percent of the firm ’s revenue and represented 19 percent of its installed camera base .
The contract value totaled $ 84 million and was set to generate even more cash on the way to 440 installed cameras in upcoming years .
Because Chicago takes ownership of the cameras upon contract termination , Redflex will also lose a significant investment in equipment , which was $ 11.3 million as of 2010 .
Upon the market ’s opening Monday , shares plunged 24 percent from $ 1.55 to $ 1.28 .
Shareholders have been upset since last November , when they issued a first strike against the company ’s lavish executive compensation package .
On Wednesday , Max Findlay , the chairman of the board and Ian Davis , a director , were forced to resign in light of their reported role in the unfolding Chicago incident .
So far , Redflex admits it paid for luxury accommodations for John Bills , the Chicago official in charge of the red light camera contract , in violation of city ethics rules .
This is nothing out of the ordinary for the industry .
In 2010 , the Australian firm also put the police chief of Oak Ridge , Tennessee up at the Ritz - Carlton Hotel in return for his favorable testimony at a court trial two years ago .
Affiliated Computer Services ( ACS , now a part of Xerox ) was caught giving hockey tickets and other services to police officers in Edmonton , Canada , although criminal charges were ultimately dropped .
American Traffic Solutions ( ATS ) regularly entertains public officials involved in red light camera business , but the airfare , lodging and wages during the event is paid for by taxpayers , not ATS .
According to court records , the Edmonton police officer who recommended ACS for a no - bid photo ticketing contract had an affair with an ACS employee .
The officer ’s ex-wife testified the cop had been so cooperative with ACS because he expected to land a lucrative job with ACS upon retirement .
The hiring of former municipal officials who have helped companies land lucrative deals has become so routine that municipal officials expect it to happen .
This was the case with a traffic sergeant in Lynnwood , Washington who went as far as to use his official position to advertise on behalf of ATS .
The former mayor of St. Peters , Missouri spent a year in jail after he solicited a bribe from Redflex on a deal that was not worth much money to the company .
The Blue Parrot
I went to a used bookstore in Takadanobaba on Sunday called The Blue Parrot .
It ’s apparently a pretty well known used English bookstore in Tokyo .
A friend of my mine at work mentioned it to me and I finally got around to checking it out .
I was lucky to find they were having a half - off sale last weekend .
The place is a pretty tiny , cramped space with three aisles of various books .
It has a typical small , alternative bookstore , hipster vibe to it .
There was a flip - flop wearing clerk with an earring and a middle - aged story - telling bald writer loitering and telling stories for a better part of an hour while the clerk ooh - ed and aah - ed .
I browsed the stacks , which had all the usual book sections : sci-fi , fantasy , classics , general lit , self help , non-fiction , travel , as well as Japanese text books and the like .
There ’s a 100 yen bargain bin with nothing in it that I wanted .
Most books seem to be about 500 yen so I got two for that since there was a sale .
There ’s some good stuff , but the things that jumped out at me out of the multitude of books were one ’s I ’ve read already .
I ended up getting this old copy of Brave New World from 1936 .
I like old books much more than new ones because they have a nice lived - in feel .
This one has some notes in French .
I also got a nice yellow - paged copy of Wind , Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint - Exupery .
It ’s an abstract and magical account of his days as an aviator in the French postal service — or so far it is , I ’ve only just started .
I used to love a brand new hardcovers with crisp pages and a sexy binding , but as time went on and I got poorer I decided to stop wasting money on new books when a used one reads just the same .
Then I found that the used ones read better since the pages are darker and easier on the eyes .
I gave up the hardcovers for mass paperbacks since they fit in my pocket and are easily concealed .
And nowadays I search for the oldest edition , particularly for sci-fi , as they usually have fantastical covers originally painted by hand ( my copy of Solaris has a beautifully surreal depiction of the colloid planet ) .
I also love when an old book has someone ’s notes in it , or better yet a dedication .
A copy of Siddhartha I own has a note inside the cover .
It reads : To Grant , To feel .
Love , Barb — dated 1/1/77 .
A new book is just a book .
But an old book has a life of it ’s own to me .
It ’s not just another copy .
Advertisements
ColorofChange.org announced today that the nation ’s largest retailer Wal - Mart has pulled its ads from Glenn Beck ’s Fox News program .
Seven other companies joined the retail giant , including Best Buy and CVS have stopped advertising on Beck ’s program .
This now means that 20 advertisers have left Glenn Beck since he called Obama a racist .
Allergan ( maker of Restasis ) , Ally Bank ( a unit of GMAC Financial Services ) , Best Buy , Broadview Security , CVS , Re-Bath , Travelocity and Wal - Mart all announced that they will no longer advertise on Beck ’s show .
David Tovar , a spokesperson for Wal - Mart told ColorofChange.org in an email , “ Walmart [ sic ] today confirmed the retailer pulled ads from the Glenn Beck show on August 3rd . ” Carolyn Castel , Vice President of Corporate Communications for CVS wrote , “ While advertising on Fox is part of our communication plan , we had not requested time on Glenn Beck ’s show specifically .
We have instructed our advertising agency to inform Fox to ensure Glenn Beck ’s program is not part of our advertising plan . ”
Advertisements
Amanda Borichevsky , a spokesperson for Travelocity said , “ We did not specifically place our ad on the show .
We buy ads in bulk and then they are placed somewhat randomly .
However , we have now specifically asked that our ads do not appear during this show . ”
Lisa Svac
Hawks , Director of Public Relations for Best Buy said that the ads that were airing on Beck ’s show were a mistake , and should not have been airing there .
When Wal - Mart dropped Beck , Fox News developed a serious problem .
When the biggest of the big wo n’t touch a program , it sends a message to other potential advertisers .
When you look at the list of all 20 companies that have left Beck , there are many household names there .
ConAgra , GEICO , Lawyers.com , Men ’s Wearhouse , Procter & Gamble , Progressive Insurance , RadioShack , Roche , SC Johnson , Sanofi - Aventis , Sargento , and State Farm Insurance have all previously dropped Beck .
Fox News should still be able to sell time on Beck ’s show , but without the biggest advertisers competing , this has to hurt ad revenue .
Interestingly , Lawyers.com and a few others who have dropped Beck have had ads showing up on MSNBC lately .
This could just be expanded buying , or it could be that some advertisers are moving on .
I do n’t know how many more advertisers FNC will stand back and let Beck lose before they do something .
A banker and Pidgin developer from Ohio rants endlessly , starts flame wars , and has been given a blog .
This can't be good ...

Transcription by Edwin Steussy , Apogee Communications .
Please send corrections to ed “ at ” my last name “ dot ” com .
CS : Good evening , we ’re very pleased to be here and thank you very much for inviting us to talk .
PK : Yeah , this is different for me , but it should be a lot of fun . … ( Set up problems ) …
What do you really think the world is going to look like , say , 30 years from now ?
CS : Ummm , there ’s a very simple answer to that and a misleading one , I think , and the simple answer is unless we are really , really unlucky the world in about 30 years time is going to look more complex .
By really , really unlucky – nuclear war , major plagues or similar – the world in 30 years time after that is going to look a lot simpler , though not a good way .
PK : Right .
Obviously what I ’m thinking about is the technology .
Given my perspective – I was thinking about his coming up – and thinking that – maybe it was just my age or something , but things do n’t seem to have changed as much in the last 30 years as myself as a sci - fi reader would have expected them to .
And I do n’t know if I ’m missing something – kinda that perspective .
CS : I think things have changed a lot in the last 30 years , but not in the direction that somebody 30 years ago would have expected .
The 20th Century , and going back to the 19th Century , the real visible vector of change technologically was transportation speeds .
You go back to 1809 and to get across the English Home Counties , the areas around London , you go via stagecoach and it would take you a couple of days to cross them , it would cost you probably about a month ’s wages and cause you considerable discomfort .
2009 , it costs about the same amount of money , it takes about the same time and the same amount of discomfort to get from here to New Zealand .
The whole world has shrunk to the scale of the English Home Counties in 1809 over about two centuries .
At the same time we ’ve gotten used to performance improvements in speed .
There ’s this weird sort of political thing in the early 20th Century called air - mindedness .
Everybody knew that flight was going to be the next really important technological revolution .
They were all trying to find ways of making money from it or using it to demonstrate how important and modern and with - it they were and how on the cutting edge they were – sort of like computers today with politicians .
Who will never pass up a photo - op with a computer even if they do n’t even know how to type .
Now the whole air - mindedness thing , the problem we ran into was … it was sigmoid curve – we had a slow start , a very rapid period of improvements where we went at about 20 years from biplanes to supersonic jets .
And then the curve stopped going up – it flattened off .
And the reason it flattened off is all to do with energy .
To go much faster , you need more and more energy inputs .
It ’s not a linear input increase but virtually an exponential one .
We hit a point at which chemical propulsion would n’t send us any faster .
And for a variety of reasons including both engineering and politics , nuclear power was n’t an acceptable answer .
And airliners today are slower than they were 20 years ago .
However , the big difference is that everyone and his dog flies today , whereas 20 years ago , or 40 years ago more accurately , that ’s where the term jet - set came from , its because those were the people who could afford to fly long distances .
PK : And yet , let me press on .
What I kind of expected .
Let me show my age here .
What you came out believing if you went to the New York ’s World Fair in 1964 was that we were going to have this enormously enhanced mastery of the physical universe .
That we were going to have undersea cities and supersonic transports everywhere .
And there has n’t been that kind of dramatic change .
It ’s not just that airplanes are no faster .
My favorite test , which shows something about me , is the kitchen .
If you walked into a kitchen from the 1950 ’s it would look a little pokey , but you ’d know what to do .
It would n’t be that difficult .
If someone from the 1950 ’s walked into a kitchen from 1909 they ’d be pretty unhappy – they might just be able to manage .
If someone from 1909 went to one from 1859 , you would actually be hopeless .
The big change was really between 1840 and the 1920 ’s , in terms of what the physical nature of modern life is like .
There ’s been nothing like that since .
So we can do fancy information searches in a way that no one envisioned 30 years ago – as one of my colleagues at the Times , Gail Collins , likes to say all the time where are the flying cars ?
CS : Yeah , where is my food pill , where are my jetpacks .
Actually , flying cars are really bad idea , if I can just go off on a tangent .
Your flying car is great , what about your neighbors flying car when his 15 year old son gets into it and tries to impress his girlfriend in it .
Normal cars have a simple failure mode ; they stop moving , hopefully at the side of a road .
Flying cars , if they have a failure mode , they stop moving and then they move very rapidly straight down .
PK : But the robot driver for the car ?
It ’s the other thing that ’s supposed to be around by now , and it ’s not .
It ’s even on the information side .
CS : Partly , there are obstacles to getting some of these technologies out .
I think that what has been happening rather than progress continuing and accelerating in a visible direction that everybody ’s expected from 1960 , we ’ve seen immense progress in other directions and the effects are not immediately obvious because they take time to sink in .
Faster transport brings its own side effects , most of them would have been fairly immediately obvious to anybody if you told them how it would work .
It ’s not a great cognitive leap from aeroplanes capable of carrying loads to bombers .
It ’s a hell of a leap from idea of getting a cheap camera chip and adding it to a mobile phone and coming up with a phenomenon of “ Happy Slapping ” .
I do n’t know if everyone knows what Happy Slapping is , it is n’t Slapping , and it is n’t Happy , but its where kids basically find some random stranger beat them up while one of their friends videos it with their camera and then upload it to YouTube .
As social phenomenon go , that ’s not one you can predict from the input technology .
That ’s a second order effect .
We ’re still seeing the second order effects emerge from the information technology , and as for biotechnology , that ’s barely off the starting blocks . ….
Where was I going with that one …. hold this thought for a moment .
PK : That ’s the thing about technology – you never know where it ’s going to lead .
CS : We ’ve already seen some effects of information technology outsourcing mind workers to the developing world was not possible before the current upsurge of communications technologies and computers .
It ’s having large scale effects today , but where it ’s going to go ultimately go is still not clear .
PK : There is no question that things have changed , but the rhythm of daily life .. and maybe it ’s a generational thing … it used to be that if you saw someone talking to themselves on the streets of New York , he was crazy .
CS : Now they ’ve got a mobile phone !
They ’re an executive !
PK : In some ways , I still have the sense that the transformation in the quality of life that I thought would be happening by now , it has not really happened .
Lots and lots of changes and consequences .
If I can veer off into something I allegedly know something about , what ’s amazing about , in case you have n’t heard , we have a global economic crisis .
What ’s amazing about it is how much it ’s traditional .
CS : A good , old fashion banking crisis .
PK : They happen to involve complicated institutions that are not called banks , they do rely on IT , you no longer have to have rows of tellers to provide people fast access to cash , not subject to standard bank regulation , they can manage to have bank runs all the same .
You read John Maynard Keynes ‘
The Great Slump of 1930 , and with just a few words changed it ’s a very fine description of what ’s happened to the world in the past year .
We have n’t actually changed the structure of how we do things to anything like the extent one might have imagined .
CS : Working hypothesis .
It ’s a working hypothesis that I ’m trying to get my head around .
Back to 1970 - ish , do you remember the book by Alvin Toffler called Future Shock ?
PK : Yeah .
CS : My working hypothesis is that we are living in a future shocked civilization in fact the future shocked globe .
There is a lot of evidence of it all around .
The ascendancy of religious fundamentalism in all sorts of cultures is one particular response .
People do n’t like rapid change when it ’s applied to them against their will , when it ’s coercive , and when people do n’t like something , an external stimulus , they tend to kick back against it .
Religious fundamentalism boils down very largely to one thing : certainty in life .
It ’s one thing , someone will tell you how things are and this is the one way to live .
And to people who are disoriented and distressed by the way the world around them is changing that ’s got to be a source of … a very attractive offer of mental stability .
PK : You know , I think this is where being an American makes a difference .
And knowing that we ’ve had these crazies with us consistently as a major feature of our political scene .
Going back to certainly the 1920’s .
CS : Do n’t they seem to be a bit louder now ?
PK : They have their ups and downs .
But , a lot of what we see now is … read H.L. Menken on the fundamentalists and it ’s the same … it sounds very similar .
In a lot of ways , I think that the modern world began in the 20’s with radio and the penetration of mass culture into places that previously had been comfortable with their bibles .
So this is not so new .
They got louder …
I ’m about to go off onto a discourse on US … it ’s not clear that the fundamentalists got any more fundamentalist … what happened was that we had a political shift in the United States at least that empowered them … the break up of the old weird coalition between basically Northern labor unions and Southern segregationists … created a place where the religious right had power again but I do n’t think that there ’s … maybe …
I ’m about to switch sides here … there has been a rise in religious fundamentalism among unusual groups there are … amazing number of relatives of mine who have the next generation on and their kids that have suddenly turned orthodox and that was not something anyone quite envisioned … maybe some kind of future shock .
CS : I ’ve noticed in the UK over the past decade there has been an increasing ( small “ c ” ) conservatism in the electorate fostered by a feedback loop with some newspapers .
Standard headline is , “ Threatening entity here going to do something hideous to you . ”
PK : That ’s my column for tomorrow ’s New York Times actually .
CS : There ’s a wonderful website called the Daily Mail - o- matic that generates Daily Mail headlines and about one in ten of them is eerily accurate …
Are Chavs Ripping Off the British Taxpayer , subtext : you are the taxpayer .
PK : That sounds a little like the application that I just saw this afternoon which is something that will generate a Kenyan Birth Certificate for you .
CS : I mean , this stuff is everywhere .
And we have a pathological news media who ’ve discovered that by terrifying people they can sell more copies .
And scared people … ( applause )
PK : Yeah , people have been talking about the … remembering what … it ’s not as if we were all calm in the months before 9/11 .
We were all terrified of , at least if you were watching … was shark attacks .
2001 was the summer of shark and then they found something else to worry about for awhile .
…
I ’m still trying to think about …
My question , if I still walk into a kitchen … food obsession here … if I walk into a kitchen in the year 2039 …
CS : You ’ll see something very different by then .
Let me explain .
One prediction that I have PETA , the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , did something very unwise earlier this year .
Never mind demanding that everybody start referring to fish as “ Sea Kittens ” – that ’s just an irrelevant publicity stunt .
No , they went and offered a million dollars to the first inventor who could demonstrate a vat machine for basically delivering vat grown meat .
And I do n’t think they realize how close we are to this and which industry will develop this machine first because it just so happens that an awful lot of people in the biotech sector are working very hard to deliver machines that will generate bits of meat to order .
Specifically , Long Pork .
For the organ transplant business .
One of the scenes in the next novel I ’m working on set in about 15 years time will involve the ladies of leisure in Morningside a fairly posh part of Edinburgh who lunch together – they dine out on each other .
From the point of view of a very , very disturbed police officer who ’s trying to figure out what , if anything , to charge them with .
PK : I do n’t want to think about that one .
( laughter )
So you ’re saying our future society will be Polynesian ?
CS : It ’ll be Poly - something .
( Cross talk )
PK : Change has been … if you ’re into IT , or you ’re part of the chattering classes it means that you ’re making your living with the dissemination of information , then it all it seems tremendously rapid … it ’s been oddly diffuse in the way it actually affects lives .
One of the things that was really striking … we had this question back in the 70’s and through the 80’s when IT was clearly well underway … not the Internet yet , but … a lot of transformation … I remember … doing statistical work on a hand calculator .
I actually did my dissertation … my dissertation was a big box of punch cards that had to be brought in and then you waited for an hour for the Gods of the computer room to do whatever they were going to do with it .
So all that changed and yet there was this long period when you really could not see it in productivity , could n’t see it in economic growth , nothing was showing up and …
CS : There ’s a huge latency in information technology .
For example , one of the reasons we do n’t have driverless cars yet is because the car has to be able to sense its surroundings in three dimensions , including hazards , in real time .
Right , and that ’s a lot of computing power required .
I mean , we just saw about two years ago the DARPA Grand Challenge was won for the first time by a vehicle that drove 200 kilometers across the desert under its own control .
Now I ’ve got a hypothesis incidentally about where this is going .
It ’s going to be one of these things where there is going to be a sudden step change .
One moment , self - driving cars are science fiction , the next self - driving stuff is going to show up very rapidly once it falls below a certain price point .
Initially in luxury cars , but within five years in cheap ones .
Afterward , we ’re going to have some real fun with it because … you want to send your kid to school on the other side of town ?
Put them in the back of the car and car to drop them off at the school gates .
Alternatively , you want to go to the pub .
You drive to the pub , then get out of the pub after drinking six pints of beer and then get into the back of the car and say , “ Home , Jeeves . ”
And shortly after that , something else is going to happen driven by the insurance industry .
About 90 % of all automobile accidents are caused by a driver error .
When the automatic self - driving vehicles get sufficiently good that they are less likely to be in a collision than a human driver , your premium will go up if you insist on driving manually .
Yeah , that ’s going to go up steeply a few years later .
I think we may be seeing the end of human beings allowed to drive the public highways within 30 years .
PK : I was about to say in New Jersey , it ca n’t come a moment too soon .
( laughter )
There ’s a favorite story about this among the economic historians and it ’s about electricity .
Which is that electrification … widespread electrification is a phenomenon of the 1880 ’s and particularly factories were electrified in the 1880 ’s and it did nothing much for productivity because they were still building factories the way … a 19th century factory was a five story brick building … very tight spaces … which has a steam engine in the basement … driving trains and pulleys and shafts and it took about 30 years for them to figure out that , hey ! , with each machine having it ’s own electric motor , we can have a wide spread out single story floor plan with lots of space and we do n’t have to be moving stuff up and down these stairs and we can have plenty of room for material flow and … we saw a little bit of that in IT , but the thing was it was terribly disappointing because although it actually does show in the GDP numbers , what was the first place where people really figured out what do with IT in a way that was productive , and the answer was Wal - mart .
It turns out that all this unglamorous stuff like inventory management , basically knowing what exactly is left on the shelves the moment it is checked out of the counter being able to plan your whole system for something big box stores brought in and actually you can see that ’s where the GDP growth …
CS : Logistics is vastly underrated .
It ’s invisible .
PK : That ’s right .
That ’s the other thing , with globalization … about the outsourcing … about the Internet and the IT … but that ’s a relatively minor thing so far , probably much bigger in ten years so , but the big thing was the freight container .
CS : Oh yeah , the freight container and the fork lift and pallet .
PK : Right .
And the big cranes and the bar code on the side of the container .
CS : Actually , if I had to make a guess at one of the major things that ’s going to affect us in the next 20 years … periodically , I keep hearing about peak oil and the long emergency that ’s going to come … and it ’s going to be very , very grim … and how our food travels an average of a couple of thousand miles between where its produced and where we consume it .
I have a slightly different way of looking at this .
We ’re going to come to the end of cheap energy not because energy is going to be innately expensive because we ’ve used all the oil up , but because we ca n’t afford to keep pumping more carbon into the air .
Now we ’ll be able to actually maintain an oil - based economy indefinitely .
My betting is on Craig Venter , the guy who founded Celera Genomics tried to bootstrap a private enterprise genome program .
His current venture with Shell is to try and crack the problem of producing diesel oil using genetically produced algae .
And they ’re throwing large amounts of money at this problem .
I would reckon in 50 , 60 years time Shell will still be selling you oil .
It wo n’t be oil they ’ve pumped out of the ground , though , it will be oil they ’ve synthesized using atmospheric carbon , so it will be carbon neutral .
That ’s a whole lot cheaper than switching to a hydrogen economy because you do n’t have to scrap all of your plant and tankage , just keep using the same stuff .
But going a step further , there ’s a huge inefficiency in these hub and spoke models of distribution and shipping stuff long distances .
If you can produce stuff locally , and distribute it locally , that gives you a huge advantage .
I think one of the things logistics is going to … well , computers are going to give us , is much tauter supply chains between production and consumption .
PK : That ’s by the way one of the mysteries … we do n’t quite know why there ’s so much stuff being shipped long distances , particularly … it ’s one thing where we ’re talking about oil because oil is where it is , it has to be shipped to get to other places , but … there was a time , again thinking of the United States , a time when we knew what Detroit did for a living , we knew Troy , New York was the detachable collar and cuff center of America and all these local specializations and you could explain why stuff was being shipped back and forth .
These days , it ’s very very hard to figure out what ’s different about the economies of different cities and so if … why is there so much … who are all those people on the plane today .
Why were they traveling and … better still , when you ’re flying between Cleveland and Atlanta , what is it that Cleveland has that Atlanta needs ?
What is it that Atlanta has that Cleveland needs ?
Actually , what is that Atlanta has that anyone needs ?
I actually did try to figure out what Atlanta ’s economy is about … it seems to be about the airport .
We ’re not quite getting it .
CS : But is n’t Fedex ’s main hub in Atlanta ?
[ Editor note : Memphis is the main FedEx hub . ]
There you have it .
PK : More economics .
When you are looking at a city and you try to figure out what is the common thread linking the export industries , not international , but string themselves to other cities and so , famously , although now its kind of a basket case , Rochester had Eastman Kodak , Xerox , Corning … it ’s all about optics , it ’s all about light .
But if you try to do that with Atlanta , the closest thing I could come up with was the damn airport .
If we can all have short supply chains why do n’t we have that now for all of the services that cities generate and yet we have all of this trucking going back and forth among seemingly very similar US cities .
CS : Because I reckon that complexity , the number of different components , the number of different of different specialties that you need to run a modern , high tech civilization has mushroomed by orders of magnitude over even the past 50 years .
And all of this stuff is really small , very , very specialized , there ’s only a very few people who do it in one place and it has to get shipped about even though it looks similar .
PK : That ’s the working hypothesis , something like that .
Let ’s totally change this .
How the hell do you come up with ideas for these novels ?
( laughter )
If I could say to everybody , this is what I can not fathom .
I live reading Charlie ’s stuff and … I just ca n’t imagine just gestating … I can write within a very , very confined set of rules that structure the thing so easily , but I ca n’t imagine just where does this thing come out of ?
CS : Well , partly I ’d have to say … hell , I ca n’t reuse Roger Zelazny ’s old thing about writing off to a PO box in Poughkeepsie can I ?
I get bored easily .
That ’s one reason why I write such different novels .
More to the point , I have a short attention span and I read too much on the web .
( laughter )
There is so much happening all around us in different fields that are highly compartmentalized .
That ’s why I brought up the whole complexity thing earlier .
There is so much going on that is just so bizarrely specialized .
You get new stuff not by coming up with it out of the ether or out of pure imagination but by taking a couple of existing ideas and banging them together and seeing whether they mesh .
For example , if you look at a road map that Intel has rolling out for the next five or ten years , what you ’ll find is they know how long it takes to build a new chip fab , they know how that it will be such - and - such an improvement in the resolution of the process they ’re using to make the chips .
You can therefore guess that the performance of the chips that will be made on it .
This in turn gives you some idea of what applications they can be put to .
And there are all these wonderful trade bodies out there that come up with new standards , for example , you may have a 3G phone or data stick these days .
The 4G standards are pretty much nailed down already and are in prototype .
They ’ll be showing up over the next couple of years .
And you can bet that within ten to fifteen years time it ’s gonna be out there and its going to be as old and slow as your GSM phone from five years ago .
It ’ll be cheap and it ’ll be available .
So if you want to write near future SF , these industry road maps are a good way to go .
PK : So that explains … I can understand Halting State , a little bit .
The Laundry novels , I ca n’t imagine .
CS : I always had fun with spy thrillers and HP Lovecraft .
PK : Or the Family Trade novels .
CS : The Laundry novels were basically … I ’ve worked for the NHS .
I ’ve worked for an American software multinational from Santa Cruz in fact …
I ’ve seen various organizations on different scales and they all seem prey to one form of dysfunction or another .
The American software company , we always knew when the executives were going to come visiting the London development office because our managers would go around the morning before , taking down all the Dilbert cartoons that had been stapled to the cubicle walls .
( laughter )
All of these organizations have interesting dysfunctional approaches to passing information from low down the chain to high up the chain .
It ’s information flow again .
PK : I still do n’t get it , but that ’s OK .
Let ’s go back … do you think that true Ai is anywhere in my lifetime ?
CS : Oh god , oh god , oh god .
The first rule of AI in computing is if we can do it computationally , then it ’s not AI .
Chess playing , checkers playing .
We have worldclass chess and checkers playing robots now .
We ’ve got cars that can drive themselves across a desert .
Expert systems that can diagnose most diseases with better accuracy than physicians .
None of this is AI any more .
I ’m not sure quite why , but its become a set of self - moving goal posts .
The real question of whether we ’ll actually get a robot friend who ’s fun to be with … that ’s another matter .
We do n’t even know what human consciousness is or quite how it works .
And until we have a better idea of how we work , I do n’t think we ’ll be able to implement something equivalent in a machine .
PK : That was sort of the point though … it was long ago , probably in college , when I took computer science that the instructor told us all that by getting chess playing computer programs we ’d learn alot the nature of consciousness and we ended up learning a lot about the nature of chess .
CS : Dead Danish computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra [ ed.
note : Dutch ] had a number of pithy aphorisms starting with anybody who teaches a student how to program in BASIC should be shot .
One I particularly like is the question of whether a machine can think is no more interesting than the question of whether or not a submarine can swim .
The point being Boeing 737’s and seagulls can both fly , however , we do n’t try to replicate seagulls when we ’re designing a new airliner .
PK : Again , thinking about what I believed when I was in high school that we would have that we would have by the year 2009 … obviously HAL from 2001 , but just in general we imagined there would be a level of interactiveness of intelligence in machines but that has n’t come .
CS : I ’m not sure this is a bad thing actually because … autocorrecting your spreadsheet is bad enough , imagine HAL9000 in charge of autocorrecting your spreadsheet .
PK : Now the web … once Google introduced page rank , instead of going for AI we ’ve gone for cyborgs .
CS : We ’ve gone for augmented intelligence , not artificial intelligence .
PK : And it ’s the weirdest thing – by finding the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue you end up in effect doing a computer meld of many peoples ’ intelligence without knowing it .
CS : Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk … actually , Amazon is very big on human intelligence emulating AI .
They have a system called the Mechanical Turk where they pay people piecework to do basic tasks and farm them out using the network and if you want to throw money at a problem , you can find a hundred thousand pairs of eyes to work on it if you can divide it up suitably .
PK : Whatever the algorithm that Amazon uses to make recommendations …
CS : That scares me .
PK : It scares me too because I took a look , once they started selling music , they started recommending music to me .
And I ’ve never bought music from Amazon .
And they were mostly right .
CS : What scares me was … a friend of mine pointed out … people sell the most amazingly weird things on Amazon .
There ’s one seller who sells tins containing about an ounce of uranium ore .
People who bought this product also bought one of my books .
PK : On the other hand , the algorithm that TIVO uses to recommend programs needs work .
What lately its been recommending to me are these shows which are live filming of surgery , where you actually see them cutting people open .
I do n’t know what it is in my viewing habits that makes it think I want to watch that but it insists that I do .
CS : Amazon ’s page ranks can have some pretty weird results as well if you accidentally contaminate their database .
For example , my wife has some interesting interests in stuff she can make .
She asked me to buy her some books using my Amazon.com account a while back .
Thereafter I was plagued by corsetry books and Georgette Heyer romances for the next six months .
PK : I want to come back .
Not only were the music predictions reasonably accurate , they included some of my more embarrassing tastes … I think I ’m going to stop right there .
CS : When you ’re in a hole , stop digging .
The other stuff we have n’t even looked at are genonomics and medicine and the biomedical sciences .
I came along just a few years late to get sucked into bioinformatics , which is something I probably would have ended up in naturally if I ’d been around to study computer science in school a few years later .
Now , if I remember correctly , the original price prediction of the Human Genome Project when they got started around 1990 was about 20 years and 100 million pounds or thereabouts of that order .
They finished it several years early under budget and they did 90 % of the work in the last six months .
PK : Right .
CS : Gets better .
At that point , sequencing an individual human genome could be done for about ten million pounds .
A while later it got cheaper and now we ’re seeing gene sequencers coming on the market over the next year or so where its basically on an integrated circuit that should be able to do personalized genome scans to the same level of detail for about $ 5,000 in three hours .
And it ’s still getting cheaper .
They have sequenced quite a few mammalian and other genomes since then it is getting cheaper all the time .
Craig Venter came up with an interesting project a couple of years ago to sequence the Pacific Ocean .
If you have a bucket of seawater , it contains probably on the order of a billion organisms most of which are viruses , probably single virus particles in that bucket from a number of species .
It turns out when they did shotgun sequencing on a bucket of seawater 98 % of the genes they discovered were hitherto unknown .
There ’s a lot of stuff out there that we do not have a clue about .
About 90 % of those unknown genes were from viruses and we have no idea what the host organisms of them were … basically , viral soup .
There ’s a lot of stuff we do n’t know about how the genome works .
It ’s not , as was widely thought in the 50’s and 60’s , a blueprint .
It ’s more like a very very messy snapshot of a running computer program .
In fact , the bits we ’ve been looking at and referring to as genes , the exons are , if anything , just the static data strings encoded in the program while it ’s running .
Things such as the actual text in a variable containing the copyright date and the name , stuff that does n’t change .
A lot of the interesting work seems to be epigenetic as various enzymes tag methyl groups onto genes to activate and inactivate them .
And we ’re not quite sure what we ’re looking at except … pointing a debugger at the running program and saying let ’s change the value in this variable and see what it produces .
PK : And that goes back to some of the things I was talking about in the beginning … we ’ve scaled this awesome mountain which is sequencing a whole human genome and it turns out that now we can do this and it turns out this does n’t actually give us , at least so far , the ability to predict , control , achieve stuff that one might once have thought it would .
CS : Actually , it showed us that the system is a lot more complex than that but we ’re making huge amounts of headway .
It ’s sort of like the early days of the microprocessor revolution , we ’re still in the 1960 ’s but its fairly visible that the rate of change is ramping up .
There are going to be some astonishing breakthroughs over the next decade .
I for one am hoping to live long enough that we find a cure for the collective package of malfunctions that give rise to senescence and aging .
There ’s a strong argument that the whole aging process is the result of an evolutionary blind spot that once you ’ve passed reproductive age the mutations that cause slowly growing damage are n’t weeded out .
You reproduce before this would impair your reproductive prospects .
PK : Nature really has no interest in keeping you whole past 40 or so because the odds of your being gored by a mammoth by then are pretty high .
I do n’t know whether to be worried by the prospect that I might not live long enough to benefit from this or worried by the prospect that I will .
CS : My take is that I ’d rather live as long as I want to live than be sort of hurried off it by some really unpleasant degenerative disease .
And from where I ’m sitting it looks as if senescence is a really unpleasant degenerative disease that we ’ve all got .
PK : But think of what it will do to the finances of Social Security ?
CS : Well they ’re going to have to abolish pensions and retirement for one thing .
PK : Tell me , what are you working on now ?
CS : I ’m working on a sequel to Halting State .
I ’m trying to set it about five years further out and I ’m trying to get my head around the implications of 3D printers and rapid prototyping technology when they become ubiquitous enough that an actual desktop 3D printer is about as common as laser printers were in 1995 , around the time that national mints and police began taking a serious interest in color laser printers that could produce something indistinguishable from a bank note .
Also trying to figure out what the criminal applications are .
PK : If you really do figure it out , you ’re not going to write that novel , right ?
You ’ll do something more lucrative .
CS : It ’s well known that the first real use of any successful new technology is pornography .
I knew that machinima and MMO ’s were successful when I saw that wonderful musical presentation called , The Internet is for Porn , sung in World of Warcraft .
PK : OK , I have n’t seen that one .
CS : I ’m talking 3D printers because its something we actually have here today .
It is a very fallible , very crude approximation of the sort of things people expect of Eric Drexler - style magical mannered tech pixie dust where we wave a magic wand and manufacture anything .
The difference is that 3D printers exist , you can write a check or use a credit card and buy one and it will make 3D objects out of plastic or bits of metal here and now .
What are the effects on society going to be once we actually have machines that can basically build anything you can feed a blueprint into ?
PK : We still have n’t figured out the economics of easy information dissemination .
Even though the Internet is all old hat , we still have n’t seen the economics of it play out .
One of the big problems is we do n’t know how do people get compensated for producing information when it can be …
CS : This is a personal preoccupation of mine , shall we say .
PK : It ’s to some extent mine , although more of one of my employers .
The New York Times has got enormous web presence , four million or so people read it online and yield the corporation very little in the way of revenue in the process .
Whereas the dwindling number of people who want the dead tree paper are the source of … and the thing survives to some extent because people still like a piece of paper with their breakfast coffee but also to a large extent because you still can’t online get quite the visual quality of color advertisements for luxury goods that you can get in the New York Times Magazine .
But you ’re relying upon a very thin lag in technology to make the whole enterprise of creating and disseminating information viable .
And if that starts to apply to lots of physical goods as well , we ’re going to see whole sectors just implode .
CS : Oh , yeah .
On the other hand , with physical goods , you ’re still going to need mass and energy to assemble the frames .
As for the intellectual property , I try not to get too worked up about it .
There ’s a lot of people angsting about piracy and copying of stuff on the Internet , publishers who are very , very worried about the whole idea of ebook piracy .
I like to get a little bit of perspective on it by remembering that back before the Internet came along , we had a very special term for the people who buy a single copy of a book and then allow all their friends to read it for free .
We called them librarians .
PK : Which is why … we used to work the professional journals , something I do know something about , professional journals sold about a couple of thousand copies worldwide , at an enormous price because every university library felt it had to have them and still does to some extent , but that ’s an enterprise near to collapse because everybody reads the things online now .
CS : If it was up to me , I ’d figure what we ’re looking at with copyright today is a smoking hole in the collective landscape .
It does n’t work .
Attempts to patch it do n’t work , attempts to enforce it leads to travesties such as 32 - year old single mothers being sued for several million dollars by large record companies .
This is not good .
We need to get away from this model .
But the model is locked in through international treaty laws .
We ca n’t simply wave a magic wand and change the copyright laws to something sensible .
So probably a better solution would be to encapsulate it below some other layer and shove it off to onside so it does n’t affect people .
Now the best thing I ’ve been able to come up with is an idea for doing this is a tax on bandwidth .
Basically , if you have a mobile phone , if you have a broadband connection , if you have a modem connection , a chunk of what you pay goes in tax .
The tax goes into a pool which is then distributed to content creators on the basis of some kind of sampling or rating mechanism that ’s sampling the traffic that ’s going across the network .
How to enforce this , let alone deal with it internationally is mind - numbingly do n’t - go - there , I ’m not paid to go there , but at least it has the one supreme advantage that if you have such a regime in place , you can legislate that if you ’ve paid your tax , you are then immune from prosecution for copyright violation .
Yes , we can cuff the whole copyright issue off to one side and just do … there is a tax base here and it will be distributed to the creators of the content that is trafficked over the network .
PK : I was just following the chain of thought here .
We have this financial crisis .
Part of the problem was the rating agencies .
Basically , there ’s three – two and a half really : S&P , Moody ’s and Fitch .
The ratings agencies were willing to take these extremely complex , newly created financial assets that really had no track record and classify them as AAA .
Now the question is why would the rating agencies be willing to do that and it turns out a lot of it probably has to do with an intellectual property issue .
When the ratings agencies originally came existence they would produce a book of ratings and people would buy the book and that was how they made their revenue .
And that has long since been impossible , people tend to disseminate the ratings too easily , so nobody buys the books so they had to find a different revenue stream .
And some decades back the source of the revenue stream was that issuers of assets would pay the ratings agencies to rate their assets .
That ’s actually the revenue model that we have right now and you think about the incentives there and it actually does happen that if the rating agency is n’t sufficiently cooperative you go to one of its competitors …
CS : That ’s going to end well .
PK : Right .
And that has not ended well .
Except now the question is , what do you do ?
And everybody looks at this and says , “ This is a terrible way to do this . ”
But then the question is how are you going to fund that rating agencies ?
And there is a certain number of people who say , “ They should be public . ”
They should be the BBC .
But in America of course , well that would n’t work , it ’d be government .
So we ca n’t use that .
So , we ’re actually doing nothing to solve the problem .
Because we have this fundamental lack of appropriability of information so we ’ve ended up with a really God-awful technique for financing these needed institutions which creates all sorts of wrong incentives but we ’re not able to come up with a fix .
These are real world problems , but yeah it ’ll become worse .

OTTAWA – Canada is taking steps to dam the flood of asylum seekers entering from Mexico and the Czech Republic by slapping visa restrictions on travellers from those countries , Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has announced .
The move is aimed at what the federal government believes are thousands of bogus refugee claimants who have attempted to move to Canada from the two countries in recent years .
But the announcement was swiftly decried by both nations .
The Mexican embassy in Ottawa said in a news release that it " regrets " the decision , warning it will monitor implementation of the measure " in the interest of seeing that it be done efficiently and with respect for the rights of Mexicans . "
A reimposed visa will affect business between Canada and the Czech Republic " seriously and significantly , " warned Richard Krpac , consul general of the Czech Republic in Toronto .
The new rules take effect today .
But for today and tomorrow only , travellers from the two countries will be able to apply for a visa upon entering Canada .
In 2008 alone , 9,400 Mexicans applied for asylum in Canada , triple the number in 2005 .
Those claims represent 25 per cent of all the refugee applications received last year in Canada .
But only 11 per cent of the 9,400 claims were accepted .
Claimants from the Czech Republic have largely been from the Roma minority – often referred to by the derogatory term " gypsies " – who human rights groups say face discrimination .
Since Canada lifted visa requirements for visitors from the country in 2007 to reflect its membership in the European Union , roughly 3,000 people have made refugee claims .
In 2006 , there were five claimants .
" The sheer volume of these claims is undermining our ability to help people fleeing real persecution , " Kenney said in a statement .
But Toronto immigration lawyer Max Berger warns the imposition of visas will shut the door " against genuine refugee claims . "

Dijkstra was not insane
Recently , a reader on the Higher - Order Perl discussion mailing list made a remark about Edsger Dijkstra and his well - known opposition to the break construction ( in Perl , last ) that escapes prematurely from a loop .
People often use this as an example to show that Dijkstra was excessively doctrinaire , and out of touch with the reality of programming [ 1 ] , but usually it 's because they do n't know what his argument was .
I wrote a response , explaining where Dijkstra was coming from , and I am very happy with how it came out , so I 'm reposting it here .
The list subscriber said , in part :
On a side note , I never read anything by Dijkstra that was n't noticeably out of touch with the reality of programming , which qualifies them as screeds to me .
And I say that as a former Pascal programmer , and as one who has read , and bought into , things like Kernighan 's " Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language " and the valid rants about how some form of breaking out of a loop without having to proceed to the end is very useful , without destroying structure ( except by Dijkstra 's definition of structure ) ...
A lot of people bring up the premature - loop - exit prohibition without understanding why Dijkstra suggested it ; it was n't just that he was a tightassed Dutchman .
Dijkstra 's idea was this : suppose you want to prove , mathematically , that your program does what it is supposed to do .
Please , everyone , suspend your judgment of this issue for a few paragraphs , and bear with me .
Let 's really suppose that we want to do this .
Dijkstra 's idea is that the program is essentially a concatenation of blocks , each of which is trying to accomplish something or other , and each of which does not make sense to run unless some part of the program state is set up for it ahead of time .
For example , the program might be to print a sorted list of links from a web page .
Then the obvious blocks are : A get the web page and store it in a variable B extract the links from the text in the variable into an array C sort the array D print out the array contents Section C is trying to sort the array ; if it is correct then the array will be sorted by the time step D commences .
But it does n't make sense to commence step C unless the array is populated .
Garbage in , garbage out , as they used to say when I was in elementary school .
We say that the " precondition " for C is that the array be populated with URLs , and the " postcondition " is that the array be in sorted order .
What you would want to prove about C is that if the precondition holds — that is , if the array is properly populated before C begins — then the postcondition will hold too — that is , the array will be in sorted order when C completes .
It occurs to me that calling this a " proof " is probably biasing everyone 's thinking .
Let 's forget about mathematical proofs and just think about ordinary programmers trying to understand if the program is correct .
If the intern in the next cubicle handed you his code for this program , and you were looking it over , you would probably think in very much this way : you would identify block C ( maybe it 's a subroutine , or maybe not ) and then you would try to understand if C , given an array of URLs , would produce a properly sorted array by the time it was done .
C itself might depend on some sub - blocks or subroutines that performed sub-parts of the task ; you could try to understand them similarly .
Having proved ( or convinced yourself ) that C will produce the postcondition " array contains sorted list of URLs " , you are in an excellent position to prove ( or convince yourself ) that block D prints out a sorted array of URLs , which is what you want .
Without that belief about C , you are building on sand ; you have almost nothing to go on , and you can conclude hardly anything useful about the behavior of D . Now consider a more complex block , one of the form : if ( q ) { E ; } else { F ; } Suppose you believe that code E , given precondition x , is guaranteed to produce postcondition y.
And suppose you believe the same thing about F .
Then you can conclude the same thing about the entire if - else block : if x was true before it began executing , then y will be true when it is done .
[ 2 ]
So you can build up proofs ( or beliefs ) about small bits of code into proofs ( or beliefs ) about larger ones .
We can understand while loops similarly .
Suppose we know that condition p is true prior to the commencement of some loop , and that if p is true before G executes , then p will also be true when G finishes .
Then what can we say about this loop ?
while ( q ) { G ; }
We can conclude that if p was true before the loop began , then p will still be true , and q will be false , when the loop ends .
BUT BUT BUT BUT if your language has break , then that guarantee goes out the window and you can conclude nothing .
Or at the very least your conclusions will become much more difficult .
You can no longer treat G atomically ; you have to understand its contents in detail .
So this is where Dijkstra is coming from : features like break [ 3 ] tend to sabotage the benefits of structured programming , and prevent the programmer from understanding the program as a composition of independent units .
The other subscriber made a seemingly disparaging reference to " Dijkstra 's idea of structure " , but I hope it is clear that it was not an arbitrary idea .
Dijkstra 's idea of structure is what will allow you to understand a large program as a collection of modules .
Regardless of your opinion about formal verification methods , or correctness proofs , or the practicality of omitting break from your language , it should at least be clear that Dijkstra was not being doctrinaire just for the sake of doctrine .
Some additional notes
Here are some interesting peripheral points that I left out of my main discussion because I wanted to stick to the main point , which was : " Dijkstra was not insane " .
I said in an earlier post that " I often find Dijkstra 's innumerable screeds very tiresome in their unkind , unforgiving , and unrealistic attitudes toward programmers . "
But despite this , I believe he was a brilliant thinker , and almost every time he opened his mouth it was to make a carefully - considered argument .
You may not like him , and you may not agree with him , but you 'll be better off listening to him .
An archive of Dijkstra 's miscellaneous notes and essays ( a pre-blogging blog , if you like ) is maintained at the University of Texas .
I recommend it .
I said : if ( q ) { E ; } else { F ; } Suppose you believe that code E , given precondition x , is guaranteed to produce postcondition y.
And suppose you believe the same thing about F .
Then you can conclude the same thing about the entire if - else block .
Actually , your job is slightly easier .
Let 's write this : [ x ] E [ y ] to mean that code E , given precondition x , produces postcondition y .
That is , if we know that x is true when E begins execution , then we know that y is true when E finishes .
Then my quoted paragraph above says that from these : [ x ] E [y ]
[ x ] F [ y ] we can conclude this : [ x ] if ( q ) { E} else { F} [ y ]
But actually we can make a somewhat stronger statement .
We can make the same conclusion from weaker assumptions .
If we believe these : [ x and q ] E [y ]
[x and not q ] F [ y ] then we can conclude this : [ x ] if ( q ) { E} else { F} [ y ]
In fact this precisely expresses the complete semantics of the if - else construction .
Why do we use if - else blocks anyway ?
This is the reason : we want to be able to write code to guarantee something like this : [ x ] BLAH [ y ] but we only know how to guarantee [ x and q ] FOO [ y ] and [ x and not q ] BAR [ y ] for some q .
So we write two blocks of code , each of which accomplishes y under some circumstances , and use if - else to make sure that the right one is selected under the right circumstances .
Similar to break ( but worse ) , in the presence of goto you are on very shaky ground in trying to conclude anything about whether the program is correct .
Suppose you know that C is correct if its precondition ( an array of URLs ) is satisfied .
And you know that B will set up that precondition ( that is , the array ) if its precondition is satisfied , so it seems like you are all right .
But no , because block W somewhere else might have goto C ; and transfer control to C without setting up the precondition , and then C could cause winged demons to fly out of your nose .

Hoare logic is the [ x ] E [ y ] notation I used above , and a set of rules saying how to reason with claims of that form .
For example , one rule of Hoare logic defines the meaning of the null statement : if ; is the null statement , then [ p ] ; [ p ] for all conditions p .
Hoare logic was invented by Tony Hoare , who also invented the Quicksort algorithm .

For further details , see Dijkstra 's book " A Discipline of Programming " .
Dijkstra introduces a function called wp for " weakest precondition " .
Given a piece of code C and a desired postcondition q , wp ( C , q ) is the weakest precondition that is sufficient for code C to accomplish q .
That is , it 's the minimum prerequisite for C to accomplish q .
Most of the book is about how to figure out what these weakest preconditions are , and , once you know them , how they can guide you to through the implementation of your program .

Software Tools in Pascal is a book by Kernighan and Plauger that tries to translate the tool suite of their earlier Software Tools book into Pascal .
They were repeatedly screwed by deficiencies in the Pascal language , and this was the inspiration for Kernighan 's famous " Why Pascal is not my Favorite Programming Language " paper .
In effect , Software Tools in Pascal is a book - length case study of the deficiencies of Pascal for practical programming tasks .

The $ 80 billion in savings ( in the form of discounts ) would apply only to a certain category of Medicare recipients  those who fall into a gap in their drug coverage known as the doughnut hole  and only to brand - name drugs .
( Drug industry lobbyists probably chuckled , knowing that some patients would switch from generic drugs to the more expensive brand names in order to get the industry - sponsored discounts . )
To get a sense of how sweet a deal this is for the drug industry , compare its offer of $ 8 billion in savings a year over 10 years with its annual profits of $ 300 billion a year .
Robert Reich , who served as labor secretary in the Clinton administration , wrote that the deal struck by the Obama White House was very similar to the “ deal George W. Bush struck in getting the Medicare drug benefit , and it ’s proven a bonanza for the drug industry . ”
The bonanza to come would be even larger , he said , “ given all the Boomers who will be enrolling in Medicare over the next decade . ”
While it is undoubtedly important to bring as many people as possible under the umbrella of health coverage , the way it is being done now does not address what President Obama and so many other advocates have said is a crucial component of reform  bringing the ever - spiraling costs of health care under control .
Those costs , we ’re told , are hamstringing the U.S. economy , making us less competitive globally and driving up the budget deficit .
Giving consumers the choice of an efficient , nonprofit , government - run insurance plan would have moved us toward real cost control , but that option has gone a -glimmering .
The public deserves better .
The drug companies , the insurance industry and the rest of the corporate high - rollers have their tentacles all over this so - called reform effort , squeezing it for all it ’s worth .
Meanwhile , the public  struggling with the worst economic downturn since the 1930s  is looking on with great anxiety and confusion .
If the drug companies and the insurance industry are smiling , it can only mean that the public interest is being left behind .

Symptoms include disfiguring and painful skin ulcers , and in severe cases the infection can also spread to the internal organs .
Patients with the infection often suffer from social exclusion because of their disfigurement .
There is currently no vaccine against the disease and , although treatments are available , they are not always effective and access is limited in many areas .
Leishmania parasites are carried in the guts of sandflies .
The parasites produce a gel which turns into a plug which effectively blocks up the fly 's digestive system .
When an infected fly bites a human it regurgitates this gel plug , which enters the skin alongside the parasites .
The latest study - carried out on mice - shows that the plug acts to entice immune cells called macrophages to the bite site .
Macrophages usually kill invading pathogens by eating and digesting them .
But the gel persuades macrophages to engulf the parasites , and feed them rather than digest them .
This happens within the first few days following infection , enabling the parasites to establish themselves and infect the skin .
Lead researcher Dr Matthew Rogers said previous studies might have failed to explain leishmaniasis infection because they injected parasites directly into tissue without including the gel plug .
He said : " Our research shows that leishmania parasites are very cunning - they make their own gel to control the human immune system so they can establish a skin infection . "
Synthetic version Dr Rogers said work suggested a synthetic version of the gel might offer protection against infection .
The researchers found that the gel attracted 108 times more macrophages to the bite site than a saline solution .
They also showed that the number of parasites that survived the first 48 hours following infection , and the number of host cells that were infected , were both eight times higher when the gel was present .
Dr Tim Paget , an expert in microbiology at Medway School of Pharmacy , said there had been several clinical trials of potential vaccines , but they had generated mixed results .
He said : " This study may well prove to be of significant benefit .
" It is known that vaccines raised against proteins from the saliva from the sandfly can give protection to infection .
" Thus it is very likely that this gel could be used a target for the development of a novel vaccine .
" However , like all new findings , the benefits from this work are likely to be long term . "
Professor Simon Croft , an expert in parasitology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : " This is very exciting research and helps us understand a lot more about how Leishmania parasites establish an infection in mammalian hosts . "
However , he added : " This is a long long way from a vaccine , but this type of knowledge could be useful in thinking about the design of vaccines for leishmaniasis . "

Alcohol Shot Gun Sprays Slippery Nipples In Your Mouth
God knows how the people at Latestbuy managed to convince the clenchers in Canberra that selling a gun which shoots shots of alcohol was a good idea .
But they must have , because they ’re selling it now .
The booze gun will set you back $ 40 , which seems like a fun way to blow part of your monthly paycheck .
At least until you end up shooting Sambucca into someone ’s eye , blinding them with aniseed aromas .
Then there wo n’t be much fun for anybody .

A week before the Pirate Bay acquisition is set to take place the board of Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) has presented plans for the site to its shareholders .
If the deal goes through , GGF plans to install a torrent management system for the rights holders , which will allow them to remove infringing files or ' authorize ' them .
In June GGF shocked many by announcing that it would acquire The Pirate Bay and turn it into a legal file - sharing site .
According to the Swedish company everything is still on schedule , including the required funding .
The only hurdle that has to be taken now is to get approval from the company ’s shareholders .
Today , GGF shared its plans with the shareholders , who get to decide next week if the deal will go through or not .
In a letter addressed to them , the company confirms that the new Pirate Bay will become a pay site while revealing some additional details on how GGF plans to legalize it .
To please the entertainment industry GGF will install a system that will allow the copyright holders to either authorize the ‘ illegal ’ torrent or have it removed from the site .
If the copyright holder opts to choose the first option they will be compensated every time the file is downloaded .
In addition , the board says that it will pay penalties if it has to .
“ The holder will be able to leave the file and obtain compensation or ask for removal of the file .
GGF will also pay any penalties that may arise , ” the GGF board announced .
There are no licensing agreements in place with the entertainment industry yet , but GGF hopes to partner with most of the major movie studios and record labels within a year .
One of the pitfalls of this new reactive system is of course that copyright holders might start to remove content en masse instead of authorizing it , so that there is nothing available for the ( paying ) users to download and share .
Without content the users will walk away and The Pirate Bay will slowly die .
However , GGF ’s board believes that this is not going to happen , and they base this on talks with entertainment industry representatives .
“ The risk that rights holders will remove all content on The Pirate Bay at the date of acquisition is estimated as inexistent by GGF .
GGF ’s assessment after talks with the entertainment industry is that the majority of the content will remain on The Pirate Bay , ” they say .
If the shareholders give the green light to the new plans , the Pirate Bay will be acquired on August 27 .
Whether or not any of the existing users will start to pay for the site is yet to be seen , but we estimate , based on talks with several Pirate Bay users , that the majority will wave goodbye and move on to the next torrent site .
The Apple tablet is real , and someone claims they 've actually seen the thing .
Well , so goes the latest rumor anyway .
After months of speculation , innuendo and good ol ' wishful thinking , someone finally found an anonymous source not willing to go on the record who claims to have first - hand knowledge of the storied Apple tablet .
This morning 's rumor comes from the anonymous " A. Veteran Analyst , " who says they 've actually held a prototype for Apple 's next wonder device in their own hands , according to Barron's .
Mr. Analyst says
Apple is going to have a final design ready in the next six weeks , and the device would then be announced in September for a November launch .
The Apple tablet may also break your bank , costing you a whopping $ 699 to $ 799 .
But for those big bucks you'd get a device that would be able to , among other things , play high - definition video .
While other features might be nice , it sounds like the Apple tablet 's video capability is the feature to beat .
The anonymous source says the device 's video quality " is better than the average movie experience . "
So the 10 - inch Apple tablet is a better movie experience than staring at a giant screen with surround sound or watching a DVD at home ?
That must be some mythical device .
Computer Industry Scared Stiff
While Apple is busy creating its next super device to replace the multiplex , everyone else in the computer industry is reportedly so nervous about the Apple tablet they 're waiting to see what the product looks like before imitating or ripping it off .
That 's a smart move considering how one guy was left with a warehouse full of iPhony Nanos after this year 's MacWorld Expo .
By the way , if you 're looking for a fully non-functioning mini-iPhone drop me a line .
Apple Tablet : the Rumor That Keeps on Giving
Apple tablet mania has been heating up in recent weeks .
Earlier this month , another rumor came out saying the Apple tablet might be available through Verizon with a multiyear service contract .
An arrangement like that would subsidize the heavy cost of the device , and with a price of almost $ 800 it's not hard to see why that would make sense .
Late last week , there was also a rumor the Apple tablet would launch with a secret software project codenamed Cocktail .
The software is rumored to be a development in conjunction with the major music labels , and would be " a new type of interactive album , which will combine photos , lyrics sheets , video clips , and liner notes , all gathered into an interactive booklet . "
That sounds like an interesting concept , but software is one of the big questions hanging over the Apple tablet .
As Barron 's writer Tiernan Ray says , no one knows if this device will be attached to the iPhone App Store or will have a software model closer to Apple 's MacBook line .
As I 've said before , I think tying a tablet to the App Store could be a mistake since it would virtually guarantee a less - functional device .
But we may have to wait until next month 's supposed announcement before we 'll know for sure how this device will work .
Assuming of course , that this yet - to - be - proven device exists .
As PC World 's Michael Scalisi pointed out last week , the rumored Apple tablet , despite all they hype , could end up being a flop given the poor track record of past tablet devices .
So would Apple risk its iPhone mojo on an unproven device that nobody may want , or are we truly at the point where the world will just go nuts for anything Apple comes out with ?
If the rumors are correct , we may know the answer to that question very soon .

At the studio wit hit boy and chase

BBC News , Geneva
The Geneva Conventions were signed in 1949 The Geneva Conventions are 60 years old on Wednesday , but the anniversary comes amid concern that respect for the rules of war is small .
The three existing Geneva Conventions , which relate to the immunity of medical personnel on the battlefield and the treatment of prisoners of war , were extensively revised in 1949 .
The fourth Geneva Convention , which stipulates that warring parties have an obligation to protect civilians , was added .
The fourth convention in particular was born out of the horrors of the World War II - not just the appalling atrocity of the concentration camps , but the deliberate starvation of the city of Leningrad , and the indiscriminate bombing of Dresden and Coventry .
The conventions received widespread international support from the start , and today all 194 states have ratified them .
Unfortunately , signatures on paper have not led to respect for the conventions , and research conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) - which is the guardian of the conventions - shows that civilians suffer most in armed conflict .
Little compliance
In World War I , the ratio of soldiers to civilians killed was 10 to one .
In World War II it became 50 - 50 , and today the figures are almost reversed - up to 10 civilians killed for every one soldier .
Mary Gelashvili ( L ) lost her home in the Russia - Georgia conflict Last year 's brief war between Georgia and Russia is a case in point .
In just a few days , several hundred civilians are believed to have lost their lives and tens of thousands were driven from their homes .
Along both sides of the closed " administrative boundary line " between Georgia and the breakaway republic of South Ossetia , dozens of villages are abandoned , the houses burned or bombed .
Mary Gelashvili , an elderly woman from the village of Tserenisi , has lost not just her house , which is destroyed , but her livelihood too .
Her fields are along the boundary line , and she can no longer get to them .
" No one should have the right to destroy my home , " she says .
Under international law she is absolutely right .
Indiscriminate damage to civilian life and property is forbidden .
" It 's true the Geneva Conventions did n't help these people very much , " admits Florence Gillette , head of the ICRC office in the Georgian town of Gori .
" The conventions actually state that all precautions should be taken to spare civilian lives and property , and not just lives and property but all infrastructure essential to survival .
" That 's part of the fourth Geneva Convention that all the parties to this conflict , the Russians and the Georgians , signed and ratified a long time ago . "
Informal conflicts
One problem the ICRC has , however , in trying to encourage respect for the conventions , is that modern conflicts are often fought not between two identifiable formal armies , but between and among a variety of armed groups , including informal militias and even criminal gangs .
Little respect for the conventions was shown in South Ossetia Last year 's war between Russia and Georgia was classified by the ICRC as an international armed conflict .
Nevertheless , local militias also took part in the fighting and are believed to have been responsible for at least some of the damage to civilian property .
" Certain key concepts in today 's armed conflicts have to be clarified , " says ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger .
" It would be desirable to further develop certain aspects of the law , particularly those related to non-international armed conflicts . "
The Red Cross insists the real problem with the conventions is not their lack of relevance to modern warfare , but the continued lack of respect for them .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I believe the conventions need to be revised and signed again in order to prevent abuses and atrocities Andrei Dascalu , Cluj , Romania " That is the big question for all of us , " admits Philip Spoerri , the ICRC 's head of international law .
" We have to find ways to enforce these rules . "
But enforcement is a very tricky issue .
As guardian of the conventions and the world 's single most important humanitarian agency , the ICRC has no power to enforce , and would not want it .
" There , we have to turn to bodies like the International Criminal Court , " Mr Spoerri adds .
" Or the United Nations could enforce them , but of course we see there is not always the willingness to do so . "
Obama commitment
At the same time , the ICRC also rejects the suggestions which came from the then Bush administration that the Geneva Conventions are not really applicable in the " War on Terror " .
The ICRC is the guardian of the conventions " It is extremely significant that the new administration of President Obama reaffirmed US commitment to the conventions , " says Mr Kellenberger .
" We welcome that . "
Nevertheless , the Red Cross knows more needs to be done to encourage respect for the conventions , in particular to strengthen the protection of civilians , and work is under way at ICRC headquarters to find ways of doing that .
In the meantime , Red Cross workers like Joyce Hood , a nurse in South Ossetia , are left to pick up the pieces of civilian lives shattered by conflict .
Ms Hood spends much of her time caring for five elderly people , the only remaining inhabitants of the now destroyed village of Satskheneti .
" In almost all these situations it is the elderly , the very young , the vulnerable normal people that bear the brunt of conflict , " she says .
" They may not be injured by bullets but they suffer for a long time afterwards .
They rarely get their life back to what it was before .
" There are so many conflicts , and mostly internal conflicts , not massive wars like we used to see last century - little conflicts to the rest of the world but to these people it 's enormous , their whole life is destroyed .
" Their life is totally turned upside down , for nothing . "

The fact that a Continental airlines flight from Brussels to Newark landed safely , despite the death of the pilot , is no surprise , says David Learmount , operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine .
That 's what co-pilots are for , he says - to stand in for the pilot in case of emergency .
Do you need two pilots to land a passenger aeroplane ?
Aeroplanes are always landed single - handed - you cannot have two pilots struggling with the controls .
It 's decided at the beginning of every leg which pilot is going to do the flying and which will do the supporting .
Flying the plane , making the radio calls and handling all the systems is a very busy job , but it can be done - and air traffic control will give every assistance to a pilot flying on his own , making the job a lot easier .
A modern plane like the 777 can be flown from take - off to landing by a single pilot .
In fact , all pilots are tested when they qualify to ensure they can handle a multi- engined jet on their own .
The main reason for having two pilots is that something like this occasionally happens - though it 's less common for a pilot to die than to be incapacitated by something like food - poisoning .
Pilots and co-pilots are required to choose different meals from the in - flight menu for precisely this reason .
Can a plane be landed without any pilots at the controls ?
No .
A system called autoland has been available to airlines since the 1960s but you have to tell it what to do next , where to go - up , down , left , right - you have to direct it .
If there is someone on the flight deck to do that , the plane does not need to be flown - but it can not be done from the ground .
Also , planes cannot taxi and reach terminals by themselves .
If both pilots died , you would just have to hope that there was someone else on hand with some experience of flying an aeroplane .
In this case there were three pilots on board , a pilot and two co-pilots .
How common is that ?
It is essential on very long flights , Singapore to London say , to allow the pilot to have a break .
It 's not necessary on a regular transatlantic flight .
It was probably just fortuitous they had an extra co-pilot , in this case .
Should the passengers have been told that the pilot had died ?
There was no reason to tell them because they were not exposed to any risk .
They were not going to face an emergency landing .
Would the request for a doctor to come forward have alarmed passengers ?
Not necessarily .
If the crew had drawn a curtain across the galley it may not have been obvious that the doctor was taken to the flight deck .
It 's another matter what the doctor would have told his neighbours when he returned to his seat .
The crew will also have faced a decision whether to leave the dead pilot harnessed in his seat , or in one of the jump seats behind the pilots ' seats , or to move him from the flight deck .
There is not much room on the flight deck , but moving the body could have caused passengers some consternation .
The pilot who died was aged 60 .
At what age do pilots retire ?
They can keep flying until they are 65 , but there is a rule that if one pilot is between 60 and 65 the other pilot has to be younger than 60 .
That is a standard set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reduce the risk of both pilots suffering health problems on the same flight .
How frequently do pilots undergo health checks ?
They have annual medical tests until they are 60 .
After that it 's every six months .

Children want to know where rainbows come from Four in five UK parents have been stumped by a science question posed by their children , a poll has suggested .
The top three most - asked questions were : " Where do babies come from ? " , " What makes a rainbow ? " and " Why is the sky blue ? " .
More than half of the 1,002 parents surveyed thought their children knew more about science than they did .
And 20 % of parents said they felt silly when they did not know the answer to their children 's questions .
The survey of UK parents with children aged five to 16 was carried out to mark the launch of a new website by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills .
The website - Science : So what ?
So everything - gives information to parents on answering those tricky questions from children , as well as downloadable activity sheets and ideas of places to visit .
How to answer about where babies come from ?
The website explains that babies are created when a cell from the mother and a cell from the father join together or " fuse " .
After the two cells fuse , the site goes on , they divide over and over again to create a ball of cells called an embryo that goes on to become a baby that grows inside the mother for nine months .
The website explains how a rainbow is made from light and water - with help from the sun .
And the sky is blue , it says , because the sun produces white light which is made up of all the colours of the rainbow .
But a clear , cloudless day - time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more easily than they do red light .
' Incredibly curious ' Former Tomorrow 's World presenter Lindsey Fallow said : " Kids are incredibly curious , constantly wondering about the world around them .
Why is the sky blue ?
How do flowers grow ?
There 's no end to the things they want to know .
" An inquisitive mind is a good thing , but can leave parents in a sticky situation if they do n't know the answers . "
Minister for Science and Innovation - and father of five - Lord Drayson said : " Like all parents , I 've had to cope with many questions from my children .
" The Science : So what ?
So everything website will help parents get ready for the onslaught of questions their kids throw at them and fuel their children 's curiosity at the same time . "

It does n't specify what the notice is for .
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A man who stripped on northeast Asia ’s highest peak has been banned from the mountain and sent to prosecutors for ruining the scenery , national park officials said on Saturday .
The 30 - year - old man surnamed Lu will be kept off Jade Mountain in Taiwan for one to three years after a friend took photos of him naked on the 3,952 - metre peak on Tuesday and posted them online , officials said .
Prosecutors may indict him , as well .
“ I think he was just goofing around , ” said acting park police chief Chou Yen - hui .
“ He said it was just for fun .
But Taiwanese are conservative , and Jade Mountain is our sacred peak . ”
Jagged and often snowy Jade Mountain , the centrepiece of Taiwan ’s largest national park , is a Taiwan symbol often used for official promotions and company advertisements .
Climbers must apply for permits a month in advance to attempt the summit .
We all know of a nearby building that is crumbling away , apparently unloved .
Our countryside and streets are littered with them and although many are considered an eyesore , they also stir up feelings of rescue , restoration and salvation – the success of the BBC's Restoration series is testament to that .
English Heritage 's latest " Buildings at Risk " register has just been published and seeks to spotlight some of our most precarious historical structures .
There are over 5,000 monuments , buildings , parks and gardens , shipwrecks and battlefields on the new register , all under threat and in urgent need of conservation and repair .
Although not meant as a name - and - shame exercise , it has thrown up some interesting entries such as Jools Holland 's Cooling Castle near Rochester on the north coast of Kent .
Described as " a quadrangular castle with ruined fabric and in need of major repair " , it 's really only four rough stone walls and a gatehouse , nothing habitable .
English Heritage have graded its listings according to " condition " and " priority " and unfortunately for Mr Holland , Cooling Castle has crashed into the register as " very bad " and " A " respectively .
The musician and broadcaster sounded nonplussed at his new - found status , saying : " It 's not open to the public and I 'm surprised we 're on the register , but I have no quarrel with it .
We 've already restored some collapsed walls ... what we 're doing is consolidation . "
But Cooling Castle is just the tip of this conservation iceberg .
With nearly 373,000 listed building entries across England , David Brock from English Heritage tries to put the enormity of the task into context .
" The register only covers buildings that are grade II * or grade I , which accounts for just 8 per cent of all this country 's listed buildings .
We can't get involved at a local level for the other 92 per cent of grade II buildings and rely on local authorities having their own " at risk " register , although only 60 per cent of them do and these are often out of date . "

Famous buildings , including Castle Howard , in North Yorkshire , which was used as the backdrop for the TV and film adaptations of Brideshead Revisited , are at risk .
As well as Tillmouth Park , in Northumberland ; Key Hill cemetery , in Birmingham ; Redlynch House , in Somerset ; and Crystal Palace Park in London .
Stately homes , castles , battlefields and shipwrecks aside , the list features many domestic properties on the verge of becoming dust .
Like Tabley Old Hall in Cheshire , Hargreaves Farmhouse in Shropshire and 187 Shoreditch High Street in the London Borough of Hackney .
All are priority " A " and are in a parlous condition , suffering from either neglectful owners , long - term vacancy or just lack of interest .
But they also represent beautiful examples of their vernacular , rich in detail and local materials , despite having collapsed walls or tarpaulin on the roof .
Half the tragedy here is that they could provide a wonderful home for someone .
But who wants to take on such a task ?
Buyers who do decide to take the plunge will find direct contact with English Heritage unlikely – it's the need to build a good relationship with their local Conservation Officer that 's essential .
One thorny issue that arises when a property reaches a certain state of decay is what is a repair and what is an alteration .
" It 's a common misconception that just reinstating what is missing from a derelict house will be seen as a repair , " states David Brock .
" But this is not always the case .
If the damage is so great that you need to replace an entire floor , roof or gable end , this may be viewed as an alteration – not a repair – regardless of how faithful it is to the original .
Buyers need to discover as much as they can through the Conservation Officer , " suggests Brock , " and hopefully keep the Building Regulations department at bay . "
And it 's not just English Heritage who are on hand to help .
SPAB ( The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings , www.spab.org.uk) was founded by William Morris in 1877 to save old buildings from decay , demolition and damage .
They offer training , and advice on materials , as well as an informal list of trustworthy builders and professionals .
For more specific advice on the period of your house , try the Ancient Monument Society ( www.ancientmonumentssociety.org.uk), The Georgian Group ( www.georgiangroup.org.uk) or The Victorian Society ( www.victoriansociety.org.uk) or very helpful Twentieth Century Society ( www.c20society.org.uk ) .
The renovation game : Five top tips
* You 'll need to discover why the property is in the state it is ?
A wreck of a house was once loved and cared for , so understanding why it has deteriorated so much will inform your purchase and subsequent restoration .
Neglect is a very common issue , but not the only one .
A lack of access can leave a house unused for decades , as can an ownership dispute .
And do n't forget the local environs such as a nearby slurry pit or noisy neighbours .
Be pragmatic in pinpointing the property 's problems .
* Get a proper survey .
Ideally by a surveyor or architect with AABC ( Architect Accredited in Building Conservation , www.aabc-register.co.uk) accreditation .
English Heritage will also recommend , or ask RICS ( www.rics.org) for a list of Conservation Accredited surveyors .
Remember , if you have major structural problems , an ordinary engineer is not up to the job .
* Appoint a good architect .
Not only will they provide you with sound conservation advice , they should also be able to predict what the local authority will require from any building work and then be able to argue your case .
* Employ a good builder .
Do n't skimp on this .
Most ordinary builders need professional supervision – you 'll need a workforce that knows its corbels from its cobbles .
* Maintain contact with your Conservation Officer throughout your renovation .
It is crucial to get them on your side , especially when dealing with the Building Regulations department as they tend to be less imaginative .
In the case of listed buildings , your CO can get waivers for most Building Regulations , although the more new construction you are planning , the less control your CO will have .

To the casual observer , Star Trek and Star Wars look a lot alike , beyond the obvious similarity between their names .
Each has a lot of spaceships , strange worlds , ray guns , and aliens , many of whom look startlingly like humans with prosthetics and makeup .
But of course geeks are not casual observers , and we know just how different they are .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Now , I freely admit to having been a huge fan of both since childhood , and I know many people who feel the same way .
So why should we debate about which is better ?
Because we ’re geeks , and that ’s what geeks do !
So , in the finest tradition of completely unnecessary geeky arguments , let ’s create a preposterous hypothetical situation that requires you to choose between the two :
Suppose you were adrift in space after your spaceship ’s engines died , and while you ’re waiting for your rescuers to find you , you wanted to watch a movie .
Suppose , further , that the only two videos available were your favorite Star Trek movie and your favorite Star Wars movie ( whichever ones those happen to be ) , but your video player has only enough power left for you to watch one of them .
Which one would you choose ?
To help decide , since I suspect everyone reading this has a pretty good idea of what to like about both , I ’m going to focus on what not to like .
Star Wars is grounded in mythology : the struggle between good and evil drawn in such broad strokes that few characters have any shades of gray .
Even Darth Vader , who switches from good to evil and then back again , is never anywhere in between — he flips between extremes .
Is it any real surprise that the most popular character from the original trilogy is Han Solo , who is n’t as cut - and - dried ?
The Star Wars storyline requires you to take a lot for granted :
Most fundamentally , the main characters are far , far more important than anyone else in their world , even the “ good ” ones .
Look , for instance , at how everyone acts after Luke returns from blowing up the Death Star :
They ’re all cheering and hugging , and then Luke gets really upset about R2 - D2 being damaged — his good friend Biggs and a dozen other men were just blown to pieces , but Luke ’s upset because his droid is busted .
Nice .
And at the end of Return of the Jedi , Vader turns good and saves Luke by killing the Emperor , and then the ghost of Anakin Skywalker appears along with Obi-Wan and Yoda .
This man is responsible for personally killing hundreds of innocent beings , for ordering the deaths of countless more , and for torturing quite a few as well ; but he is completely redeemed because he saved his son ’s life .
This can only mean that Luke ’s life is worth as much as ( or more than ) those of all the ( probably ) thousands of people Vader slaughtered put together , because otherwise it simply makes no sense , right ?
These are the two examples that stand out the most in my mind , but there are plenty more where they came from .
Star
Trek begins with a premise so ridiculous it could only have originated in the Sixties : a united Earth , only about 250 years from now .
At least Star Wars started off by telling you it was happening “ in a galaxy far , far away ” so any assumptions based on what we know about Earth and humanity did n’t necessarily apply .
But Trek is science fiction , not fantasy , and so different rules need to apply , and they break them all the time .
First they go and invent things like warp drive and transporters , which are implausible but not outside the realm of normal suspension of disbelief .
Then , having created rules around how these marvelous devices work , they regularly break those rules .
It ’s not enough that the Enterprise can travel many times faster than light speed ; now they can go through a rift in subspace ( or somesuch ) and wind up thousands of light years away in an instant .
It ’s not enough that they can go back and forth between a planet and their ship in a few seconds ; now an ion storm ( whatever that is ) sends them to an alternate universe ( yes , it ’s one of my favorite episodes , too , but that does n’t make the premise less silly ) .
And why did it never occur to anyone designing chairs for Starfleet to install seat belts ?
I mean , I know they would have deprived us of some lovely scenes of actors throwing themselves back and forth and pretending to fall , but there might have been other benefits , too !
Of course , we have to consider the serious failures that are a part of both universes .
The Star Wars universe would look so much better were it not for Episodes I – III , and the Ewoks .
And the Star Trek universe would look much better without Star Trek V , and Generations , and Insurrection , and ( in my opinion , anyway ) Nemesis , not to mention quite a few episodes of each of the five TV series .
I hate to have to make a call here , but it ’s my job .
I have to give the nod to Star Trek .
For all its technobabble and implausible extrapolation from current reality , it ’s just on the whole a better product .
It ’s far more egalitarian , and so easier to identify with .
I get the feeling that , if I were transplanted to the Star Trek universe , I could make a go of it and be a productive member of society on some level ; conversely , I get the feeling that , if I were transplanted to the Star Wars universe , I would be one of those guys who has two lines and then gets shot by stormtroopers , who as everyone knows can only aim well at unimportant folks .
Plus , percentage - wise as well as ( obviously ) length - wise , Star Trek simply has a lot more good material .
Groupthink in Academia
Majoritarian Departmental Politics and the Professional Pyramid
Although academia differs from the settings explored by groupthink theorists , it exhibits many of the same tendencies and failings .
One result is the relative absence of classical - liberal and conservative viewpoints among humanities and social sciences professors , especially in the more elite departments .
Article
" Generally speaking , we can observe that the scientists in any particular institutional and political setting move as a flock , reserving their controversies and particular originalities for matters that do not call into question the fundamental system of biases they share . "
 Gunnar Myrdal , Objectivity in Social Research " Perhaps we avoid studying our institutional lives because such work is not valued by our colleagues .
The academy is , after all , a club , and members are expected to be discreet .
Like any exclusive club , the academic world fears public scrutiny .
Research is in the public domain .
Outsiders might use what the research reveals against the academy . "
 Richard Wisniewski , " The Averted Gaze " " The thousand profound scholars may have failed , first , because they were scholars , secondly , because they were profound , and thirdly , because they were a thousand . "
 Edgar Allan Poe , " The Rationale of Verse "
In baseball , fans of different teams can agree on general issues concerning rules , umpiring , and performance evaluation because such matters are separable from support for a specific team .
In academia , however , we find that rules and standards for performance are not separable from support for specific beliefs .
Ideological sensibilities and commitments in academia tend to be bound up with notions of the whole academic enterprise .
Thus , one 's positions on how performance should be umpired or evaluated and one 's support for a certain " team " are not separable .
We think that discussion of ideology in academia is itself bound to be ideological and that good scholarship calls on us to declare that our principal motivation for the present investigation is our belief that , by and large , professors in the humanities and social sciences are weak in certain sensibilities that we ourselves hold .
In particular , classical liberalism has few adherents among academics .
In policy terms , classical liberalism favors domestic reform generally in the direction of significantly decontrolling markets and personal choices , reducing the welfare state , and depoliticizing society .
A further policy feature of classical liberalism , in our view , is a strong disposition against military entanglements abroad .
The current label closest to classical liberal is libertarian , although classical - liberal beliefs are properly understood as somewhat looser and more pragmatic ; we also prefer the label classical liberal because it reminds us of liberalism 's historical arc .
Ample evidence on the ideological profile of professors in the humanities and social sciences indicates that the dominant , though not monolithic , sensibilities combine social - democratic leanings and support for ( or acquiescence to ) most domestic government interventions .
( We identify modern American " liberalism " as social democracy , a political outlook that readily treads on voluntarist ethics , views the polity as an organization , and therefore advocates the pursuit of collective endeavors , such as equalizing well - being and opportunity . )
Social - democratic views do not always run against the grain of classical liberalism .
In our view , however , existing frictions indicate problems with the faculty 's ideological profile .
Also , even absent friction , the neglect of important classical - liberal ideas itself often counts as a problem .
Our analysis rests on the judgment that the relative absence of classical - liberal views among humanities and social sciences professors is unfortunate ( but we make no argument for that judgment here ) .
Our analysis may be adapted by the adherents of other viewpoints who likewise see problems in the faculty 's ideological profile and find themselves systematically excluded and marginalized .
In particular , conservatives , in a narrow sense that clearly separates them from classical liberals , may use a version of our analysis as a conservative diagnosis of the problem .
Our classical - liberal viewpoint , then , is but one of two major viewpoints whose adherents may find the current account especially valuable .
Adapting Groupthink to the Academic Setting
We analyze academic ideology in terms of groupthink .
Groupthink analysis examines decision making presupposed to be defective .
In that sense , groupthink analysis is pejorative .
In the seminal work Groupthink : Psychological Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes ( 1982 ) , Irving L. Janis begins by examining a number of well - known fiascoes , including the Bay of Pigs , escalation in Vietnam , and Watergateepisodes that came to be judged fiascoes even by those responsible for them .
Janis starts with defectiveness and seeks to explain the absence of correction .
He defines groupthink as " members ' strivings for unanimity overriding their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action . "
He declares the term 's " invidious connotation " ( 9 ) .
Paul 't Hart , who developed the Janis tradition in Groupthink in Government : A Study of Small Groups and Policy Failure ( 1990 ) , calls groupthink " excessive concurrence - seeking , " a behavior that explains " flaws in the operation of small , high - level groups at the helm of major projects or policies that become fiascoes , " such as the Iran - Contra affair ( 7 , 4 ) , and he reviews several applications of groupthink research ( 12h15 ) .
Diane Vaughan's ( 1996 ) discussion of the space shuttle Challenger disaster , which involves both bottom - up and top - down organizational errors , can be said to occupy an intermediate position between traditional Janis - Hart analysis and the analysis offered here .
The groupthink theorist wants to gain standing as a social theorist and therefore wants to avoid unnecessary controversy .
Accordingly , groupthink theorists at least those like Janis and Hart have focused on episodes where , in hindsight , the judgment of failure ( or error ) is uncontroversial .
The need for uncontroversial judgment is one reason why the scope of groupthink applications has been quite limited .
In this article , we apply groupthink theory to a setting where the presupposition of failure is anything but uncontroversial .
Academe is quite different from the settings groupthink theorists have examined .
We suggest , however , that given the presupposition of failure , central mechanisms in academe make it possible to adapt groupthink theory to this setting .
We try to make plausible the idea that if academic groups were caught up in defective thoughts , the defectiveness would be resistant to correction .
We explain persistence , or the lack of correction .
We do not consider " how the problem got started , " in part because of space limits and in part because there never was an Eden .
To be sure , we ought to be cautious about using groupthink to interpret academic ideology in the humanities and social sciences .
The groupthink literature in the tradition of Janis and Hart examines mostly the belief processes of policymaking groups .
The cases usually have the following features :
The group is small .
The group is fairly neatly defined a group of " insiders . "
The group is chief based , with highly centralized decision making .
The group is concerned about security leaks or other constraints that lead it to put a premium on secrecy .
The group acts under great stress .
The group makes decisions that run great risks and involve huge possible dangers .
The group is dealing with an issue of great immediacy and exigency .
The group 's bad beliefs are specific to the decision at hand .
The bad beliefs are shallow ; they are not about issues of identity .
The potential for eventually admitting defectiveness usually exists .
In all of these features , policymaking groups differ significantly from academic groups .
The latter whether colleagues in a university department or the leadership at a prestigious journal or association are larger , less well defined , much less chief based , much less specific - action oriented , and much less subject to stress , urgency , risk , and danger .
Their bad beliefs are much deeper , more complex , and more incorrigible more in the nature of moral , political , and aesthetic values .
These differences make academic groups more diffuse and variegated in purpose .
Despite these differences , we see basic similarities between Janis - Hart groups and academic groups .
Both types of groups hold defective beliefs , and both tend toward concurrence seeking , self - validation , and exclusion of challenges to core beliefs .
Finally , mechanisms in academe work to create an " in-group " that is insular , self - perpetuating , and self - reinforcing .
Departmental Majoritarianism
Let us imagine a university called XYU whose inner workings resemble those of other institutions which is to say , they are hierarchical in purpose , structure , and authority .
XYU is an organization led by a provost , deans , and so on .
Beneath the administration come the academic departments .
Actors in an organization subdivide labor .
In most nonacademic organizations , the bosses can scarcely tamper in detail with tasks assigned to subunits ; rather , they look for results that advance the organizational mission .
Academe has the same necessary subdivision and delegation , but a much fuzzier sense of organizational mission .
Furthermore , oversight is more problematic in academe because scholarship is inherently specialized and embedded in the scholarly community .
Even Adam Smith ( [ 1776 ] 1981 ) , who criticized academia , emphasized that any " extraneous jurisdiction " over substantive issues of teaching " is liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously . "
[ 1 ]
The upshot is that administrators generally rubber - stamp departmental decisions .
Although the department may appear to be structurally " under " the administration , in practice it is left to decide the important questions ( about hiring , firing , promotion , teaching , research , graduate student training , and so on ) , nor is it guided in matters of an ideological nature .
The most important departmental decisions involve the hiring , firing , and promotion of tenure - track faculty .
Such decisions come down to majority vote .
Although the chair exercises certain powers , committees control agendas , and so on , the central and final procedure for rendering the most important decisions is democracy among the tenure - track professorsor departmental majoritarianism .
Most intellectuals develop ideological sensibilities by the age of twenty - five or thirty ( Sears and Funk 1999 ) , and afterward they rarely revise them substantially .
Intellectual delight and existential comfort are taken not in reexamining prior decisions , but in refining and developing ideas along the lines already mastered ( Ditto and Lopez 1992 ; Nickerson 1998 ) .
Professors are likely to respect scholars who pursue questions similar to their own and who master similar modes of thought .
They are not likely to respect scholars who pursue questions predicated on beliefs at odds with their own .
Indeed , if a scholar is engaged in a task that might threaten a colleague 's sense of self , he may give rise to personal distress and create acrimony between them .
Professor A might lose standing and credibility with students if a colleague , Professor B , who is teaching those same students in a different course , exploded some of the premises of Professor A's course materials , lectures , and writings .
In hiring a new member of the department , most existing members will tend to support candidates who share their fundamental beliefs , values , and commitments .
Indeed , one of a scholar 's prime responsibilities is to navigate through the big issues , make judgments and commitments , and move on .
These judgments are not separate from science or scholarship , and scholars rightly may say : " If Candidate A has judged differently on fundamentals , then he has exhibited bad scholarly or scientific judgment . "
This judgment cannot be disposed of .
No one has a way to step outside of it .
Discriminating on the basis of differences in fundamentals , therefore , cannot be condemned in the abstract as irresponsible scholarship .
We all discriminate on the basis of ideology , and again in the abstract doing so is perfectly justifiable .
As noted previously , the academic setting differs in certain regards from the settings groupthink theorists have studied .
Yet some of these differences may compensate for each other .
In academia , the focus of belief and action is not a crucial policy decision , such as invading Cuba .
Therefore , there is no corresponding secrecy and necessary separation from regular channels of discourse .
Another difference , however , has to do with the depth or personal significance of the beliefs in question .
In academia , the beliefs are deep seated and connected to selfhood and identity .
For that reason , protecting and preserving them have high personal stakes .
The existential significance of ideological beliefs in some respects compensates for the fact that personnel and other decisions in academia are otherwise mundane and socially inconsequential .
In context , people know they must judge and act on deep sensibilities , and they know , if only tacitly , that no real scandal attends their doing so .
Theories of group formation and social dynamics tell us that social groups tend to seek and attract newcomers like themselves ( McPherson , Smith - Lovin , and Cook 2001 ) , screen out and repel misfits ( Allport 1954 ; Brewer 1999 ) , and mold the unformed in their own image ( Katz and Lazarsfeld 1955 , 6263 ; Moscovici 1985 ) .
[ 2 ]
These tendencies are rooted in human nature .
Suppose a department must hire a new member , and 51 percent of the current members share a broadly similar ideology say , social - democratic progressivism or conservatism or classical liberalism / libertarianism .
Moreover , they believe that one must broadly conform to that ideology to be a good colleague and a good professor .
What happens ?
The department members hire someone like them .
The 51 percent becomes 55 percent , then 60 percent , then 65 percent , then 70 percent , and so on .
As Stephen Balch ( 2003 ) and others have noted , majoritarianism tends to produce ideological uniformity in a department .
The syndrome does not depend on the ideology 's identity .
The George Mason University Department of Economics is led by and dominated by classical liberals .
Some would identify themselves as conservative .
Only a few would identify themselves as liberal ( in the current U.S. sense ) .
A case of ideological discrimination ?
The classical liberals and conservatives think that being an interventionist in the manner of , say , Kenneth Arrow , Joseph Stiglitz , Paul Krugman , or Dani Rodrik reveals failings in economic judgment .
Many George Mason economists regard undue confidence in government and politics as bad science , and they consider arcane work a scientific failure to deal with the most important things . [ 3 ]
We speak of tendency , not of lockstep uniformity .
Some degree of variation will be normal and acceptable for example , ongoing internal tensions prevail between the more radical Left and the establishment Left .
In any case , the tendency toward uniformity is not the whole story .
An ideological oddball might be well liked and considered unthreatening , perhaps because he is meek or does research in an arcane mode that renders him effectively irrelevant to fundamental issues .
Moreover , departments usually have an ethic of consensus .
Colleagues are human beings , and they are stuck with each other .
They usually seek to avoid acrimony and aggravation .
The majority does not steamroll the minority 's interests .
The consensus factor works toward blandness in personnel matters ; the majority advances job candidates who belong to their camp , but not in a strident or outspoken way .
The consensus factor moderates the majority 's actions , but it does not undo the tendency toward uniformity .
Its main effect is probably to pull that uniform character toward blandness that is , merely toward a presumption in favor of the conventional policies and opinions of whatever major party the majority favors .
Outsiders often think that the classical - liberal or conservative professor needs only to get tenure in order to ensure his professional success and psychic well - being .
But imagine building a career through graduate school and pretenure employment ( about eleven years ) before feeling able to be yourself .
You then find you are no longer yourself not that your ideological views have changed much , but that any ideological motivation has likely receded .
You " go native , " as they say .
Your twenties and early thirties are a crucial period of development , and these developments cannot be reversed .
Moreover , even after being granted tenure , you depend on department colleagues for pay raises , resources , teaching assignments , scheduling , promotions , recognition , and consideration .
Tenure alone is clearly not a refuge for the departmental miscreant .
Because of departmental majoritarianism , each department tends toward ideological uniformity , perhaps watered down .
Some XYU students lament that the history department lacks classical liberals or conservatives .
Citizens at large , however , may hope that the public conversation among prestigious academic historians includes such viewpoints , so that perhaps one can shop for a university that has a history department with a more appealing ideology .
The Professional Pyramid
Imagine a college freshman named Sarah who comes from a family that admires thinkers such as Adam Smith , F. A. Hayek , and Milton Friedman .
She goes off to XYU .
After her first year , she informs her parents that the humanities and social science departments seem to be dominated by social democrats .
Her parents grumble , but what 's done is done .
However , they have another child looking toward college who wants to study history .
This time , they shop more carefully and investigate the history departments at different schools .
Everywhere they see signs of a social - democratic bent , and they wonder why it prevails so widely .
The principal explanation of the uniformity across campuses lies in understanding what the individual history department is at an existential level .
The XYU history department , for example , is not so much a subunit of XYU as it is a village of the larger tribe , history as a profession .
History the profession has a settlement at XYU , the XYU history department .
As professional researchers , members of that department find much of their meaning and validation in belonging to and serving the history profession .
They may share a roof with philosophers , linguists , and so on , but they almost never engage in scholarly discourse with them .
Rather , their scholarly life takes place within the tribe of history , which resides in settlements situated laterally across geography and physical institutions ( see figure 1 ) .
History is the " invisible college " to which most historians principally belong .
The department is more a creature of history as a profession than of XYU .
Again , the XYU history department has to make decisions about hiring and other matters .
They are microdecisions .
In making and justifying these decisions , department members draw on the tribe 's macronorms and values .
The micro and macro are intimately and thickly interconnected .
In structure , the tribe is pyramidal , with the elite at the apex and widening echelons at each lower step ( see figure 2 ) .
Position within the pyramid depends on focal , conventional rankings of key institutions , notably academic journals , departments , publishers , citations , grants , awards , and other markers of merit .
Individual scholars , aside from playing specific roles ( as teacher , writer , journal editor , and so forth ) , help to organize the tribe by performing activities that determine or affirm rank , such as writing letters , praising work , and citing research , and they too are subject to ranking .
All the usual metrics are intertwined and mutually reinforcing .
Research is highly specialized , and the tribe is broken down into subfields .
U.S. history , for example , might be broken down by period , by aspect ( social , cultural , economic , gender , political , legal ) , by mode of research , by theme or character .
Prestige and eminence are determined within the subfield , a kind of club within the tribe .
The clubs constitute the tribe , just as agencies and branches constitute the government .
Each club sorts people with overt reference to pedigree , publication , citations , and letters of reference .
The club controls these filters and then applies them to itself .
It controls the graduate programs and journals .
By spawning and hiring new recipients of Ph.D. degrees , the club reproduces itself .
The academic job market is unlike the market for waiters or cab drivers .
In all but the literal sense , one history department " sells " its newly minted Ph.D. holders to other history departments .
The consumers ( history departments ) , the producers ( other history departments ) , and the products ( newly minted history Ph.D. holders ) are all historians .
Waiters and cab drivers are accountable to their employers , who are accountable to consumers .
Historians are accountable for the most part only to other historians .
Meanwhile , they are spending funds drawn from taxpayers , tuition payers , foundations , and charitable donors .
The pyramid of club and tribe is self - validating .
Who else can possibly provide the validation ?
The pyramidal structure is to a great extent in the nature of the beast .
A department 's microdecisions are decisions about friends , colleagues , enemies , friends of friends , students of mentors , and so on .
If it wants to look beyond itself to make and justify its decision , it looks to the higher echelons of the profession , as an individual may look to heritage .
This allegiance reflects in part a sincere faith in the tribeafter all , we would agree that the official rankings express genuine quality in some important dimensions of scholarship .
But in part it reflects a practical need to establish commonly understood standards and practices .
The tribe 's standards are focal points around which expectations are mutually coordinated and consensus is tolerably achieved ( Whitley 1984 ) .
Without an encompassing standard , a discipline has no prospect of conducting itself as a coherent enterprise .
The precept " history is what historians do , and historians are those with history degrees and appointments " may not be intellectually satisfying , but at least it keeps the wheels turning fairly smoothly .
Reliance on the tribe 's standards to decide on jobs , pay , security , teaching loads , grants , research assistants , and so forth is so entrenched and ingrained that the players come to value the standards for their own sake .
Having an article accepted at a top journal brings concrete gains and prestige , regardless of the article 's or journal 's intrinsic value .
Functionality depends on internalizing the discipline 's norms .
Now , suppose that the departments and journals at the pyramid 's apex adhere to ideology j .
In that case , no internal conflict occurs , and any dissent from below is safely ignored .
Indeed , inferiors will be inclined to refrain from criticism because they depend on their superiors ' acceptance and endorsement .
Microdecisions throughout the pyramid will tend to follow those at the apex .
In addition to such concurrence mechanisms , there is propagation : the apex produces Ph.D. holders and places them well .
Consider a conventional ranking of two hundred economics departments worldwide , where the top thirty - five are treated as the apex ( Klein 2005 , 143 ) .
In these top thirty - five departments , more than 90 percent of faculty received their Ph.D. degree from the same thirty - five departments ; the top is almost entirely self - regenerating .
According to the regression line , the department ranked one hundredth would have about 65 percent of its faculty from the top thirty - five .
Departments farther down the pyramid are generally much smaller , so the top thirty - five departments train and mentor the people who populate most of the top two hundred departments .
The profession , especially at the higher echelons , consists for the most part of people directly indebted to and personally loyal to those at the apex .
Yet these results do not fully capture the domination by the top departments , which also have vastly disproportionate influence in regard to journals , grants , second - generation degrees , and so on ( Klein 2005 , 14445 ) .
In sociology , for instance , Val Burris documents the extraordinary power that the leading U.S. departments exercise :
Graduates from the top 5 departments account for roughly one - third of all faculty hired in all 94 departments .
The top 20 departments account for roughly 70 percent of the total .
Boundaries to upward mobility are extremely rigid .
Sociologists with degrees from nontop 20 departments are rarely hired at top 20 departments and almost never hired at top 5 departments .
. . .
The hiring of senior faculty by prestigious departments is even more incestuous than the hiring of new PhDs. . . .
Of the 430 full - time faculty employed by the top 20 sociology departments . . . only 7 ( less than 2 percent ) received their PhD from a nontop 20 department , worked for three or more years in a nontop 20 department , and , after building their scholarly reputations , advanced to a faculty position in one of the top 20 departments .
( 2004 , 24749 , 251 )
In the field of law , Richard Redding finds : " A third of all new teachers [ hired in law schools between 1996 and 2000 ] graduated from either Harvard ( 18 % ) or Yale ( 15 % ) ; another third graduated from other top - 12 schools , and 20 percent graduated from other top - 25 law schools " ( 2003 , 599 ) .
Because of the mechanisms that operate within disciplines propagation , " follow the apex , " and " freeze - out " if the apex embraces ideology j , it will tend to sweep that ideology into positions in every department all the way down the pyramid .
We are oversimplifying , but perhaps not much .
Some dissent will occur , but heterodoxy focuses on criticizing the mainstream pyramid because the pyramid remains the gravity well of group practice and individual ambition .
As for any central power , people fight over its exercise and distribution .
If parallel pyramids are erected , they generally are either ignored or co-opted into the fringes of the official pyramid , altering its character somewhat .
The professional pyramid and departmental majoritarianism function together effectively to exclude scholars opposed to ideology j , especially from the highest - ranked departments .
This process may explain why in most fields of the humanities and social sciences , no predominantly classical - liberal institution has a significant professional standing .
Academic Groupthink
Although academia differs from the settings explored by groupthink theorists , it exhibits many of the same tendencies and failings .
Irving Janis provides a summary table of antecedent conditions and symptoms of groupthink ( 1982 , 244 ) .
We list them here verbatim ( in boldface ) , omitting a few items that do not fit the academic application ( such as " Provocative Situation Context " ) .
We add ( in regular type ) our suggestions of how these conditions and symptoms operate in academia .
We sketch a narrative of increasing social - democratic groupthink from about 1972 , when the ratio of Democrat to Republican in the humanities and social sciences ( excluding two - year colleges ) was around four to one , to the present , when it is around eight to one ( Klein and Stern 2005 , 264 ) .
ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS
Decision Makers Constitute a Cohesive Group .
The professional pyramid and departmental autonomy tend toward group cohesiveness .
Structural Faults of the Organization Insulation of the Group .
No one outside the pyramid is qualified to judge the group .
Insiders safely ignore outside opinion .
Homogeneity of Members ' Social Background and Ideology .
Sorting and molding mechanisms produce ideological homogeneity , both throughout the pyramid and within the individual department .
In 1972 , the social science and humanities faculty was preponderantly Democratic .
Once the skew became too great , it tumbled into a self - reinforcing process .
Among professors , the Democratic tent is significantly narrower in policy views than the Republican tent ( Klein and Stern 2005 , 272 ) .
OBSERVABLE CONSEQUENCES
Symptoms of Groupthink Type I : Overestimation of the Group Illusion of Invulnerability .
Academics feel that those outside the pyramid lack knowledge and credibility , and that those inside the pyramid would not dare to become renegades .
Belief in Inherent Morality of the Group .
Individuals choose to join an academic profession .
Many say they do so to serve scholarship , learning , science , truth , society , and so forth .
Belonging is infused with dedication and purpose .
It is part of one 's identity .
Heightened uniformity makes the group overconfident .
Members take their ideas to greater extremes .
Facing less testing and challenge , the habits of thought become more foolhardy and close - minded .
Type II : Closed - Mindedness Collective Rationalizations .
Academic professions develop elaborate scholastic dogmas to justify the omission of challenging or intractable ideas .
Discussions that depart the forty - yard line and explore substantially different arrangements are dismissed as " normative , " " ideological , " or " advocacy . "
Classical - liberal formulations of voluntary versus coercive action would be dismissed as illusory and ideological .
In economics , where mathematical model building dominates the theoretical literature , important facets of knowledge and discovery , including the virtues of free markets , have little chance to be noticed or studied .
As Janis writes , " When a group of people who respect each other 's opinions arrive at a unanimous view , each member is likely to feel that the belief must be true .
This reliance on consensual validation tends to replace individual critical thinking and reality - testing " ( 1982 , 37 ) .
Stereotypes of Out - Groups .
Janis writes : " One of the symptoms of groupthink is the members ' persistence in conveying to each other the cliché and oversimplified images of political enemies embodied in long - standing ideological stereotypes " ( 1982 , 37 ) .
It is not uncommon for social - democratic academics to lump their critics together as " conservatives " or " the Right , " and , as Mark Bauerlein ( 2004 ) notes , to assume that these critics are represented by the likes of George W. Bush , Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , and Sean Hannity .
Few social - democratic academics engage the classical - liberal alternative offered by Adam Smith , F. A. Hayek , Milton Friedman , or Richard Epstein .
Self - Censorship .
The pyramid functions much like a genteel society in which criticism is muted .
Particularly because of norms of consensus , it is impolitic to alienate colleagues .
Going along to get along , dissidents and miscreants tend to suppress their disagreements with the dominant view , leading to what Timur Kuran ( 1995 ) calls " preference falsification . " [ 4 ]
Direct Pressure on Dissenters .
In Janis 's work , an insider who dissents is pressed to toe the line .
In academia , the dissenter is more likely to be frozen out .
As the group 's beliefs become more defective , the group becomes more sensitive to tension , more intolerant of would - be challengers and miscreants .
This development leads to tighter vetting and expulsion , more uniformity , more intellectual deterioration , and more intolerance .
Stanley Rothman , Robert Lichter , and Neil Nevitte ( 2005 ) provide evidence that conservative scholars hold less academically prestigious positions than their peers , controlling for research accomplishment , and we show elsewhere ( Klein and Stern 2005 , 275 ) that Republican - voting scholars who are members of major academic associations are more likely than their peers to have landed outside of academia ( especially in sociology , history , and philosophy ) .
Symptoms of Defective Decision Making Incomplete Survey of Alternatives Incomplete Survey of Objectives Failure to Reappraise Initially Rejected Alternatives Poor Information Search , Selective Bias in Processing Information at Hand
All of the foregoing items from Janis 's table can be applied to social - democratic and forty - yard - line blinders and precepts .
Classical - liberal and conservative ideas are often ignored , dismissed by way of elaborate dogmas , or treated only in false caricature .
Some Examples
Perhaps the clearest way to illustrate how we see the problem of social - democratic groupthink in the humanities and social sciences is to perform a thought experiment .
Imagine a doctoral student who unabashedly holds classical - liberal ideas .
Ask yourself whether such a student would be able to find warm support in the elite departments of political science , sociology , history , and so forth .
Ask yourself whether the student , no matter how solid his research , would be likely to win grants , have his articles published by the most respected journals , and succeed on the academic job market .
Consider some specific claims that such a student 's research might explore :
FDR and the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression .
American labor laws , such as union privileges , have never been justified and have hurt the poor .
The K12 school system in the United States can be fruitfully analyzed as a socialist industry , and it exhibits most of the characteristic failings of socialism .
Most mandated recycling programs are a waste .
In our view , such claims are more than merely plausible , and it would be easy to multiply the examples .
Research of this type is not completely unheard of within the tribe of economics , [ 5 ] but especially in other disciplines a new Ph.D. holder who develops such claims and substantiates them thoroughly would fail on the job market and in the " good " journals .
The lack of tribe credentials and seals of approval would justify microdecisions to freeze out such a scholar .
Consider some broader theses in philosophy , politics , sociology , anthropology , and history , many of which can be pursued empirically :
" Social justice " makes no sense ( as argued by Hayek ) .
" Social justice " is an atavism ( as argued by Hayek ) .
Government intervention , such as the minimum - wage law , is coercive ; the social - democratic state is a society of wholesale coercions .
Leading features of democratic processes include ignorance , superficiality , and systematic biases .
Democracy often treads on liberty , decency , and prosperity .
The rise of social democracy since the late nineteenth century may be fruitfully regarded as a subversion of liberalism , specifically in that it promotes a view of the polity as a kind of organization .
Since 1880 , intellectuals have altered the meaning of many key terms of the liberal lexicon freedom , liberty , liberalism , justice , rights , property , rule of law , equity , and equality so as to undermine their power in opposition to a social - democratic worldview .
and so as to undermine their power in opposition to a social - democratic worldview .
Organizational integrity varies positively with the voluntary basis of participation and funding that is , government organizations tend to lack organizational integrity because they do not face the threat of loss of support based on voluntary participation .
The distinction between voluntary and coercive action ( or laissez - faire versus interventionism ) provides a better framework for analyzing political views and public opinion than a distinction between liberal and conservative .
These ideas are anathema to the tribes of such disciplines . [ 6 ]
Groupthink keeps them out of the prestigious journals and course curricula .
Some of these fields have alternative centers and associations that might pursue such ideas , but these centers and associations generally remain peripheral to the professional pyramid .
Classical - liberal and conservative scholars know the score , and if they nonetheless try to get on in academia , they find themselves watering down their ideas and cloaking or misrepresenting who they really are .

Following all the problems ( both technical and human ) in last week 's primaries in Maryland , combined with the rather damning report on the security of the machines put out by Ed Felten ( which Diebold has responded weakly to , making all sorts of claims that do n't refute anything Felten put in the paper ) , Maryland 's Governor , Robert Ehrlich is calling for the state to scrap all of the e-voting machines for the November election and focus on paper ballots .
This comes as even more problems were found with the electronic voting machines used in the election .
Of course , the head of the Elections Board and the state Senate President are fighting against this plan , saying that they can " correct " the problems with the machines .
That would be impressive , considering just how many problems have been found with Diebold e-voting machines over the years , and the company 's blatant unwillingness to deal with them .
The rationale for keeping the machines also leaves us scratching our heads : " We paid millions .
These are state - of - the - art machines . "
Two responses :
The evidence is pretty clear that these arestate of the art machines .
They 're badly made , with ridiculously weak security , and a company behind them that bullies its critics , blatantly misleads in its responses to security problems and cracks jokes about their weak security when confronted .
Therefore , it really does n't matter how many millions you spent on them , the machines are a problem .
The Senate President also accused Ehrlich of simply using this issue as a political ploy to rally his supporters .
By the way , for those of you who want to believe e-voting is simply a big Republican conspiracy ( based on some offhand remarks by Diebold 's former chief ) , we should note that Ehrlich ( who wants to scrap the machine ) is a Republican , and the folks who want to keep the machines are Democrats .
So , once again , we 'll note that this is not a partisan issue .
It 's an issue about having secure , fair and accurate voting .
