The COVID - 19 pandemic has prompted calls by democrats for mail - in voting in November ’s elections .
While President Trump says the move would open the door to election fraud , his opponents say it is necessary to ensure public safety .
With the stakes so high , the issue remains hotly debated on both sides of the aisle .
A recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) and Israel , to normalise ties , represents a foreign - policy win for US President Donald Trump , who played a crucial role in mediating the deal .
Trump was elected in 2016 on the promise to end what he described as ‘ endless and unnecessary ’ conflicts between regional neighbours .
There is a lot that goes into really understanding politics in America .
It ’s important to know the political system , the principles , and bills .
New bills and laws are passed in different states throughout the country every day .
Some can even be considered very controversial .
One controversial topic going around America right now is online gambling .
Online Gambling Regulations in the US
There are a lot of politics in the United States when it comes to online gambling .
It is up to a state ’s government to legalize online gambling .
The state can choose what forms of online gambling are allowed , including online casinos , sportsbooks , and the lottery .
Online gambling laws in the United States are extremely strict .
Operators have to follow regulations set in place by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board , and failure to do so could result in serious consequences .
As a player , you must adhere to certain rules .
Anyone looking to legally gamble online must be at least 21 years old and located within that state .
Pennsylvania and New Jersey are among the only states to have legalized both online casinos and sportsbooks .

MGS4 Goes Gold , Includes iPod and Playboy Brands
" I can now saw we have finished , Metal Gear Solid 4 is finally completed , " series creator Hideo Kojima announced at a press event yesterday .
" It was quite a test .
Honestly , I feel relieved . "
As for Playboy , the well - known nudie publication replaces the generic dirty magazines that have been used to distract enemies in past releases .
Kojima noted that flipping through the in - game magazine will help reduce the stress level of protagonist Solid Snake .

“ This is the new face of hunger , ” said Josette Sheeran , executive director of the UN ’s World Food Programme , launching an appeal for an extra
$ 500 million so it could continue supplying food aid to 73 million hungry people this year .
“ People are simply being priced out of food markets ” ¦We have never before had a situation where aggressive rises in food prices keep pricing our operations out of our reach . ”
The WFP decided on a public appeal several weeks ago because the price of the food it buys to feed some of the world ’s poorest people had risen by 55 percent since last June .
By the time it actually launched the appeal on March 20 , prices had risen a further 20 percent , so now it needs $ 700 million to bridge the gap between last year ’s budget and this year ’s prices .
In Thailand , farmers are sleeping in their fields after reports that thieves are stealing the rice , now worth $ 600 a tonne , straight out of the fields .
Four people have died in Egypt in clashes over subsidized flour that was being sold for profit on the black market .
There have been food riots in Morocco , Senegal , and Cameroon .
Last year , it became clear that the era of cheap food was over : food costs worldwide rose by 23 percent between 2006 and 2007 .
This year , what is becoming clear is the impact of this change on ordinary people ’s lives .
For consumers in Japan , France , or the United States , the relentless price rises for food are an unwelcome extra pressure on an already stretched household budget .
For less fortunate people in other places , they can mean less protein in the diet or choosing between feeding the kids breakfast and paying their school fees , or even , in the poorest communities , starvation .
And the crisis is only getting started .
It is the “ perfect storm ” : everything is going wrong at once .
To begin with , the world ’s population has continued to grow while its food production has not .
For the 50 years between 1945 and 1995 , as the world ’s population more than doubled , grain production kept pace — but then it stalled .
In six of the past seven years , the human race consumed more grain than it grew .
World grain reserves last year were only 57 days , down from 180 days a decade ago .
To make matters worse , demand for food is growing faster than population .
As incomes rise in China , India , and other countries with fast - growing economies , consumers include more and more meat in their diet : the average Chinese citizen now eats 50 kilograms of meat a year , up from 20 kilos in the mid-1980s .
Producing meat consumes enormous quantities of grain .
Then there is global warming , which is probably already cutting into food production .
Many people in Australia , formerly the world ’s second - largest wheat exporter , suspect that climate change is the real reason for the prolonged drought that is destroying the country ’s ability to export food .
But the worst damage is being done by the rage for “ biofuels ” that supposedly reduce carbon - dioxide emissions and fight climate change .
( But they do n’t , really — at least , not in their present form . )
Thirty percent of this year ’s U.S. grain harvest will go straight to an ethanol distillery , and the European Union is aiming to provide 10 percent of the fuel used for transport from biofuels by 2010 .
A huge amount of the world ’s farmland is being diverted to feed cars , not people .
Worse yet , rain forest is being cleared , especially in Brazil and Indonesia , to grow more biofuels .
A recent study in the U.S. journal Science calculated that destroying natural ecosystems to grow corn or sugar cane for ethanol , or oil palms or soybeans for biodiesel , releases between 17 times and 420 times more carbon dioxide than is saved annually by burning the biofuel grown on that land instead of fossil fuel .
It ’s all justified in the name of fighting climate change , but the numbers just do n’t add up .
This is the one element in the perfect storm that is completely under human control .
Governments can simply stop creating artificial demand for the current generation of biofuels ( and often directly subsidizing them ) .
That land goes back to growing food instead , and prices fall .
Climate change is a real threat , but we do n’t have to have this crisis now .
“ If ” ¦more and more land [ is ] diverted for industrial biofuels to keep cars running , we have two years before a food catastrophe breaks out worldwide , ” said Vandana Shiva , director of the Indian - based Research Foundation for Science , Technology , and Natural Resource Policy , in an interview recently .
“ It ’ll be 20 years before climate catastrophe breaks out , but the false solutions to climate change are creating catastrophes that will be much more rapid than the climate change itself . ”
It is great to see that we finally have some national unity on energy policy .
Unfortunately , the unifying idea is so ridiculous , so unworthy of the people aspiring to lead our nation , it takes your breath away .
Hillary Clinton has decided to line up with John McCain in pushing to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline , 18.4 cents a gallon , for this summer ’s travel season .
This is not an energy policy .
This is money laundering : we borrow money from China and ship it to Saudi Arabia and take a little cut for ourselves as it goes through our gas tanks .
What a way to build our country .
When the summer is over , we will have increased our debt to China , increased our transfer of wealth to Saudi Arabia and increased our contribution to global warming for our kids to inherit .
No , no , no , we ’ll just get the money by taxing Big Oil , says Mrs. Clinton .
Even if you could do that , what a terrible way to spend precious tax dollars  burning it up on the way to the beach rather than on innovation ?
The McCain - Clinton gas holiday proposal is a perfect example of what energy expert Peter Schwartz of Global Business Network describes as the true American energy policy today : “ Maximize demand , minimize supply and buy the rest from the people who hate us the most . ”
In developing this new Copywriting Maven Makeover Series , I wanted to make sure that I provided useful information to Copyblogger readers without giving too much of the proprietary information away .
Therefore the format for my critiques will be somewhat different than the landing page series .
The simple “ 10 points ” approach does n’t work as neatly here .
So , for now at least – and subject to change as we go along – I ’ll provide a short background outline and then X number of points under What Works , What Needs Work , and Maven Mull - Overs .

Let ’s look at what works and what needs work .
WHAT WORKS :
Specificity of the Target Market – I like that , unlike so much of the self - help / self - discovery market out there , you ’ve found a niche within a niche – budding / would - be entrepreneurs .
You could sharpen this further , targeting gender , business - types , etc .
Also , too , your market will be coming to you at different places in their entrepreneurial cycle .
Some are tire - kicking the idea .
Some are almost ready to make the move , but need a little more time and confidence .
Others have already jumped in but are floundering and feel lost .
Your copy needs to address these individual market segments or “ personas ” in ways that make sense .
Personal Experience / Expertise of the Developer – You have current experience in the field you ’re providing for .
I ’d make sure you promote that experience upfront and other any tangibles that will lend credence and credibility to your offering .
( No one cares about what you ’ve read or think EXCEPT in terms of what you ’ve already done . )
Product is Accessible to Subscriber 24/7 without Your Personal Input – An ideal situation which frees you up for other things , including brainstorming new product and promotional ideas .
Strong Satisfaction Guarantee – Even after finishing the course , subscriber gets full refund if not delighted .
Right now it ’s 30 days .
Why not extend it ?
Strong guarantees move fence - sitters to yes .
Few subscribers , unless your offering is truly awful , will ask for the refund .
WHAT NEEDS WORK :
Product Appears too Familiar – I do n’t get a strong sense of something special and unique about your offering .
I ’d sharpen up the focus to make sure your content is all about building a great heart and mind to build great business .
Your description seemed to read like every other self - help course I ’ve seen promoted .
Product Deliverables Appear Ordinary –
You ’ve got a lot of competition in this market , so you need to be sure that what you deliver is unique .
I do n’t see anything really special about the “ what I get ” part of your program .
We have self - contained , interactive modules and a forum .
What else of perceived value can you offer upfront to make your product an irresistible buy ?
Ebooks ?
Reports ?
Your personal checklist of something wonderful ?
How about a weekly “ Call with Lars ” for your students to interact with you personally ?
MAVEN MULL - OVERS :
Do n’t confuse features with benefits , identify the ultimate promise you ’re making – Features are the physical characteristics of your product / service .
It ’s the outer shell that people can see , smell , taste , etc .
In your case , the features are the course and course components , how it ’s delivered , and things like that .
Benefits are what your prospects will get / enjoy by using your product / service .
By taking your course , subscribers boost their chances for success , reduce their risk , ultimately save time , money and headaches faced by less - savvy budding business owners , and the like .
Your ultimate promise – the deepest , most emotionally resonant part of your message – is the ability to live your life – fully , completely , and richly – on your own terms .
Rethink the “ anti- sales ” bias in your plan .
Embrace your inner “ salesman ” with a full heart – Good marketing is n’t about screaming hype and hyperbole .
At its honorable heart – yes , I said honorable – it ’s about increasing the pleasure / alleviating the pain of your prospect with genuine products / services , ethically developed and delivered .
You ’re not looking to make a sale .
You ’re looking to begin a relationship built on mutual trust , need and loyalty .
Build Price and Offer Testing into Your Plan – Bottom - line , you need to know what works and what does n’t .
Price and offer tweaking , as well as creative testing , are all critical to your long - term success .
Test low , medium and high price points .
I like your free report for email , $ 1 for module 1 .
How could you make deadlines work , adding more urgency to the offer and rewarding the prospect for acting now rather than later ?
Start planning the second product now rather than later – Dollars to find ’em , pennies to keep ’em – that ’s an old marketing saw that still rings true .
You ’ve spent a lot of time , money and effort to get those first sales / customers in .
They ’ve taken your course , now what ?
How else can you deepen and further the relationship you ’ve just opened ?
The real value of any customer is what they buy from you the second and subsequent times .

The coins were reportedly distributed at a checkpoint in Falluja A US marine in Iraq has been removed from duty following claims that he handed out coins inscribed with biblical verses in Arabic .
Residents in Falluja had complained that the coins were being distributed at a checkpoint , the US military said .
US troops are forbidden from proselytising any religion .
The case comes a week after US President George Bush made a personal apology over a US soldier in Iraq shot holes into a copy of the Koran .
In the Falluja incident , a military statement said a service member had been discharged " amid concerns from Falluja 's citizens regarding reports of inappropriate conduct " .
A report from McClatchy News Service carried a photo of a silver coin it said had been distributed in the Iraqi city .
Written in Arabic script on one side of the coin were the words : " Where will you spend eternity ? "
On the other side , the news service said there was a Bible verse referring to Jesus : " For God so loved the world , that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish , but have eternal life .
John 3:16 . "
Koran shooting Military spokesman Mike Isho told McClatchy that marines at the western gate in Falluja had been searched following a report about the coins .
One man found with the coins was reassigned and would no longer be working in the central Anbar province , he said .
The military said coalition forces were prohibited from " proselytising any religion , faith or practices , and our troops are trained on those guidelines before they deploy " .
It is still investigating the incident and says " appropriate action will be taken " if claims about the coins are substantiated .
Earlier this month , a soldier was sent home from Iraq after a Koran was found riddled with bullets in a shooting range near Baghdad .
The incident triggered a violent protest by more than 1,000 people in Afghanistan in which three people died .

Forcing people who are injured to apply for Social Security before paying their claims appears to bolster insurers ’ profits in several ways .
If claimants refuse to apply , the insurers can simply stop paying their benefits , said Dawn Barrett , an employee of the Cigna Corporation , who grew frustrated sending people to Social Security and who is now a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits .
More typically , she said , people apply for Social Security when an insurer tells them to .
That allows the insurer to reduce its claim reserves , money that is kept in conservative investments for benefit payments .
And in the insurance industry , smaller reserves mean bigger profits .
Image Jessica Ortiz of San Diego said her disability insurer called more than 10 times after she was hurt in a car crash , insisting that she apply for Social Security .
She was denied , as she had expected .
Credit ... Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times
“ It ’s all about the numbers , ” Ms. Barrett said .
Finally , disability insurers tell many of their claimants to appeal Social Security ’s rejections again and again , until some are finally accepted .
Then the insurers can take those people off their rolls , shifting the cost to the government .
Whistle - blowers have filed lawsuits against the Unum Group , America ’s largest disability insurer , and Cigna , another large one , though there is no dispute that the Social Security requirement is an industrywide practice .
Unum , with revenue of $ 10.5 billion , paid disability claims of $ 4 billion last year .
Both companies said their claims practices were fair , legal and consumer - friendly .
“ Our goal is to ensure that each member receives all of the benefits to which he or she is entitled , ” said Jill Roman , a spokeswoman for Cigna .
The lawsuits do not fault the idea of coordinating benefits with Social Security and workers ’ compensation .
Instead , they contend that insurers are recklessly dumping people on Social Security ’s doorstep , without properly screening them to make sure they have a chance of qualifying .
The typical long - term disability policy says workers can collect when they are unable to do their own jobs for some period , usually more than five months .
Social Security , by contrast , will pay only those people who are so badly disabled they cannot do any job at all .
The disability must be one that will last more than 12 months or that will lead to death within that time .
Mr. Sabourin , the spokesman for Unum , denies the suits ’ accusations and says that his company does screen people .
He said Unum considered it in the best interests of its claimants to try for Social Security , because the federal program offers advantages over private insurance .
Even though the federal requirements are tough , he said , Social Security has certain exceptions and trial programs that Unum ’s claimants might qualify for .
Several people have written asking whether , in posting a quick note about the school girls of Ningxia who wore the same school uniform every day for three years , I meant that the modest circumstances of many average Chinese people proved that China posed no problems for the rest of the world .
Of course not , as I said at the time .
To spell it out : countries can support powerful and threatening military establishments even if their overall economy is faltering ( the old Soviet Union ) .
They can create problems for the world even if they are extremely poor ( North Korea ) .
Sometimes economic dislocation itself can make aggression more likely ( post - Weimar rise of the Nazis ) .
Often the attempt to escape poverty can cause environmental disaster .
And so on .
What I was trying to convey is how different , both intellectually and emotionally , the phenomenon of " China 's unstoppable rise " looks if you 're actually here seeing the people in the middle of the process , versus how it must sound if you just hear about it from afar .
( Young boy helping bring in the harvest , Gansu Province , last September )
I had traveled in China in the mid-1980s , when virtually everyone was poor and the " rich " people were farmers with their own pigs .
To be in the middle of the Chinese phenomenon now is to be respectful of and , yes , occasionally awe - struck by what China has achieved .
But I think any visitor here has to notice how many , many challenges China has to deal with -- and how preoccupying those internal challenges are to almost everyone in the country .
( Different family doing harvest work , Gansu Province )
My impression is that outsiders think Chinese officials really are sitting around mainly thinking about their ever - improving place in the world .
I 'm sure they spend some time on such thoughts .
But I am saying that , if you were here , you would probably feel as I do that China 's officials and people spend 90 per cent of their time thinking about the next 99 problems the country faces , and how they can deal with them .
Actually , what I was trying to say was exactly this , from the Atlantic 's American Values issue last fall :
When living in Japan , I heard accounts from many Japanese who had gone to the U.S. for business or study in the 1950s , after the Allied occupation ended .
They looked at the factories and the farms and the vastness of America and asked themselves :
What were we thinking ?
How could tiny Japan have imagined challenging the United States ?
After the Soviet Union fell and the hollowness of its system was exposed , many Americans asked :
What were we thinking about “ two superpower ” competition with the U.S.S.R.?
Its missiles were lethal and its ideology was brutal and dangerous .
But a rival to America as an overall model ?
John F. Kennedy was only one of many to suggest as much , in his 1960 campaign references to the prestige gap as well as missile gap that had opened .
Eventually , we all learned there was no comparison at all .
I think if more Americans came to China right now and saw how hard so many of its people are struggling just to survive , they too might ask :
What are we thinking , in considering China an overall threat ?
Yes , its factories are formidable , and its weight in the world is huge .
But this is still a big , poor , developing nation trying to solve the emergency of the moment .
Susan Shirk , of the University of California at San Diego , recently published a very insightful book that calls China a “ fragile superpower . ”
“ When I discuss it in America , ” she told me , “ people always ask , ‘ What do you mean , fragile ? ’ ”
When she discusses it here in China , “ they always ask , ‘ What do you mean , superpower ? ’ ”
Sixty - Six
This story from Joe Wilcox a little over a week ago is really quite something :
Apple ’s retail market share is 14 percent , and two - thirds for PCs costing $ 1000 or more .
Should I repeat those numbers ?
The share data is for first - quarter brick - and - mortar stores , as tabulated by the NPD Group .
Apple ’s market share is but one measure of success .
Sales growth is way up , while Windows desktop PC sales are way down .
Just to clarify , this is just the U.S. brick - and - mortar retail market .
So it does n’t count PCs purchased by IT departments ( which do n’t buy retail , and which do buy $ 1000 + machines ) , but it does n’t count computers purchased via the web , either .
So it ’s just a slice of the overall market , but an interesting one , because retail sales generally indicate individual preferences .
Most people do n’t get to choose the computer they use at work , but they do get to choose the one they use at home .
The idea that Apple now sells two - thirds of retail computers costing $ 1000 or more is simply stunning .
I ( along with many others ) have long argued that a simplistic “ overall PC market share ” number has never been a good metric for gauging the Mac ’s success because the “ overall PC market ” includes millions of commodity - level low - end machines that Apple neither tries nor wants to sell .
Back in 2003 , I wrote :
The analyst Baker is on the right track with his “ Acura sports cars vs. Taurus station wagons ” analogy , but it is n’t quite right .
The idea of overall PC market share , as currently conceived by IDC , is not so much like overall automobile market share as it is like overall motor vehicle market share .
It ’s like counting everything from golf carts to tractor trailers as a single category , thus making the “ overall market share ” look worse than it is for a company that only makes actual passenger cars .
And , similarly , I ’ve long held that Apple ’s share of the overall profits in the PC hardware industry would be a far better measure of success than their unit sales share , in that their product line eschews the high - volume / low - profit commodity market .
Paul Thurrott frames this new sales data as simply proving that “ Macs really are more expensive than PCs ” .
One could easily ( and rightly ) quibble with Thurrott ’s analysis in a slew of ways — that , no , comparably equipped Macs actually cost around the same or even less than similar PC machines — but in a way he ’s right .
Most “ PCs ” sold today cost less than $ 1000 , and but for the Mini , all Macs cost more than $ 1000 .
Which means
Apple ’s recent market share growth is far more impressive than unit sale numbers indicate .
In fact , given that the Mini is Apple ’s only sub -$ 1000 machine and that typical MacBooks and iMacs are n’t even that close to $ 1000 , I strongly suspect that if NPD ’s numbers were more granular , Apple ’s share would be even more dramatic at higher price ranges : $ 1500 + , $ 2000 + , etc .
So the striking thing about this report is n’t that the number makes Apple look good , it ’s how much better Apple is doing than just two years ago .
These fantastic numbers are not how it ’s always been .
Philip Elmer - DeWitt reports :
Still , Apple ’s share of the $ 1,000 - plus retail market was less than 18 % in January 2006 according to NPD .
By September 2007 , it had grown to more than 57 % .
And in the first quarter of 2008 it hit a record 66 % .
So from 18 to 66 percent in two years — in what had seemed until very recently a relatively old and stable market .
In short : people who care about computers , at least insofar as “ caring ” means “ spending over $ 1000 ” , are switching to Macs .

AMY GOODMAN : The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold a series of hearings examining the Bush administration ’s role in authorizing the illegal torture of prisoners in US custody at Guantanamo and elsewhere .
On Tuesday , Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers subpoenaed Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff , David Addington , to testify at a hearing scheduled for June 26th .
Three other former Bush administration officials have already agreed to testify : former Attorney General John Ashcroft , former Justice Department attorney John Yoo and former Pentagon official Douglas Feith .
Over the past month , more evidence has emerged tying high - ranking Bush administration officials to the use of torture .
In April , ABC News reported Vice President Cheney , former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft all discussed and approved how top al - Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the CIA .
President Bush has also confirmed he was aware of these meetings .
In an interview with ABC News , Bush said , “ We started to connect the dots , in order to protect the American people .
And yes , I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ” 
Today , we ’re joined by British attorney and author , Philippe Sands .

Welcome to Democracy Now !
PHILIPPE SANDS :
It ’s great to be back , Amy .
AMY GOODMAN : It ’s good to have you with us .
Talk about the Conyers subpoena of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff , David Addington .
PHILIPPE SANDS : Sure .
Well , if you remember , we talked about a month ago , after a piece I had written for Vanity Fair came out .
That piece , I ’m told by Congressman Conyers , catalyzed his committee into focusing on the role of the lawyers , and they began the process of setting up hearings .
Yesterday was the first hearing .
They ’ve issued letters of invitation to all of the lawyers that I ’ve written about and several other individuals .
All , I understand , have agreed to come voluntarily , with one exception , and that ’s Mr. Addington , who was the Vice President ’s lawyer at the time , now his chief of staff .
He has indicated , however , in a letter of the 1st of May , that if subpoenaed , he would attend , and it is likely that he will now attend next month .
AMY GOODMAN : And what did you raise in your testimony before the congressional subcommittee ?
PHILIPPE SANDS :
Well , I think – I raised a number of issues , but the heart of this story is that the administration has spun a narrative that this was a bottom - up thing , they were simply reacting to requests from people on the ground .
And what I ’ve discovered , and what was the center of the gravity of what I said to the subcommittee , is that ’s a false narrative .
It came from the top down .
A crime was committed in relation to the detainee that I ’m looking at .
The Geneva Conventions were violated .
He was abused .
He was probably , almost certainly , tortured in violation of international law .
But the biggest story may well be the cover - up , the spin , that this came from the bottom up , when in fact it was top - down .
And that seemed to have resonated with the committee .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about this ABC News revelation about this Principals Committee , all the names that I just gave – you know , Condoleezza Rice , Rumsfeld , Colin Powell , George Tenet , Attorney General John Ashcroft – first time senior White House officials linked to an explicit group authorizing the CIA interrogation program , one top official recounting Ashcroft was the lone cabinet member to raise doubts ?
The official quoted Ashcroft as saying , “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ” 
PHILIPPE SANDS : I think it ’s a very important revelation .
Of course , it deals not with the military interrogations that I focused on , but with the CIA interrogations , but they went hand - in - hand , and it ’s plain that they were all part and parcel of a decision taken at the top .
It confirms my investigation , as a consequence ; it ’s namely that this came straight from the top .
The significance , of course , of this is that there seems to be a question as to whether the people immediately below the principals knew about this .
I was in conversation , for example , a couple of days ago with Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff , who expressed –
AMY GOODMAN : Lawrence Wilkerson ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : Larry Wilkerson , who – I asked him , “ Were you aware of this ? ” 
He said , “ Absolutely not . ” 
I asked him , “ Did you have any inkling that this was going on ?
Do you think it could have happened ? ” 
And he expressed some considerable surprise .
But if the President of the United States says a meeting happened , he knew about it , he approved it , it becomes , I think , a very , very big story , because you ’ve got confirmation from the main man , so to speak .
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about the missing records of Mohammed al - Qahtani .
PHILIPPE SANDS : Well , I discovered in the course of meeting – I went around America , was treated with great hospitality and friendship .
I spoke to everyone in the decision - making process , from the lawyers down at the bottom , Major General Dunlavey , who was the combatant commander at Guantanamo at the time , and his lawyer Diane Beaver , right up to Jim Haynes , who wrote the memorandum , the famous memorandum in which Mr. Rumsfeld scrolled , “ Why is standing limited to four hours ?
I stand for eight to ten hours a day . ” 
AMY GOODMAN : Wait , explain that memo .
It ’s also the cover of your book .
PHILIPPE SANDS :
It is the cover .
AMY GOODMAN : You ’ve got the handwritten note of Donald Rumsfeld .
First you see his signature , and then you see this note , “ I stand for eight to ten hours a day .
Why four hours ? ” 
PHILIPPE SANDS :
It ’s become iconic .
What Mr. Rumsfeld did was he authorized fifteen techniques of interrogation , but he wrote at the bottom of the document , “ I stand for eight to ten hours a day .
Why is standing limited to four hours ? ” 
That ’s been interpreted a number of ways .
Was he signaling to the interrogators that the Secretary of Defense was willing for them to go further ?
Or was it just a jocular comment ?
I discussed that with a lot of people .
One of the people I met with on a couple of occasions , lengthy conversations , was Mike Dunlavey , the head of interrogations .
And right at the end of one of the conversations , he mentioned to me that he had made efforts to go back to get hold of all the documentation to check the computers , to check the record of what had happened , and that there had been , he discovered , what he called a SNAFU , and everything had been lost .
And I think it will be for others now to follow up as to whether the interrogation materials relating to al - Qahtani have suffered the same fate as the interrogation materials of the CIA that , as we now know , were destroyed .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Richard Myers ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : I had one lengthy and fascinating conversation with General Myers .
I thought he was a decent man of integrity , but out of his depth .
And on two issues , I was staggered , so staggered , in fact , that when I came home to London from my trip to the United States , I told my wife what I discovered in conversation with him , which I ’m about to share with you , and she was disbelieving – she listened to the tapes – and said absolutely .
There were two points .
Firstly , as everyone knows , the President took a decision that none of the detainees at Guantanamo would have any rights under the Geneva Conventions .
It seems that General Myers was unaware of that .
He was under the impression they had decided that Geneva would apply .
So that was a fairly staggering discovery .
But it was as nothing compared to the discovery , as we went through the techniques of interrogation one by one , that he had thought that these came out of the US Field Manual guide for interrogations .
They were all prohibited .
And as we went down the list , his jaw literally dropped .
So I got the sense that the most powerful military man in the United States , indeed probably in the world , was blissfully unaware of what had been decided .
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re talking to Philippe Sands .
His book is Torture Team – it is just out this week – Rumsfeld ’s Memo and the Betrayal of American Values .
I want to ask you about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ’s recent statement that the torture of prisoners does not violate the Eighth Amendment ’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
Scalia ’s comment came during an interview with Lesley Stahl on CBS ’s 60 Minutes .
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : I do n’t like torture .
I ’m – although defining it is going to be a nice trick .
But , I mean , who ’s in favor of it ?
Nobody .
And we have a law against torture .
But if the – everything that is hateful and odious is not covered by some provision of the Constitution .
LESLEY STAHL : If someone ’s in custody , as in Abu Ghraib , and they are brutalized by a law enforcement person , if you listen to the expression , “ cruel and unusual punishment , ”  does n’t that apply ?
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : No , no .
LESLEY STAHL : Cruel and unusual punishment ?
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA :
To the contrary .
You think – you think that you would – has anybody ever referred to torture as punishment ?
I do n’t think so .
LESLEY STAHL : Well , I think if you ’re in custody and you have a policeman who ’s taken you into custody – JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA :
And you say he ’s punishing you ?
LESLEY STAHL : Sure .
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA :
What ’s he punishing you for ?
You punish somebody – LESLEY STAHL :
Well , because he assumes you , one , either committed a crime – JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : No , no .
LESLEY STAHL : – or that you know something that he wants to know .
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA :
Ah , it ’s the latter .
And when he ’s – when he ’s – when he ’s hurting you in order to get information from you – LESLEY STAHL : Yeah ?
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : – you do n’t say he ’s punishing you .
What ’s he punishing you for ?
He ’s trying to extract – LESLEY STAHL : Because he thinks you ’re a terrorist , and he ’s going to beat the you - know - what out of you .
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA :
Anyway , that ’s my view .
And it happens to be correct .
AMY GOODMAN : Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , being questioned by 60 Minutes ’ Lesley Stahl .
Philippe Sands ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : I ’m not an expert on US constitutional law .
I ’ll talk about what I know , which is international law .
The US is a party to all of those conventions that prohibit torture .
That is a shocking statement by a serving justice , who I know is very partial to the television program 24 , along with his colleague Clarence Thomas .
It ’s –
AMY GOODMAN : Explain 24 .
PHILIPPE SANDS : 24 is a television program in which the use of torture is essentially rejoiced in as a technique for producing meaningful information .
It had an effect down at Guantanamo .
One of the things I discovered in my conversations was that people watched it , people were influenced by it , probably apparently as Antonin Scalia is .
But that is a shocking statement .
And I put it in these terms .
If he ’s going to express that view , that the United States president is free to authorize torture , then why is n’t the Iranian president free to authorize torture against American nationals ?
Why is n’t the Egyptian president free to organize – authorize torture ?
The logic of the argument is really surprising and , frankly , outrageous .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you , Philippe Sands , about the possibility of US officials being charged with war crimes .
You were quoted in a New York Times piece on Tuesday : “ Mr. Sands , a British law professor , said two foreign prosecutors , whom he did not name , asked him for the materials on which his book Torture Team was based .
“ ˜ If the US does n’t address this , ’ he said , “ ˜other countries will . ' ”
PHILIPPE SANDS :
That ’s an accurate account , and I describe , in one of the concluding chapters of the book , conversations I had with a European prosecutor and a European judge .
And the committee was very interested in that , in relation to a question they asked me and the other witnesses giving testimony : “ What should this committee do ? ” 
And the answer that I gave was , “ Look , it ’s not for me to make recommendations on precisely what you do and do n’t do , but what needs to happen is the United States needs to get involved in an accounting process .
The committee needs to establish the facts .
And if the United States does n’t , others will do it . ” 
And I have no doubt , no doubt whatsoever , that investigations will take place , if they ’re not already taking place , and that some of these individuals , if they travel outside the United States , will face a very real threat of investigation .
AMY GOODMAN : And the legality of what President Bush said , or the implications of it , when he said to ABC News , “ We started to connect the dots in order to protect the American people .
Yes , I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue , and I approved ” ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : Well , it appears to be an admission that the President of the United States authorized torture , that he authorized waterboarding .
The convention prohibiting torture , the Geneva Conventions are absolutely clear : there are no circumstances in which torture is permitted .
And if the account is accurate , the President is , in effect , owning up to the fact that he has committed a war crime .
And under the torture convention , there is an obligation to investigate any person who has committed a war crime .
So it was a very surprising admission .
I wonder if it was fully thought through .
If it ’s accurate , it is deeply disturbing .
AMY GOODMAN : Philippe Sands , you talked in your testimony before Congress about torture and what Britain learned in its fight with the IRA , with the Irish Republican Army .
PHILIPPE SANDS :
In many ways , that was actually the most interesting exchange that I had , because I had it with some seemingly very sensible Republican congressmen , who were very interested and came up and talked to me about that afterwards .
What I shared was that the experience of Brits across the political spectrum – it ’s not a left - right issue , as I explained – derives from the experience we had in the early 1970s , in which the United Kingdom moved to aggressive interrogation .
And they used pretty much the same techniques of interrogation : hooding , stress , humiliation .
And it backfired terribly .
On all military accounts , it extended the conflict by between fifteen and twenty years , because it creates such resentment in the community that is associated with the people who are being abused that it served to generate further opposition and people moving to violence .
So basically the message is : it does n’t work .
And no one in the United Kingdom , literally no one from any of the main political parties or across the political spectrum will in any circumstances support what has been apparently authorized by the President in this country .
AMY GOODMAN : Philippe Sands , I wanted to ask you about a report out of Associated Press .
A Kuwaiti freed from Guantanamo Bay carried out a suicide car bombing recently in Iraq – the US military said this on Wednesday , confirming what ’s believed to be the first such attack by a former detainee at Guantanamo .
Tom Wilner , al - Ajmi’s American lawyer , said incarceration at Guantanamo may have turned the Kuwaiti into a terrorist .
Wilner said , quote , “ I do n’t know whether the experience of being kept down there in isolation radicalized him . ” 
PHILIPPE SANDS : I read that report , and I was – this morning – and I was disturbed by that report .
I mean , I find that the whole system that has been created at Guantanamo is abhorrent .
It does n’t meet minimum international standards .
It sends out a terrible signal to the rest of the world .
Most of the people , I think , being held at Guantanamo are really not seriously problematic people .
But undoubtedly , there are some problematic people , and steps do need to be taken in order to protect countries like the United States and the United Kingdom .
That said , I immediately , reading the article , asked myself the question : is this individual someone who fell into that small category of persons who was , as Donald Rumsfeld put it , a seriously bad person ?
We do n’t know that .
And there is the possibility that the treatment that he was subjected to gave rise to an IRA type of situation , that it so enraged him , that it so enraged his community , that it essentially politicized him and energized him .
Of course , we do n’t know the facts , and I think we need to find out a lot more about the facts before expressing a final view .
AMY GOODMAN : You live in Britain .
Your book is Torture Team , though , about the United States and international law .
The people involved that you ’re talking about go across the gamut , now a number out of office .
You have John Yoo , for example , who ’s a law professor at University of California , Berkeley .
You have Douglas Feith , who ’s now teaching at Georgetown .
What are your thoughts about this ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : John
Yoo ’s dean at Berkeley has been subject to intense criticism for not firing him , and indeed there was even an op -ed , an opinion , an editorial , in the New York Times , saying he basically should n’t be teaching there anymore .
Dean Edley wrote an interesting letter , in which he said , look , there ’s freedom of expression , that includes freedom of views , and under the rules at Berkeley , you can only fire someone if they ’ve been convicted in a court of law of committing a criminal offense .
And John
Yoo has not been convicted of committing a criminal offense .
And in our system , you are innocent until proven guilty .
I ’ve laid out the reasons why I believe John Yoo has participated in authorizing torture , and that exposes him to investigation .
But I entirely accept that until he is actually condemned by a court of law , he is perfectly entitled to carry on peddling views , even if I violently and fundamentally disagree with those views .
As regards Doug Feith , I spent time with him .
He ’s an entertaining character , but he ’s a scary character .
I ’ve read his book , 900 pages on war and decision , five pages devoted to the issue of interrogations .
And you read that book , and you have no idea that this man was deeply involved in the decisions that I write about .
It ’s spin .
It ’s whitewash .
There ’s a failure to accept responsibility .
And that , I think , is what is going to cause them in difficulty , because it ’s essentially a cover-up .
AMY GOODMAN : We invited Douglas Feith on the show , but we did n’t get a response .
Can you talk about the significance of the 1947 case , United States of America v. Josef Altstoetter ?
PHILIPPE SANDS :
It “ ˜s a delicate case .
It ’s one of the cases known as the Justice Cases , the only time that lawyers have ever been convicted of international crimes for carrying out their professional activities .
AMY GOODMAN : Lawyers ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : Lawyers .
The focus was on lawyers .
I included reference to that case in my book , because I found it ironic that the theory that lawyers could cross a line and be investigated , prosecuted , and convicted for committing international crimes was a theory that was drawn up by the United States military itself , and then we come full - circle sixty years on , and we find that , with Mr. Rumsfeld ’s hand , abuse is authorized and permitted by the US military in plain violation of international rules , but also in plain violation of President Lincoln ’s disposition , going back to 1863 , that the US does n’t do cruelty .
But the case is an important one .
It ’s not a bang - on point , and I ’m absolutely not drawing analogies .
I ’m not saying that these lawyers are equivalent to those lawyers or this regime is equivalent to that regime .
What I ’m interested in is the circumstance , in when does a lawyer cross a line into criminality ?
And coming back to an earlier question that you raised , the European judge and the European prosecutor that I met , when I laid out all the materials for them , they came back with a most startling conclusion .
They said , “ Philippe , the bottom line of it is , there is no distinction between the man or woman who interrogates and the man or woman who authorizes by law an abusive interrogation .
They are both subject to investigation .
They are both subject to prosecution . ” 
And I think that ’s the way the law has gone , and it ’s a law that is right , and it is a law that the United States has helped put in place .
AMY GOODMAN : What were you most surprised by in your research for Torture Team ?
PHILIPPE SANDS : I was most surprised by the total failure of the upper echelons to accept responsibility for the errors that they have made .
If I had met these people , if I had met Doug Feith and Jim Haynes , and they had said to me , “ Look , we faced in September 2002 a situation in which we felt another attack was coming .
We had someone who we felt had information .
We authorized techniques of interrogation that were aggressive .
They may or may not have crossed the line into torture .
With the benefit of hindsight , we realize we fell into error .
We made a mistake .
We accept responsibility for that , and we need to learn not to do that again ”  – that shocked me , and it equally shocked me that they then sought to push the blame of responsibility onto people like Mike Dunlavey and Diane Beaver , people who were doing decent service for the US military and who were unfairly scapegoated .
So at the end of the day , it ’s not only the crime ; it ’s the abject failure of individual responsibility to take full account for what they have done .
I find that really shocking .
AMY GOODMAN : Philippe Sands , I want to thank you for being with us .
His book is Torture Team : Rumsfeld ’s Memo and the Betrayal of American Values .

White House does n’t deny McClellan ’s Bush - to - Libby leak allegation
Eric Brewer
In Scott McClellan ’s recent statements to the press regarding his apostasy , he says that one of the things that pushed him over the edge was the revelation on April 6 , 2006 , that President Bush had secretly authorized the selective release to reporters of classified information , something that both the president and his then - spokesman McClellan had been vigorously condemning in their public statements about the Valerie Plame leak case .
“ I walk onto Air Force One and a reporter had yelled a question to the president trying to ask him a question about this revelation that had come out during the [ Libby ] legal proceedings , ” McClellan told the Today Show ’s Meredith Viera on Thursday morning .
“ The revelation was that it was the president who had authorized , or enabled , Scooter Libby to go out there and talk about this information .
And I told the president that that ’s what the reporter was asking .
He was saying that you , yourself , were the one that authorized the leaking of this information .
And he said , ‘ Yeah , I did . ’
And I was kinda taken aback . ”
So “ taken aback ” evidently that he announced his resignation thirteen days later .
At Friday ’s morning gaggle in the White House briefing room I asked Press Secretary Dana Perino whether McClellan ’s claim about what Bush said to him on Air Force One was true .
The classified information McClellan was talking about was the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iraq , portions of which were leaked to reporters in the summer of 2003 as part of the Bush administration ’s counter - attack on Joe Wilson , who had accused the White House of using twisted intelligence to support the invasion of Iraq .
Yesterday , another reporter asked a similar question , but had interpreted Scott ’s remark as referring to the Plame leak , which is not a claim McClellan explicitly makes .
Today I asked Perino the following question ( note : the gaggle was off - camera , and no official transcript was provided by the White House ) :
Me : Yesterday you were asked about Scott ’s assertion that in early April 2006 he relayed to President Bush a reporter ’s question about whether the president had personally authorized Scooter Libby ’s leaking of classified information , to which the president replied , according to Scott , “ Yeah , I did . ”
Did the president make that statement ?
Perino :
The question I got was whether or not the president had authorized the leaking of Valerie Plame ’s identity .
That ’s not what the book says .
That ’s what the question was , that ’s not what the book says .
And that ’s the question that I did n’t answer because I knew that ’s not what the book says .
Me : But can you answer my question , right now ?
Perino : I did n’t understand your question , because you asked me about a question I was asked yesterday that was mischaracterized .
Me : Well , Scott has asserted that in early April of 2006 he relayed to President Bush a reporter ’s question about whether the president had personally authorized Scooter Libby ’s leaking of classified information , to which the president replied , according to Scott , “ Yeah , I did . ”
Did the president say “ Yeah , I did ” to Scott ?
Perino : I have no idea whether he said that or not .
Me : Well , have you asked him ?
Perino :
No , I have n’t .
And I think it ’s kind of unreasonable to expect anyone to remember a specific conversation like that .
But let me just say one thing .
That ’s commenting specifically on the Libby and Plame case .
Because it ’s still a matter of civil litigation , I ’m not going to get myself embroiled in that .
I do n’t think there ’s anything improper about pushing back on the public record when it needs to be pushed back on .
And the case that you ’re talking about is the NIE on Iraq , and that was declassified .
At least that ’s the story put out by the Bush administration and by Scooter Libby , who was convicted of two counts of perjury , one count of making false statements to the FBI , and one count of obstruction of justice .
In reality , the NIE was “ officially declassified ” ( those are Scott McClellan ’s words , by the way ) on July 18 , ten days after Scooter Libby leaked it to the New York Times ’s Judy Miller in their meeting in the St. Regis Hotel .
But there was something else that Scooter leaked to Judy at that July 8 meeting .
As firedoglake ’s Marcy Wheeler has pointed out , Scooter Libby was asked to leak something to Judy Miller on July 8 that was so unprecedented , so hush - hush , so on the Q.T. , that he was n’t willing to do it until he had gotten assurances from Vice President Cheney that the president himself had authorized it .
It does n’t make sense that he would have been that worried about leaking the NIE , because he had already leaked the NIE twice before , to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post on June 27 , and to David Sanger of the New York Times on July 2 .
So what was it then that made Scooter so nervous ?
The other thing he leaked to Judy that day at the St. Regis was that Joe Wilson ’s wife , Valerie Plame , worked for the CIA .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first reporter to ask about the Downing Street memo and the Pentagon analysts scandal at White House briefings .
( Original Source )
Democrat Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , is in a unique position to settle his party 's presidential nomination battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
And the solution he could offer his party would not involve winning another primary or caucus , negotiating redo votes in Florida and Michigan , convincing superdelegates to make or break commitments , or masterminding convention floor fights .
The solution that is within his power is simpler , yet more profound than any of the extraordinary political events America has witnessed this election year .
It requires only the rarest of things : an individual willing to set aside his own power and ambition for the good of his party and his country .
It is this : Mr. Reid could step aside as leader of the Senate and hand the post to Mrs. Clinton .
Only the proffer of this consolation prize would likely persuade Mrs. Clinton to drop her divisive , and now futile , quest for her party 's nomination .
Make no mistake – because of the increasingly bitter Clinton - Obama fight , the Democrats are poised to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .
Every political indicator points to a smashing Democratic win this November .
Their presidential candidates have outraised the Republican field by a huge margin ; 2008 turnout in Democrat primaries has almost doubled over the turnout in 2004 ; the Democrats ' congressional campaign committees are swamping their GOP counterparts in fundraising ; a record number of Republican incumbents are retiring from Congress , opening numerous opportunities for Democratic gains ; President Bush 's unpopularity continues at record highs ; the war in Iraq remains unpopular ; and the economy is in , or near , recession .
Yet , because Mrs. Clinton continues to try to win what has become unwinnable , John McCain now holds comfortable leads over both Democrats for the first time in this race .
In her selfishness and grandiose sense of entitlement for the presidency , Mrs. Clinton 's continued pursuit of the nomination threatens to tear asunder what could otherwise be a dream Democratic year .

Before the Financial Services Committee , Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy , Trade , and Technology , Hearing on HR 5512 , March 11 , 2008
Mr. Chairman ,
I oppose HR 5512 because it is unconstitutional to delegate the determination of the metal content of our coinage to the Secretary of the Treasury .
Under Article I Section 8 of the Constitution , the Congress is given the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof .
It is a shame that Congress has already unconstitutionally delegated its coinage authority to the Treasury Department , but that is no reason to further delegate our power and essentially abdicate Congressional oversight as the passing of HR 5512 would do .
Oversight by members of Congress , who have an incentive to listen to their constituents , ensures openness and transparency .
This bill would eliminate that process and delegate it to unelected bureaucrats .
The Secretary of the Treasury would be given sole discretion to alter the metal content of coins , or even to create non-metal coins .
Given the history of Congressional delegation and subsequent lax oversight on issues as important as the conflict in Iraq , it would be naïve to believe that Congress would exercise any more oversight over an issue as unimportant to most members as the composition of coins .
While I sympathize with the aim of Section 4 of this bill to save taxpayer dollars by minting steel pennies , it is disappointing that our currency has been so greatly devalued as to make this step necessary .
At the time of the penny ’s introduction , it actually had some purchasing power .
Based on the price of gold , what one penny would have purchased in 1909 requires 47 cents today .
It is no wonder then that few people nowadays would stoop to pick up any coin smaller than a quarter .
Congress ’ unconstitutional delegation of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve and its reluctance to exercise oversight in that arena have led to a massive devaluation of the dollar .
If we fail to end this devaluation , we will undoubtedly hold future hearings as the metal value of our coins continues to outstrip the face value .
HR 5512 is a sad commentary on how far we have fallen , not just since the days of the Founders , but only in the last 75 to 100 years .
We could not maintain the gold standard nor the silver standard .
We could not maintain the copper standard , and now we cannot even maintain the zinc standard .
Paper money inevitably breeds inflation and destroys the value of the currency .
That is the reason that this proposal is before us today .

Migrants will help to swell population of England by two London - sized cities within 50 years
The population of England is to increase by the equivalent of two new cities of the size of London within half a century , researchers said last night .
The independent House of Commons Library is predicting that by 2056 there will be an extra 17 million people - taking the total to 67.9 million .
More births , people living longer and , more significantly , continued mass immigration will fuel the unprecedented growth in numbers .
Capital : By 2056 , England will need two cities the size of London to cope with new migrants
The research came as an influential group of MPs demanded urgent improvements in the Government 's methods of counting the population , claiming that it is ' not fit for purpose ' .
A research paper produced by the Commons library says : ' The estimated population of London in 2006 was 7.5 million .
Making a straightforward calculation , the population in England will increase , between 2006 and 2056 , by 2.3 times the current population of London . '
Based on current assumptions , it would mean the number of households in England increasing by 11.2 million .
It is also likely to place enormous strain on public services , such as schools and hospitals .
Conservative MP James Clappison , who asked the library to complete the research , said : ' For somebody starting work today , they will experience population growth over their lifetime of two cities the size of London .
' What sort of quality of life are they going to have if there are 17 million more people in England alone ? '
Separate research by Karen Dunnell , the National Statistician , revealed the huge role immigration plays in UK - wide population growth , as compared with birth and death rates .
Net migration - the amount immigration adds to the population after subtracting emigration - is running at 190,000 a year .
But Mrs Dunnell 's research shows that , until Labour came to power , ' natural change ' - people living longer or having more children - was the main reason for Britain becoming more crowded .
Between 1992 and 1996 , when the Tories were in power , natural change added 582,604 to the population of the UK .
Net migration and other factors , such as the number of Forces personnel living in the UK , added only 143,112 .
But , between 1997 and 2001 , a huge change took place as the new Labour government adopted an ' open door ' immigration policy .
Natural change added 416,471 to the population , and migrants and the other limited factors 532,652 .
From 2002 to 2006 , it was even more dramatic , with natural change adding 528,429 , and net migration 932,999 .
MPs on the Treasury select committee say today that the International Passenger Survey - which plays a central role in estimating international migration - is ' not fit for purpose ' .
It surveys only a small number of travellers and , in the past , some ports were not even covered .
MPs also say short - term migrants are being excluded from official figures , leaving local councils short of funding .
Committee chairman Michael Fallon said : ' Reliable population estimates are fundamental for allocation of funding for public services .
' Our democracy is dependent on accurate , independent statistics .
It is essential that when we consider important migrants granted UK citizenship since Labour came to power national issues we can rely on the data that is provided .
' It is now impossible to estimate accurately the UK population today .
' Unreliable statistics make planning impossible .
We call on the Government to improve the population count as a matter of urgency . '
Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green said : ' This is a damning report .
' After 11 years in power , the Government has still failed completely to set up systems which allow them to measure immigration numbers .
' No wonder they can't control immigration when they do n't know how many people are in this country . '
Earlier this week , the Daily Mail revealed that the population of England and Wales has shot up by more than a million in only three years in a boom on a scale not seen for a century .
Foreign workers were at the heart of the increase , according to the Government figures , which showed that numbers had reached 54,348,000 .
The Home Office said it was introducing electronic border controls , a points - based visa system and would take into account any pressures on public services reported by its new Migration Impacts Forum when deciding the numbers allowed in .
A spokesman said : ' Projections like these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake - up to the immigration system for a generation .
' Centre - stage is our new Australian points system which means only those we need can come to work or study . '

Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed
A New York Judge ruled to continue an injunction against Premise Media , which effectively prevents Premise , the producers of Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , from further distribution .
Expelled is a film about intelligent design and creationism starring Ben Stein , and is currently playing at 200 U.S. theaters .
Since its April 18 debut it has received criticism from the scientific community , which considers both pseudoscience , and film critics .
The case Lennon v Premise Media was filed by Yoko Ono , Julian Lennon , Sean Lennon , and EMI Blackwood Music , Inc. against Premise Media , C&S Production , and Rocky Mountain Pictures in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 23 , 2008 alleging copyright infringement concerning John Lennon 's song " Imagine " .
Premise is being represented by Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project .
EMI filed its own separate lawsuit against Premise in a New York state court alleging that Premise 's usage of the song is harming EMI ’s ability to license “ Imagine , ” which has only been licensed in one film ( The Killing Fields ) .
In court , Judge Richard Lowe , according to the Wall Street Journal , " seemed skeptical " about Falzone 's arguments .
Lowe asked Falzone why the film 's producers did not read the lyrics to the song or flash the lyrics on the screen .
Lawyers also pointed out that Premise Media licensed all other music in the film except for Lennon 's song .
At the end of the hearing Lowe " decided to stay the original TRO pending his ruling , which means that Expelled , currently playing in theaters around the country , cannot be reproduced or otherwise distributed . "
The judge promised a quick decision since the film will debut in Canada on June 6 and DVD rights must be finalized by the end of May for October distribution .

It is normal for luxury Cairo hotels to serve alcoholic drinks A decision by the Saudi owner of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Cairo to ban the sale of alcohol and destroy millions of dollars worth of beverages has sparked a debate in Egypt .
The international company which runs the hotel has urged Sheikh Abdulaziz al - Brahim - a relative of the Saudi king - to revoke his decision , fearing it could drive away Western tourists and may even lead to the hotel losing its five - star rating .
The Grand Hyatt occupies one of the most expensive sites overlooking the River Nile .
It is only minutes from the diplomatic quarter , where the British and American embassies are located .
Like all five - star hotels in Egypt , alcohol used to be available there - but not any more .
It is unclear what prompted the owner Sheik Al Brahim to take this controversial measure .
Staff at the hotel are reluctant to talk about the whole affair .
But a barman told me that they now only serve soft drinks and that he saw with his own eyes how expensive whiskey , liqueurs and fine wines were emptied down the drains of the hotel .
He said it took his colleagues a whole day to go through the hotel 's entire stock of alcoholic drinks .
Does he feel sorry for that , I asked ?
He chuckled .
Financial muscle
The move has sparked fears that other hotels may follow suit , which could hit the tourism industry , one of the pillars of the Egyptian economy .
Egyptian columnist Suleiman Gouda wrote that if the owner wanted to invest in the international tourism industry , then he had to play by the well - known rules of the business .
Alternatively , he wrote , quoting an unnamed Arab head of state , he should sell his hotels to those who are prepared to do so .
Supporters of the decision say Egypt is a Muslim country and foreign visitors should respect local custom .
But critics say just as Muslims expect to be served Halal food on international flights , they should be prepared to respect the desires of their Western guests .
And Egyptian liberals see the incident as a clear example of how Saudi Arabia uses its financial muscle to spread its own puritanical brand of Islam to other countries .
Egyptian author Ezzat Al Qamhawy wrote that the incident was only an example of what Saudi investment in Egypt can do .
" It can strangulate the Egyptian tourism industry ... by imposing Islam on tourists who are not Muslims , and compulsory drunkenness on the Muslim fish of the River Nile , " he wrote , referring to reports that the stock was emptied in the river when the owner ordered staff to get rid of it .
The question of alcohol is a sensitive one in this predominantly conservative Muslim society .
The vast majority of Egyptians do not drink , and their government cannot be seen to pressure the owner of the Grand Hyatt for fear of giving the Islamist opposition ammunition to attack it for being un -Islamic .
Yet at the same time it is wary of anything that can hurt tourism , which brings hundreds of millions of dollars every year .

Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor is furthering his goal of taking newspaper services online with Tribute.com , a website for the bereaved .
Photo courtesy georgiap / Flickr Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor helped you find a job , and helped ease you into middle age .
Now he wants to help you build the last web page you 'll ever need .
Tributes.com is scheduled for a soft launch in June .
It aims to provide a central location to house online memorials for those who have passed on .
It 's starting with $ 4.3 million in funding , with The Wall Street Journal as a lead investor .
Taylor , who retired from Monster.com in 2005 , says Monster was intended to take the jobs section of newspaper 's classified ads online .
So online obituaries seemed like an inevitable next step .
" I 'm extremely bullish about this business – it's not a question of if it will explode , but when , " says Taylor , who spun the business off his baby boomer social networking site Eons.com .
" I 've watched and built a career on migrating the whole newspaper to the web , and the obituary section is the laggard category . "
The site comes as the funeral industry is learning to target the public 's desire to grieve online for the dearly departed .
On social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook , online memorials are springing up organically to give friends , family members and strangers a place to mourn , and even small , family - owned funeral homes have begin offering web - based memorials for their customers .
The site sets itself apart from memorial sites like SweetMemoriesSite.com , ChristianMemorials.com and PreciousMemoriesAndMore.com in two ways .
First , people can find information on those who 've died with a name search from a database that includes the entire Social Security Death Index since 1936 .
And second , the site plans to market more to the funeral industry than other sites , where individuals pay for tributes .
The venture competes squarely with the existing site Legacy.com , which uses Social Security death records and also picks up obituaries from 650 newspapers .
11 Tributes.com will attempt to partner with funeral homes in an effort to cut newspapers out of the loop .
Tributes will allow people to verify deaths , get memorial service information , and leave tributes and messages .
" We are building a channel to the funeral industry to build our site with them , so we can be an aggregator for all the obituaries , " said John Heald , a funeral director who is working with Tributes.com .
Tributes plans to sell its service to funeral homes that will then package an online tribute with the other services offered to the bereaved .
Obits will stay up indefinitely , while condolences may come down after five to 10 years .
" We need to learn from MySpace .
For example , when a teenager dies there are thousands of condolences , " Heald says .
" It 's a new , important , effective way of grieving . "
The death - care industry is ready to embrace an idea like Tributes.com , says Robin Heppell , who coaches funeral directors on how to use the web to promote their business and to make their services more valuable .
" People who spend the winter in Florida log on to faraway websites during the winter to check to see who died back home , " the Vancouver - based funeral director and consultant says .
" Most funeral homes have websites now , and those that do n't are looking at setting up . "
Mortuaries with well - established websites , like Pellerin Funeral Home in Louisiana and Haskett Funeral Homes in Canada , say the amount of traffic they get , and the way the websites are used , surprise even them .
Both family - owned businesses have learned to upload video tributes to their sites , and keep a condolence page open to collect messages long after the funerals .
" I have friends who check the website every day to see who 's died , and our parish sheriff leaves a tribute for every one , " says Debbie Gauthier , who manages the Pellerin website .
" We know it 's one of the best things we can do for the family – the tributes and condolences are comforting to people long after the funeral has ended . "
There 's definitely a hunger for online memorials .
The Pellerin website includes a longstanding video tribute to Pope John Paul , who died in April 2005 , that still gathers many hits a day .
" You can watch that one forever , we wo n't be taking it down , " Gauthier says .
And Heppell points to the memorial page on Facebook for Stefanie Rengel , a 14 - year - old Toronto girl murdered in January .
" Ten thousand people offered condolences , memories and comfort , " Heppell says .
The industry is already learning that a decedent 's self - created MySpace or Facebook profile can be jarring for the families of the recently deceased .
Heppell advised funeral homes to " have one of the deceased friends look at their page first , because there can be suggestive photos and explicit language that the families are n't ready to deal with . "
Taylor , who left Monster.com in 2005 to launch Eons.com , a website popular with aging baby boomers , started his newest venture after noticing that there was no central repository for online memorials where one could grieve and remember – and verify the loss of – a loved one .
He spun Tributes off Eons as a separate entity , and sought investors to give Tributes five to 10 years to take off .
" Jeff always had his eye on Monster 's obits , and he noticed the obits were n't getting any traction for getting online , even when every other section of a traditional newspaper had made the transition , " Haney says .
" When he evolved a strategy for Eons as a lifestyle brand for boomers , he saw that the grieving groups are very popular at Eons . "
By harvesting the U.S. Death Index , Tributes will automatically have a listing for everyone who dies , or who has died since 1936 .
The website also plans to offer round - the - clock grief support groups .
" Traditional support groups that meet once a week are n't as valuable to members as the 24/7 online groups , " Haney says .

Wired Science : Anti-Aging Drugs Could Change the Nature of Death
A Zimbabwean man has been jailed for two years after he sold urine to residents in a mining town claiming it was cooking oil , state media reported .
Piccard Mudzingwa , 28 , approached one of the victims at a bus terminus in the southern mining town of Zvishavane selling bottles containing a liquid he said was cooking oil , The Herald newspaper reported .
The victim discovered she had been duped when she was preparing dinner the following day and reported Mudzingwa to the police .
Last month , we posted a scientific attempt to create the most annoying song ever , but " Most Unwanted Music " was only half of the equation .
Using the same survey data , Vitaly Komar , Alex Melamid and David Soldier also put together " Most Wanted Music . "
Ironically , it 's a way rougher listen than the unwanted music .
This " most wanted " version combines the elements the 500 people surveyed said they wanted most – love , soprano sax , humble ambition , tenor sax , a marriage proposal , cheesy electronic drum fills , working the night shift , string swells , power chords , and saccharine male / female harmonies – into an easy listening - style adult contemporary sound that could peel the paint off of the Space Shuttle .

Maybe pop music is n't one of crowd - sourcing 's stronger suits .
Conservatives have long trumped progressives at using the ballot initiative process to circumvent governors , state legislatures , and the courts .
By sending paid organizers out to gather signatures from registered voters , they ’ve successfully placed their policy priorities straight onto November ballots , where if they are passed , state legislatures often can’t overturn or amend them without super - majorities — or without going back to the ballot .
In recent years , affirmative action and immigrants ’ rights have been targeted by the Right for the ballot initiative treatment .
Most infamously , California businessman Ward Connerly successfully overturned Michigan ’s affirmative action policies by giving his quest the misleading name " The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative . "
This year , conservatives are applying similarly confusing rhetoric to their nationwide drive to restrict reproductive freedom at the ballot box .
Here ’s a primer of what to expect in various states this November .
Directly Challenging Roe
The most ideologically strident of the new anti-choice initiatives are the so - called " Human Life Amendments . "
If approved at the ballot , these initiatives would amend state constitutions to declare that life begins the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg — and that the resulting mass of cells has the exact same legal rights as a human being living outside of the womb .
The campaign to put " Human Life Amendment " initiatives on state ballots is led by the Thomas More Law Center , an Ann Arbor , Mich . - based organization that describes itself as " the sword and shield for people of faith . "
The group ’s goal is to directly challenge Roe v.
Wade by provoking pro-choice lawsuits , ultimately culminating in a Supreme Court case that would take advantage of the Court ’s new , more conservative make - up .
In practice , the Human Life Amendment would not create new laws or void existing ones , but would provide state legislatures and governors with constitutional backing for laws outlawing abortions and even some forms of hormonal contraception ( those that prevent implantation of a fertilized egg , not fertilization itself ) .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

The good news is that of the four states targeted by Thomas More , two of them — Georgia and Oregon — have n’t allowed the signature - gathering process to move forward .
That leaves Colorado and Montana as battle - grounds .
In Colorado last week , a coalition of religiously - motivated anti-choicers with the misleading name Colorado for Equal Rights submitted 131,000 signatures in support of placing the Human Life Amendment on the ballot .
That ’s more signatures than are legally necessary .
In Montana , where the initiative is called the " Personhood Amendment , " the signature gathering process is still underway .
There , as in other states considering the proposal , its radical and even illegal nature has split the anti-choice community down the middle .
That National Right to Life Committee , a leader in its field , has not endorsed the strategy .
And Catholic groups , including the Montana Catholic Conference , have outright rejected it .
In a statement , Montana ’s bishops explained their rationale as such : " Legal experts agree that the current Supreme Court would , at best , decline to hear the case , and at worst , use the opportunity to reaffirm the right to abortion yet another time .
The more times the Supreme Court ’s abortion decisions are affirmed , the more difficult it becomes to obtain further hearings from the Court and to expect decisions to end abortion . "
( For a June 25 , 2008 , update on the Montana ballot initiative , click here . )
Targeting Health Care Providers , Infantalizing Women
In this area , there has already been a major victory for reproductive rights advocates .
Through a lawsuit , Planned Parenthood stopped a proposed ballot initiative in Missouri that would have made performing an abortion an act of criminal negligence unless a woman was evaluated beforehand for so - called " abortion risk factors . "
Those factors would have included common psychological and emotional conditions such as depression and anxiety , which very often accompany any unexpected pregnancy — regardless of a woman ’s decision on whether or not to seek an abortion .
The measure had been pushed by the Eliot Institute , a group that traffics in the scientifically false notion that abortions cause breast cancer and other chronic diseases .
In fact , abortion is one of the safest surgeries offered , and is considerably less risky for a woman ’s health than carrying a pregnancy to term .
Straight - Forward Abortion Bans
In 2006 South Dakota voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have banned all abortions , including in cases of rape , incest , and risk to the mother ’s health or life .
This year , anti-choicers are trying again with a ban that includes those exceptions .
They have already gathered enough signatures to place their initiative on the ballot .
In California , anti-choicers are collecting signatures for a ballot initiative that would " declare God the creator of life " and change the law so that " abortion after 24 weeks is murder unless necessary to save the mother ’s life . "
It ’s not clear who the initiative ’s backers believe should be charged with murder : women , doctors , or both ?
Parental Notification
Also in California , anti-choicers are gathering signatures to place an initiative on the ballot that would require parental notification for a minor to obtain an abortion .
Voters have rejected such measures twice in the past .
Fox host : Olbermann crossed line when he picked on my kid David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 20 , 2008

Print This Email This Steve Doocy of Fox News is really " steamed " at MSNBC's Keith Olbermann , and he wants the world to know that Olbermann went " over the line " when he picked Doocy 's 20 year old son Peter as his " Worst Person in the World . "
On May 5 , Steve Doocy invited Peter onto Fox & Friends to provide " a youth view of the Democratic presidential campaign . "
As reported by RAW STORY , Peter Doocy 's segment consisted primarily of asking his fellow students negative leading questions about Barack Obama and Reverend Wright .
That night , Keith Olbermann named Peter Doocy as one of his Worst Persons in the World .
" Wow ! " commented Olbermann .
" Wonder which emotion impacts dad more at this moment , pride that at 20 years old , the boy is already a completely replaceable cog in the vast Rupert Murdoch media manipulation machine , or buyers remorse when he gets the bill from college and realizes the kids mind has already been nailed shut ? "
Steve Doocy has now struck back against Olbermann for criticizing his son , finding his opportunity in the course of a segment about the White House sending NBC News a letter blasting them for broadcasting an edited version of a recent interview with George Bush .
According to White House counselor Ed Gillespie , the cut - down version made Bush appear to be agreeing with the interviewer that he believes merely talking to Iran constitutes appeasement , a claim which NBC denies .
Gillespie ended his letter by warning , " I 'm sure you do n't want people to conclude that there is really no distinction between the ' news ' as reported on NBC and the ' opinion ' as reported on MSNBC , despite the increasing blurring of those lines .
I welcome your response to this letter , and hope it is one that reassures your broadcast network 's viewers that blatantly partisan talk show hosts like Christopher Matthews and Keith Olbermann at MSNBC do n't hold editorial sway over the NBC network news division . "
" NBC , with MSNBC , has made a business decision to lean left -- way left , " began Doocy , but after a few gratuitous slams at Air America , he quickly went on to say , " I have a problem with Keith Olbermann . "
" A couple of weeks ago , on this program , my son Peter , we asked him to get the opinions of some of the kids at Villanova , " Doocy explained plaintively .
" Keith Olbermann made my son ... the World 's Worst Person .
How can you make a kid the World 's Worst Person .
...
He 's just a kid in college , and he is asleep right now as I talk about him .
...
He has no forum .
Where does he go to get his reputation back ? "
" Next time you see Keith Olbermann on TV , just remember , that is a guy who picks on people 's children , " Doocy concluded , becoming visibly angrier as he spoke .
" I am steamed , " he acknowledged .
" How can you pick on a kid ? ...
That is over the line , buddy . "

Transcript of Keith Olbermann 's May 5th worst person comment follows : " The bronze to Peter Ducey , 201 - year - old son of the often hilariously uninformed Steve Ducey of Fixed Noise .
Appearing on his dads show for a youth view of the Democratic presidential campaign , asking questions of students at Villanova University , questions like , Senator Obamas , quote , slogan is change we can believe in .
This is a guy who could not change churches when his preacher was saying , the United States deserved 9/11 and the U.S. created AIDS .
So what makes you think that hes going to bring about this kind of change ? "
" Wow !
Wonder which emotion impacts dad more at this moment , pride that at 20 years old , the boy is already a completely replaceable cog in the vast Rupert Murdoch media manipulation machine , or buyers remorse when he gets the bill from college and realizes the kids mind has already been nailed shut ?

Transcript ( via closed captions ) of Fox & Friends May 20th attack on Keith Olbermann follows : gretchen : i have to wonder if the white house has ever sent a letter like this .
they sent a scathing letter to nbc news taking them to task about how they misrepresented the comments that president bush said when he spoke in israel .
steve : the interview with richard engel that ran on " the today show , " ed gillespie said it was intended to give the impression that the president agreed with richard engel 's remark when explicitly he challenged it .
brian : essentially the president was talking about terror and saying you can't be doing that and did he agree that that was directed at barack obama , and here 's what he said .
however , they just put it on their web site , msnbc web site , they did n't put it back on nbc news , and he did go on to express a fear that nbc news is going to merge with the same philosophy of msnbc and keith olbermann and become a left wing organization on the network and on cable .
gretchen : i found it so interesting that the voice of the president through this letter would also say that i noticed that around september of 2007 your network quietly stopped referring to conditions in iraq as a civil war .
remember , nbc decided on its own that iraq was in a civil war , and they said from this point forward we 're going to say civil war .
now , ed gillespie says we noticed at the white house that we stopped referring to it as a civil war .
are you going to tell the american public it is no longer a civil war ?
steve : we 've talked a little bit about this .
nbc along with msnbc has made a business decision to lean left .
way left .
david gregory has a program on in the evenings .
i've never seen it .
but it 's also simulcast on air america .
brian : and that 's that left wing network that failed miserably .
steve : and tonight if you watch their campaign coverage , i believe it 's going to be keith olbermann and chris matthews , the guy who feels the thrill up his leg regarding barack obama , but keith olbermann is the face of nbc news at msnbc .
i have a problem with keith olbermann , and here it is .
a couple of weeks ago on this program my son , peter -- we asked him to get the opinions of some of the kids al villanova before a big primary , how the kids felt .
at the conclusion of it keith olbermann made my son because of questions he asked , not because of anything he said , keith olbermann made my son the world 's worst person .
how can you make a kid the world 's worst person ?
peter does n't have a forum .
he 's just a kid in college , and he is asleep right now as i talk about him .
but here 's the thing .
where does a kid like him go ?
he has no forum .
where does he go to get his reputation back .
next time you see keith olbermann on tv , just remember that 's a guy who picks on people 's children .
he completely sandbagged my son , took his comment out of context , and mangled them around the way he does every night , and i am mad at keith olbermann .
gretchen : he 's steamed , and i'm on doocy 's side today .
steve : how can you pick on a kid ?
gretchen : we 're all grown adults .
steve : we 've all been made the world 's worst person .
you do n't pick on a kid , keith olbermann .
that is over the line .
buddy .
brian : let 's go to a guy that has a lot of kids throughout on the line , mitt romney .
governor romney , welcome back to " fox & friends . " steve : do n't get on my bad side , governor .
i'm really ticked off today .
Microsoft 's security team is advising users to stop using Apple 's Safari browser pending investigation into a quirk that allows miscreants to litter their desktop with hundreds of executable files .
Windows users who visit a booby - trapped site with Safari could be forced to download and execute malicious files with no prompting , Microsoft says .
The " blended threat " is a result of the default download location in Safari and the way the Windows desktop handles executable files .
This Microsoft advisory suggests users " restrict use of Safari as a web browser until an appropriate update is available from Microsoft and / or Apple . "
The recommendation comes a week after researcher Nitesh Dhanjani reported that Apple 's browser does n't seek user permission before downloading certain types of files .
Even when encountering malicious iframes - a common occurrence these days even on the most trustworthy of sites - Safari obediently does what it 's told to do , including downloading a file hundreds of times .
Apple 's security pros , upon learning of the so - called carpet bombing vulnerability , said they did n't see it as a significant threat .
A researcher in Cupertino wrote to Dhanjani that it may get fixed at some point down the road as " a further measure to raise the bar against unwanted downloads , " but said it could take a quite a while , if ever , for that to happen .
Apple 's unfortunate refusal probably explains why Microsoft 's security arm has resorted to the unusual recommendation .
We can't remember the last time Redmond counseled users to avoid installing a mainstream product for security reasons .
Apple representatives did n't respond to a request to comment for this story .
And before any Mac users decide this is an issue they can safely ignore , remember this :
While Microsoft 's recommendation obviously is limited to Windows users , Dhanjani says the carpet bombing scenario can play out on OS X , too . ®

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Thousands of children in southwest China have been sold into slavery like “ cabbages ” , to work as labourers in more prosperous areas such as the booming southern province of Guangdong , a newspaper said on Tuesday .

China announced a nationwide crackdown on slavery and child labor last year after reports that hundreds of poor farmers , children and mentally disabled were forced to work in kilns and mines in Shanxi province and neighboring Henan .
“ The bustling child labor market ( in Sichuan province ) was set up by the local chief foreman and his gang of 18 minor foremen , who each manage 50 to 100 child labourers , ” the Southern Metropolis Newspaper said .
“ The children generally fall between the ages of 13 and 15 , but many look under 10 , ” it added .
The newspaper said 76 children from the same county , Liangshan , had been missing since the Chinese Lunar Year festival in February , 42 of whom had already left the region to work .
“ The youngest kids found in the child labor market were only seven and nine years old , ” it said .
According to a contract exposed by an undercover reporter , a child laborer is paid 3.5 yuan ( $ 0.50 ) an hour and must work at least 300 hours a month .
“ These kids are robust and can do the toughest work , ” a foreman was quoted as saying , as he pulled a scrawny girl to stand beside him , the paper said .
Xinhua news agency said the county government had sent officials to rescue the children , but some were unwilling to leave , having been sold into slavery by their parents or volunteering to work themselves .

WASHINGTON – First she “ misspoke , ” now she misheard .
Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday seemed to deny that she told New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson that Barack Obama could not win the presidency .
But her campaign later said she misheard a reporter ’s question .
McCain in the 1996 Dole - Drums
Barack Runs Up $ core
Asked at a press conference whether she made the comment to Richardson , Clinton said , “ That ’s a no . ”
She added , “ We have been going back and forth in this campaign of who said what to whom and let me say this , that I do n’t talk about private conversations but I have consistently made the case that I can win . ”
Campaign spokeswoman
Mo Elleithee later said Clinton thought she was being asked whether she ’d disclose what she actually said to Richardson , who has endorsed Obama .
“ Senator Clinton was simply reiterating what she had just said – she does n’t talk about private conversations , ” Elleithee said .
Clinton has come under fire in recent weeks about inconsistent statements .
She admitted late last month , that she “ misspoke ” when she claimed she had dodged bullets while arriving in Bosnia as first lady .
She poked fun at the controversy last night in an appearance on “ The Tonight Show ” telling host Jay Leno , “ I was so worried I was n’t going to make it .
I was pinned down by sniper fire . ”
The latest misstep came as supporters of Obama called her claims that he can’t win the desperate act of a losing candidate .
“ I ’m sure she is frustrated , ” said Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , who supports Obama .
“ Up until late last year , the common wisdom around here was that Hillary Clinton had it .
In fact , there are many who even thought that Barack Obama was probably being foolish to try . ”
Now that Clinton is 135 delegates behind Obama in the race for the Democratic nomination , she and her loyalists have begun arguing that Obama cannot win .
“ Sen . Clinton is absolutely qualified to be president , and I am sure it is difficult for her to see herself behind , ” said Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , a superdelegate who has endorsed Obama .
Federico PeÑa , who served in two Cabinet posts for Bill Clinton , was one of the first to endorse Obama , “ because I absolutely believed that he could win . ”
“ She must believe that Barack ca n’t win and she can , or she would n’t still be running – but the evidence is absolutely to the contrary , ” PeÑa said .
Clinton , who has been courting superdelegates to catch Obama , hinted yesterday that she would go after pledged delegates .
Pledged delegates are a “ misnomer , ” she said .
“ The whole point is for delegates , however they are chosen , to really ask themselves who would be the best president . ”
Meanwhile , two of Clinton ’s top supporters hinted yesterday that they might switch their support to Obama if he maintains a lead in delegates and popular vote .
“ I ’m going to look at delegate selection , who has the most .
I ’m going to look at the popular vote , who has the most votes , ” said New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine , a superdelegate who currently backs Clinton .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) echoed Corzine .

James Bryce was a nineteenth - century English writer who loved America and wrote passionately about politics .
The following excerpt , from his book " The American Commonwealth , " is still widely cited by American journalists .
Europeans often ask , and Americans do not always explain how it happens that this great office , the greatest in the world , unless we except the Papacy , to which any one can rise by his own merits , is not more frequently filled by great and striking men .
In America , which is beyond all other countries the country of a " career open to talents , " a country , moreover , in which political life is unusually keen and political ambition widely diffused , it might be expected that the highest place would always be won by a man of brilliant gifts .
But from the time when the heroes of the Revolution died out with Jefferson and Adams and Madison , no person except General Grant , had , down to the end of last century , reached the chair whose name would have been remembered had he not been president , and no president except Abraham Lincoln had displayed striking qualities in the chair .
Who knows or cares to know anything about the personality of James K. Polk or Franklin Pierce ?
The only thing remarkable about them is that being so commonplace they should have climbed so high .
Several reasons may be suggested for the fact , which Americans are themselves the first to admit .
One is that the proportion of first - rate ability drawn into politics is smaller in America than in most European countries ....
Another is that the methods and habits of Congress , and indeed of political life generally , give fewer opportunities for personal distinction , fewer modes in which a man may commend himself to his countrymen by eminent capacity in thought , in speech , or in administration , than is the case in the free countries of Europe .
SAFE MEN ARE PREFERRED
A third reason is that eminent men make more enemies , and give those enemies more assailable points , than obscure men do .
They are therefore in so far less desirable candidates .
It is true that the eminent man has also made more friends , that his name is more widely known , and may be greeted with louder cheers .
Other things being equal , the famous man is preferable .
But other things never are equal .
The famous man has probably attacked some leaders in his own party , has supplanted others , has expressed his dislike to the crotchet of some active section , has perhaps committed errors which are capable of being magnified into offences .
No man stands long before the public and bears a part in great affairs without giving openings to censorious criticism .
Fiercer far than the light which beats upon a throne is the light which beats upon a presidential candidate , searching out all the recesses of his past life .
Hence , when the choice lies between a brilliant man and a safe man , the safe man is preferred .
Party feeling , strong enough to carry in on its back a man without conspicuous positive merits , is not always strong enough to procure forgiveness for a man with positive faults .
A European finds that this phenomenon needs in its turn to be explained , for in the free countries of Europe brilliancy , be it eloquence in speech , or some striking achievement in war or administration , or the power through whatever means of somehow impressing the popular imagination , is what makes a leader triumphant .
Why should it be otherwise in America ?
Because in America party loyalty and party organization have been hitherto so perfect that any one put forward by the party will get the full party vote if his character is good and his " record , " as they call it , unstained .
The safest candidate may not draw in quite so many votes from the moderate men of the other side as the brilliant one would , but he will not lose nearly so many from his own ranks .
Even those who admit his mediocrity will vote straight when the moment for voting comes .
Besides , the ordinary American voter does not object to mediocrity .
He has a lower conception of the qualities requisite to make a statesman than those who direct public opinion in Europe have .
He likes his candidate to be sensible , vigorous , and , above all , what he calls " magnetic , " and does not value , because he sees no need for , originality or profundity , a fine culture or a wide knowledge .
Candidates are selected to be run for nomination by knots of persons who , however expert as party tacticians , are usually commonplace men ; and the choice between those selected for nomination is made by a very large body , an assembly of nearly a thousand delegates from the local party organizations over the country , who are certainly no better than ordinary citizens .
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
It must also be remembered that the merits of a president are one thing and those of a candidate another thing .
An eminent American is reported to have said to friends who wished to put him forward , " Gentlemen , let there be no mistake .
I should make a good president , but a very bad candidate . "
Now to a party it is more important that its nominee should be a good candidate than that he should turn out a good president .
A nearer danger is a greater danger .
As Saladin says in The Talisman , " A wild cat in a chamber is more dangerous than a lion in a distant desert . "
It will be a misfortune to the party , as well as to the country , if the candidate elected should prove a bad president .
But it is a greater misfortune to the party that it should be beaten in the impending election , for the evil of losing national patronage will have come four years sooner .
" B " ( so reason the leaders ) " who is one of our possible candidates , may be an abler man than A , who is the other .
But we have a better chance of winning with A than with B , while X , the candidate of our opponents , in anyhow no better than A .
We must therefore run A . "
This reasoning is all the more forcible because the previous career of the possible candidates has generally made it easier to say who will succeed as a candidate than who will succeed as a president ; and because the wire - pullers with whom the choice rests are better judges of the former question than of the latter .
After all , too , a president need not be a man of brilliant intellectual gifts .
His main duties are to be prompt and firm in securing the due execution of the laws and maintaining the public peace , careful and upright in the choice of the executive officials of the country .
Eloquence , whose value is apt to be overrated in all free countries , imagination , profundity of thought or extent of knowledge , are all in so far a gain to him that they make him " a bigger man " and help him to gain over the nation an influence which , if he be a true patriot , he may use for its good .
But they are not necessary for the due discharge in ordinary times of the duties of his post .
Four - fifths of his work is the same in kind as that which devolves on the chairman of a commercial company or the manager of a railway , the work of choosing good subordinates , seeing that they attend to their business , and taking a sound practical view of such administrative questions as require his decision .
Firmness , common sense , and most of all , honesty , an honesty above all suspicion of personal interest , are the qualities which the country chiefly needs in its first magistrate .

President Bush says Africa has been a foreign policy priority
Bush interview
Speaking on a visit to Tanzania , Mr Bush said the people of Zimbabwe deserved a government that recognised their " basic human rights " .
Earlier , Mr Bush signed a $ 698 m deal with Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete to reduce poverty .
Mr Bush is in the east African nation on the second leg of a six - day five - nation tour of the continent .
The deal will help improve roads , power and water supplies and comes as part of the Millennium Challenge compact , which makes grants to countries which stick to democratic principles and sound economic policies .
African issues
President Bush said free and fair elections in Zimbabwe were in the interest of its people .
" It happens to be in the interest of the world as well , " he said at a joint news conference with President Kikwete , who is the new head of the African Union .

Western countries say the last elections in 2002 , which saw President Robert Mugabe returned to office , were not free and fair .
Mr Mugabe is standing again for the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The political stalemate and violence following Kenya 's disputed election in December was also on the agenda during Mr Bush 's visit to Tanzania .
Mr Bush had thrown his weight behind a possible power - sharing deal between President Mwai Kibaki and his chief opponent , Raila Odinga , as a way out of the political impasse .
He said his discussions with the Tanzanian leader had focused on " how best we can help the process .
Not what we should do to dictate the process . "
Kenya's Foreign Minister , Moses Wetangula , speaking on Sunday , warned other countries not to try to force a deal on Kenya .
" We encourage our friends to support us and not to make any mistake of putting a gun to anybody 's head and saying ' either or ' because that cannot work , " he told reporters .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due in Nairobi on Monday to help the peace effort led by ex-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .

Mr Bush urged the US Congress to renew his global programme to combat Aids .
He also wants it doubled from $ 15 bn to $ 30bn .
" We do n't want people guessing on the continent of Africa whether the generosity of the American people will continue , " he said in Dar Es Salaam .
Mr Bush also wants to allay concerns about a new military command he wants to base in Africa to work with African militaries to deal with trafficking or terror .
So far , Liberia is the only nation to have offered to host the US base .
There are already some 1,700 US troops in Djibouti .
Mr Bush has also called for urgent action over the " genocide " in Sudan 's region of Darfur , where at least 200,000 people have died and two million been displaced since 2003 .
In a BBC interview prior to his tour , the US president defended his decision not to send soldiers to Darfur , saying he had not wanted to deploy US troops into another Muslim country .
Manitowoc County reports 4th death related to COVID - 19
The county reported the fourth death related to the virus on Tuesday along with 36 new positive cases .
Here 's what to know .
The storm passed right through the heart of the city , wreaking havoc on landmarks large and small .
It blew the windows out of Ted Turner ’s restaurant , called Ted ’s Montana Grill , and the Tabernacle , a popular concert venue .
Skyscrapers were pocked with broken windows and billboards were twisted into skeletal scaffolds .
Debris and glass carpeted the usually busy streets , making them impassible .
Brenton Young , a dentist from Shelby , N.C. , had just put his drink order in at Thrive , a chic downtown restaurant , when street - level windows started exploding .
“ People were jumping up and screaming , ” Mr. Young said .
“ We did n’t know if a car had hit the building or what had happened .
People were hitting the floor .
People were running for the center .
It was a chaotic three seconds . ”
Cheryl Denton , also in town for the convention , said she was in her hotel when the storm hit .
“ It just came up all of a sudden , ” she said .
“ We looked out the window and stuff started swirling , and it was there and gone that quick . ”
Her friend Dwayne Hawkins added , “ It was on the news and it hit 15 minutes later . ”
At a 2 a .m. news conference Saturday , Kelvin J. Cochran , the fire and rescue chief , said it would take 24 to 36 hours to complete the search and rescue operation .

One of the 11 people who were taken to Grady Hospital had life - threatening injuries , a spokeswoman for the hospital said , but by Saturday morning the condition of that victim had been upgraded to stable .
The 10 others had been treated and released .
A few blocks away , where the Southeastern Conference men ’s basketball playoffs were under way , players from both teams froze , mouths gaping on the court , when part of the fabric roof was torn away by the force of the storm , allowing a sudden gush of wind to blow through the Georgia Dome .
Catwalks at the top of the dome swayed and bits of insulation rained down on players and fans during overtime of the Mississippi State - Alabama game , halting play and sending spectators scrambling for the exits .
Washington is numb during a presidential campaign .
The oxygen of power drains to the hustings .
Blossom droops , restaurants empty , pompous porticos slump as their tenants depart .
Even the issue of Iraq , whose subsidies fund more of Washington than they do Baghdad , has left town and gone local .
The one thing known by all three candidates for the presidency ( if not just two from today ) is that whoever wins must do something painful .
He or she must negotiate the terms of an eventual retreat from Iraq , not with the Iraqis but with the American people .
Even John McCain , who watched the retreat from Vietnam and swears he will " stay a hundred years in Iraq until peace , stability and democracy " are achieved , will eventually leave , if only under the lash of Congress .
Yet now is not the time to admit it .
A war that is unpopular with 60 - 70 % of Americans ( depending on the question ) is not politically sustainable , however stupefying the cost .
But the modalities of its ending are unpredictable and possibly humiliating .
Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may call for early withdrawal , at least of " combat troops " .
But the real paradox of Iraq is that McCain knows he must find a way of leaving , and Clinton and Obama know they must find a way of staying , if only for the time being .
For all of them , getting from here to there crosses uncharted territory and none wants to glimpse the map .
Though foreign policy is rarely salient in peacetime elections , Americans have been almost persuaded by their president , George Bush , that they are not at peace .
To visit America at present is to be reminded of the continuing trauma of post - 9/11 , of a nation that craves a cohering substitute psychosis for the lifting of the Soviet menace .
It is seen in ubiquitous threat alerts , hysterical airport security , the continued acceptance of Guantánamo Bay and even jibes about public figures not wearing the American flag in their buttonhole .
A country in so many ways a kaleidoscope of the world is in many ways so different .
Above all it is full of soldiers .
Americans still do not travel abroad , and rely on television news for their knowledge of foreign places , which they continue to regard with bizarre suspicion .
Hence a world view is lumped in with defence and security in a collective paranoia .
And a candidate 's stance on foreign policy is a proxy for his or her character .
To this the candidates must pander .
Hence Clinton emphasises her " role " in Kosovo and her " mis-remembered " landing in Bosnia under fire .
Obama stresses his links to three world continents and a seminal visit as a young man to Karachi .
McCain trumps them by having been tortured by the Vietnamese , a sanctification whose only drawback is that it recalls his age ( 71 ) .
All must appear trigger happy .
McCain may distance himself from the unilateralism of George Bush and remark that Americans must show " a decent respect for the opinions of mankind " ( in Bush 's America the remark was worth reporting ) .
But his team is penetrated by such neocons as Robert Kagan and John Bolton , on the basis that " if we can't beat him , we can persuade him " .
The only thing to be said with confidence about McCain is that his position on everything is uncertain .
Desperate not to be outflanked on defence , Clinton said yesterday that she would " totally obliterate " Iran if Iran bombed Israel .
Last week she offered an astonishing nuclear - shield guarantee for neighbours of a nuclear Tehran .
Obama duly chided her as " Annie Oakley with a gun " .
Yet he has tended to follow her positions with a ready me - tooism , as on Tibet .
He offered to bomb Pakistan terrorist hideouts on the basis that even if that country 's President Musharraf " wo n't act , we will " .
He wanted two more brigades sent to Afghanistan .
Everywhere is on display the conundrum described in James Sheehan 's The Monopoly of Violence , subtitled Why Europeans Hate Going to War .
A more realistic title would be Why Americans Love It .
Europeans , writes Sheehan , have tested war to destruction as a way of settling the world 's ills and reject it .
Electorates now demand " material wellbeing , social stability and economic growth " and have demoted military virtues and the military class to history 's dustbin .
In modern Europe , " colonial violence seems wasteful , anachronistic and illegitimate ... grandeur no longer an important goal " .
That is why few Europeans other than Britons will help America in escalating the Afghan conflict .
They just do not believe it will work .
To Americans it " must work " .
The mistakes made by America in Iraq and Afghanistan are seen from Washington as accidents in necessary wars , as they might have been in Britain in the 19th century .
Such wars present puzzles to be resolved , tests for weapons systems , trials of strength for Pentagon lobbies , budget barons and thinktanks .
And they seem very , very far away .
Enthusiasts for Obama , more plentiful beyond America 's shores than within them , regard him as the most plausible candidate to pilot America to a new and more internationalist haven than this .
He has spoken of an endgame to America 's hostile relations with the Muslim world and dismisses democratic nation - building in Iraq as " a bunch of happy talk " .
He says simply : " We can not bend the world to our will . "
This may be true , but it is increasingly dangerous for Obama .
His handling of foreign policy has been naive and reactive .
His weakness is that he seems unknown , not quite American , exotic , elitist , intelligent .
He can write his own books , but can he hack his own war ?
Hence Clinton 's notorious " red - phone - at - 3 am " advertisement - implying that a black man with a foreign name could not be trusted with the nation 's defence - was so lethal , especially her aside that " as far as I know " he is " not a Muslim " .
It is why , were Obama to emerge from this week 's still uncertain events as the Democratic candidate , the smart money in Washington is still on McCain to win a dirty election .
At a distance I continue to find Obama one of the most exciting and potentially able men to run for the American presidency in a generation .
His capacity to transform America 's self - image and world image is colossal .
But to do so he must confront America atavistic love affair with war , and that will be hard .

( Recasts first paragraph ; adds byline , details on rice bag size , stock movement )
NEW YORK , April 23 ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc's WMT.N Sam's Club warehouse division said on Wednesday it is limiting sales of several types of rice , the latest sign that fears of a rice shortage are rippling around the world .
Sam ’s Club , the No. 2 U.S. warehouse club operator , said it is limiting sales of Jasmine , Basmati and long grain white rice “ due to recent supply and demand trends . ”
U.S. rice futures hitting an all - time high Wednesday on worries about supply shortages .
On Tuesday , Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O , the largest U.S. warehouse club operator , said it has seen increased demand for items like rice and flour as customers , worried about global food shortages and rising prices , stock up .
Sam ’s Club , the No. 2 U.S. warehouse club operator , is limiting sales of the 20 - pound ( 9 kg ) , bulk bags of rice to four bags per customer per visit , and is working with suppliers to ensure the products remain in stock .
Warehouse clubs cater to individual shoppers as well as small businesses and restaurant owners looking to buy cheaper , bulk goods .
With prices for basic food items surging , customers have been going to the clubs to try to save money on bulk sizes of everything from pasta to cooking oil and rice .
Sam ’s Club said the large - sized bags of rice subject to the limits are typically purchased by its restaurant owner or food service customers .
Sam ’s Club said is not limiting sales of flour or cooking oil at this time .
Costco said some of its stores have put limits on sales of items such as rice and flour , but it was trying to modify those restrictions to meet customer demand .
Costco Chief Executive James Sinegal told Reuters that he believed the recent surge in demand was being driven by media reports about rising global demand and shortages of basic food items in some countries .
Food costs have soared worldwide , spurred by increased demand in emerging markets like China and India ; competition with biofuels ; high oil prices and market speculation .
The situation has sparked food riots in several African countries , Indonesia , and Haiti .
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has warned that higher food prices could hurt global growth and security .
Rice prices have risen 68 percent since the start of 2008 .
Trade bans on rice have been put in place by India , the world ’s second largest exporter in 2007 , and Vietnam , the third biggest , in hopes of cooling domestic prices .
Rice is a staple in most of Asia .
On Tuesday , Tim Johnson , president - CEO of California Rice Commission , which represents growers and millers of rice in the state , said : “ Bottom line , there is no rice shortage in the United States .
We have supplies . ”
Wal - Mart shares were up 0.4 percent to $ 56.80 in afternoon trading , while Costco shares rose 1.7 percent to $ 69.26 .

Matt Taibbi and his buddies are making complete fools of themselves by trying to mock those who question 9/11 :
The same people who had managed in the 2000 election to sell billionaire petro-royalist George Bush as an ordinary down - to - earth ranch hand apparently so completely lacked confidence in their own propaganda skills that they resorted to ordering a mass murder on American soil as a way of cajoling America to go to war against a second - rate tyrant like Saddam Hussein .
As if getting America to support going to war even against innocent countries had ever been hard before !
The truly sad thing about the 9/11 Truth movement is that it 's based upon the wildly erroneous proposition that our leaders would ever be frightened enough of public opinion to feel the need to pull off this kind of stunt before acting in a place like Afghanistan or Iraq .
Um . . . have n't you guys ever cracked a history book ?
Do n't you know that virtually every war is preceded by either a false flag attack or fake intelligence , so as to trump up an imminent threat from the folks that are to be on the receiving end of the bayonets and bombs ?
Have n't you guys ever heard these quotes by famous historical figures :
" This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs ; when he first appears he is a protector . "
- Plato
" If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land , it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy . "
- U.S. President James Madison
" Terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death " .
- Adolph Hitler
" Why of course the people do n't want war ...
But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy , and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship ...
Voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country . "
- Hermann Goering , Nazi leader .
" The easiest way to gain control of a population is to carry out acts of terror .
[ The public ] will clamor for such laws if their personal security is threatened " .

SAN FRANCISCO 
They drive hybrid cars , if they drive at all , shop at local stores , if they shop at all and pay off their credit cards every month , if they use them at all .
They may have disposable income , but whatever they make , they live below their means , in a conscious effort to tread lightly on the earth .
They are a new breed of Gen Xers and Ys , Young and Wealthy but Normal , or Yawns .
The acronym comes from The Sunday Telegraph of London , which noted that an increasing number of rich young Britons are socially aware , concerned about the environment and given less to consuming than to giving money to charity .
Yawns sound dull , but they are the new movers and shakers , their dreams big and bold .
They are men and women in their 20s , 30s and 40s who want nothing less than to change the world and save the planet .
Take Sean Blagsvedt , who moved from Seattle to India in 2004 to help build the local office of Microsoft Research .
Moved by young children begging on the streets , Blagsvedt quit Microsoft and launched two networking sites , babajob.com and babalife.com , to link India 's vast pool of potential workers with the people who need labor .
The larger goal — to reduce poverty .
Far from the techie cafe life , Blagsvedt , 32 , lives at babajob 's headquarters in Bangalore , a 3,000 - square - foot apartment where his mother and stepfather also live and 15 workers come and go every day .
" I 'm a happy person , " he said .
" It 's great to do something that you believe in doing . "
The high - tech world has spawned some Yawns , but they can sprout anywhere .
In fact , Yawns are a subset of a growing global movement of the eco-socially aware .
The state of the economy and the state of the planet have inspired people to consider what they buy and how they spend in ways not seen since the " Small is Beautiful " and ecology movements of the 1970s .
The movement makes perfect sense , said David Grusky , a sociologist at Stanford University , since society tends to follow cycles — with anti-materialist periods like the hippie movement generating a pro-materialist reaction — the yuppie period , and so on .
Not to mention , he adds , that the evidence of major climate change and a concern with terrorism gives rise to more interest in spiritual as opposed to material objectives .
The upshot , he said , is that " A cultural and demographic ' perfect storm ' may well push us decisively toward an extreme form of postmaterialism in the upcoming period . "
That helps explain why Earth Day has become so big again , why products are all going " green " and why freecycle.org , an Internet community bulletin board where members offer items for free , has grown in five years from a dozen members in Tucson , to a network of over 3,000 cities in 80 countries .
Deron Beal , the site 's founder , counts 4 million members , and growing by 20,000 to 50,000 members each week .
" People have many reasons for freecycling , " said Beal .
" But the biggest reason is environmental — reusing and recycling instead of helping create more waste . "
Could it also be that we are sick to death of buying stuff ?
Pam Danziger , a consumer trends expert , thinks so .
" The green thing is just a small part of it , " said Danziger , whose firm , Unity Marketing , has new research showing luxury spending is way down .
" Americans have been on a buying binge for the last 10 years , " she said .
" Our closets are full .
Our attics are full .
Our garages are full .
Enough already ! "
Yawns live small , but they already own whatever they want .
Rik Wehbring , a 37 - year - old dot.com millionaire — he worked for multiple start - ups — limits himself to living on $ 50,000 a year .
That 's no chump change but well below what he could spend in San Francisco , where his rent eats up 40 % of his allotted spending .
Wehbring does n't own a television , his mp3 player cost $ 20 ( " and it works just fine " ) and he drives ( when he drives ) a Toyota Prius .
He buys most of his food from local farmers ' markets , is leaving the bulk of his estate to various environmental organizations and donates money to what he considers worthy causes .
Everyday , he grapples with " how to live a low - carbon life . "
But Wehbring does n't buy clothes , or much of anything .
" I do n't need a lot of material possessions , " he said .
" I have n't had to buy anything in a while . "
Such frugality seems to run in his circle .
Brad Marshland , 44 , the husband of Wehbring 's cousin , is a successful filmmaker living near Berkeley .
He and his wife and two sons , ages 10 and 12 , dry their clothes on a line , grow their own vegetables and buy what they need at garage sales and second - hand stores .
( Second - hand stores are to Yawns what The Gap was to Yuppies . )
" We 're pretty low on the stuff scale , " Marshland said .
Marshland offsets his family 's " carbon footprint " — how much energy it uses — by donating money to environmental groups online .
Yawns hate ostentation .
When Ray Sidney , a software engineer at Google , cashed in his stock options in 2003 , they yielded him more money than he could ever burn through in his lifetime .
( Billions ?
He wo n't say . )
But instead of building himself a 10,000 - square foot mansion in the Googledom of Silicon Valley , he retired to a four - bedroom house in Stateline , Nev. , and started giving money away .
He has given $ 400,000 to a local arts council to help build a new arts center , $ 1 million to a bus company to help launch a route so that casino workers would n't have to rely on private transportation to get to and from work , and $ 1.7 million for a new football field and track at a local high school , for example .
Sidney also donates millions to charities that try to cure diseases or save the world .
His one rich - guy , carbon - hogging guilt trip : a single engine plane he flies about once a week to see his girlfriend in San Francisco .
But his pet project these days is pure Yawn .
He is building what he calls " an environmentally friendly affordable housing development " on 100 acres near his home in Stateline .
" This world and our society and the people in it are good and worthwhile , " he said , by way of explanation , " and I think it 's worth spending money to keep it around and try to improve it . "

Introduction
So : Geronimo !
It 's time to tackle the thorny topic of astrology .
Why now ?
Well , for one thing , I 've waited long enough .
It just seems wrong to avoid talking about the biggest baddest astronomy there is .
For another , I wrote an article about astrology for the magazine Night Sky .
My editor and I discussed how to do it , and he wanted me to focus on star - sign astrology ( the kind you see in the newspapers , for example ) .
I agreed that was good for the magazine article , but it did n't go into the depth I wanted to about astrology in general .
This page is an antidote to that .
Astrology is wrong , and I aim to show you why .
Conclusion
I wanted to put that first , just so we 're clear , and to make sure you 're paying attention .
I 'll repeat it later , too .
The Basics
Taurus , the aptly - named Bull
If there is an effect , and it 's real , it can be measured .
That 's pretty much by definition .
Maybe it's not directly measured on an individual basis ; maybe there is only a statistical effect .
In other words , the effect cannot be shown for an individual , but only for groups of people ( like saying that I cannot know what the weather will be like where I live exactly ten years from today , but there is a high probability it will be clear and sunny that day ) .
But even that can be measured using statistics , and predictions like that can be tested for their accuracy .
First , let 's see if there can be any effect from the planets and stars as astrologers claim .
Then , after I show you that there not only is n't any , but can not be any as they claim , we 'll take a look at the claims astrologers make about measured effects ( I 'll give you a hint : they 're wrong ) .
Then finally , I 'll talk a little bit about the real effect of astrology , and how it is eroding people 's ability to think clearly .
Farce of Nature
Our choices are limited .
Planets are big balls of ice , rock , metal , and other stuff .
Their ability to affect us is weak because they are pretty far away .
As far as we can tell in science , there are only four fundamental forces : gravity , electromagnetism , and two forces called the strong and weak force .
Those last two only work ( more or less ) on the nuclei of atoms and subatomic particles .
It 's hard to see how they could affect us on a macroscopic scale ( the strong force weakens so rapidly with distance that it 's essentially gone by the time you 're a few billionths of a meter from the source ! ) .
So we 're stuck with either gravity or electromagnetism .
Let 's look briefly at both .
We know quite a bit about how gravity works on large scales , scales like that of the solar system .
Basically , the gravity of an object depends on two things : how much mass it has , and how far away it is .
The more massive an object , the stronger its gravity .
The closer it is , the more its gravity affects you .
Jupiter and its moon , Io .
Note the size difference ;
Io is the same size as the Earth 's Moon ( and that black spot is its shadow on Jupiter ; Io itself is a little bit to the right ) .
In this case , it 's distance , by a long shot .
I wo n't go into details here , because I already wrote up a page about gravity and the planets .
Read it here to get the actual numbers .
But the bottom line is that at best , the gravity from the planets in our solar system is a tiny fraction of the Moon's .
So if gravity were the force behind astrology , then the Moon would dominate all the planets combined .
Yet it does n't in any astrologer 's horoscope .
So it 's not gravity .
Could it be electromagnetism ?
Gravity depends on mass and distance .
Electromagnetism ( or just EM ) depends on electric charge and distance .
The problem here is that most large objects do n't have an electric charge !
I have a little bit more about this topic here .
Electric charges come from charged particles like electrons and protons .
But opposite charges attract each other so well that it 's very rare to find one without the other nearby , which means that a planet is electrically neutral overall .
An alternative astrological phenomenon
Some planets , for other reasons , do have magnetic fields .
But these fields are only strong near their home planet .
Jupiter 's field is immense , but Jupiter is so far away it has no real effect on us .
Furthermore , the Sun is far and away the largest EM source in the solar system .
Its magnetic field directly affects us ; when there is a gigantic flare , or other explosions on the surface of the Sun , vast streams of charged particles are sent sleeting out .
These can interact with the Earth 's own magnetic field , causing havoc ( in 1989 , such an event caused a blackout in Quebec ) .
So if anything , the Sun should be the only source of astrological effects .
However , astrologers tend to ignore it or still give the planets the lion 's share of the astrological effect on us .
Either way , the planets ' combined force is miniscule compared to the Sun's .
If EM is the force behind astrology , the planets could be safely ignored .
If gravity were the driving force of astrology , the Moon would dominate , but it does n't .
If EM were the driving force , the Sun would dominate , but it does n't .
We 've run out of forces !
Astrologers ' only hope is to posit some other force , unknown to science .
However , that hope is bleak indeed .
Why ?
As far as we know , every force weakens with distance .
An object farther away has lesser force on you than something closer .
Yet astrologers claim that all the planets have equal ( or at least comparable ) effects , so nearby Venus and distant Pluto both exert some sort of measurable tug on you ( at least , measurable in the sense that they can affect your life somehow ) .
This means , by the astrologers ' own claims , distance must not be a factor with this force .
Obviously , mass must n't either , or else Jupiter would dominate the planets , and poor tiny Mercury would be left out .
But this can not be right !
What about asteroids ?
These are chunks of rock and metal that also orbit the Sun along with planets .
Most asteroids are closer to Earth than the outer planets ( not that distance matters to astrologers , remember ? ) , so they should have some effect .
The problem is that there are many , many asteroids .
My friend Dan Durda has calculated that there are a billion asteroids in the solar system larger than 100 meters in diameter .
That 's a lot of rock !
So why do n't astrologers include them in their horoscopes ?
And it gets worse for astrology .
Astronomers have now found about 150 planets orbiting other stars .
These are very distant , certainly , but hey !
Distance is no issue .
So therefore these planets must affect us too .
Now , these are only the planets we 've discovered so far .
Given how many we 've found , and what kind of stars they tend to orbit , it 's reasonable to assume that there are billions ( billions ! ) of such planets in our galaxy alone .
They 're everywhere !
Why do n't astrologers include them in their horoscopes ?
Here 's another way to think of it .
Astronomers ( the real scientists ) can determine that the planets are out there due to their real effects on their parent stars .
If these planets affect us , as they must according to the astrologers ' own set of rules , then why do n't astrologers predict them ?
Why did n't any single astrologer 50 years ago say " There must be planets around other stars , because we can see it in our data ! " ?
They did n't because they can't .
Their " data " are meaningless .
Again , by the rules used by astrologers , all those planets would simply overpower our own solar system planets , washing out their effects as simply and profoundly as the sound of a nuclear explosion would overpower a whisper .
Remember , and I keep repeating this because it 's important -- this is playing by the astrologers ' own rules .
Either there is a known force , and we can show it does n't work for astrology , or it 's some unknown force that does n't obey the laws of physics , in which case asteroids and extrasolar planets would dominate astrology , washing out the effects from our own solar system planets .
So it can't be a known or unknown force .
That leaves nothing .
Astrology does n't work .
Inaccuracy We Trust
Another two - bit prediction
But there are several possible logical missteps here !
First , was the prediction really that accurate ?
Did it say something like " you will come into money today " and you found a quarter on the ground ?
Or was it something specific , like " you will find a quarter on the ground " ?
The difference is that a specific prediction is rarely right , while a vague one is rarely wrong .
Second , was that horoscope right in everything it said ?
Did an old friend contact you ?
Were you able to resolve a thorny issue today ?
Did you really find love today ?
In other words , how many predictions were accurate , and how many were not ?
People tend to remember the hits and forget the misses ( which is precisely why " speakers to the dead " like John Edward and James van Praagh do so well -- see here , or here or here ) .
Still having doubts ?
My friend and master skeptic James Randi performs a wonderful demo of how easily people are fooled by astrology .
He went into a classroom , posing as an astrologer , and cast horoscopes for all the students .
He had them read and rate the accuracy , and they almost overwhelmingly rated the horoscopes as accurate .
The kicker ?
He had them pass around the horoscopes , and the students saw that every horoscope was exactly the same .
It was worded vaguely enough that nearly everyone in the room thought they were being well - described .
The horoscopes were so vague they matched nearly everyone , and so their predictive power was meaningless .
It was all in the students ' heads .
Astrologers rely on our inability to remember when they are wrong , and our almost unfailing ability to see patterns in random noise ( in other words , to pull out something that may just possibly kind of vaguely resemble something that describes us ) .
What are the odds ?

The point is that even a wild guess by an astrologer , even if it 's right , may be meaningless .
How many times has he said something like that to someone he is reading , only to be denied ?
When investigated closely , and with a skeptical mind , astrological claims are smoke and mirrors .
In the next section we 'll see just such an investigation .
Cause and Defect
Yes , there is .
In the spirit of giving the astrologers more rope , so to speak , let 's assume that despite all the scientific evidence against such a thing , there really is an effect on us by the planets .
If it exists , it must be measurable , and for astrologers to be able to use it to cast horoscopes , their claims must be consistent .
After all , if a force cannot be measured , it cannot have an effect on us , and if astrologers say such a force exists , then all their claims must be based on that force , and should be consistent with each other .
Surprise ! Astrologers ' claims are not consistent .
They 're not even internally consistent .
I could show you nearly endless examples of how , say , Sun-sign astrology horoscopes ( the kind you see in your newspaper ) are completely inconsistent with each other .
I could even talk about an astronomical term called precession , which shows that Sun-sign astrology is rubbish anyway ( you can try reading one page about it if you 'd like ) .
I wo n't bother , because in the end I think all that stuff is distraction ; astrologers will always come up with some lame excuse about how their claims are still correct , when that other astrologer 's claim is nonsense ( of course , the other guy says that too ) .
So let 's cut to it : astrologers claim they get results that are consistent .
There have been studies , tests , experiments , all sorts of things to check this claim .
The bottom line is , their claims are wrong .
How do I know ?
Because I read a wonderful paper , a very thoroughly researched , well - documented , and referenced paper , which shows precisely where astrology fails all its tests .
This paper is titled Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi ? " , and was written by Geoffrey Dean , a long - time astrology researcher , and Ivan Kelly , a professor of Educational Psychology and Special Education at the University of Saskatchewan .
The paper demolishes , utterly , any notion that astrology has any effect at all .
They look at not only direct studies of astrology , but also " meta- studies " , tests that are compiled together to improve statistics ( a very powerful method that enables researchers to extract much better quality data from tests that are individually too borderline to give good results ) .
As they say in their own paper abstract :
Many tests of astrologers have been made since the 1950s but only recently has a coherent review been possible .
A large - scale test of persons born less than five minutes apart found no hint of the similarities predicted by astrology .
Meta - analysis of more than forty controlled studies suggests that astrologers are unable to perform significantly better than chance even on the more basic tasks such as predicting extraversion [ sociability ] .
More specifically , astrologers who claim to use psychic ability perform no better than those who do not .
In other words , astrology does n't work .
They detail the cases of people born at very close times and locations , what they call " time twins " ( say , two babies born within minutes of each other at the same hospital ) .
Astrologers , of course , would predict many similarities between time twins .
But , as Dean and Kelly phrase it so succinctly , " The strong similarities predicted by astrology were simply not there " .
This paper goes on with a very careful analysis of the studies , and also very carefully tries to discuss any flaws astrologers might bring up ( for example , they use an astrologer 's own definition of what a time twin would be ) .
Simply put , the paper is devastating to astrology .
It 's also not terribly hard to read .
Give it a try !
I laughed out loud many times when reading it , it was so matter - of - fact in its dissection and eventual destruction of astrology .
Ivan Kelly wrote another paper , called " The Concepts of Modern Astrology : A Critique " , which discusses the underlying basis of astrology and its claims , and is similarly devastating in its conclusions .
As Kelly says , " We can conclude that astrology ... is not a reliable source of information or knowledge about ourselves ... Astrology is part of our past , but astrologers have given no plausible reason why it should have a role in our future ... " .
I could n't say it better myself .
Oh wait , yes I can : astrology is wrong .
A Call to Harms
Wrong .
For one thing , it 's estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on astrology every year in the United States alone .
That 's real money , folks , wasted on something that does n't work .
For another , astrology promotes the worst thing in the world : uncritical thinking .
The more we teach people to simply accept anecdotal stories , hearsay , cherry - picked data ( picking out what supports your claims but ignoring what does n't ) , and , frankly , out - and - out lies , the harder it gets for people to think clearly .
If you cannot think clearly , you cannot function as a human being .
I cannot stress this enough .
Uncritical thinking is tearing this world to pieces , and while astrology may not be at the heart of that , it has its role .
For a third , and this one irritates me personally , astrology takes away from the real grandeur of the Universe .
We live in an amazing place , this Universe of ours , and it 's quite fantastic enough without needing people to make up things about it .
Astrology dims the beauty of nature , cheapens it .
Hey , you might say , sure it's in the newspapers , but they put it next to comics , right ?
How seriously do newspapers take it then ?
My answer is , if newspapers do n't take horoscopes seriously , then they should n't publish them in the first place .
People know that comics are n't real , but not everyone understands astrology has as much legitimacy as " Blondie and Dagwood " .
Saying their location indicates their rationality is a cop out .
Most newspapers in this country do n't even have a science section , and science is critical to our daily lives ( you 're reading this on a computer , right ?
Do you wear glasses , or clothes , do you brush your teeth , take medicine , invest in tech stocks , drive a car ?
Thank science for all of those things then ) .
They do n't have a science section , but they 'll publish horoscopes .
Also , back in the 1980s , Nancy Reagan , President Reagan 's wife , consulted an astrologer to make sure that meetings and such were planned on auspicious dates astrologically .
Her husband -- the President of the United States -- went along with it .
Still do n't think this is harmful ?
Arguably the most powerful man in the world , and he based his calendar on the random and unsubstantiated claims of an anti-scientific nonsense peddler .
I hope I 've made my stance clear .
Summing Up
There is no force , known or unknown , that could possibly affect us here on Earth the way astrologers claim .
Known forces weaken too fast , letting one source utterly dominate ( the Moon for gravity , the Sun for electromagnetism ) .
An unknown force would allow asteroids and extrasolar planets to totally overwhelm the nearby planets .
Astrologers tend to rely on our ability to remember hits and forget misses .
Even an accurate prediction may be simple chance .
Study after study has shown that claims and predictions made by astrologers have no merit .
They are indistinguishable from chance , which means astrologers cannot claim to have some ability to predict your life 's path .
There is harm , real harm , in astrology .
It weakens further people 's ability to rationally look at the world , an ability we need now more than ever .
Conclusion
See ?
Told you I 'd repeat it .
That was one astrological prediction you could actually count on .

Fidelity Spartan 500 Index ( FSMKX )
Not so long ago , the idea that U.S. stocks should be at the core of any investment strategy would have been deemed too obvious to discuss .
This decade , in which the brutal 2000 - 02 bear market and the current downturn have left the S&P 500 stuck where it started , may have changed that .
Let 's review : Since 1967 there have been seven bear markets , with losses ranging from 19 % to 49 % .
Even so , the annual gain for blue - chip U.S. stocks is 10.8 % - far outpacing bonds .
Those painful but temporary losses are the price you pay for higher potential returns .
And those gains are the best defense against the corrosive effects of inflation .
Are stocks better than gold at whipping inflation ?
Way better : Since 1908 , stocks have grown more than eightfold after inflation ; gold has little more than doubled in today 's dollars .
Although U.S. firms no longer dominate the world , their stocks still account for more than 40 % of the world 's equity value .
So U.S. blue chips need to be at the heart of a diversified strategy .
The best way to own them is through the Fidelity Spartan 500 Index fund .
It replicates the performance of the S&P 500 and takes only a sliver of a fee for doing so : 0.10 % a year .

Allegations of widespread mismanagement and corruption among private contractors in Iraq are nothing new ; if anything , tales of cronyism , over - billing , and embezzlement have become so frequent that our national tolerance for them seems only to have increased as the Iraq War has drawn on .
Even so , the testimony earlier this week of three whistleblowers before the Senate ’s Democratic Policy Committee ( DPC ) stands out for the sheer outrageousness of their accusations — namely that U.S. private contractors looted Iraqi palaces and ministries , stole military equipment , fenced supplies destined for U.S. troops , and even operated a prostitution ring that may have contributed to the death of fellow contractor .
Yet despite its focus on such salacious matters as sex and corruption , the session earned little media attention .
The first to testify was Frank Cassaday , a former KBR employee who worked as an ice plant operator in Fallujah in 2004 and 2005 .
“ Ice was a very valuable commodity in Iraq that was regularly stolen and bartered for other goods , ” he told the committee .
He recalled how a convoy of U.S. Marines , in preparation for an operation that would take them outside the wire for several days , requested 28 bags of ice to keep their food fresh in the desert heat .
They received only three .
“ The ice foreman was cheating the troops out of ice at the same time that he was trading the ice for DVDs , CDs , food , and other items at the Iraqi shops across the street , ” Cassaday said .
“ This foreman would change the ice tally sheets at the distribution area I worked in to make it seem as though we had handed out more ice to the Marines than we actually did . ”
Cassaday said he later observed his colleagues returning to KBR ’s camp with equipment they had stolen from the U.S. military , including refrigerators , artillery round detonators , two rocket launchers , and about 800 rounds of small arms ammunition .
After he informed the KBR camp manager of the thefts , Marines searched the camp with dogs to recover the stolen property .
For his trouble , Cassaday said , KBR security officers jailed him in his tent for two days .
He then spent another four days in “ protective custody ” before being transferred , against his will , to work in a laundry .
The practice of stealing equipment and supplies destined for the U.S. military was so pervasive that KBR employees invented a slang term to describe it : “ drug deals . ”
But thefts were not limited to military supplies , said Linda Warren , another former KBR employee who testified at the hearing .
Upon her arrival in Baghdad in 2004 , she was shocked by the number of contractors involved in criminal activity .
“ KBR employees who were contracted to perform construction duties inside palaces and municipal buildings were looting , ” she said .
“ Not only were they looting , but they had a system in place to get contraband out of the country so it could be sold on eBay .
They stole artwork , rugs , crystal , and even melted down gold to make spurs for cowboy boots . ”
Like Cassaday , when she complained to her superiors about the thefts , she was punished .
She said her vehicle was taken away , her movements were closely monitored , and her access to phones and the Internet were cut off .
Eventually , she was transferred out of Baghdad .
Perhaps more shocking than any of this was the accusation from Barry Halley , a former project manager for Worldwide Network Services , a Washington , D.C. - based firm that was working on subcontract for DynCorp .
According to Halley , his site manager in Iraq , who he said was employed by a “ major defense contractor , ” moonlighted as the leader of a prostitution ring serving American contractors in Iraq that indirectly caused the death of a colleague .
“ A co-worker unrelated to the ring was killed when he was traveling in an unsecure car and shot performing a high - risk mission , ” he told the committee .
“ I believe that my co-worker could have survived if he had been riding in an armored car .
At the time , the armored car that he would otherwise have been riding in was being used by a manager to transport prostitutes from Kuwait to Baghdad . ”
The prostitution ring was shut down when the company ’s home office learned of it , but , Halley said , the manager who controlled it retained his job , moving on to work another contract in Haiti .
A theme running through all three witnesses ’ testimony , aside from the pervasiveness of corruption among private contractors in Iraq , was that blowing the whistle on abuses rarely did any good .
As is often the case with whistleblowers , speaking out was a shortcut to getting fired or demoted .
“ There ’s a no - talk , no - speak policy in effect in Iraq about what goes on , ” Halley said .
According to Cassaday , although contractors for KBR are trained to report irregularities , the practice is generally frowned on by managers in the field .
“ In Houston at the training camp that I was at for two weeks before we went over to Iraq , they told us that , ‘ Our door is always open .
If you have a problem , just come on in , ' ” he said .
“ But what they do n’t tell you is there ’s a back door to that office .
If you come in and you complain about something , you ’re going to be going out that back door .
You ’re going to either be transferred someplace you do n’t want to be , or you ’re going to be fired . ”
Arriving nearly two weeks after the military awarded a 10 - year logistical contract worth up to $ 150 billion to DynCorp , KBR , and a third firm , the DPC hearing was the thirteenth in a series designed to look into contractor fraud and abuse in the reconstruction of Iraq .
Although , as a partisan committee , it has no powers to pass legislation , DPC members do refer allegations to the Department of Justice and the Pentagon ’s Inspector General for further investigation , says Barry Piatt , the DPC ’s communications director .
Committee chairman Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota has been advocating for the creation of a permanent , bipartisan Wartime Contracting Commission to look into the types of accusations raised this week , but so far , says Piatt , Senate Republicans have blocked the measure .
Until he is able to obtain the necessary 60 votes , Dorgan will continue to negotiate with the opposition in hopes of peeling away enough support to establish the commission .
In the meantime , “ the hearings that need to be done will be done , ” says Piatt .
“ The Republicans wo n’t able to block that , and by continuing to do them , [ Senator Dorgan ] is showing the work that a committee like that would do . ”

Erik Youngdahl and Michelle Garcia share a dorm room at Connecticut 's Wesleyan University .
But they say there 's no funny business going on .
Really .
They mean it .
They have set up their beds side - by - side like Lucy and Ricky in " I Love Lucy , " and avert their eyes when one of them is changing clothes .
" People are shocked to hear that it 's happening and even that it 's possible , " said Youngdahl , a 20 - year - old sophomore .
But " once you actually live in it , it does n't actually turn into a big deal . "
In the prim 1950s , college dorms were off - limits to members of the opposite sex .
Then came the 1970s , when male and female students started crossing paths in coed dormitories .
Now , to the astonishment of some Baby Boomer parents , a growing number of colleges are going even further : coed rooms .
At least two dozen schools , including Brown University , the University of Pennsylvania , Oberlin College , Clark University and the California Institute of Technology , allow some or all students to share a room with anyone they choose — including someone of the opposite sex .
This spring , as students sign up for next year 's room , more schools are following suit , including Stanford University .
As shocking as it sounds to some parents , some students and schools say it 's not about sex .
Instead , they say the demand is mostly from heterosexual students who want to live with close friends who happen to be of the opposite sex .
Some gay students who feel more comfortable rooming with someone of the opposite sex are also taking advantage of the option .
" It ultimately comes down to finding someone that you feel is compatible with you , " said Jeffrey Chang , a junior at Clark in Worcester , Mass. , who co-founded the National Student Genderblind Campaign , a group that is pushing for gender - neutral housing .
" Students are n't doing this to make a point .
They 're not doing this to upset their parents .
It 's really for practical reasons . "
Couples do sometimes room together , an arrangement known at some schools as " roomcest . "
Brown explicitly discourages couples from living together on campus , be they gay or straight .
But the University of California , Riverside has never had a problem with a roommate couple breaking up midyear , said James C. Smith , assistant director for residence life .
Most schools introduced the couples option in the past three or four years .
So far , relatively few students are taking part .
At the University of Pennsylvania , which began offering coed rooms in 2005 , about 120 out of 10,400 students took advantage of the option this year .
At UC Riverside , which has approximately 6,000 students in campus housing , about 50 have roommates of the opposite sex .
The school has had the option since 2005 .
Garcia and Youngdahl live in a house for students with an interest in Russian studies .
They said they were already friendly , and did n't think they would be compatible with some of the other people in the house .
" I had just roomed with a boy .
I was under the impression at the time that girls were a little bit neater and more quiet , " Youngdahl said .
" As it turns out , I do n't see much of a difference from one sex to the other . "
Garcia , 19 , admitted : " I 'm incredibly messy . "
Parents are n't necessarily thrilled with boy - girl housing .
Debbie Feldman 's 20 - year - old daughter , Samantha , is a sophomore at Oberlin in Ohio and plans to room with her platonic friend Grey Caspro , a straight guy , next year .
Feldman said she was shocked when her daughter told her .
" When you have a male and female sharing such close quarters , I think it 's somewhat delusional to think there wo n't be sexual tension , " the 52 - year - old Feldman said .
" Maybe this generation feels more comfortable walking around in their underwear .
I 'm not sure that 's a good thing . "
Still , Feldman said her daughter is partly in college to learn life lessons , and it's her decision .
Samantha said she assured her mom she thinks of Caspro as a brother .
" I 'm really close to him , and I consider him one of my really good friends , " she said .
" I really trust him .
That trust makes it work . "

The process which led to Norway ’s
Yes vote on OOXML was so surrealistic that it deserves to be recorded for posterity .
Here ’s my version of the story .
It is not impartial .
I was the Chairman of the Norwegian mirror committee for SC34 ( K185 ) for 13 years until resigning a couple of weeks ago in protest against Standard Norway ’s decision to vote Yes .
On the other hand , I was present throughout the whole process and have more first - hand knowledge of what went on than anyone ( excepting two employees of Standard Norway ) .
Here I describe the fateful meeting on Friday March 28 .
More background will follow .
The meeting started at 10 and we spent an hour on other business before proceeding to the main agenda item : reviewing Ecma ’s responses to the comments that accompanied our No vote in the August DIS ballot .
I led the first part of the meeting and then handed over to the VP of Standard Norway for the last part , as I had done on previous occasions when OOXML was under discussion .
There were nearly 30 people present : three employees of Standard Norway ( the VP , the committee secretary , and the JTC1 representative ) ; the rest were technical experts .
The VP opened by declaring that our only purpose was to discuss the comment responses and decide whether they had been addressed to our satisfaction .
If so , Norway ’s vote would change from No to Yes .
I suggested that we should also take account of changes made at the BRM and base our decision on a total assessment .
The VP did not disagree , but insisted that the discussion should focus on the comments .
He also made it clear that the goal was to achieve consensus and that there would not be any voting .
The next four hours were spent going through the 12 comments submitted by Norway .
My tally of the final result was as follows :
Consensus that the comment had been satisfactorily resolved : 2 comments .
Consensus that the comment had not been satisfactorily resolved : 2 comments .
No consensus that the comment had been satisfactorily resolved : 8 comments .
Regarding those last 8 comments , there was a roughly 80/20 split between those who were dissatisfied and those who were satisfied .
( Since there was no voting , this is just an estimate , but it ’s pretty accurate . )
There was not even a shadow of consensus that the comments as a whole had been satisfactorily addressed and I naturally assumed the No vote would stand .
But lo… at this point , the “ rules ” were changed .
The VP asserted that “ Ecma has clearly made steps in the right direction . ”
The most important thing now was to ensure that OOXML came under ISO ’s control so that it could be “ further improved ” .
However , the committee was not allowed to discuss this .
The VP thereupon declared that there was no consensus , so the decision would be taken by Standard Norway .
Halfway through the proceedings , a committee member had asked for ( and received ) assurance that the Chairman would take part in the final decision , as he had for the DIS vote back in August .
It now transpired that the BRM participants had also been invited to stay behind .
23 people were therefore dismissed and we were down to seven .
In addition to Standard Norway ’s three , there were four “ experts ” : Microsoft Norway ’s chief lobbyist , a guy from Statoil Hydro ( national oil company ; big MS Office user ) , a K185 old - timer , and me .
In one fell swoop the balance of forces had changed from 80/20 to 50/50 and the remaining experts discussed back and forth for 20 minutes or so without reaching any agreement .
The VP thereupon declared that there was still no consensus , so the decision would be taken by Standard Norway .
The experts were dismissed and the VP asked the opinion of the Secretary ( who said “ Yes ” ) and the JTC1 rep ( who said “ No ” ) .
The VP thereupon declared that there was still no consensus , so the decision would be taken by him .
And his decision was to vote Yes .
So this one bureaucrat , a man who by his own admission had no understanding of the technical issues , had chosen to ignore the advice of his Chairman , of 80 % of his technical experts , and of 100 % of the K185 old - timers .
For the Chairman , only one course of action was possible .
That ’s the story .
Here ’s the management summary , based on the song we used to sing as kids when going on long trips in the car :
There were 30 in the bed and the little one said , “ Roll over , roll over . ”
So they all rolled over and 23 fell out .
There were 7 in the bed and the little one said , “ Roll over , roll over . ”
So they all rolled over and 4 fell out .
There were 3 in the bed and the little one said , “ Roll over , roll over . ”
So they all rolled over and 2 fell out …
There was 1 in the bed and the little one said , “ Norway votes Yes ! ”
The meeting was a farce and the result was a scandal .
But it ’s not over yet , and one thing is clear : the “ little one ” is unfit to represent the interests of Norwegian users .
It ’s time he was told , “ Roll over , roll over … ”
West Wing Obama the Inevitable
The issue of race has emerged as the key Democratic divide in this year 's primary season .
Despite his waning support amongst white voters , though , the superdelegates appear to have no other choice but to vote for Barack Obama .
A vote against him could have serious consequences .

Prisons prepare to integrate cellmates
Court order raises concern in a system where peace and violence revolve around racial lines
In June the prison system , including San Quentin prison will implement a U.S. Supreme Court ruling requiring the integration of inmates in double cells .

San Quentin State Prison inmate Lexy Good is white , hangs out with whites on the prison exercise yard and must be careful not to associate with blacks and Latinos .
No cards , no basketball outside the color lines .
Those are the unwritten inmate rules of prison life .
People stick to their own race .
Good , who 's doing a short stretch for receiving stolen property , likes it that way .
" We segregate amongst ourselves because I 'd rather hang out with white people , and blacks would rather hang out with people of their own race , " said Good , 33 , of Walnut Creek .
" Look at suburbia .
Look at Oakland .
Look at Beverly Hills .
People in society self - segregate . "
Soon that may change in the prisons .
San Quentin and 30 or so other state penal facilities are gearing up to carry out a federal court mediation agreement for integrating double cells and ending the use of race as the sole determining factor in making cell assignments .
Men in California 's prisons have long been segregated in cells to quell racial tensions .
But Good , along with California 's other 155,700 male inmates , may soon be forced to live in a 4 - by - 9 - foot cell with an inmate of a different race .
A 1995 lawsuit filed by a black California inmate , Garrison Johnson , said that the California Department of Corrections ' practice of segregating prisoners by race violated his rights .
A 2005 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court led to federal court mediation and the agreement that double cells would be desegregated .
While most inmates and correctional officials agree that it is a noble idea , many fear the worst .
" They should be thinking about what kind of war they are going to start , " said a San Quentin inmate who identified himself only as S. Styles , 36 , of Vallejo .
" It is like putting a cat and a dog in a cell together . "
Lt. Rudy Luna , assistant to the warden at San Quentin , said there is some concern among prison officials about the change because much of the violence is already based around racial gangs .
State mandate
" There is always concern , but that is a rule that has been sent down .
There are a lot of times we do n't like what we have to do , " Luna said .
" I think we will have a spike in fighting because we have races that do n't get along .
If it was up to us , we 'd keep it the way it is .
But it is a state mandate . "
Among the state 's male inmates , about 28.9 percent are black , 39.3 percent are Latino , 25.9 percent are white , and 5.9 percent are classified as other , according to figures from the state Department of Corrections .
" There are a lot of incidents in prison where you have a group of inmates going against another group of inmates , " said Terry Thornton , spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
" You have these groups aligned along race but it is about control .
It is about criminal activities . "
As currently planned , the cell integration will begin July 1 as a pilot project at two prisons - Mule Creek State Prison in Ione ( Amador County ) and the Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown ( Tuolumne County ) .
Next year , the plan calls for integration to begin at other prisons .
Interviewing inmates
In carrying out the plan , prison officials will interview and evaluate each inmate .
Department of Corrections officials know some inmates cannot be placed with inmates of other races .
But those who are deemed eligible and still refuse will face discipline ranging from loss of privileges to solitary confinement .
Guards and staff have also been undergoing training for the past year on procedures and have been told to be alert for signs of abuse or fighting , Thornton said .
" The benefit is for inmates to live how they are supposed to live .
It is rehabilitative .
This is how we live in the world .
It should be the same way in prison too , " Thornton said .
" It breaks down all of those prejudicial barriers . "
Inmate David Johnson said that all the races sit together peacefully in the prison church and they work together with few problems .
But he would n't socialize with inmates of another race outside of those settings where he is forced to mingle .
Loyal to his race
" Prison politics " dictate that he stay loyal to his race , Johnson said .
And the repercussions for a violation are swift and severe .
" You would be taken care of in some way .
You could get stabbed or worse , " said Johnson , 38 , of San Diego .
" Whether you agree with the ( unwritten ) rules or not , you have to follow them . "
That 's why prison officials said the new plan will help the prisons manage the criminal prison gangs , which are divided racially and strictly control who their members associate with .
" Ninety percent of the gang members do n't want to be in a gang but they can't get out .
But now we are giving them a way out .
It will be an excuse for a white to be with a black and a black to be with a white , " Luna said .
The race lines are stark throughout the prisons .
One recent sunny afternoon on the exercise yard of San Quentin , a group of two dozen or so African American inmates congregated around the basketball court , shooting hoops or just talking .
White inmates were in the middle of the yard , playing ping pong or cards .
And the Latino inmates were at the far end of the yard where there was some exercise equipment .
In a nearby courtyard , inmates who had recently arrived sat in small groups , mostly segregated except for those doing an intake exam .
Carnell Bradley , 23 , Gregory Ealey , 27 and Wayne Griffin , 22 , all of Oakland and all black , sat together and agreed that the integration plan is flawed .
' That is how jail is '
" It is going to cause problems .
As soon as the cellmates get into a fight , it will become a race against race thing , " said Ealey .
" It is going to bring everybody into it because that is how jail is .
It is just more comfortable being with your own race . "
However , experts say it can work .
The Texas prison system integrated its cells in the early 1990s and eventually saw a decline in racial tensions , said Professor Jim Marquart , chair of the criminology department at the University of Texas at Dallas , who studied the transition and is advising California during its process .
" The people said , ' It ca n't be done , you are going to have helter skelter in the prisons . '
On the other side , you had people say it can be done .
But basically , it was somewhere in between , " said Marquart , who authored a report called " The Caged Melting Pot . "
He said there was a spike in interracial violence at first .
But after a while it died down , and the levels of interracial violence are now less than in the general population .
" We are not here to say that everybody is holding hands and singing Kumbaya .
There is a lot of hate .
There is a lot of animosity .
But inmates are intelligent and they want to just do their time and they want to go home , " said Marquart .
" It worked here .
It is an uneasy peace and truce , but it worked .
I have ultimate faith in their ability to do it in California . "
Are you fit enough to save your own life ?
That ’s the premise of a new reality show from Discovery Health that premieres tonight .
Called “ Fit to Live , ” it ’s based on Dr. Pamela Peeke ’s book of the same name and raises the question of whether you have the strength , endurance and agility to escape a natural disaster , flee a burning building or pull your family from a wrecked car .
Fitness is n’t about working out at the gym or running a marathon , notes Dr. Peeke , assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland and chief medical correspondent for Discovery Health Television .
Fitness is important for coping with life ’s emergencies , big and small , whether it ’s running to make an airport connection or fleeing a burning building .
“ Fit to Live ” joins a series of reality - meets - health TV shows like ABC ’s “ Fat March ” and NBC ’s “ The Biggest Loser . ”
But this show is n’t a weight - loss contest .
It ’s a fitness test to determine if someone , whether they are skinny or fat , is in good enough shape to save their own life .
In the show , five average people are given 10 minutes to escape a simulated fire in a 30 - floor building .
During the simulated emergency , they find stairways blocked and “ bodies ” to rescue , and none of them can make it to safety on the roof .
“ They all died , ” noted Dr. Peeke .
After undergoing a month of basic fitness and health habits , the contestants retake the test .
While this may sound far - fetched , I can personally attest that fitness counts in an emergency .
On September 11 , 2001 , I was on the ninth floor of the World Financial Center , which was just across the street from the World Trade Center .
After the second plane struck the Trade Center , my building was evacuated .
A nine - floor descent does n’t sound like much , but my group was stuck behind a slow - moving overweight woman .
It took what seemed like forever to get out , and it was truly frightening .
The evacuation was far more challenging for the people several floors above us .
Dr. Peeke notes that the television show focuses on escaping a burning building , but the real message is about the importance of fitness to cope with life ’s everyday emergencies , like sprinting for a train or catching your dog when it escapes .
“ When people think of fitness , they think of athletes and bulging biceps and running to the gym and doing squats , ” said Dr. Peeke .
“ What I ’m trying to do is get people strong enough to be able to survive 21st - century living . ”
“ Fit to Live ” premieres on the Discovery Health Channel tonight at 8 p.m. ( check your local listings ) .

Nuclear weapons presented " much more difficult food defence problems "
The threat of a nuclear attack on the UK in the 1950s caused concern over the supply of tea , top - secret documents which have now been released reveal .
Government officials planning food supplies said the tea situation would be " very serious " after a nuclear war .
" It would be wrong to consider that even 1 oz per head per week could be ensured , " they stated .
The papers were released under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Archives at Kew .
Heart and health
The documents said a nuclear conflict would result in the loss of three - quarters of tea stocks .
One paper from April 1955 said : " The advent of thermonuclear weapons ... has presented us with a new and much more difficult set of food defence problems . "
The aim was to be " completely ready to maintain supplies of food to the people of these islands , sufficient in volume to keep them in good heart and health from the onset of a thermonuclear attack on this country " .
" It has become increasingly clear that the severity of the attack which the enemy could launch would produce a catastrophe in the face of which past measures would be fatally deficient , " the document added .
Food stockpiles
For planning purposes , the Ministry of Food listed London , Birmingham , Merseyside , Manchester and Clydeside as H - bomb targets .
Tyneside , Teesside , Leeds , Sheffield , Hull , Derby , Purfleet in Essex , Southampton , Portsmouth , Bristol , Plymouth , Cardiff , Coventry and Belfast were named as A - bomb targets .
Subjects down for discussion were arrangements for stockpiling food , emergency feeding and equipment , and the availability of bread , milk , meat , oils and fats and tea and sugar .
Methods successfully used in World War II would be " unable to maintain bread supplies under the conditions envisaged " , the documents said .
US manned guns and were ' very close ' to firing on Iranian ships RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 7 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Update : Iran 's Foreign Ministry downplays confrontation , says incident was ' something normal ' US Navy warships over the weekend came " very close " to shooting at Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessels , which American officials say provoked US ships in international waters , according to CNN .
" US officials are confirming to CNN that five Iranian Revolutionary guard boats , in their words , ' harassed and provoked ' three US Navy warships sailing in the Strait of Hormuz , " reports CNN 's Barbara Starr .
" One of those Iranian boats came within 200 yards of a Navy warship . "
The Iranian boats had also transmitted threats via radio , according to officials .
" According to the sources we have spoken to , " Starr continued , " the Iranians made threatening moves and threatening radio transmissions .
One of those transmissions was ...' I am coming at you , you will explode in a couple of minutes . ' "
CNN 's website reports that " one of the Iranian ships had been dropping white boxes into the water in front of the US ships . "
Following the radio transmission , a Navy ship had prepared to fire on an Iranian vessel .
" This official also tells CNN that when that radio transmission was heard , the Navy went to manning its positions , its gun positions on those ships , " Starr reports , " and that they were very close to shooting at one of the Iranian boats .
In fact the were ready to shoot , the orders had been given when the Iranians suddenly turned away . "
No shots were fired , and there were no injuries .
" It is the most serious provocation of this sort that we 've seen yet , " a Pentagon official told the Associated Press .
He added that the Iranian boats turned away " literally at the very moment that US forces were preparing to open fire . "
But a spokesman for Iran 's Foreign Ministry on Monday downplayed the confrontation , suggesting the Iranian boats had not recognized the US vessels as American .
" That is something normal that takes place every now and then for each party , and it ( the problem ) is settled after identification of the two parties , " Mohammed Ali Hosseini told the state news agency IRNA .
The incident was " similar to past ones " that were resolved " once the two sides recognized each other , " he added .
At the State Department , spokesman Sean McCormack said he was not aware of any plans to lodge a formal protest with the Iranian government .
" Without specific reference to this incident in the Strait of Hormuz , the United States will confront Iranian behavior where it seeks to do harm either to us or to our friends and allies in the region , " McCormack told reporters .
" There is wide support for that within the region and certainly that 's not going to change . "
AP reports the confrontation occurred about 5 a.m. local time Sunday as a US Navy cruiser , destroyer and frigate were transiting the strait on their way into the Persian Gulf .
" Five small boats were acting in a very aggressive way , charging the ships , dropping boxes in the water in front of the ships and causing our ships to take evasive maneuvers , " the Pentagon official said .
Iranian Revolutionary Guard sailors last March captured 15 British sailors and held them for nearly two weeks .
The 15 sailors from HMS Cornwall , including one woman , were captured on March 23 .
Iran claims the crew , operating in a small patrol craft , had intruded into Iranian waters  a claim denied by Britain .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate John McCain accused North Carolina ’s Republican Party of being “ out of touch with reality ” over its refusal to pull an advertisement criticizing Democrat Barack Obama .
In an NBC interview aired on Friday , the Arizona senator said he has done all he can to persuade the state party to cancel the television ad that criticizes Obama as “ too extreme ” because of controversial remarks made by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
“ They ’re not listening to me because they ’re out of touch with reality and the Republican Party .
We are the party of Abraham Lincoln , Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and this kind of campaigning is unacceptable , ” McCain told NBC ’s “ Today ” Show .
“ I ’ve done everything that I can to repudiate and to see that this kind of campaigning does not continue , ” he added .
Asked if the state party ’s unwillingness to heed his call raised questions about his leadership , McCain replied : “ I do n’t know exactly how to respond to that . ”
North Carolina is one of two states holding the next crucial Democratic primaries on May 6 in the tight race between Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton to oppose McCain in the November presidential election .
Obama , an Illinois senator who would be the first black U.S. president , has come under fire for attending Wright ’s church in Chicago where the fiery black preacher made a number of racially charged statements about the United States .
Wright , who is now retired , said in a PBS interview that people are trying to paint him as “ some kind of fanatic . ”
The McCain campaign said it had been assured that North Carolina Republicans would withdraw the TV ad , scheduled to air early next week .
But the state party served notice that the ad would air .
On Friday , a YouTube.com version appeared on the party ’s Web site at www.ncgop.org with an invitation for visitors to contribute money .
The violence comes amid speculation of an Egyptian - brokered ceasefire
Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip have killed a total of four people , Palestinian medical workers say .
Medics say an aircraft - fired missile hit a group of children near Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza , decapitating a boy , 13 , and wounding two others .
Palestinian militants had launched rockets into Israel from the same spot 20 minutes earlier , eyewitnesses said .
In a second strike , a missile was fired at Palestinians planting explosives , the Israeli military said .
Muawiya Hassanein , the head of Gaza emergency services , said a Palestinian man , Ali al - Dahduh , 32 , was killed .
Hamas said two of its fighters had been killed and one wounded in a third Israeli attack , on the south side of Gaza City .
The Israeli military confirmed its aircraft targeted a group of armed men in that area .
Israel missiles strikes and land raids into the Gaza Strip have killed at least 14 Palestinians , two of them civilians , in the past two weeks .
Palestinian rocket fire has killed two Israeli civilians in the same period .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Jerusalem says there is growing speculation that Egypt may be close to brokering a ceasefire between Israel and the militant Hamas movement .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said on a trip to Cairo on Monday that any deal had to involve the release of the captured soldier , Gilad Shalit .
Hamas , which has been in control in Gaza since last June , has in the past said it wants the ceasefire to include a lifting of Israeli sanctions on Gaza .
Hamas officials are now in Egypt and are due to issue a statement later on Tuesday .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Honesty is not the best policy , especially when it comes to bad dates or the dreaded “ do I look fat in this ” question from a partner , a new survey showed on Friday .
One in two American men and women have told a lie to get out of a date , while 32 percent of men and 43 percent of women have given a fake phone number to someone they were not interested in , according to the Harlequin Romance Report 2008 .
“ What we discovered ... is that at the heart of every confession lies the truth about who we are , ” Katherine Orr and Marleah Stout , editors - in - chief of the report , said in a statement .
When it comes to giving an opinion on whether your partner looks fat in an outfit , 61 percent of men and 50 percent of women approved of lying , while 63 percent of men and women said that in general lies were sometimes alright .
Toronto - based Harlequin Enterprises -- best known for publishing romance novels -- surveyed 2,000 men and women online from the United States and Canada .
The report also found that 46 percent of men and 45 percent of women thought a lie was not harmful if a person did n’t have anything nice to say about a friend ’s significant other .

Und wenn es sich um ein kabelloses Modell handelt , können Sie mit demselben Werkzeug Löcher bohren und Schrauben antreiben – und müssen sich keine Sorgen machen , eine Steckdose in der Nähe der Arbeit zu finden , um den Bohrer anzutreiben .
Die gute Nachricht : Es gibt Hunderte dieser Bohrer auf dem Markt .
Die schlechte Nachricht :
Es ist nicht immer klar , über welche Übungen Sie nachdenken sollten .
DER GRIFF an einem Akku- Bohrschrauber ist entweder ein Pistolengriff oder ein T - Griff .
Der T - Griff ist am bequemsten für allgemeine Bohr - und Antriebsschrauben .
Leistung
Bei Akku- Bohrern wird die Leistung in Batteriespannung gemessen .
Höhere Spannung bedeutet mehr Drehmoment - Spinn - Stärke , um den Widerstand zu überwinden .
In den letzten zehn Jahren ist die Spitzenspannung von 9,6 auf 18 V gestiegen , aber die Modellpalette umfasst 6 , 7,2 , 9,6 , 12 , 14,4 und 18 V. Heutige Hochspannungsbohrer haben genug Kraft , um große Löcher in Rahmenholz und Bodenbelag zu bohren .
Das ist beeindruckende Muskeln .
Aber der Kompromiss für die Macht ist Gewicht .
Ein typischer 9.6V - Bohrer wiegt 3 1/2 lbs , während ein 18 V - Modell bis zu 10 lbs wiegt .
Griffe Bevor die Akku- Bohrschrauber kamen , hatten die meisten Bohrer Pistolengriffe , wobei sich der Griff wie der Griff einer Pistole hinter dem Motor befand .
Die meisten kabellosen Modelle von heute sind jedoch mit einem T - Griff ausgestattet : Die Griffbasis flammt auf , um ein Verrutschen der Hand zu verhindern und eine Batterie unterzubringen .
Da die Batterie unter dem Gewicht und der Masse des Motors zentriert ist , sorgt ein T - Griff für eine bessere Gesamtbalance , insbesondere bei schwereren Bohrern .
Außerdem können T - Griff - Bohrer oft in engere Räume gelangen , da Ihre Hand in der Mitte des Bohrers nicht im Weg ist .
Aber beim schweren Bohren und Fahren großer Schrauben lässt sich mit einem Pistolengriff ein höherer Druck ausüben – fast direkt hinter dem Bohrer – und Sie können mehr Kraft auf die Arbeit ausüben .
Kupplung
Eine verstellbare Kupplung trennt elektrische Bohrmaschinen von Akku-Bohrschraubern .
Direkt hinter dem Futter positioniert die Kupplung die Antriebswelle der Bohrmaschine und macht ein Klicken , wenn ein voreingestellter Widerstandswert erreicht ist .
Das Ergebnis ist , dass der Motor noch dreht , aber der Schraubendreher nicht .
Warum braucht ein Bohrer eine Kupplung ?
Es gibt Ihnen die Kontrolle , so dass Sie keine Schraube abziehen oder es überstürzen , sobald es gemütlich ist .
Es hilft auch , den Motor zu schützen , wenn beim Antreiben einer Schraube oder Festziehen einer Schraube viel Widerstand erreicht wird .
Die Anzahl der separaten Kupplungseinstellungen variiert je nach Bohrer . bessere Bohrer haben mindestens 24 Einstellungen .
Mit diesen vielen Kupplungseinstellungen können Sie die Leistung , die ein Bohrer liefert , wirklich fein abstimmen .
Einstellungen mit den niedrigsten Nummern sind für kleine Schrauben , höhere Nummern sind für größere Schrauben .
Die meisten Kupplungen haben auch eine Bohreinstellung , die es dem Motor ermöglicht , das Bit mit voller Leistung anzutreiben .
Geschwindigkeit
Die billigsten Bohrer laufen mit einer einzigen Geschwindigkeit , aber die meisten haben zwei feste Geschwindigkeiten : 300 U / min und 800 U / min .
Mit einem Schiebeschalter oder Trigger können
Sie eine hohe oder niedrige Geschwindigkeit auswählen .
Diese Bohrer sind ideal für die meisten leichten Einsätze .
Die niedrige Geschwindigkeit ist zum Schrauben , die hohe Geschwindigkeit zum Bohren von Löchern .
Für anspruchsvollere Zimmer - und Reparaturarbeiten wählen Sie eine Bohrmaschine mit dem gleichen zweistufigen Schalter und einem Trigger mit variabler Geschwindigkeitssteuerung , mit der Sie die Geschwindigkeit von 0 U / min bis zum oberen Ende jedes Bereichs variieren können .
Und wenn Sie mehr Löcher bohren als Schrauben , dann suchen Sie nach mehr Geschwindigkeit – 1.000 U / min oder höher – am oberen Ende .
Batterien und Ladegeräte
Nickel - Metall - Hydrid ( NiMH ) - Batterien sind der neueste Durchbruch bei Batterien .
Sie sind kleiner und länger als Standard - Nickel - Cadmium ( Nicad ) - Batterien .
NiMH-Batterien stellen auch eine geringere Gefahr bei der Entsorgung dar als Nicad , da sie kein Cadmium enthalten , das hochgiftig ist .
Makita , Bosch , Hitachi und DeWalt bieten NiMH-Batterien an , und bald werden auch andere Hersteller diese Leistungszellen produzieren .
Alle Akku- Bohrschrauber sind mit einem Ladegerät ausgestattet , das Wiederaufladezeiten von 15 Minuten bis zu drei Stunden umfasst .
Aber schneller ist nicht unbedingt besser .
Ein Auftragnehmer kann auf schnelle Wiederaufladungen angewiesen sein , aber ein langsameres Aufladen ist in der Regel kein Problem zu Hause , besonders wenn Sie zwei Batterien haben .
Darüber hinaus gibt es Nachteile beim Schnellladen .
Eine schnelle Wiederaufladung kann eine Batterie beschädigen , indem sie übermäßige Hitze erzeugt , es sei denn , es handelt sich um eine speziell entwickelte Einheit .
Wenn
Sie schnell aufladen möchten , sollten Sie ein Werkzeug von Makita , Hitachi oder Panasonic verwenden , dessen “ intelligente ” Ladegeräte mit Temperatursensoren und Rückkopplungsschaltkreisen ausgestattet sind , die die Batterien schützen .
Diese Einheiten liefern eine Ladung in nur neun Minuten ohne Batterie Schaden .

A United Nations investigator released a preliminary report last week citing widespread civilian deaths in Afghanistan , often at the hands of unaccountable units led by the CIA or other foreign intelligence agencies .
The investigator is Philip Alston , a New York University professor serving as the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution .
His report provides a partial glimpse into the illegal actions of intelligence agencies , occupying forces , and Afghan police , as they seek to repress opposition to the US - led occupation and US - backed government .
A more detailed final report will be released later this year .
Alston focused on civilian killings by US and other international military forces , citing 200 reported deaths in the first four months of 2008 .
This figure , however , was based on tabulations by the United Nations and other international organizations , and is undoubtedly a serious underestimation .
In addition to civilians killed in air raids — often targeted indiscriminately at civilian dwellings —
Alston reported on “ a number of raids for which no state or military command appears ready to acknowledge responsibility . ”
In a press conference on Thursday , Alston elaborated , saying , “ I have spoken with a large number of people in relation to the operation of foreign intelligence units .
I do n’t want to name them but they are the most senior level of the relevant places .
These forces operate with what appears to be impunity . ”
The location of the incidents cited in the report indicate that the intelligence agencies in question include the CIA or US Special Operations Forces .
The report cited a few incidents as examples of extra-judicial killings .
In January 2008 , two brothers were killed in Kandahar province in a raid led by “ international personnel . ”
Alston found that the victims “ are widely acknowledged , even by well - informed Government officials , to have had no connection to the Taliban , and the circumstances of their deaths are suspicious .
However , not only was I unable to get any international military commander to provide their version of what took place , but I was unable to get any international military commander to even admit that their soldiers were involved . ”
Other incidents involved raids by Afghans led by unnamed “ international intelligence services ” out of bases in both Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces .
“ It is absolutely unacceptable for heavily - armed internationals accompanied by heavily - armed Afghan forces to be wandering around conducting dangerous raids that too often result in killings without anyone taking responsibility for them , ” the report stated .
The British Independent newspaper provided some additional information .
It noted , “ A Western official close to the investigation said the secret units are still known as Campaign Forces , from the time when American Special Forces and CIA spies recruited Afghan troops to help overthrow the Taliban during the US - led invasion in 2001 .
‘ The brightest , smartest guys in these militias were kept on , ’ the official said .
‘ They were trained and rearmed and they are still being used . ’”
The Independent went on to cite one incident involving British forces .
“ In Helmand , where most of Britain ’s 7,800 troops are based , Special Forces were accused of slitting a man ’s throat in a botched night raid last year .
Security sources now claim the operation was mounted by a secret spy unit . ”
Alston also reported on the actions of Afghan police .
“ They function not as enforcers of law and order , but as promoters of the interests of a specific tribe or commander , ” he reported .
He cited one incident in which Afghan police massacred a group from a rival tribe .
There was no investigation by the government or the occupying forces .
In another incident , police killed nine and wounded 42 unarmed protestors in Sheberghan in May 2007 .
In general , he found little to no interest among US or Afghan officials in monitoring or following up on civilian deaths .
“ The level of complacency in response to these killings is staggeringly high , ” he said .
At the press conference , he noted , “ When I asked for the number of reported civilian casualties over the past year or so , I was told that those figures are either not available in Afghanistan — which I was told by several senior military people — or that they are secret and cannot be provided to me .
When I asked for the results of certain cases , to ascertain whether those involved have been punished , I was told that no such information is available here in Afghanistan and that perhaps I should read the newspapers of the countries concerned . ”
The fact that the CIA is involved in covert operations in Afghanistan is neither new nor surprising .
Already by the 1970s , the CIA had developed ties to sections of the Afghan population , and in particular Islamic fundamentalist elements , in an effort to undermine the Soviet - backed government .
Later , the CIA was heavily involved in developing ties to anti-Taliban warlords prior to the US invasion and occupation in 2001 .
Following the invasion , Afghanistan — and in particular the Bagram Air Force Base near Kabul — became a transit point for prisoners captured by the United States and destined for Guantánamo Bay , secret CIA prisons , or US - allied countries that practice torture .
US intelligence agencies were reportedly also involved in the interrogation of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
In 2005 , US media reported on the operations of US - backed deaths squads in Iraq , deployed to kill suspected opponents of the US occupation .
Yasser Salihee , a special correspondent for news agency Knight Ridder who was investigating the death squads , was killed with a bullet to the head in June of that year .
Separate reports related how the US military had modeled Iraqi units on the death squads deployed in Central America during the 1980s to eliminate left - wing opposition to US policies .
While most of the CIA ’s actions remain shrouded in secrecy , one CIA contractor was prosecuted for torturing an Afghan prisoner to death in 2003 .
The contractor , David Passaro , interrogated and beat the prisoner , Abdul Wali , for two days , injuring him so severely that he died two days later .
In a separate development , the New York Times reported on Saturday that the Pentagon is moving forward with the construction of a 40 - acre prison complex at the Bagram military base .
The current prison , as well as separate prisons run by the Afghans and by the US , are reportedly insufficient to hold the massive number of individuals swept up by the occupying forces .
The facility may also be used for prisoners currently detained in Guantánamo Bay .
It will be designed to hold as many as 1,100 people .

They call it the O - Factor : the power to make or break , to change lives , to sell millions of books , and to exercise a magnetic pull on the hearts , minds and wallets of middle America .
For Oprah Winfrey , it is the intangible quality that brought her fame , made her fortune , and turned her into perhaps the most influential woman on the planet .
So it is with a slight sense of disbelief that some in the US have begun to wonder whether the magicO - Factor could be on the wane .
How can a country that has embraced Oprah for so long , and turned her into a living embodiment of the American Dream , now explain a slow decline that has apparently begun to tarnish her glittering multimedia empire ?
Look at the figures : this week , it emerged that average audiences for The Oprah Winfrey Show have fallen by nearly 7 per cent in 2008 , its third straight year of decline .
From a peak of nearly nine million in 2004 , the afternoon chat show 's viewing figures are hovering perilously close to the psychologically - crucial seven million mark .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Then there 's the failure of Oprah 's Big Give , a prime - time philanthropy show that was launched with huge fanfare before Christmas , only to mislay nearly a third of its audience during an eight - week run .
A mooted second series , again on the mass - market channel ABC , has been abandoned .
Or what about the slow decline of O , the Oprah magazine ?
Its circulation has fallen more than 10 per cent in the past three years , to 2.4 million .
At the Chicago headquarters of Harpo , Winfrey 's global business ( its name is Oprah , spelled backwards ) , they are now seeking a new editor - in - chief after the departure of the longstanding incumbent , Amy Gross .
Talk of terminal crisis may be premature but one thing 's for sure : the universal adulation that turned Oprah into the most popular TV host in history is no more .
At 54 , her longstanding Midas touch is vanishing , fast .
" What we are seeing is a natural saturation .
For years , everything in Oprah 's empire was growing but now there 's a natural scaling - back , " said Janice Peck , an associate professor of mass communication at the University of Colorado , and author of The Age of Oprah , a book about Winfrey 's cultural influence .
" She has a new network , a new reality show , and a satellite radio channel , on top of the book club , the magazine , the website , and the rest of this empire .
Maybe that 's too much Oprah for people .
" Her audiences are getting older , young people are not gravitating to her , and she herself is getting older .
Numbers are down across the TV industry , and if you look at what 's happening to Oprah in particular , we may be at a tipping point : back as recently as 2005 , she was solid gold , and everything she touched made money ; now I think she realises that the sky is no longer the limit . "
Commentators say the rot really set in last October .
That was when the first lady of daytime TV – in her debut dalliance with the political arena – announced that she would be rejecting a grass - roots campaign to make her president .
Instead , she would be endorsing a new favourite of hers , the Senator from Illinois , Barack Obama , at that point considered a rank outsider for the White House .
That decision irritated some of the same middle - class white female constituency who make up the bulk both of her television audience and Hillary Clinton 's supporters .
After Winfrey appeared with Mr Obama in Iowa and South Carolina , they began bombarding the message boards of oprah.com , her official internet site , accusing her of betraying her sex .

" Celebrities have always been fantasy figures .
As long as you can remain that way , then people can view you any way you like , but as soon as you talk politics , then you become just another political actor , and that can make people angry , " said Steven J Ross , an expert on Hollywood and politics from the University of Southern California .
" You go back to the days of Sid Grauman , whose Chinese Theatre was huge in Hollywood in the early 1900s .
He used to warn his stars to keep their mouths shut about politics , because as soon as you endorse someone , then you alienate about 50 per cent of your audience . "
Another hefty chunk of middle America who Oprah has recently succeeded in upsetting is the evangelical Christian movement , who are troubled by her recent drift towards alternative spiritualism .
In particular , they dislike Kathy Freston , a self - styled " conscious living counsellor " who appears across the Winfrey network , and is responsible , among other things , for a 21 - day vegan detox plan which Oprah began last week .
Religious critics have now dubbed Oprah , who has previously made much of her own Christianity , the " queen of new age gurus " .
They say Freston 's teaching about the power of prayer and meditation – which she claims will lead to a state of " quantum wellness " – represents a heretical endorsement of false doctrines .
The backlash is all the more noisy because to many of her biggest fans , Oprah has always represented a living example of the American Dream .
Born into poverty in Mississippi in 1954 , she overcame almost every conceivable disadvantage to become the woman Vanity Fair once described as having " more influence on the culture than any university , president , politician or religious leader , except perhaps the Pope . "
Despite being raised in a broken home , subjected to repeated sexual abuse from family members ( she was raped at the age of nine ) , and having given birth at 14 to a son who died during infancy , she studied hard and eventually won a scholarship to Tennessee State University .
From there , she began a career in television journalism .
At 19 , Oprah became both the youngest news anchor and first black female newsreader at the Nashville station WLAC , before moving to Baltimore and , in 1984 , to Chicago where her emotional brand of seemingly ad - lib delivery landed her the presenter 's job on the sofa of a struggling morning chat show .
By 1986 , the show had been expanded , moved to a more prominent time - slot and syndicated nationally .
Its selling point , so to speak , was the host 's ability to turn everyday subjects ( her first ever show was about marrying the right person ) into compulsive viewing .
As Time magazine , which has included her in its annual " 100 most influential people " list more times than any other individual , once wrote : " Guests often find themselves revealing things they would not imagine telling anyone , much less a national TV audience .
It is the talk show as a group - therapy session . "
But for all the broadcasting milestones under Oprah 's belt – who can forget Tom Cruise 's bizarre sofa - jumping declaration of love for Katie Holmes on her show in 2005 ?
– her appeal is n't just about unmissable TV .
Instead , Oprah 's empowering " strong woman " philosophy , and ability to encourage guests to reveal more of their inner self than perhaps they might have wished have , over the years , helped her create a lucrative global brand .
Not only does she own important TV and film production firms , she has also become one of the most powerful people in publishing .
Her book club has scored some notable literary " scoops " , once enticing the author of To Kill a Mockingbird , Harper Lee , out of hiding .
Like all empires under threat , the Oprah machine was playing hardball in reaction to claims that she 's lost her mojo yesterday .
Although a spokesman said that Winfrey herself was unavailable for comment , Harpo 's president Tim Bennett told The New York Times that all aspects of her business were thriving and that the audience for her daytime talk show remains roughly one - third larger than that of its closest rival , Dr Phil , featuring Phil McGraw .
Any drop in her television ratings can be traced to general weakness in the overall television audience , rather than hostility related to her stance on political or personal matters , he said , denying claims that she 's become over - exposed : " Stations pay us a lot of money for that show , and if they felt she was doing anything that was diminishing the mother lode , we would get a call saying , ' Enough ' .
" We did n't hear one iota of feedback ...
I 've never witnessed someone more in touch with the audience she serves .
She paces herself very well . "
Robert Madden of CBS Television Distribution , which syndicates The Oprah Winfrey Show , said he was unworried by declining ratings .
" It has been the No 1 talk show for 471 consecutive weeks , " he said .
" That 's a good barometer if her show is in trouble or not , and obviously if you 're No 1 , you 're not in trouble . "
" Despite everything , " added Steven J Ross , " there is still only one celebrity in existence who can possibly influence a US election , and that celebrity is Oprah Winfrey .
So perhaps her decline is not the big story today .
Perhaps her remaining influence is . "

Now that you have heat treated the bamboo you need , cut , miter and tack the frame together .
You may choose to use a jig to hold everything in place .
I did not use a jig so I am not going to go into that here .
I do n't know much about jigs so do n't even ask .
I used the full size drawing and built directly off of that using spacers and standoffs to get everything in the right position .
Use a good half - round wood rasp to miter the joints .
Make sure that you use trigonometry to figure out the length of the chain stays and seat stays .
What is drawn on the paper is a projected view .
Rough up the bamboo where the epoxy will go .
Rough up the metal too and stick it all together using 5 minute epoxy or your favorite glue .
Once it is all stuck together very gently put the wheels and fork in place and check alignment .
If it looks good you are ready to move to move to the next step .
If not
Note :
The bamboo headset shown was not a good idea .
I had to ream it out and insert a steel head tube because the headset cups did not seat properly in the bamboo and gave a scary wobble when turning corners !
Start with a metal head tube and save yourself the hassle .
The picture does show how rough your bamboo joint areas should be .
Hundreds of janitors demanding a wage increase and better health benefits walked off their jobs at some of Silicon Valley ’s largest high technology companies Tuesday in a strike that organizers said will continue through the week .
The janitors went on strike after contract discussions ended last Thursday between the Services Employees International Union – which represents 6,000 janitors – and the Bay Area Maintenance Contractors , representing 15 contractors who provide janitorial services to local companies .
“ The strike is for me , my co-workers , for life and respect , ” said Elsa Guich , 62 , one of about 100 janitors who walked off at Cisco ’s North San Jose offices early Tuesday .
“ The company does n’t understand that we work hard .
They need to understand . ”
Many Bay Area companies like Cisco and Hewlett - Packard hire contractors who employ janitors like Guich to clean their buildings .
A master contract with 15 companies represented by Bay Area Maintenance Contractors expired April 30 .
After labor talks ended last Thursday , the union rejected what was described as the contractors ’ “ final offer . ”
Janitors at Cisco , HP , Oracle , Yahoo and eight other work sites went on strike .
Officials with Cisco and HP said the strike has not affected their operations .
In striking , SEIU is attempting to make its case directly with the companies , as it bids for higher wages and improved health benefits .
But the companies seem to be resisting that effort .
“ This is a contract dispute between our supplier , SBM , and the union , ” said HP spokesman Ryan Donovan .
“ We hope for a rapid resolution between the two parties . ”
Guich , an immigrant from Peru , has worked for GCA Services cleaning at Cisco for eight years .
She makes about $ 11 an hour , about $ 2 less than her counterparts in Los Angeles , and $ 7 less than San Francisco janitors , according to the SEIU .
The cleaning contractors offered an average of 40 cents an hour increase , said Mike Garcia , SEIU president .
The union also is seeking to eliminate a requirement that new employees wait two and half years before they can obtain health benefits for family members .
“ The janitors feel like they ’re being short changed , ” Garcia said .
What the cleaning contractors offered , he said , “ does not remedy the reality of life for many workers .
They felt insulted and rejected . ”
Jim Beard , chief negotiator for the cleaning contractors , said he offered SEIU a 50 cent hourly wage increase for the first year of a four - year contract .
Declining to give specifics , he said contractors offered a 20 percent overall increase – combining wages and benefits – for the four - year period .
“ It ’s disappointing that this is happening , ” said Beard .
“ And we ’re disappointed they want more . ”
Ayro was never seen at a public gathering and avoided interviews
The US military has confirmed that it carried out a pre-dawn missile strike which killed a senior leader of an Islamist militant group in Somalia .
A spokesman said the target of the attack in the town of Dusamareb was an al - Qaeda leader , but would not name him or say whether it had been successful .
The strike hit the home of Aden Hashi Ayro , the military head of al - Shabab , which controls much of Somalia .
At least 10 other people , including another al - Shabab leader , also died .
But local elders have said up to 30 bodies have been recovered from the scene , according to unconfirmed reports .
' Militia leader '
Speaking to reporters on Thursday , the US Central Command confirmed it had attacked al - Qaeda militants in Somalia , but would not say whether it was an air strike nor name the intended target .
" It was an attack .
If we say too much then we give away platforms and things that we use , " CentCom spokesman Bob Prucha told the Associated Press .
This incident will cause a lot problems to US interests in the region and the governments who support the US , by that I mean its allies who are puppets
Mukhtar Robow Adumansur
Al - Shabab spokesman
Profile : Somalia 's Islamic ' lads ' Q&A : Somali conflict
" It was an attack against a known al - Qaeda target and militia leader in Somalia , " he added , giving no further details .
An al - Shabab spokesman , Mukhtar Robow Adumansur , told the BBC that Ayro was killed along with another senior leader , Muhiyadin Muhammad Umar .
Considered a terrorist group by the US , al - Shabab began as the youth and military wing of the Somali Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) , which controlled much of southern and central Somalia in 2006 .
When , at the end of that year , the UIC was driven from power by Ethiopian troops supporting the country 's transitional government , al - Shabab melted away into remote and distant parts of the country .
It has since re-emerged as a radicalised group of young fighters , who have been conducting an insurgency against the government and its Ethiopian allies , and attacking African Union peacekeepers .
The US has said al - Shabab is part of the al - Qaeda network , although analysts say it is impossible to accurately establish those links .
Al - Shabab 's leaders insist it is a purely Somali movement .
Ayro , its military commander , received training in Afghanistan in the 1990s and was an instrumental military figure as the UIC took control of Mogadishu .
The head of the BBC's Somali Service , Yusuf Garaad , says Ayro was considered by fellow militants as a soldier rather than a politician .
He never addressed a rally , was never seen at a public gathering and did not like to give interviews either , our correspondent says .
But his name came into the public domain few years ago when a group of Somali warlords co-operating with Western intelligence agencies stormed his house in the capital .
Two men were kidnapped from the house , but Ayro escaped unhurt .
He also escaped a US air strike near the southern port of Kismayo a year ago with only a minor injury .

The US military is believed to have used a combination of human informants on the ground and precision - guided missiles fired from offshore in the Indian Ocean .
Locals said the missiles hit Ayro 's home at about 0300 ( 0000 GMT ) .
" We heard a huge explosion and when we ran out of our house we saw balls of smoke and flames coming out of house , " Dusamareb resident Nur Geele told the BBC .
The house that was attacked was a small concrete villa and it has been destroyed - the sight is quite horrific
Dr Ahmed Mahdi
Dusamareb Hospital
" The house was totally destroyed to the ground , also other houses nearby , " local elder Ahmed Mumin Jama said .
Dr Ahmed Mahdi at Dusamareb Hospital told the BBC he was treating eight civilians , including women and children , for burns and shrapnel wounds .
" The house that was attacked was a small concrete villa and it has been destroyed , " he said .
" The adjacent houses which were made from traditional mud were also destroyed .
The sight is quite horrific . "
One of the women has since died , bringing the death toll so far to 11 .
An al - Shabab spokesman warned that there would now be revenge attacks .
" This incident will cause a lot problems to US interests in the region and the governments who support the US , by that I mean its allies who are puppets , " Mr Robow told the BBC , referring to Ethiopia which backs Somalia 's interim government .
" I am letting the citizens of the US and the allies know they are not going to be safe in this area . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Prices of U.S. single - family homes plunged a record 14.4 percent in March from a year earlier , while consumer confidence slumped to its lowest in 16 years in May as gasoline prices surged .
The Standard & Poor ’s / Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas released on Tuesday showed prices of previously owned homes fell 2.2 percent in March , deepening their year - on - year decline .
Separately , the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slumped to 57.2 this month from 62.8 in April as rising gasoline costs and falling home prices made Americans increasingly nervous both about current conditions and the future .
In one positive sign , however , the Commerce Department said sales of newly constructed single - family homes rose in April for the first time in six months , while the inventory of unsold new homes declined for the 12th straight month .
But the previous month ’s decline was even steeper than first reported .
“ In terms of prognosis , there remains no reason for the situation to stabilize and every reason for it to continue to deteriorate yet further with price declines accelerating , ” said BNP Paribas economist Richard Iley , referring to the record declines in the S&P report .
Prices of U.S. Treasury securities fell on Tuesday , weighed by ongoing concerns about inflation amid persistently high energy prices .
U.S. stocks ended higher with the Dow Jones industrial average up 68 points .
The dollar rose against major currencies .
Falling home prices have led to a wave of foreclosures that is expected to grow worse before it gets better .
The crisis in foreclosures , which pressure prices even lower , has spurred plans by regulators and lawmakers to keep borrowers in their homes by forgiving a portion of their loan principal .
Housing markets that grew the most during the housing boom , such as Las Vegas , Nevada and Miami , Florida , are leading the decline , S&P said .
A separate S&P index of prices in 10 metropolitan areas declined 2.4 percent in March for a record 15.3 percent year - over - year drop .
“ The key to any degree of stabilization in the house market is , of course , the balance between supply and demand , specifically a reduction in the unprecedented inventory overhang that is pressuring prices lower , ” Iley said .

NEW HOME SALES RISE
The Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose 3.3 percent in April to a 526,000 annual rate .
However , they were down 42 percent from a year ago , the largest year - over - year drop in nearly 27 years .

While April ’s sales gain was the first since October , it followed a drop in March that was much sharper than previously reported .
Sales in March fell 11 percent ; a month ago the department had said they were off just 8.5 percent .
“ It is premature to call the bottom for housing , ” said Ken Mayland , economist with ClearView Economics , near Cleveland .
Despite the lingering weakness in sales , the report showed a sharp pullback in construction activity by builders was helping to reduce the backlog of homes on the market .
The inventory of homes available for sale at the end of April fell 2.4 percent to 456,000 , the 12th straight monthly decline .
That represents 10.6 months ’ supply at April ’s sales pace , down from 11.1 months ’ worth in March .
The housing market has been one factor weighing on consumer confidence .
The Conference Board ’s gauge of sentiment has dropped by almost half since July , when housing troubles triggered the most severe credit crisis in at least a decade .
Consumers this month grew both more worried about what is happening now and about the future .
The present situation index dropped to 74.4 from 81.9 , while the expectations barometer fell to 45.7 from 50.0 .
Inflation expectations rose to an all - time high 7.7 percent , well above April ’s 6.8 percent , the Conference Board said .

The girl emerged from her house with a mobile phone glued to her ear and a cigarette hanging out of her mouth .
Her friends take the mickey out of her , we learn from her sister 's MySpace internet page , because she is never out of " a chav T - shirt and tracksuit bottoms " - and she did n't disappoint yesterday .
Even so , it does n't pay to get on the wrong side of this 14 - year - old , who plays for a local girls ' football team and weighs in at around 13 stone .

Wild : A teenage member of a girl gang
Someone who did is retired school teacher Beryl Barber .
The pensioner was walking along the pavement near her home in Selby , North Yorkshire , recently when she was confronted by the girl in question and her " mates " .
The gang ( three girls , two boys ) fancied the odds : five of them versus one defenceless 72 - year - old woman .
They began hurling stones at Mrs Barber .
She could have turned away , and many in her position would have done .
Instead , however , she picked up one of the stones and threw it back .
The retaliation was swift and sadistic .
Suddenly , the girl rushed towards Mrs Barber and pushed her into the path of an oncoming car which had to brake sharply to avoid a collision .
Nevertheless , Mrs Barber fell with such force that , in the words of an eye - witness , " her face literally bounced off the pavement , skidding across the tarmac . "
Mrs Barber suffered a broken nose and two black eyes , and was left looking like the girl had played football - with her head .
The girl 's motive , according to the police , was to make her " look good " in front of her group ; to gain " respect " .
It is a word that features prominently in the street lingo of such youngsters , and never was it more misplaced .
The girl , the second of three children who lives with her parents on the outskirts of Selby , was given a 12 - month referral order when she appeared before magistrates in March ; the equivalent , many might think , of a " slap on the wrist " .
Under the terms of the order she has to attend a course in anger management .
That is as much as we are allowed to tell you about her , because in the eyes of the law she is still a juvenile .
Mrs Barber , for her part , was too scared to come to the door when we called at her bungalow .
This is the reality behind a Home Office report this week which revealed that crimes committed by girls as young as ten have soared by 25 per cent in three years .
The statistics mask an even more disturbing trend .
Many of these feral females are involved in gangs .
Be they all - girl gangs , mixed gangs ( like the one which targeted Beryl Barber ) or male gangs to which they become attached .
Sometimes beneath a cap or a " hoodie " it is hard to tell one sex from another any more - girl from boy , or boy from girl .
Either way , in this Clockwork Orange world , pushing a pensioner into a road , or mugging an innocent passer - by , earns you respect .
Two further incidents in the past few weeks alone highlight the frightening escalation of the kind of female gang violence which , until recently , was presented as an intrinsically male problem .
One was at Shoreham railway station , near Brighton , when about 20 girls - from two rival gangs - fought a pitched battle on the platform with beer bottles and snooker balls wrapped in socks .
Two girls , aged 18 and 20 , have been charged with affray .
The other occurred in the Midlands , where a woman was mercilessly punched , kicked , and stamped on by a mob of teenage girls who , she says , acted " like a pack of wild animals " .
You do not have to grow up on a sink estate , come from a broken home , get excluded from school , be promiscuous , binge drink or play violent computer games to become immersed in this culture .
But - boy or girl - this is more likely if you do .
The most recent Metropolitan Police estimate put the number of gangs in London at 174 , of which at least three were exclusively girls .
But the report concedes : " The actual number could be even greater as this is based purely on police intelligence . "
Among the girl " crews " believed to operating in the capital today are the " Shower Gyals " ( Tottenham ) , PYG ( Peckham ) , identified by black bandanas , and OCS ( Brixton ) , which is said to have members as young as ten .
Last year , a running feud between the PYG and OCS turned into a mass brawl in Camberwell , South London .
Such girls , according to a study to be published by the Centre for Policy Studies next month , routinely carry knives and " are prepared to use them " .
Initiation rites might require a girl to rob or mug .
Casual sex ( " linking " ) is endemic and videos of girls and boys having sex in the stairwells of housing blocks circulate school playgrounds .
London , where the research was conducted , is the norm , not the exception .
In Nottingham there is the NG2 Crew , for example , an all - girl gang named after the postcode which includes the notorious Meadows estate , a crime - ridden warren of dimly - lit council houses .
Becki , 16 , lives with her mother - her father has long since gone - in the area .
Many of her peers come from the Meadows .
Her brother is a drug dealer , selling " skunk " cannabis .
Becki is member of the NG2 .
" I have been part of the crew for six months now , " she said last night .
" It 's like a type of protection .
My mum works all the time [ in a supermarket ] so I hardly ever see her and there is no one at home , so I do n't feel I have anyone looking after me really .
Scroll down for more ...
" I started hanging out with the girls from school and we just decided to form a crew . "
It sounds innocent enough until Becki admits : " It gets serious when arguments start .
One of our girls had a " beef " with another girl from a different area and when that happened we had to protect her and help her to sort it out .
" We went round and beat the other girl up .
We punched her and we also took off our shoes and hit her with them .
It was like a warning really that they should not mess with us .
" A lot of rows are over boys , or it's name - calling and girls showing us disrespect .
" We stand up for one another .
It 's like having a big family .
You feel safe .
You can go anywhere as long as your girls are with you . "
What 's clear is that there has been a dramatic coarsening in the behaviour of an entire underclass of young women - driven partly by the destruction of the nuclear family and the lack of a strong father figure , but also by a celebrity culture in which female so - called " stars " - famous only for appearing on Big Brother or its equivalents - are photographed blind drunk and fighting in the gutter with other women outside nightclubs .
For some young girls , joining a male gang is their way of trying to feel cool , desirable and protected .
The price for such protection - and the material rewards of membership - are high .
Such girls are known as " bitches " .
" In Leeds , every postcode and every little area has its own crew , " says Pat Regan , who runs a Mothers Against Violence group in the city .
" There 's the Hyde Park Crew , the Little London Crew , and the CPT from Chapeltown .
All these gangs have girls in them .
" They see the boys in nice clothes and driving flash cars and they want a part of it .
" But nothing is free .
The girls often have to keep guns and drugs for their so - called boyfriends , who will usually have several girls on the go , and they end up with the convictions when they are caught . "
Violence , in one way or another , defines these girls .
The underlying evidence , if anyone cared to look , has been there for some time .
The most common age of a female criminal - calculated from the average age of juvenile females convicted in the courts - has fallen to just 14 .
In the early Nineties , the age was 16 .
Equally disturbing is the shift towards thuggery .
The figures released by the Youth Justice Board on Thursday , as the Mail reported yesterday , show significant increases in assaults , robberies and public order offences .
It was 8 pm on a sunny April evening when Wendy Clarke , a 47 - year - old mother from the Birmingham suburbs , got caught up in this nightmare world .
She had just locked up her tanning salon when she spotted a group of about 20 girls congregating near a bus shelter .
Four of the gang - although she did n't know they were a gang at the time - were sitting near an elderly man on a bench .
" They began taunting him , " says Wendy .
" Grandad " , they called him .
One of the girls then opened his jacket and started rummaging through his pockets .
" Soon they were all over him like a pack of animals and I knew I had to do something . "
She strode over to the group and told them to " back off and leave him alone " .
Almost before the words had left her mouth , one of the girls yanked her by the hair and punched her in the face .
Two others jumped on her back .
Three more joined in and jumped on Wendy 's head when she fell to the ground .
" One minute I was telling them to leave the man alone and the next I was on the floor , " she says .
" During the attack I was aware of more and more girls joining in .
I tried my best to defend myself , but it was useless .
I was completely and utterly helpless .
" All the time they were shouting abuse and baying like savages .
It was absolutely terrifying and I thought it would never end . "
Wendy might not have got out alive if a couple had n't pulled up in their car and run over to help when they realised what was happening , causing Wendy 's attackers to flee .
It would be mistake to think this was a spontaneous , random attack .
True , the girls did not know who their victim was going to be , but they knew they were going to get someone .
They were wearing several layers of clothing so they could change their appearance quickly .
Unfortunately for them , someone followed them to a nearby McDonald 's and dialled 999 .
The girls were in the process of " undressing " when officers arrived .
Ten girls , aged between 14 and 17 , were later arrested and bailed in connection with the attack on Wendy .
Her injuries were so severe that doctors could n't be certain whether her nose had been broken until the swelling had gone down .
" My boyfriend did n't recognise me when he saw me , " she said .
" I have a 15 - year - old daughter and the difference between her and " them ' ' is difficult to comprehend . "
Consider , too , the harrowing experience of an 18 - year - old youth , whom we shall call Ben , who agreed to meet us in a park in Woolwich , South - East London this week .
Ben went to live with foster parents following a deeply troubled upbringing ( his father committed suicide ) which has left him with severe emotional problems .
He is also partially disabled after injuring his legs in a motorbike accident .
All in all , it would be difficult to find a more vulnerable teenager .
Ben , who is slightly built , was walking down the street , near the spot where he is now standing , one day last year when he was ambushed by a gang of five girls .
The girls supplied cannabis to Ben 's cousin .
When his cousin left a drug debt unpaid , they took revenge on Ben instead .
The group , aged 15 and 16 , dragged him into a nearby flat where they stripped him , repeatedly beat him with a broken broom handle , and made him perform sex acts .
They filmed his three - and - a - half hour ordeal on a mobile phone .
" I did not fight back because they were at least five of them and they were stronger than me .
I pleaded with them to stop but they would n't .
I just covered my face . "
Initially , Ben was too embarrassed to go to the police .
" They were girls , after all , " he said .
Had his sister not eventually persuaded him to inform the authorities , his story would have been difficult to believe .
He gave evidence against the gang via video link because he was too embarrassed to face them in court .
The girls were convicted for false imprisonment , assault , and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent .
They were jailed for a total of nine years at Inner London Crown Court .
The judge called the attack " sadistic " and " disgraceful " .
The background of the girls , who again cannot be identified , provides chilling insight into the culture of female violence and girl gangs .
One had a previous conviction for assault .
When she was just 13 she punched another girl in the face , fracturing her cheekbone , leaving her needing a metal plate .
She was skilled in martial arts and her CV included robbery and threatening and abusive behaviour .
Two of her accomplices also had previous convictions for crimes including robbery , assault , and drug offences .
These are the kind of nihilistic , violent crimes , of course , that we used to associate with men not women , boys not girls .
The truth is there is little difference any more - which is perhaps the most shocking indictment of all .
Mr Taylor said he took the drastic action to make a point A man has sawn his car in half with an angle - grinder in protest at it being clamped outside his home .
Ian Taylor , from Tredworth , Glos , said the untaxed Ford Fiesta was parked on his drive with only part of a rear wheel poking out on to the pavement .
The 40 - year - old builder said the vehicle was going to be scrapped anyway , but he wanted to make a point .
A spokesman for NCP Services said half of the car was parked on the road and should therefore have been taxed .
' Jobsworths '
Mr Taylor bought the Fiesta for his stepson with the intention of restoring it , but it was beyond economical repair .
" I told [ my stepson ] not to bother , so we parked it up , we were going to get rid of it .
I came home from work the other day and it'd been clamped , " he said .
Mr Taylor said he made several efforts to explain that the car had a SORN ( Statutory Off Road Notification ) certificate verifying it had not been driven on the road and that it had been parked on his drive .
" We tried to talk to [ NCP ] .
I said , ' you 're not taking it ' .
I got my cutter and cut it in half , " he said .
" [ I 'm ] happy I got one over on them .
They 're jobsworths , for the sake of an inch and a half on the path . "
James Pritchard , communications manager for NCP Services , said clamping staff had photographs to prove that half the car was on the public pavement .
" We were astonished at the reaction this gentleman had to the fact we put a clamp on his car .
Fortunately , the only damage was done to his car and as far as our people are concerned we stand by what they did
James Pritchard , NCP Services
" It was a remarkable incident which highlighted some of the problems my colleagues face while they 're doing what is a very important job in ensuring that motorists tax their vehicle , " he said .
" And in cutting his car in two , he managed to put both himself at risk and also a number of bystanders - along with ourselves , the police had to be called and the fire brigade , as he set fire to the car while cutting it in two .
" Fortunately , the only damage was done to his car and as far as our people are concerned we stand by what they did . "

The MDC says its leader won with just over 50 % of the vote
Scenes in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe 's opposition party says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai has won the presidential election , releasing its own results to back up the claim .
MDC Party Secretary General Tendai Biti said Mr Tsvangirai had won 50.3 % of the vote to President Robert Mugabe 's 43.8 % , so avoiding a run-off .
Results have yet to be officially declared but the state - run Herald newspaper has predicted a run-off .
The ruling Zanu - PF party has dismissed the MDC claim as " wishful thinking " .
Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said it was irresponsible and could incite violence .
Rumours
In his news conference , Mr Biti said there was " anxiety and disappointment " at the failure of the Zimbabwe Election Commission to declare presidential results .
This had produced a vacuum , he said , giving room for all sorts of rumours .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The root cause of all Zimbabwe 's teething problems is Mugabe 's failure to hold free and fair elections Wilbert Mukori But Mr Biti said that if the election commission decided that neither of the main candidates had won outright , the MDC would be prepared to take part in a second round .
According to the MDC 's tally , Simba Makoni , an independent and former Mugabe loyalist , won 7 % .
Despite the MDC 's declaration , the issue of whether Mr Tsvangirai has won more than 50 % remains in dispute .
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network , a coalition of civil society organisations , said earlier that he had won 49 % to Mr Mugabe 's 42 % .
It based its results on a random sample of polling stations .
' Fatally damaged '
In a separate development , a senior Zanu - PF official has told a BBC correspondent in Zimbabwe that he believes Mr Mugabe has been fatally damaged .
The official , who did not want to be identified , said that by not declaring victory on Sunday or Monday , Mr Mugabe had shown weakness .
Now , he told our correspondent , civil servants and police were determined to show even - handedness in their treatment of the Zanu - PF and the opposition .
Earlier , election officials said the verification of results in the presidential election had begun .
They said the process was taking place in the presence of the presidential candidates ' chief polling agents in Harare .
ELECTION RESULTS SO FAR Parliamentary constituencies MDC - Tsvangirai : 96 Zanu-PF : 93 Breakaway MDC faction : 5
Yet to declare : 21 Presidential results
None so far Winner needs more than 50 % to avoid run-off Source : ZEC
Profile : Morgan Tsvangirai
Hope for change in Zimbabwe Zimbabwean voices Zanu - PF has also rejected suggestions that talks have been taking place with the MDC on a possibly handover of power .
MDC sources had earlier told the BBC that the outline of an agreement had nearly been reached for Mr Mugabe to leave office .
In his first public appearance since the election , Mr Tsvangirai told a news conference on Tuesday evening there was " no way the MDC will enter in any deal before ZEC has actually announced the result " .
ELECTION RESULTS FROM MDC Presidential results MDC - Tsvangirai : 50.3 % Zanu - PF - Mugabe : 43.8 % Independent - Makoni : 7 %
In the separate parliamentary race , results released so far show that the MDC has 96 seats , including five for a breakaway faction of the party , against 93 for Zanu - PF , with 21 still to come .
Quoting analysts , the Herald newspaper said on Wednesday that the " pattern of results " indicated by the tight parliamentary race showed a presidential re-run would be necessary .
The Herald is generally seen as reflecting government thinking .
Transparency
While the atmosphere on Zimbabwe 's streets remains peaceful , if tense , there are fears that prolonging the declaration of results could lead to violence .
Roadblocks have been set up around the capital , Harare , and there has been a marked increase in the presence of paramilitary police on the streets of major cities .
ROBERT MUGABE Born : 1924 Trained as a teacher 1961 : Married Ghanaian Sally Hayfron 1964 : Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980 : Wins post - independence elections 1980s : Accusations of atrocities in south - west 1996 : Marries Grace Marufu 2000 : Loses referendum 2000 : Land invasions start 2002 : Wins presidential elections , dismissed by western observers 2008 : Runs for a sixth term as president
Profile : Robert Mugabe
As pressure grew around the world for final results to be declared , United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm .
He urged the " utmost transparency be exercised so that the people of Zimbabwe can have full confidence in the process " .
The White House said it was clear the people of Zimbabwe had " voted for change " .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for the results of the presidential election to be published as soon as possible .
" What we want to see is that the whole of the Zimbabwean people can be guaranteed that the elections are fair and are seen to be fair , and we get the democratic outcome that the people of Zimbabwe have chosen , " he said .
Mr Mugabe , 84 , has not been seen in public since the election but Mr Matonga has denied rumours the president had left the country .
He came to power 28 years ago at independence but in recent years Zimbabwe has been plagued by the world 's highest inflation , as well as acute food and fuel shortages .

What are these ?
Mr. Pielke and his colleagues argue that the best hope for salvation will be investment in new technologies  and that ’s why I asked the climate deniers not to read this column , for it can sound a bit like President Bush ’s “ solution . ”
The difference is that Mr. Bush has used modest investments in hydrogen as a substitute for immediate action , while what we need is vast investments on top of a drive to curb emissions through a carbon tax and a cap - and - trade system .
In the best of worlds , it will be enormously difficult to persuade China and India to rely less on coal - fired power plants , and it will be utterly impossible unless we take serious steps ourselves .
“ The message is , let ’s change light bulbs and let ’s be more efficient , ” Mr. Pielke said .
“ But let ’s do more than that .
The solution lies in transformational technologies . ”
Solar power is one of the most hopeful technologies but still produces about 0.01 percent of U.S. electricity .
The U.S. allocates just $ 159 million for solar research per year  about what we spend in Iraq every nine hours .
Other renewable technologies , including wind power , also merit far more investment ; it ’s appalling that subsidies continue to support oil and coal , and that money should be diverted to renewables .
Since 1979 , U.S. spending on energy research has shrunk by approximately half , taking inflation into account .
Spending on military research , meanwhile , has more than doubled and now amounts to roughly 20 times what is spent on energy research .
Then there is geo-engineering , or tinkering with our planet to overcome our past tinkering .
One proposal is to inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to mimic the effects of volcanic eruptions in cooling the planet .
Another is to fertilize the sea with iron particles to encourage the growth of plants that would suck in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
Then there are more bizarre proposals for giant sunshades to orbit the earth , or for space - based solar panels .
WASHINGTON  Israel , America ’s staunchest ally in the Middle East , just became the latest example of a country that has decided it is better to deal with its foes than to ignore them .
The announcement that Israel has entered into comprehensive peace talks with Syria is at odds with the course counseled by the Bush administration , which initially opposed such talks in private conversations with Israelis , according to Israeli and American officials .
A week ago , President Bush delivered a speech to the Israeli Parliament likening attempts to “ negotiate with the terrorists and radicals ” to appeasement before World War II .
“ We have heard this foolish delusion before , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared , ‘ Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is : the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ”
But in many ways , the Bush administration ’s own policies appear to be at odds with his thesis .
While Mr. Bush and his advisers have repeatedly scorned the idea of talking to enemies without first getting preconditions met , administration policy over the last seven years has been far more nuanced .
In fact , the United States under the Bush administration has shown a sliding definition of just when it is beneficial to talk to whom .

Why do you need a KeyGhost hardware keylogger ?
KeyGhost hardware keyloggers protect computer resources and increase computer security .
Several areas have been identified where a hardware keylogger , like the KeyGhost , is in great demand :
As a key logger tool for computer fraud investigations .
As a monitoring device for detecting unauthorised access .
As a deterrent , to prevent unacceptable use of company resources .
As a back up tool which creates a log of all keystrokes typed on a keyboard .
But I use a software ' key logger ' program ...
Article Over $ 120 billion was lost in the USA due to employee fraud last year .
And this figure is growing .
As a user 's technical knowledge increases and weaknesses in software become well known , software keylogger ( key loggers and keystroke loggers ) become less effective .
If the user is capable of disabling or bypassing the security system ( or manipulating the logs ) , then there is no record of the break - in or what has been done .
Investigations of the computer break - in become very difficult , if not impossible .
In addition , there is the added risk of the log file being stolen and its sensitive contents read .

The Humane Interface Richard Karpinski 11 years , 7 months ago Page history last edited by Jef Raskin wrote " The Humane Interface " about the fundamental issues of interaction design for usability of any computer based system .
A summary of design rules Jef Raskin
The first principle .
When using a product to help you do a task , the product should only help and never distract you from the task .
Definition : A gesture is an action that you finish without conscious thought once you have started it .
Example :
For a beginning typist , typing the letter " t " is a gesture .
For a more experienced typist , typing the word " the " is a gesture .
Commentary .
Designing a human - machine interface demands that both the human and the machine be understood as well as possible .
A understanding of the relevant portions of cognitive psychology , ergonomics , and cognetics is essential .
That is not all that is needed , but it is a prerequisite .
Rule 1 .
An interface should be habituating .
Commentary .
If the interface can be operated habitually then , after you have used it for a while , its use becomes automatic and you can release all your attention to the task you are trying to achieve .
Any interface will have elements that are habituating , but the principle here is to make the entire interface habituating .
Rule 1a .
To make an interface habituating , it must be modeless .
Commentary .
Modes exist where the same gesture yields different results depending on system state at a time when your attention is not on system state .
In the presence of modes , you will sometimes make mode errors , where you make a gesture intending to have one result but get a different and unexpected result , distracting you from your task .
Rule 1b .
To make an interface habituating , it must be monotonous .
Commentary .
" Monotony " here is a technical term meaning that you do not have to choose among multiple gestures to achieve a particular sub-task .
Crudely , there should be only one way to achieve a single - gesture subtask .
The second principle : An interface should be reliable .
Commentary .
Aside from not crashing , the system should never lose any work you have done or any information you have received or retrieved , even if you make a mistake or are forgetful .
This is often not thought of as a property of an interface , but one can build a reliable interface on top of an unreliable system ( of the order of unreliability of todays operating systems ) .
Rule 2 : The system should neither lose your work nor through inaction allow your work to be lost .
The third princple :
An interface should be efficient and as simple as possible .
Commentary .
Time is an irreplaceable asset .
An interface should not take more of your time than is necessary , either in use or in learning .
Rule 3 .
Good engineering practices should be applied to interface design .
Quantitative measures should be used , and an interface should be close to its theoretical minimum in terms of the time it takes to do an operation .
Commentary .
The GOMS model and information theoretic measures of efficiency ( to name two particular techniques among many ) must be mastered and used by interface designers .
Another set of techniques and measures can be used to help judge learnability .
LINK - Where for GOMS ?
The fourth principle :
The suitability of an interface can only be determined by testing .
Commentary .
All of the theory in the world , and the wisest guru , cannot always predict how an interface will work in practice .
One must test , objectively observe , and modify the interface if testing shows that users have difficulties .
It is never the user 's fault , but also remember that people find it difficult to change , so difficulties based on previous habits may not be dispositive .
The fifth principle :
An interface should be pleasant in tone and visually attractive .
Commentary .
How messages are phrased is important , how the interface looks is also important .
But these are of secondary importance in terms of task completion .
When use of the interface has become habitual , these elements go unnoticed .
All of the principles , if followed , create learnable interfaces .
Summary .
An interface should be effective , habituating , reliable , efficient , and tested .
To the extent that doing so does not conflict with these essentials , an interface should also be attractive .

And then there was one .
After Battlestar Galactica revealed the identities of four of the show 's " final five " human - looking Cylons at the end of Season 3 , theories about the last " skin job " burned in fans ' brains .
Season 4 of SciFi Channel 's re-imagined Galactica begins with even more questions and " what the frak ? " moments , and few actual answers about where the show is headed in its final season .
The Cylon revelations in the psychedelic Season 3 finale reinforced the big ideas about religion , war and what it means to be human that have made Battlestar Galactica the smartest science - fiction series on television .
The Season 4 opener explores the same brainy terrain .
Galactica 's unflinching parallels to current events in Iraq – and executive producers Ronald D. Moore 's and David Eick 's skill at crafting meticulously orchestrated cliffhangers – earned the show a prestigious Peabody Award in 2006 and have made it SciFi 's highest - rated original series to date .
There 's a reason for all the accolades : Galactica is top - tier sci- fi television , as gritty and engaging as anything on HBO or at the multiplex .
Wired.com got a sneak peek at " He That Believeth in Me , " the first episode of Season 4 , and offers this ( mostly ) spoiler - free first look at what to expect when Galactica returns today for its final season .
( Editor 's note :
If you have n't seen Season 3 and do n't want any of its plot twists revealed , stop reading now .
Or watch SciFi 's eight - minute video that recaps the major plot points of Seasons 1 through 3 , and get up to speed immediately . )
Frak is back , big time
Characters spew BSG 's signature F word four times in the season opener 's first three minutes .
But do n't expect the Chief to use the expletive any time soon .
Aaron Douglas , the actor who plays Chief Petty Officer Galen Tyrol , told Wired.com that he vows never to utter frak on camera .
Too bad he 's used it at home :
While taking pots out of a kitchen cabinet , Douglas says , some kitchenware fell directly on his foot .
Gut reaction ?
" Frak ! "
Search for Earth continues
The ragged human colonists are still racing the Cylons to find the lost planet Earth , but are they headed the right way ?
Direction home : still unknown .
The look that thrills
Galactica 's cold , deserted - warehouse cinematography remains in focus , sticking to the blue - tinted production values that have elevated the series visually a cut above its cheesier sci- fi brethren .
The show , which won an Emmy Award in 2007 for outstanding visual effects , even got an upgrade : Keep your eyes peeled and you 'll notice that in one scene , Cylon raiders do much more than blow up when shot .
Cylon mania continues
The quartet of Cylons - who - thought - they - were humans are still freaked out after learning their true identities , but at least they 're no longer haunted – for the time being – by that creepy melody they could n't get out of their heads at the end of Season 3 .
Question : If Col . Saul
Tigh is resurrected , will he be reborn with his missing eye intact ?
No losing the religion
Cued by the episode 's title ( " He That Believeth in Me " ) , the deep themes that distinguish Galactica from most genre crap remain in play as religion shifts to the foreground .
And the space opera 's neurotic relationship dynamic still fires on all cylinders in regard to the question , " Is a Cylon just a Cylon if you 've known them all your life ? "
Front - burner stories stay hot
Hot - shot fighter jock Kara " Starbuck " Thrace ( played by Katee Sackhoff ) questions her pretty much unexplainable return .
After all , she blew up her Viper and died during Season 3 , yet here she is in her cockpit beaming like an angel and telling Lee : " I 've been to Earth and I 'm going to take us there . "
Her homecoming ?
Not so upbeat .
Baltar is reborn
Dr. Gaius Baltar ( James Callis ) , who spirited away from outraged citizens after the tribunal 's not - guilty verdict at the end of Season 3 , discovers a community that regards him in an entirely new light .
Raise your tainted Kool - Aid to the doctor with nine lives .
Seven semi-spoilers from the Season 4 opener follow .
Read no further if you 're a purist .
Somebody says : " If I found out you were a Cylon , I 'd put a bullet through your head . "
Somebody wakes up with a naked lover and tries to heal a sick child .
Somebody wakes up President Laura Roslin ( Mary McDonnell ) by aiming a gun at her head .
Somebody appears to shoot Adm. Bill Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) .
Again .
Somebody in manacles says : " I 'm not programmed to think about that . "
Somebody has a new favorite blanky .
Many , many characters hear voices and see things that no one else can hear or see – but then , you knew that .

Review : Razor Slices Smartly Into Battlestar's Past
University of Pittsburgh researchers have discovered that certain organic — or carbon - based — molecules exhibit the properties of atoms under certain circumstances and , in turn , conduct electricity as well as metal .
Detailed in the April 18 edition of Science , the finding is a breakthrough in developing nanotechnology that provides a new strategy for designing electronic materials , including inexpensive and multifunctional organic conductors that have long been considered the key to smaller , cheaper , and faster technologies .
The Pitt team found that the hollow , soccer - ball - shaped carbon molecules known as fullerenes can hold and transfer an electrical charge much like the most highly conductive atoms , explained project head Hrvoje Petek , a professor of physics and chemistry in Pitt ’s School of Arts and Sciences and codirector of Pitt ’s Petersen Institute for NanoScience and Engineering .
The research was performed by Pitt post - doctoral associates Min Feng and Jin Zhao .
When an electron was introduced into a fullerene molecule , the shape of the electron distribution mimicked that of a hydrogen atom or an atom from the alkali metal group , which includes lithium , sodium , and potassium .
Moreover , when two fullerenes were placed next to each other on a copper surface , they showed the electron distribution of their chemical bond and appeared as H 2 , a hydrogen molecule .
The assembly exhibited metal - like conductivity when the team extended it to a wire 1 - molecule - wide .
“ Our work provides a new perspective on what determines the electronic properties of materials , ” Petek said .
“ The realization that hollow molecules can have metal - like conductivity opens the way to develop novel materials with electronic and chemical properties that can be tailored by shape and size . ”
Although the team worked with fullerenes , the team ’s results apply to all hollow molecules , Petek added , including carbon nanotubes — rolled , 1 - atom - thick sheets of graphite 100,000 times smaller than a human hair .
The team ’s research shows promise for the future of electronics based on molecular conductors .
These molecule - based devices surpass the semiconductor and metal conductors of today in terms of lower cost , flexibility , and the ability to meld the speed and power of optics and electronics .
Plus , unlike such inorganic conductors as silicon , molecule - based electronics can be miniaturized to a 1 - dimensional scale ( 1 - molecule - wide ) , which may enable them to conduct electricity with minimal loss and thus improve the performance of an electronic device .
Traditionally , the problem has been that organic conductors have not conducted electrical current very well , Petek said .
The Pitt team ’s discovery could enable scientists to finally overcome that problem , he added .
“ Metal - like behavior in a molecular material — as we have found — is highly surprising and desirable in the emerging field of molecular electronics , ” he said .
“ Our work is a unique example of how nanoscale materials can be used as atom - sized building blocks for molecular materials that could replace silicon and copper in electronic devices , luminescent displays , photovoltaic cells , and other technologies . ”

The report found three of 18 benchmarks had been fully met
Bush on Iraq policy
Political progress in Iraq has been unsatisfactory and violence " remains high " , a report by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) found .
Iraq has met three benchmarks and partially met another four , it says .
The report came as the most senior US commander in Iraq suggested that he may recommend a reduction in troops .
Meanwhile President George W Bush strongly defended his policy in Iraq .
Speaking in Sydney after a meeting with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard , Mr Bush said : " The security situation is changing , so that reconciliation can take place . "
He added that the fact that Iraqi legislature passed 60 pieces of legislation " was illustrative of a government that 's beginning to work " .
The set of 18 political and military goals for Iraq were set by Congress , which asked the GAO to inquire whether they had been met .
Its report issued on Tuesday said Iraq had failed to live up to key targets on reducing sectarian violence and passing laws on oil revenue sharing .
It says militias are still active and the performance of the US - backed Iraqi government has been poor .
" Significant progress has not been made in improving the living conditions of the Iraqis on a day - to - day basis with regard to things that all citizens care about - safe streets , clean water , reliable electricity , a variety of other basic things , " GAO head David Walker said .
" The government is dysfunctional , " he added .
' Corrections '
The GAO findings come a day after President George W Bush visited Iraq 's Anbar province and said his security surge - the injection of an extra 30,000 troops into Iraq - was delivering results .
The report is the first in a series of assessments over the next month on the situation in Iraq and the success of the US troop surge .
Gen Petraeus will report on the security surge next week
The most crucial findings could be the verdicts of General David Petraeus , the commander of US forces in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador to Iraq .
They will deliver a full progress report to Congress next week .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says opponents of war will question the purpose of the surge , if the Iraqis themselves cannot use the breathing space provided by US forces to find long - term solutions .
Meanwhile , General Petraeus has suggested he may recommend a reduction in US troop numbers in Iraq .
In an interview with the US television network ABC , he said there were limits to what the military could do .
The GAO assessment contrasts with a White House study in July which found eight of the key US goals had been fully met .
But Tuesday 's report was slightly more upbeat than leaks had suggested last week , following criticism from the Pentagon .
The draft report said three benchmarks had been met and only two benchmarks partially met .
Following leaks to the media , a Pentagon spokesman said officials had made some " factual corrections " and " offered some suggestions " .

In the first quarter a year ago , The New York Times Co. made $ 23.9 million in profit .
This week , the company reported a loss of $ 335,000 .
That ’s about the worst quarter - to - quarter loss the company â€ ” and the news biz â€ ” has ever seen .
In a story by The Times ‘ Richard PÃ©rez - PeÃ±a , president and CEO Janet L. Robinson said “ it was ‘ a challenging quarter , one that showed the effects of a weaker economy , ’ compounded by ‘ a marketplace that has been reconfigured technologically , economically and geographically . ' ”
That ’s Robinson - speak for “ Holy crap !
We ’re screwed ! ”
Hands down ,
The Times is still the best newspaper in America ( the occasional hit job on a presidential candidate notwithstanding ) .
But this multi-million - dollar loss caps a humbling year .
Like all newspaper companies , it seeks above all else to maintain a traditionally high profit margin ( around 15 to 17 percent industry wide ) to placate investors .
But that desire for a stable profit margin masks the simple fact that investors are getting less return on their investment because they ’re getting 15 percent of rapidly shrinking revenue .
There ’s a bad bottom line ahead for the Times Co. and other newspaper companies as investors confront that reality .
To keep its head above shark - filled financial waters , the Times Co. has sold properties .
It has cut jobs in its newsroom .
It ’s been buying back shares , but issuing dividends to try to keep those investors sated .
It even had to deal a potential proxy fight , and this plunge in first - quarter revenues intensifies the company ’s problems :
The Times Companyâ€™s declining fortunes have sowed shareholder discontent , and the weak first - quarter results could intensify calls for a shift in strategy .
A pair of hedge funds , Harbinger Capital Partners and Firebrand Partners , acquired a large stake in the company early this year , demanding that it sell assets and invest aggressively in Internet operations .
Rather than endure a proxy fight , the hedge funds and the Times Company struck a deal , agreeing to expand the board to 15 seats from 13 , with the two extra seats going to the funds .
That agreement is expected to win approval at a shareholdersâ€™ meeting on April 22 .
( The head of Harbinger likes making money .
Phil Falcone made $ 1.7 billion last year .
Not a guy to make unhappy , if he ’s an investor . )
At least , it appears , the Times Co. does n’t have to fear what happened to Knight Ridder , which was broken up by Bruce Sherman , whose Private Capital Management investment firm nearly single - handedly forced the company ’s sale .
The Times Co. has a dual - class stock structure , allowing the Ochs - Sulzberger family to control more voting stock than any other investor : “ Only the family trust that controls the Times Company can change its stock structure , and the company has said repeatedly that the family has no intention of doing so . ”
So the company will remain under control of the family … for now .
Expect the overall advertising revenue of the Times Co. â€ ” and other newspaper companies â€ ” to decline because they cannot capitalize on Internet ads fast enough .
While online advertising is increasing at a significantly faster rate than print advertising , it ’s a poor bet that total Internet ad revenue will swiftly add up to industry salvation .
The faltering economy , as measured by job losses , creeping inflation , higher food costs and even higher fuel costs , is hurting the newspaper biz .
Its costs will rise , too .
The presidential campaign , also known as the Nightly Hillary , John and Barack Comedy Hour , has been unexpectedly costly to newspapers attempting to cover it full time .
Even though newspapers have physically shrunk the paper product to save money , newsprint prices have been rising since February .
And how many staff cuts can be made before it becomes impossible to produce its product â€ ” the news ?
In Robinson - speak , the future looks like this for the Times Co. :
We see continued challenges for print advertising in a faltering economy .
The Times ‘ motto may be “ All the news that ’s fit to print , ” but it should perhaps be changed to “ All the space for print ads that we just ca n’t sell anymore . ”
The Times Co. , not known for being managerially nimble , had best learn how , or it faces an unpleasant financial destiny â€ ” and a swift fall from journalistic grace .

Few perceive the truth about the Federal Reserve .
Rare are those who know its origins .
It is right in front of us , but our relative ignorance of economics and history is their protection .
A quick history lesson is in order .
On October 14 , 1066 , AD. , King William I ( the Conqueror ) founded the English monarchy .
The Corporation was created by William in 1067 AD .
to facilitate trade , and assure the continuation of the wealth of the monarchy .
The City of London 's legal name is The Corporation of the City of London .
The City of London has unique political and economic privileges that do not apply to Greater London , or anywhere else in the British realm .
The " City " even has its own police force that is sovereign .
The Bank of England was granted a royal charter on July 27 , 1694 , by William III to regularize the monarchy 's finances .
This scheme was invented by a Scot promoter named William Paterson .
The scheme was to create a bank with a " fund for perpetual interest " .
Fractional reserve banking was created , along with the radical monetary concept of a " monopoly " bank which would create money for loans that would never be repaid .
A perpetual money machine for the monarchy was born .
The permanent National Debt was born .
The Bank of England would finance the emerging empire from its headquarters in the City of London .
Never again would the lack of money , or liquidity , hamper the British empire under normal economic conditions .
Conveniently , the monarchy also controls the City of London .
This assures that the heart of the economic machine will always be protected .
The United States fought a hard and expensive war against England in 1776 to achieve sovereignty .
That included the right to have her own currency , control her own tax policies , and the avoidance of involvement in the affairs of other nations .
HistoryCentral.com > > War of 1812 > United States Declares War on Great Britain
The United States declared War on Great Britain on June 12 , 1812 .
The war was declared as a result of long simmering disputes with Great Britian .
The central dispute surrounded the impressment of American soldiers by the British .
The British had previously attacked the USS Chesapeake and nearly caused a war two year earlier .
In addition , disputes continued with Great Britain over the Northwest Territories and the border with Canada .
Finally , the attempts of Great Britain to impose a blockade on France during the Napoleonic Wars was a constant source of conflict with the United States .
The US did everything in their power to remove British influence and control from this continent .
Again and again we defeated all attempts to allow our money to be controlled by a National ( Central ) bank .
When Central banks were established , we abolished them .
Times changed , and Thomas Woodrow Wilson was elected .
The intellectual who wanted the League of Nations ( the progenitor of the United Nations ) was elected .
Under his leadership , we received the Federal Reserve , and the Sixteenth Amendment ( Income Tax ) shackling us into slavery to the British Crown forever .
In 1917 , Wilson made the world safe for democracy by plunging the US into World War I
On December 23 , 1913 , the Federal Reserve Act , also known as the Glass - Owen Bill , was passed .
The Republican controlled Senate rammed the bill through when many members of the US Congress were home for the holiday .
The President , Dr. Thomas Woodrow Wilson , signed it into law one hour after being passed by the Congress !
Somebody very powerful really wanted this law passed .
The Federal Reserve System is an independent central bank .
Although the President of the United States appoints the chairman of the Fed , and this appointment is approved by the United States Senate , the decisions of the Fed do not have to be ratified by the President , or anyone else in the executive branch of the United States government .
Buried in the legislation was the granting of total power over the monetary policies of all US banks .
A very curious statement is found in the original 1913 law .
SEC . 30 .
The right to amend , alter , or repeal this Act is hereby expressly reserved .
Reserved expressly to whom , or what ?
No definition is provided .
This is the entire Section 30 statement !
" Curiouser and curiouser , cried Alice " .
Stock not held by member banks shall not be entitled to voting power .
This clause guarantees
that no outsider can justify buying shares in the Federal Reserve .
" But wait !
There 's more ! "
Sec. 341 Second .
To have succession for a period of twenty years from its organization unless it is sooner dissolved by an Act of Congress , or unless its franchise becomes forfeited by some violation of law .
The Federal Reserve was only given a corporate life of 20 years !
Their time was up in 1933 Who was President at that time ?
Franklin . D. Roosevelt , of course .
Somehow , the Federal Reserve 's termination did not occur .
Reader , do I have your attention yet ?
My research failed to find any reauthorization of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , other than the tacit approval given by the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 .
No Senator or Representative in Congress shall be a member of the Federal Reserve Board or an officer or a director of a Federal reserve bank .
No member of Congress is have access to the inner sanctum !
Hello , what is this ?
Are they afraid that an American might come upon something untoward ?
12 USC 3019 Federal reserve banks , including the capital stock and surplus therein , and the Income derived therefrom shall be exempt from Federal , State , and local taxation , except taxes upon real estate .
People , I think we are a roll now .
SEC . 25 .
Any national banking association possessing a capital and surplus of 1,000,000 dollars or more may file application with the Federal ReserveBoard , upon such conditions and under such regulations as may be prescribed by the said board , for the purpose of securing authority to establish branches in foreign countries or dependencies of the United States for the furtherance of the foreign commerce of the United States , and to act , if required to do so , as fiscal agents of the United States .
Such application shall specify , in addition tothe name and capital of the banking association filing it , the place or places where the bankingoperations proposed are to be carried on , and the amount of capital set aside for the conduct of its foreign business .
The Federal Reserve Board shall have power to approve or to reject such application if , in its judgment , the amount of capital proposed to be set aside for the conduct of foreign business is inadequate , or if for other reasons the granting of such application is deemed inexpedient .
Wow , the US government has no formal control over the foreign operations of the Federal reserve banks !
The Federal reserve banks are exempt from all taxation .
These people are very independent .
Independent of audits , independent of congressional supervision , and independent of the American voter .
The Federal Reserve claims that nobody owns it � that it is an " independent entity within the
government . "
The Federal Reserve is subject to laws such as the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act which cover Federal agencies but not private corporations ; yet Congress gave the Federal Reserve the autonomy to carry out its responsibilities insulated from political pressure .
Each of the Fed 's three parts � the Board of Governors , the regional Reserve banks , and the Federal Open Market Committee � operates independently of the federal government to carry out the Fed 's core responsibilities .
Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed , he or she can be as independent as a U.S. Supreme Court judge , though the term is shorter .
As the nation 's central bank , the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the U.S. Congress .
It is considered an independent central bank because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms .
( The Fed 's financial independence arises because it is hugely profitable due to its ownership of government bonds .
( It gives the government billions of dollars each year . )
However , the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by the Congress , which periodically reviews its activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute .
Also , the Federal Reserve must work within the framework of the overall objectives of economic and financial policy established by the government .
The only statements of ownership made by the Federal Reserve Board is an allusion to the twelve Federal district banks .
This circle puts us back at the beginning , for no information is provided regarding the ownership of the twelve Federal district banks .
However , a 1976 government study commissioned by the Federal Reserve Directors revealed the following :
OWNERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE
Most Americans , if they know anything at all about the Federal Reserve , believe it is an agency of the United States Government .
This article charts the true nature of the " National Bank . "
Chart 1 Source : ** Federal Reserve Directors : A Study of Corporate and Banking Influence ** - - Published 1976 Chart 1 reveals the linear connection between the Rothschilds and the Bank of England , and the London banking houses which ultimately control the Federal Reserve Banks through their stockholdings of bank stock and their subsidiary firms in New York .
The two principal Rothschild representatives in New York , J. P. Morgan Co. , and Kuhn , Loeb & Co. were the firms which set up the Jekyll Island Conference at which the Federal Reserve Act was drafted , who directed the subsequent successful campaign to have the plan enacted into law by Congress , and who purchased the controlling amounts of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914 .
These firms had their principal officers appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council in 1914 .
In 1914 a few families ( blood or business related ) owning controlling stock in existing banks ( such as in New York City ) caused those banks to purchase controlling shares in the Federal Reserve regional banks .
Examination of the charts and text in the House Banking Committee Staff Report of August , 1976 and the current stockholders list of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks show this same family control .
George Bush presided over a minor change in the Federal Reserve Act .
The Sarbanes - OxleyAct was passed in 2002 .
The American Congress failed again to deal with the Federal Reserve .
Bush managed to keep all discussion and changes confined to some reporting requirements for financial institutions .
Bush knows very well who he serves , and he really serves his master well .
It 's amazing how few grasped the significance of Alan Greenspan being knighted by the Queen of England !
Greenspan was knighted on September 26 , 2002 .
An obvious reward for preventing any real discussion , or change , of the Federal Reserve during the Sarbanes - Oxley Act debates .
Had an American President been knighted , serious questions would have arisen .
It was so each easier to reward her manager , Alan !
Do you still believe that Alan Greenspan has the power of Dearth Vader ?
He is only a little man , faithfully serving his queen .
The British Crown , or the British monarchy is the owner of the Federal Reserve .
This is their real secret .
The strategy of the Federal Reserve is their other secret .
Again , it is right of front of us , but no one sees the obvious .
The strategy of the Federal Reserve is to accumulate all the wealth through the very slow , but effective , technique of currency debasement .
The monarchs of old used to shave or clip the coins as they passed through their treasuries .
Now the process is more sanitary ( no more clipping and scraping all those dirty coins ) .
John Maynard Keynes clearly stated that at there is no more effective method of destroying a society than through currency debasement .
The primary reason for its success is the inability of most people to understand that more is not necessarily better .
A recent conversation highlighted Kenyes 's observation .
There is some agitation to raise the minimum wage in my state .
I listened to a proponent of a higher minimum wage .
I attempted to point out that an increase in a large number of people 's income would only result in prices going up , along with the obvious tax increases .
" What was I talking about ? " was the response .
I explained that some percentage of people might wind up dealing with tax bracket creep ( increases ) , and all will have with the obligatory tax increases that follow from any price increase .
If nothing else , the sales tax must go up because the prices have gone up .
I was immediately informed that I was the most negative person they had ever talked to .
The Federal Reserve will always debase the currency to take its cut , and guarantee that the government has a tax base available to feed its bureaucratic family .
The government is a total slave of the Federal Reserve .
For example , analyze the latest real estate boom .
There will be a major boost in property taxes based on the new valuations .
Many people will be surprised when they receive their new tax bill .
This will guarantee more money for the government coffers .
They know that people will do almost anything to keep their homes .
What 's another job or two per family ?
Besides , the extra job will provide more tax revenue for the government .
This will require more day care , or baby - sitting services for many families , which create more income for the government .
This will cause more meals to be eaten out , which creates more revenue for the government Meanwhile , prices will continue to go up , which creates more sales tax revenue for the government .
Are you getting the point yet ?
Deflation is end of the government .
The local , state , and federal government will all fail !
This is the strategy of the Federal Reserve .
The majority of the people will always believe that more is better .
Knowing that , and now having a democracy ensconced in the US , it was time to feed and breed .
Prices always go up , and everything is " Wunnerful , Wunnerful " Bring on the Champagne Lady .
Alan runs the bubble machine .
The illusion of money has destroyed most people since society ( goverment ) developed socialism .
Democracy feeds on the illusion of something for nothing .
As each demagogue promises more than his competition , the tax burden becomes oppressive .
The monetary illusion serves to conceal the costs through currency debasement .
This assures the complete destruction of the society that embraces this perversion .
Any attempt to introduce logic into a dialogue will be defeated by claiming you 're an elitist devoid of compassion .
Envy , hate , and manipulated passions are the hallmark of democracies .
While all this destruction is occurring , money diverted by the mechanism of currency debasement is constantly being transferred to the British Crown in the City of London .
Any questions , gang ?

Politics , sex and religion are the three things you 're not supposed to discuss in mixed company .
Fortunately , if you 're in a cult , odds are you get to discuss those topics as much as you want .
In the right cults you probably get to discuss them while having group sex .

6 The Raelian Movement
Founded by a dude who appears to have stolen his clothes after a stint as an extra on Star Trek , the Raelians are one of the few cults that occasionally make the news down here on Earth .

Rael lets you know on his website that he 's a Frenchman who used to be a cabaret singer and a race car driver , which realistically is slightly cooler than being a carpenter like Jesus or jolly fat man like Buddha .
All of this was prior to meeting an alien named Yahweh , of course , who came to Rael to tell him about the origin of mankind as well as offering him the service of several futuristic sex robots .
Oh , hell yes .
The Pope offers people holiday blessings and waves from behind bullet proof glass .
Rael bangs sex robots from another galaxy .
We 're not saying one 's cooler than the other , we 're just saying sex robots are cooler than anything the Pope has probably even thought of doing .

The movement is noted for such awesome things as claiming in 2002 to have cloned a human ( which turned out to sort of being entirely untrue ) and accusations of brainwashing via sex .
Suavely balding leader Rael also has his own harem of women called the Order of Angels , who apparently exist just to bang the men and donate eggs to human cloning efforts .
Not content with all this amateur whoring , Rael also has an actual subgroup of real - life whores called Rael 's Girls made up solely of woman who work in the sex industry .
If this whole religion sounds like some insanely clever man 's diabolical plan to wear pajamas all day and fuck really gullible women then , congratulations , you may qualify to enter the inner sanctum .
Membership numbers indicate followers in the tens of thousands , most of whom were probably swayed in no way by the religion having its own skank squad .
Black Superdelegates
Shift to Obama Clyburn says many black reps blame Clintons for injecting race in the campaign .
WASHINGTON Feb. 15 , 2008  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , may have an added obstacle in her pursuit of the support of superdelegates — the party insiders and elected officials who compose roughly 20 percent of the total Democratic delegates , and who may ultimately choose the nominee .
One prominent superdelegate who is also the highest - ranking black in Congress told ABC News that the racially tinged way in which critics say the Clintons conducted their campaign in South Carolina is driving black superdelegates into the arms of Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill ..
" The surge — if I may use that word — occurred in direct correlation to the way that campaign had been ratcheted up , " said Rep. Jim Clyburn , D - S.C. , the House Majority Whip who has not endorsed a candidate .
" Those of us who live in the South especially , we know the code words when we hear them and we understand the tone .
People felt some of that was going on and they reacted to it in a very bitter way . "
Clyburn made his remarks as his colleague , Rep. John Lewis , D - Ga. , switched from supporting Clinton to announcing that as a superdelegate he will vote for Obama .
" In recent days , there is a sense of movement and a sense of spirit , " Lewis told The New York Times .
" Something is happening in America and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap . "
Lewis also said he was influenced by the fact that his home state voted heavily for Obama .
Clyburn told ABC
News that he had heard from many black lawmakers who thought the Clintons played the race card .
Clyburn said of particular offense was former President Clinton 's comparison of Obama with the Rev. Jesse Jackson .
" It was an attempt to isolate the ethnicity of the candidate , " Clyburn said .
On Capitol Hill , the lobbying from both campaigns has taken on an emotional and dramatic air .
" It 's pretty intense , especially in places where a lot of the unpledged superdelegates live and their districts went overwhelmingly the other way , " said Clyburn .
" I 've seen a superdelegate driven to tears over this .
It 's a very emotional thing .
People who have been waiting for years to vote for a woman or a black find themselves conflicted having to make a choice between the two at one time .
That 's very , very tough , especially on African - American women . "
Luckily for Clinton , black voters are not as large a voting bloc in some of the must - win states in which she 's campaigning , such as Texas , which has a sizable population of Latinos , and Ohio , which has many blue - collar workers — two groups that tend to favor Clinton and that have given her an edge in state polls .
Clinton has sharpened her message in pursuing these voters , attempting the political jujitsu of using her opponent 's strength against him — in this case Obama 's soaring oratory .
" Speeches do n't put food on the table , " she said in Warren , Ohio , Thursday morning at a General Motors plant .
" Speeches do n't fill up your tank , or fill your prescription , or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night . "
Clinton said , " My opponent gives speeches .
I offer solutions . "
The former first lady just days ago was assailing Obama as untested , using as evidence the fact that Obama had never had a negative TV ad run against him .
This week she remedied that complaint , launching an ad criticizing Obama for not agreeing to debate her in Wisconsin .
" Maybe he 'd prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions , " the ad states .
Obama responded in an ad , saying , " after 18 debates , with two more coming , Hillary says Barack Obama is ducking debates ?
It 's the same old politics of phony charges and false attacks . "
Neither candidate is leaving anything to chance .
On Thursday , the Center for Responsive Politics released a study showing that Obama 's and Clinton 's campaign committees and political action committees had showered superdelegates with almost $ 900,000 in campaign cash .
And as a weapon in the hotly pursued Hawaii primary Tuesday , Chelsea Clinton flew to the land of leis to glad - hand while island - hopping .

A study of the survival rates of premature babies has provided a vital boost to pro-choice campaigners , ahead of one of the most significant parliamentary debates on abortion for a generation .
As the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill returns to the Commons on Monday , campaigners are preparing to use it as a battleground for reform of Britain 's abortion laws , 40 years after the termination of pregnancy was made legal .
Anti-abortion MPs are demanding a cut in the 24 - week time limit on the ground that some babies are viable at 23 or even 22 weeks .
The group , led by the Tory MP and former nurse Nadine Dorries , claims that the lives of as many as 2,000 babies a year could be saved by a reduction in the limit to 20 weeks .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Jim Dobbin , chairman of the pro-life group of MPs , said he would like to see the current limit halved .
" We would like there to be a number of amendments where you can start from a lower limit , say 13 weeks , " he said .
Dr Peter Saunders , general secretary of the Christian Medical Fellowship , said his group was supporting 20 weeks as a first step .
" It gets a lot of people on board and gets us on the way , " he said .
" We have to realise we are in for a very long battle here . "
But a new survey of all extremely premature babies born in the Trent region shows no improvement in survival of those born before 24 weeks over the past 12 years .
The review of 55,000 births in 16 hospitals showed a significant improvement in survival of babies born at 24 and 25 weeks with almost half ( 47 per cent ) of the 497 babies admitted to intensive care surviving to go home in 2000 - 05 , compared with 36 per cent of the 490 born in 1994 - 99 .
But only 18 per cent of those born at 23 weeks – 12 out of 65 babies – survived their stay in hospital , and none of the 150 born at 22 weeks .
Professor David Field , of the University of Leicester , who led the study , said there was a " lack of evidence " to support the claim that the current limit for abortion should be lowered because of continued improvements in medical care .
" The limits of viability for the survival of premature babies have been reached , " he said .
The findings are in line with preliminary results from a national study , released last month , which also showed no increase in the number of babies surviving after being born within the 24 - week abortion limit over the past 10 years .
The report , Epicure 2 , was presented at the annual conference of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in York but has not yet been published .
It examined all severely premature births across England in 2006 and found improved survival rates only in babies born after 24 weeks , compared with those born a decade previously .
Its conclusions are not likely to cut much ice with Ms Dorries , who claims the backing of almost 200 MPs ahead of next week 's parliamentary confrontation .
With strong backing from many Catholic MPs , pro-life campaigners believe that the tide of public opinion has turned on abortions and a majority of voters would now back a reduction of the upper time limit on the grounds that technological advances have increased the viability of early births .
According to the Tory MP , no one would have thought that , when abortion was legalised 40 years ago , it would have led to seven million abortions in Britain in the intervening years .
She said : " Polling shows that 72 per cent of the public believe 24 weeks is too late .
Given we know so many babies now survive that are born below 24 weeks these issues are compelling reasons why it is time to reduce it to 20 weeks . "
She added that of almost 3,000 abortions carried out last year between 20 and 24 weeks , up to 2,300 might result in viable births ( after excluding those where either the mother or foetus was suffering serious health problems ) .
Abortions past 20 weeks , she said , were " not the mark of a decent society " and the process was " frankly barbaric " .
Pro-choice MPs led by the Liberal Democrat Evan Harris , a member of the Commons Science and Technology Committee , will demand an end to the requirement for two doctors to give permission for an abortion which can be a " barrier " for some women seeking help , resulting in abortions later in pregnancy .
The group said reducing the time limit will close the options for the most vulnerable women , such as teenagers , who discover too late that their foetus has an abnormality .
The Health minister Ann Keen has said there was " no evidence " to support a lowering of the time limit , echoing the report of the Commons Science and Technology Committee last year .
Medical organisations have urged MPs to conduct the debate with " evidence - based , factual information " .
In a joint statement last month , the British Medical Association ; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ; the Royal College of Nursing ; and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine said there was " no evidence of a significant improvement in survival of pre-term infants below 24 weeks ' gestation in the UK " since 1990 , when the time limit was reduced from 28 to 24 weeks .
Alan Johnson , the Health Secretary , has told MPs the 24 - week limit has " stood the test of time " and should remain .
MPs are to be given a free vote on the issue but supporters of the existing law fear they could be forced to compromise on 23 weeks , to limit any change .
Almost 200,000 pregnancies are terminated every year in England and Wales .
Critics point to the steady rise in abortions as evidence of the failure of sex education and family planning .
Defenders say one in three pregnancies is unplanned .
Better provision of contraceptive services and easier access to abortion are key elements of a safe service , they say .
Less than 1 per cent of abortions are carried out at more than 22 weeks and 87 per cent are performed before 13 weeks .
Global rules on termination
France
Since 1979 abortion has been available if it is carried out by the end of the 10th week of pregnancy and by a physician in an approved hospital .
By law a woman must state she is " in a situation of distress " but in practice women can choose to have an abortion .
The Netherlands
Abortion is available on request up to 24 weeks , the point of viability , though in practice it tends to be just over 21 weeks .
The Netherlands has one of the lowest international abortion rates which experts say is due to widespread use of contraception .
A woman seeking an abortion must discuss her decision with her doctor who must establish it has been taken voluntarily and after careful consideration .
After this , the woman must wait at least five days before the abortion can be performed if the abortion is taking place more than 16 days after menstruation was due .
Czech Republic
Abortion has remained the preferred method of birth control .
A woman must make a written request to her gynaecologist for the " artificial termination of pregnancy " , and the gynaecologist will then inform her of the possible consequences of the procedure and of other available methods of birth control .
Russia
Russia – where abortion is available on request with the same provisos as elsewhere for cases up to 12 weeks ' gestation – has one of the highest abortion rates in the world , with an estimated 13 terminations for every 10 live births in 2003 .
It was the first country to legalise abortion in 1920 , although the law was repealed in 1936 and abortion remained illegal until 1955 .
As with the Czech Republic , termination is considered to be a common method of birth control , though this appears to have changed in recent years : between 1988 and 2001 , modern contraceptive use increased in Russia by 74 per cent , while the abortion rate declined by 61 cent .
The United States
Abortion is a highly contentious political issue , and the law varies from state to state .
The Supreme Court in its landmark Roe v Wade decision in 1973 ruled by a 7 - 2 vote that women have a constitutional right to an abortion , making abortions legal throughout the nation .
In 1992 , the court allowed some new restrictions as long as they do not impose an " undue burden " on pregnant women .

I watch and read the news every day .
I always have done so , because I like to keep up with the happenings in the world I live in .
As an American , I watch or read US news , but also , European , Asian , African , and South American news .
I have never limited my views to what CNN or Fox News has to say .
I like to keep up with world events , local events , and the ideas and opinions of others .
I ’ve learned that , by doing so , I can define my own opinions , thoughts and ideas clearly .
I ’m no journalist , and I am surely no writer .
Bertrand Russell said , “ The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution . ”
I am no great thinker , and offer up no solution – there are times when I have things I feel deeply , and want to talk about .
Today is one of those times .
Over the last couple of years , I ’ve watched the US decline .
I ’ve seen , first hand , the falling of the WTC .
I ’ve seen , first hand , the effects of the Bush administration , with all it ’s lies and deceit , put fear into the minds and hearts of the American people .
I ’ve witnessed troop movements — miles and miles and miles of military vehicles moving towards some unknown place , to go to Afghanistan , and then Iraq , in defiance of the United Nations , and at the sheer want and will of GWB and his cronies .
I ’ve witnessed first hand men who have come back from that place with no limbs , with half their face gone ; in wheel chairs , with prosthesis in place of legs , or arms ;
Men blinded because shrapnel to their face took out their eyes .
I have hugged my friend Jeff , when he came back alive and whole .
Alive he may be , but whole he is not .
There is a deep sadness within him —
His once sweet eyes , full of mirth , and life , are no longer – now they are sharp , glaring , frightened , and the horror that I saw when I looked in his eyes was heartbreaking .
I look back at the way we used to be .
The Clinton Era , and Pre-GWB , and often wonder what has become of the American people I was so proud of ?
I ’ve never been naive when it comes to the opinion of America – I know too many Europeans with a bitter taste for the US .
But there were as many good things about America , as there are deleterious .
We used to care .
We used to try .
We kept watch on what our government did , and tried , if not always succeeded , to do the right thing by , not only ourselves , but the people of the world .
Perhaps that really is naive , but it was my perception .
Looking at the last 7 years , I ’ve seen the decline of the America I knew and loved .
The America that cared about what happened in the world .
An America that would care about the Darfur Genocide , or the lashing of Tibet , or the hunger that is an epidemic in so many countries in Africa .
And the hunger that now has begun in earnest here in this country .
My parents generation protested the “ war ” in Vietnam .
My own generation is tacitly expecting somebody — anybody other than themselves — to stand up and say No more .
Where are the students to protest in Times Square ?
Is there an SNCC any longer to bring groups of 30,000 to Washington ?
How about the 400,000 who marched in NYC to protest ?
or the 100,000 that marched in San Francisco ?
How about the 100,000 who marched in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial and gave voice to the millions who felt the same way ?
Or the 35,000 who marched on the Pentagon ?
Maybe we need another May day .
We have no King , no Jerry Rubin , no Abbie Hoffman , and no one who can step into those places .
What we ’ve got instead is a country full of people who are apathetic , with an indifferent attitude towards this “ war ” in Iraq and this depression we are sliding into .
Why have we become so complacent ?
Why have we let this go on this long ?
What , exactly , are we waiting for ?
We ca n’t get through to our government officials , they do n’t listen to what the people say or want .
Our President has always had his own agenda , and has been both blind and deaf to the needs of the people he governs .
Government spending is through the roof , yet some of the basic services put in place long before George took office have been pushed to the wayside , and forgotten .
This country is going in to a financial depression , and one that , in my opinion , wo n’t be short lived .
Fuel prices are up , and going to go up .
Food prices are already on the rise , Utility prices are going up , and our job market is already falling .
I ’ve personally sent out over 100 CV’s , and have had little response .
And I ’m pretty damned qualified .
Not only is our country going into a financial depression , but I honestly believe the apathy , the general lassitude of the American population is a form of population depression , deriving from the fact that our middle of the road Congressmen , Governors , representatives , mayors , all the way down to the local Police chief do n’t or wo n’t rock the boat .
The loss of a voter , and re-delectability is more important than doing what is ethical , honorable , and righteous .
How can a normal American feel anything other than apathy when our government is held on a tight leash , by a President that has failed us , failed to do what is right , what is just , and what is called for ?
When our congressmen fail us , when our representatives fail us ?
I long for change .
Change in the way we act , and feel , and do , and say .
Maybe that change will happen with a new Presidential administration .
Maybe it wo n’t .
But that is my own dream .
I am counting down the days until Election day , with the hope that my own belief in the America I miss wo n’t die out .

Terrorist Recognition Handbook : A Practitioner 's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities , is unique in that author Malcolm Nance is a 20 - year veteran of the U.S. intelligence community and writes from a first hand - perspective , but with the organization and methodology of writers such as Pipes and Emerson .
Those combined traits make the book extraordinarily valuable and perhaps the definitive text on terrorist recognition . "
Read below for the rest of Ben 's review Terrorist Recognition Handbook : A Practitioner 's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities , Second Edition author Malcolm Nance pages 480 publisher CRC rating 10 reviewer Ben Rothke ISBN 978-1420071832 summary Perhaps the definitive text on terrorist recognition .
Ben Rothke writesRead below for the rest of Ben 's review
The main theme of the book , as detailed in chapter 1 is critical awareness .
The book notes that criminal investigators spend years studying criminal behavior to better understand and counter crime .
Nance writes that the field of terrorism is no different as it is a specialized subject that requires serious study and requires that those in the front line of defense be as knowledge as possible .
In a later chapter , Nance gives the Iraq war as an example of a group of leaders that were not as knowledge as possible and ignored the advice of those that were as knowledge as possible .
Had the Bush administration consulted Nance , a trillion dollars and thousands of lives could have been saved in the Iraq debacle .
The book is divided into 5 sections comprising 21 heavily - detailed chapters .
Each chapter is a progression in detailing , understanding and identifying terrorists .
In chapter after chapter , the book details every aspect of terrorism and indentifies all of the various elements .
The various aspects of different guns , explosives , and other elements are described and categorized in detail .
In the section on suicide bombers , an important point the book makes is that contrary to popular belief , suicide bombers are rarely insane .
They are most often intelligent , rational individuals with beliefs that those in the West finds difficult to comprehend .
Nance does not for a second rationalize the actions of such groups and individuals .
But notes that it is critical to understand why they do it in order to prevent future attacks .
Chapter 8 is quite valuable in that it provides a comprehensive overview of how terrorist cells operate and are organized .
While the cell is the fundamental unit of a terrorist group ; cell operations and their members are the least understood part of terrorism .
Their operations are always secret and never seen , until they attack .
The chapter details the many types of terrorist cells , operative membership pools , and how cells and leadership communicate .
Chapter 19 is a fascinating primer on al - Qaeda and the global extremist insurgency .
The chapter details how al - Qaeda divides its enemies into two categories : Far Enemies and Near Enemies .
The terms are taken from the Islamic concept of the community and those who oppose it .
While the far enemies of al - Qaeda are the USA , Australia , UK , Europe and Israel , the near enemies are those Moslem 's or nations that al - Qaeda sees as corrupted governments or apostate rules .
These include the governments of over 20 countries including Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Bangladesh , India and many more comprising billions of people .
While the post - 9/11 attacks from coalition forces have indeed hurt al - Qaeda and killed many of its top leaders , Nance notes that al - Qaeda now acts a terror strategy consultancy .
This transformation of al - Qaeda is in response to the loss of its base of operations in Afghanistan and the displacement of its leadership to the Pakistani border .
The most significant changes were a shift of operational responsibility from the regional terror commanders , who executed a long awaited plan for jihad operations , to a more radical and difficult to detect posture : jihadist who were self - starting and worked independently from al - Qaeda .
The most significant changes al - Qaeda 's structure occurred when it was able to co-opt the Jordanian Salafist group Tawhed Wal Jihad and organize the foreign fighters into Iraq into al - Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) .
AQI changed the structure of the military committee 's roles dramatically and Iraq would become the cornerstone of al - Qaeda 's global operations .
Much of the invasion of Iraq was premised on a link between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
There was never such a link , but the war turned into a self - fulfilling prophecy , as al - Qaeda is now a mainstay in Iraq .
The book writes that it is important to note that contrary to popular belief , al - Qaeda is not a single terrorist group , rather a collection of like - minded organizations that cooperate and receive funds , advice and orders from Osama bin Laden and his supporters .
al - Qaeda has transformed itself from a physical chain of terrorist training camps to a virtual network that uses the Internet to create a network centric information and advisory body .
Nance therefore notes that al - Qaeda has transformed itself from a global terrorism operation into a terrorism management consultancy .
The 6 main aspects of this consultancy are that al - Qaeda : provides inspiration , contributes finances , shares collective knowledge , provides weapons resource and contacts , accepts responsibility and releases video propaganda .
Besides a few minor historical errors , some grammatical and punctuation mistakes , and not a lot of details about cyber - based terrorism , Terrorist Recognition Handbook : A Practitioner 's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is a most important book in that it avoids all of the hype , politics and bias that come along with such titles , and simply focuses on its task at hand , to be a field guide for anti-terrorist and counter - terrorist professionals to use to prevent attacks .
Such a title is sorely needed by groups such as the TSA , who still think that anti-terrorism means having people remove their shoes at airports .
The book notes that the European approach of guarded vigilance via a sustained level of anti-terrorism readiness and awareness is a much better concept than the US approach of spiking to heightened alert levels .
The Terrorist Recognition Handbook is a must - read for anyone tasked with or interested in anti-terrorism activities .
One would hope that every TSA and Homeland Security manager and employee get a copy of this monumental reference .
It would change the face of TSA and the Department of Homeland Security , and might perhaps really enable them to identify terrorists , and not simply require the elderly to take off their support shoes at airport checkpoints .

Baha Mousa had been working in a hotel when he was arrested
Des Browne said the MoD would also admit breaching the rights of eight other Iraqi men at a High Court hearing due to take place on Friday .
This will pave the way for compensation claims by Baha Mousa 's family and the others that may run to six - figure sums .
The 26 - year - old hotel receptionist was beaten to death in September 2003 .
In a written statement , Mr Browne said the government would admit " substantive breaches " of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights which protect the right to life and prohibit torture .
During 2003 and 2004 , a very small minority committed acts of abuse and we condemn their actions
Bob Ainsworth , armed forces minister
The lawyer representing his family , Sapna Malik , said they felt " at last there had been some acknowledgement at a senior level of the wrongs that were done " .
" They felt that this was in some way a victory for what they had been campaigning for in terms of justice . "
Armed forces minister Bob Ainsworth said " acts of abuse " had been carried out by a " very small minority " of British troops .
He said he deeply regretted their actions and offered his apologies to Mr Mousa 's family and the other Iraqi detainees .
" All but a handful of the over 120,000 British troops who have served in Iraq have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour , displaying integrity and selfless commitment , " Mr Ainsworth said .
" But this does not excuse that during 2003 and 2004 a very small minority committed acts of abuse and we condemn their actions . "
He said the Army had done a great deal since then to improve procedures and training and continued to demand the very highest standards of conduct from all troops .
Corporal dismissed
Mr Mousa and the other Iraqi men were arrested at a hotel where weapons and suspected bomb - making equipment were found in 2003 .
Mr Mousa was detained under suspicion of being an insurgent .
Seven members of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment ( QLR ) , now the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment , faced the most expensive court martial in British history over the case .
Six soldiers were acquitted after the six - month hearing in Bulford , Wiltshire , but a seventh soldier admitted treating Iraqis inhumanely .
Cpl Donald Payne was jailed for a year and dismissed from the Army .
Much of the trial rested on whether headquarters staff at 19 Mechanised Brigade sanctioned the use of what British troops called " conditioning " , intended to make suspects more likely to answer questions .
This process involved the hooding , handcuffing and placing terrorist suspects into stress positions and depriving them of sleep .
Senator Barack Obama likes to joke that the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination has been going on so long , babies have been born , and they ’re already walking and talking .
That ’s nothing .
The battle between the sciences and the humanities has been going on for so long , its early participants have stopped walking and talking , because they ’re already dead .
It ’s been some 50 years since the physicist - turned - novelist C.P.
Snow delivered his famous “ Two Cultures ” lecture at the University of Cambridge , in which he decried the “ gulf of mutual incomprehension , ” the “ hostility and dislike ” that divided the world ’s “ natural scientists , ” its chemists , engineers , physicists and biologists , from its “ literary intellectuals , ” a group that , by Snow ’s reckoning , included pretty much everyone who was n’t a scientist .
His critique set off a frenzy of hand - wringing that continues to this day , particularly in the United States , as educators , policymakers and other observers bemoan the Balkanization of knowledge , the scientific illiteracy of the general public and the chronic academic turf wars that are all too easily lampooned .
Yet a few scholars of thick dermis and pep-rally vigor believe that the cultural chasm can be bridged and the sciences and the humanities united into a powerful new discipline that would apply the strengths of both mindsets , the quantitative and qualitative , to a wide array of problems .
Among the most ambitious of these exercises in fusion thinking is a program under development at Binghamton University in New York called the New Humanities Initiative .
These immune cells , infected with a genetically engineered HIV , are expressing the green fluorescent protein .
The cells exhibit great cell - to - cell variation ( noise ) despite being genetically identical to each other .

Researchers at the University of California , San Diego and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have discovered how a genetic circuit in HIV controls whether the virus turns on or stays dormant , and have succeeded in forcing the virus towards dormancy , a finding that shows promise as an avenue for HIV therapy .
Their findings are published in the March 16 issue of the journal Nature Genetics .
Leor S. Weinberger , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego , with Michael L. Simpson of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Roy D. Dar of the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , say that their study shows how a developmental decision between HIV ’s two “ replication fates ” is made .
The authors were able to measure the level of “ noise ” or randomness in HIV gene expression and use this noise to probe how HIV decides to replicate or remain dormant .
This method is somewhat like finding a radio station by honing in on regions with the most static .
It provides a new tool for probing cellular , as well as viral , regulation , and for understanding how other biological decisions are made , notably how stem cells choose between different developmental fates .
“ It ’s significant for two reasons , ” said Weinberger .
“ First , many researchers are interested in determining which cellular processes generate biological noise .
We , instead , asked if the cellular noise could tell us anything about HIV and the cell – and it did .
What it told us is how a developmental decision is made by HIV .
“ We still do n’t understand how developmental decisions are made at the single - cell level -- for example , how a particular stem cell differentiates into many different cell types -- and whether noise can drive this decision .
Surprisingly , viruses appear to be good models for understanding this type of cellular decision - making . ”
The authors explored the genetic master circuit of HIV , the Tat circuit , and built upon previous work by Weinberger which showed that it did not function like a standard on - off switch ( a light switch , for example ) .
Weinberger ’s previous work found that the HIV circuit is driven by cellular noise , or random events , which activate the circuit for a limited amount of time before it turns off .
In the current study , Weinberger and colleagues were able to exploit this noise in the HIV
Tat circuit to measure how long HIV remained activated in the cell , and deduce that the time spent in the active state drove HIV ’s decision to destroy the cell or not .
Then the researchers increased the levels of the native cellular gene SirT1 ( a gene implicated in aging ) to reduce the lifespan of the HIV virus and force HIV - infected cells to go dormant .
Further studies are now under way in Weinberger ’s lab on the feasibility of using this approach for anti-HIV therapy .

Last month I wrote about the pressure to adopt " graduated response , " a policy that is better described as " three strikes and you 're out " for ISP subscribers .
While Canada has yet to take a public position on the issue , a new French document cites Canada as an example of a country that is negotiating an ISP three strikes policy .
In particular , the latest Olivennes bill draft submitted by the Conseil d'Etat , states :
La méthode et le dispositif des Accords de l’Élysée soulèvent d’ailleurs un vif intérêt à l’étranger .
De nombreux pays d’Europe ( comme la Grande_Bretagne ) ou d’autre continents ( comme le Canada ou le Japon ) ont d’ores et déjà initié un processus de négociation comparable , encadré par les pouvoirs publics , que ceux_ci viendront relayer en tant que de besoin .
Given that there has been no Canadian public statement consistent with the French claim , either the French are simply wrong ( and should be corrected ) or Canadian officials may have privately indicated a willingness to move in this direction .
The latter possibility is very troubling given the likelihood that new Canadian copyright legislation is likely to be introduced within the next few weeks .
The following is the text as prepared for delivery of Governor Bill Richardson 's speech endorsing Senator Barack Obama in Oregon .
My friends ,
Earlier this week , an extraordinary American gave a historic speech .
Senator Barack Obama addressed the issue of race with the eloquence and sincerity and decency and optimism we have come to expect of him .
He did not seek to evade tough issues or to soothe us with comforting half - truths .
Rather , he inspired us by reminding us of the awesome potential residing in our own responsibility .
Senator Obama could have given a safer speech .
He is , after all , well ahead in the delegate count for our party 's nomination .

Advertisement A 93 - year - old driver who had not had an accident in 76 years but caused £ 60,000 worth of damage to two Porsche cars has spoken of his " miracle " escape .
Jack Higgs was uninjured when his Ford Fiesta hit a Carrera II then flipped over onto a Porsche 911 outside a showroom in Penarth , Vale of Glamorgan .
He was found hanging upside down by his seatbelt in his overturned Fiesta .
The former Pentecostal minister , who lives next door to the showroom , has now decided to quit driving .
Mr Higgs said he could not explain how he managed to lose control of his 13 - year - old car and smash into the Porsches .
One of the elite cars was a write - off while the other was badly damaged and will need extensive repairs .
Both cars were privately owned and were in the garage for servicing .
Mr Higgs ' Fiesta , worth £ 600 , was also a write - off .
The next thing I knew I was hanging upside down in my car thanking my lucky stars I was still alive
Jack Higgs
The cost of his accident was estimated at £ 60,000 , which will be met by his insurance company .
" I 've been driving since I was 17 , have a clean licence and have never even picked up so much as a parking ticket , " said Mr Higgs .
He said he would be relying on the bus service and lifts to get him around from now on .
" I just do n't know what happened except that I lost control as I was reversing and suddenly I had hit the cars .
" The next thing I knew I was hanging upside down in my car thanking my lucky stars I was still alive .
" It was a miracle I got out alive and I put it down to the power of prayer and God looking after me .
" But that 's it - the end of my driving career , I 'm never driving again . "
Staff at the RS Porsche base said Mr Higgs managed to get himself free and walked away from the crash without a scratch .
He was given the all - clear after being checked over by paramedics .
There was glass and bits of broken metal everywhere - but Jack is such a gentleman he asked for a sweeping brush to help clear them up
Dave Coombs , RS Porsche
He is well - known to workers at the showroom and has driven across the forecourt to get to his garage for 45 years without any problems .
Porsche dealer Dave Coombs said : " It was amazing .
We could hardly believe our eyes at the damage .
" He managed to get himself free and walked out without a scratch .
But the Porsches were a real mess .
" There was glass and bits of broken metal everywhere - but Jack is such a gentleman he asked for a sweeping brush to help clear them up .
" But we walked him to his home for a cup of sweet tea while the breakdown trucks arrived to tow away the cars .
" I 'm not too concerned about the cars - what matters is that Jack survived , which is incredible considering his great age . "

What are these ?
Twelve years ago , biologists and clinicians hoped for a fleeting moment that combining several new drugs might completely eliminate HIV from the body and thus achieve a cure .
Those hopes quickly vanished when it was discovered that the virus hides in a dormant state inside certain cells out of reach of this therapeutic cocktail .
Ever since , researchers in the war against AIDS have looked for drugs to coax the elusive virus out of hiding so that other drugs or the patients ' own immune systems could target them .
But most of the meds were either toxic or ineffective .
A few compounds derived from plants showed promise in the laboratory , but scientists could not procure sufficient quantities to move ahead with drug development .
New research points the way to addressing that scarcity .
A Stanford University research team reports in Science that it successfully synthesized two plant chemicals that appear to lure HIV from its hiding spots .
If the drug candidates prove themselves in human clinical trials , researchers say the process used to develop them may pave the way for the manufacture of commercial quantities of pharmaceuticals .
New synthesis methods constitute an important step in making plants and other natural products into practical therapies .
Bristol - Myers Squibb's semisynthetic technique of making taxol for cancer treatment overcame objections of conservationists by eliminating the need to fell three Pacific yew trees to procure enough of the drug to treat one patient .
Prostratin , one of the compounds synthesized by the Stanford team , comes from the bark of the mamala tree ( Homalanthus nutans ) , which is used by Samoan islanders to treat hepatitis .
The other , 12 - deoxyphorbol 13 - phenylacetate ( DPP ) , originates in resin spurge ( Euphorbia resinifera ) , a cactus - like plant that is also being investigated as a painkiller .
Prostratin has a storied history , because ethnobotanist Paul Cox , who found the plant during field studies in the early 1980s , has waged a campaign to ensure that Samoans receive a portion of the proceeds from any drug developed from the plant .
The availability of the plants is limited — intensive harvesting in Samoa could cause ecological damage — and , as with taxol , the amount of active chemicals that can be extracted is low .
Stanford chemist Paul Wender and his colleagues synthesized prostratin and DPP by using oil from the seeds of a small Asian tree , Croton tiglium , as a starting material .
Oil from the Jatropha plant , which can be used to make biodiesel , can also serve as an initial ingredient .
Both provide readily available raw materials .
The researchers transformed croton oil into prostratin and DPP in a five - step process .
" We reduced the step count from around eight or nine steps to the four to five we ended with , " Wender says .
The synthesis technique is flexible enough that it can be altered to generate related chemicals that may demonstrate more effectiveness as drugs or a lower side - effect profile .
Both compounds have shown that they can induce HIV in cell cultures to emerge from its latent state and can protect healthy cells from becoming infected .
The California - based AIDS Research Alliance , a non-profit that is trying to find new AIDS treatments , plans to move ahead with additional preclinical work on prostratin .
The group cut a deal with the prime minister of Samoa in 2001 to return 20 percent of any prostratin - related profits to the country .
This agreement is thought to be the first time local groups were given a stake in a compound discovered by traditional healers .
While promising , these drug candidates still have a long way to go before they become a routine weapon in the anti-HIV armamentarium .
" I'm skeptical about agents such as prostratin to flush out latent HIV , " says Mario Stevenson , an HIV researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester .
" Firstly , we do n't know what maintains HIV in a latent state and , until we do , we can't rationally design agents that interrupt latency .
Secondly , I 'd like to see proof of concept that these new prostratin analogs actually do affect latent HIV in a physiologically relevant setting . "
Stevenson also notes that the reservoirs may exist in cells other than the white blood cells targeted by prostratinlike drugs .
" The upshot is that I think that the science behind designing drugs to flush out latent [ HIV ] is hampered by our limited understanding of the nature of latency itself , " he says .
The investigation of synthetic prostratin and DPP will undoubtedly continue .
With the much - publicized failure of an HIV vaccine last year , researchers are still desperate to find better ways to boost the effectiveness of AIDS therapies .
City inspectors will no longer be present every time a construction crane is erected or made taller , officials said on Wednesday , as they continued to modify safeguards put in place after the collapse of a crane 10 weeks ago that killed seven people on the East Side of Manhattan .
Instead , inspectors will make spot checks of the crane raisings , known as jumps , and of safety meetings at which procedures for each jump must be laid out .
The 22 - story crane fell at a high - rise construction site on East 51st Street on March 15 .
Ten days later , the Buildings Department issued a new set of provisional regulations for crane jumps and said that as a precaution , its inspectors would be on hand every time a crane was put up , made taller or dismantled .
On Wednesday , the department issued a report saying its inspectors attended 51 crane jumps between March 25 and May 16 .
It described 49 of the jumps as successful and said its inspectors found serious safety violations at two others .
With our beloved Constitution under attack , and new legislation ( H.R. 1955 and S. 1959 ) that will further usurp our freedoms , Americans are reaching back into history for the familiarity of their Revolutionary past .
American freedom fighters , determined to reNEW their democracy , are digging into the fashion of their Founders , donning tricorn hats , and preparing to reNEW their Constitution .
The New American Revolutionaries are here !
Even before the Patriot Act was whisked into being on October 26 , 2001 by an uninformed and over zealous Congress , true American patriots knew it would shred the Constitution .
Respected Constitutional scholars like Irwin Chemerinsky ( formerly of USC & Duke ) , Jonathan Turley ( George Washington University ) , the ACLU , and numerous legal experts , forewarned Americans of the infringements on their freedoms by this pernicious act .
Concerned citizens rose up in protest , but never in sufficient numbers to force Congress to repeal the act .
Of course , had there been an informed American electorate , MILLIONS would have protested this purging of their rights .
But the corporate - owned media had accomplished its task .
It had dumbed down Americans so drastically that " Survivor " was their reality , and the threat to their democracy was unreal .
In October of 2002 , the Iraq War Resolution passed , granting George W. Bush the authority to take what actions HE deemed necessary against Saddam 's Iraq .
Concerned citizens rose in protest .
Women held constant vigil at the White House .
But mindless reality television held a vigil of its own .
Americans were minor interested and major uninformed - as filmmakers Danny Schechter , Robert Greenwald and Norman Solomon have clearly shown .
On February 15 , 2003 , millions around the globe stood in solidarity against the war .
The greatest numbers were in Europe .
Rome had 3 million strong .
Across America , pro-peace patriots marched in large numbers - but not large enough .
Corporate media had again done its job .
This time " Survivor " had company .
" Fear Factor , " and " Big Brother " were added realities , and " The Osbournes " took the nation by storm .
For America 's media - deluded nation , the war eventually became a reality on March 20 , 2003 , when it was broadcast as " Shock and Awe . "
Americans chomped popcorn and drank beer to their war .
It was the ultimate video extravaganza .
The corporate media had sold Americans a war .
Americans bought it , financed it , staffed it , and now owned it .
Their hard earned taxes had bought George Bush 's war .
When will they finally stop paying ?!
On March 9 , 2006 , George W. Bush signed the newly reauthorized Patriot Act into law .
Patriots bemoaned their inability to protect the Constitution .
Corporate media - conned Americans paid it no mind .
The New York Times front page did n't cover it , concentrating instead on the Dubai ports debacle , which bolstered domestic fear .
With the scrawl of a pen , Americans ' freedoms and privacy were again signed away .
By 2006 , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still raging on .
Thousands of troops had been killed .
Tens of thousands had been grievously wounded .
Bush had suspended habeas corpus .
Houses began to foreclose .
More jobs were shipped overseas .
More workers became unemployed .
More health benefits were denied .
More widening of the economic divide .
With this further decline in quality of life , more Americans awakened to their decaying democracy .
Still not in sufficent numbers .
Corporate media dumbed on .
Peace marches were n't televised .
Progressive leaders were n't interviewed .
" American Idol " and " Dancing With The Stars " rated high .
Britney 's marriage was rocky and French - hating Americans were ga - ga for Paris .
And now , as 2007 moves toward its end , the wars continue , the economy further dies , and Congress sucker - punches the Constitution once again .
Meet the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( H.R. 1955 ) , and its Senate companion , S. 1959 - the government 's newest weapon against its own people .
Its latest tool to identify and control " homegrown terrorists , " and in the process suppress dissent .
Thanks to California 's ever disappointing Bush - Dog Democrat , Jane Harman , Congress pushed through yet further legislation to erode First Amendment rights .
Harman's H.R. 1955 , which passed the House overwhelmingly with a 404 to 6 vote , presents such a vague definition of " homegrown terrorism , " that any American who dissents is subject to government reprisal .
Per H.R. 1955 , " homegrown terrorism " is defined as " the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States or any possession of the United States to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . " click here
When considering that individuals and organizations who oppose government policy regularly plan the actions needed to force government change , Jane Harman 's bill is antithetical to democracy .
H.R. 1955 dissuades citizen participation in government , and is an extension of the disastrous Homeland Security Department - the same Homeland Security Department that used its resources in 2003 to track down Texas state legislators at the behest of former Republican Congressman , Tom Delay .
The Founders of this nation surely did n't foresee , or prescribe , the tyrannical rule set forth in H.R. 1955 , in Senate bill 1959 , or in the Patriot Act .
Thomas Jefferson , perhaps this nation 's most vocal proponent of participatory democracy , made many statements in support of citizen involvement in government .
Jefferson said :
" Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone .
The people themselves are its only safe depositories . "
Jefferson also said :
" The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive . "
Left in the despotic hands of Bush - Dog Harman , and her 404 colleagues in the 110th Congress , Mr. Jefferson 's America will collapse into disrepair .
The great leaders of this nation have always understood that its salvation rests squarely in the hands of THE PEOPLE , who love it more purely than electeds who succumb to ambition and corporations that succeed through greed .
After enduring nearly seven years of the Goebbels ' fear tactics of George W. Bush , and the dumbing - down tactics of corporate media , the American people are slowly waking to the perilous state of their union .
Still , many fail to realize how severely their Constitution has been shredded by their ruthless President and reckless Legislators .
For most Americans , few historical symbols are as recognizable as the clothing worn by the Founders they learned about as children .
In a non-partisan effort to assist Americans in reclaiming their nation , the New American Revolutionaries will don the duds of their forefathers and go forward to re-teach the Revolutionary principles of justice and humanity upon which this nation is based .
On January 1st at the Pasadena Rose Parade , Revolutionary garbed patriots from the White Rose Coalition will move amongst the crowds to spread the message that its time to reclaim our democracy .
It 's time to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It 's time to bring our heros home .
It 's time to make peace with the world .
It 's time to end corporate dominance of a society steeped in greed .
It 's time to impeach Bush and Cheney , and restore our nation to its original creed .
Birthing impacts the well - being of a mother and child for a lifetime and possibly generations to follow .
I believe we must create safe and peaceful births in order to promote community healing , empowerment , and social change .
Having recently returned from Haiti , I am wondering where to venture next , and how I can create these possibilities .
Italian wall lizards introduced to a tiny island off the coast of Croatia are evolving in ways that would normally take millions of years to play out , new research shows .
In just a few decades the 5 - inch - long ( 13 - centimeter - long ) lizards have developed a completely new gut structure , larger heads , and a harder bite , researchers say .
In 1971 , scientists transplanted five adult pairs of the reptiles from their original island home in Pod Kopiste to the tiny neighboring island of Pod Mrcaru , both in the south Adriatic Sea .
Genetic testing on the Pod Mrcaru lizards confirmed that the modern population of more than 5,000 Italian wall lizards are all descendants of the original ten lizards left behind in the 1970s .
Lizard Swarm
While the experiment was more than 30 years in the making , it was not by design , according to Duncan Irschick , a study author and biology professor at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst .
After scientists transplanted the reptiles , the Croatian War of Independence erupted , ending in the mid-1990s .
The researchers could n't get back to island because of the war , Irschick said .
In 2004 , however , tourism began to open back up , allowing researchers access to the island laboratory .
( Read : " Kayaking the New Croatia " in National Geographic Adventure Magazine . )
" We did n't know if we would find a lizard there .
We had no idea if the original introductions were successful , " Irschick said .
What they found , however , was shocking .
" The island was swarming with lizards , " he said .
The findings were published in March in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Fast - Track Evolution
The new habitat once had its own healthy population of lizards , which were less aggressive than the new implants , Irschick said .
The new species wiped out the indigenous lizard populations , although how it happened is unknown , he said .
The transplanted lizards adapted to their new environment in ways that expedited their evolution physically , Irschick explained .
Pod Mrcaru , for example , had an abundance of plants for the primarily insect - eating lizards to munch on .
Physically , however , the lizards were not built to digest a vegetarian diet .
Researchers found that the lizards developed cecal valves — muscles between the large and small intestine — that slowed down food digestion in fermenting chambers , which allowed their bodies to process the vegetation 's cellulose into volatile fatty acids .
" They evolved an expanded gut to allow them to process these leaves , " Irschick said , adding it was something that had not been documented before .
" This was a brand - new structure . "
Along with the ability to digest plants came the ability to bite harder , powered by a head that had grown longer and wider .
The rapid physical evolution also sparked changes in the lizard 's social and behavioral structure , he said .
For one , the plentiful food sources allowed for easier reproduction and a denser population .
The lizard also dropped some of its territorial defenses , the authors concluded .
Such physical transformation in just 30 lizard generations takes evolution to a whole new level , Irschick said .
It would be akin to humans evolving and growing a new appendix in several hundred years , he said .
" That 's unparalleled .
What 's most important is how fast this is , " he said .
While researchers do know the invader 's impact on its reptile brethren , they do not know how the species impacts local vegetation or insects , a subject of future study , Irschick said .
Dramatic Changes
The study demonstrates that a lot of change happens in island environments , said Andrew Hendry , a biology professor at Montreal 's McGill University .
What could be debated , however , is how those changes are interpreted — whether or not they had a genetic basis and not a " plastic response to the environment , " said Hendry , who was not associated with the study .
There 's no dispute that major changes to the lizards ' digestive tract occurred .
" That kind of change is really dramatic , " he added .

How does J.K. Rowling do this to people ?
The beloved author convinced an American court to hear her complaints of factual errors about an imaginary world , in a proposed encyclopedia of her Harry Potter series .
Then , testifying in New York yesterday , she somehow got her attorney to apologize for uttering the words " Lord Voldemort " in court , since the Potter character is " he who must not be named , " you see .
" Forgive me for speaking the name , " said the attorney , Dale Cendali .
Granted , Rowling has many other complaints , first among them copyright infringement , and her attorney may have been having a bit of fun with the " Voldemort " apology .
But Rowling still seems to have performed something of a magic trick , turning a relatively straightforward publishing case into a forum on her charitable contributions ( her profits , unlike the defendant 's , will be donated ) ; on her own plans for a Harry Potter encyclopedia ( in the works for 10 years ) and on alphabetical order ( " What are you accessing in these A - to - Z's ?
Are n't you being suckered out of your hard - earned cash ? " ) .
The author of the encyclopedia Rowling is trying to stop , Harry Potter 's Lexicon , once received an award from Rowling for his Potter website , and Rowling has admitted using his site to check her own facts while writing .
But she accused the author of plagiarism and shoddy scholarship :
She claims the author has lifted large chunks of her own language without quotation marks .
" I believe that this book constitutes the wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work , " she testified ...
The entry under Remus Lupin , she said , missed the opportunity to comment on the etymology of the name as a " double allusion " to the character 's being a werewolf , since in Roman mythology Remus was raised by wolves , and Lupin derived from lupine .
She also objected to what she called the book 's " facetious asides , " like a comment about whether Hagrid could fit into a booth at McDonald's .

Hadouken !
And we ’re back .
OK .
Last time I left ya with a cliffhanger and this week we ’ll get right to it .
Rounding out our cast , portraying Gen , the sage kung - fu master and Chun Li’s mentor , will be none other than …Robin Shou !
Sound familiar ?
It should .
Robin already brought one of the most famous video game characters of all time to life , as Mortal Kombat ’s Liu Kang .
So it should come as no surprise that Street Fighter will be right up his alley .
I ’ve seen the man in full costume and makeup and I promise you this - the dude is damn near unrecognizable .
But hey , do n’t take my word for it .
Behold an EXCLUSIVE first look at …Robin Shou as Gen !
I hope you enjoyed last week ’s intro , cuz we ’re about to hit the ground running with some more good bits on what you can expect from Street Fighter : The Legend of Chun Li .
I want to say first , a resounding thank you to all the news sites for posting word of our little blog we got goin’ here .
With your help , it spread across the net like wildfire .
Some good feedback , and yeah , some negative .
I follow it all .
I hear ya .
And that ’s what I want to address .
Actually , better yet , I ’m gonna have our screenwriter , Justin Marks do it instead .
Trust me , this dude is one of the good guys .
An action buff and more importantly , a gamer to the core .
After you read the following , you ’ll see that he has your best interests at heart .
Enjoy …
“ A movie based on the Street Fighter game ?
But it does n’t even have a plot ! ”
I ’ve heard this line before .
A few times .
Whenever I talk to people who do n’t know much about Street Fighter , it ’s always the first thing they say .
But any true fan of Street Fighter knows about its rich world , its colorful palette of characters , and complicated web of varying interests and betrayals .
No story ?
You ’re just not paying attention .
The way I approached the writing of Street Fighter ’s script was simple .
Throw away everything and start with character .
For just a moment , forget about the fights , forget about the costumes , forget about the flaming Hadoukens … go back to the essence of what the characters are about .
See , I think the Street Fighter world is epic .
I think it ’s got a huge story , and it ’s busting at the seams .
But to start , it would be a HUGE mistake to say , “ How many characters can we pack into this movie without regard to whether it makes sense ? ”
Think of the X - Men franchise .
Think of the way it started with a simple story of Wolverine trying to find a place in the world .
And then it spawned an entire universe of amazing characters .
If we did n’t keep this movie grounded , we would risk turning Street Fighter into a parody of itself .
And to those of us who are fans of fighting franchises , the last thing we want is a movie that does n’t take itself seriously .
It starts and ends with character .
Everything else is just window dressing .
Easter eggs ( keep your eyes peeled … ) .
Setups for a sequel .
Moments that reference favorite moves from the game .
They are all secondary to what a good movie should be about : the people in it .
And there are many great people in the STREET FIGHTER franchise .
Ryu vs. Ken is the obvious one .
Sagat and his quest for honor is another .
It was just a question of picking one hero to start it all , one who ’s never really gotten her moment in the spotlight …
Chun -Li .
She comes from nothing .
She ’s an unlikely hero .
And then , against all odds , this little girl who everyone wrote off eventually saves the day .
You do n’t get any better than that .
She ’s a movie legend waiting to happen .
And believe me , if this movie finds its audience the way I think it will , fans should brace themselves for many more Street Fighter movies .
This is n’t just another video game adaptation .
This is the beginning of something we ’ve never seen before .
Get ready for it .
– Justin Marks
That do anything for ya ?
How ‘ bout a little more dirt on the film from a man who knows a thing or two about a thing or two ?
I pulled up a chair next to Producer and Hyde Park Chairman Ashok Amritraj ( Death Sentence , Walking Tall , Boondock Saints ) .
Here ’s some of what he had to say …
On why he chose to bring Street Fighter to the big screen : “ Street Fighter has been such an iconic title over the years , but it actually started with my kids and I talking about it .
I have two kids and they ’re big video game fans .
One day we were talking about games and Street Fighter , which is one of their favorites , was one of the names that came up .
It just kind of developed from there .
So I gotta say thanks to my kids ! ”
On Neal McDonough as Bison : “ This is actually the 3rd film Neal and I have done together ( Walking Tall , and the upcoming Traitor ) and I just could n’t think of anybody better to play Bison .
He ’s got the eyes , he ’s got the look , and trust me , he ’s going to scare the hell out of you . ”
On Robin Shou as Gen : “ I remember Robin from ‘ the old days ’- and he ’s matured very well .
He ’s perfect for the role of Gen .
He and Kristen will look great together as master and pupil . ”
On the relationship between Andrzej Bartkowiak and Dion Lam : “ Andrzej and Dion are like the yin and the yang , we ’ve got these two units shooting full - time , one with all the acting and the other with all the action and then it all sort of melds together .
Its beautiful , like a well choreographed action ballet .
Dion is a total star , he ’s brilliant . ”
So there ya have it Fight fans .
Another week , in the bag .
Next week brings another set report and some more visual goodness to satisfy your thirst ( including more new character photos ) .
I ’ve attached another one of Ted ’s wicked storyboards below .
And with that , I ’m out with a sonic BOOM !

And what does the reference notebook look like when VIA builds one ?
Quite attractive , if you ask me .
As Richard Brown , Vice President of Corporate Marketing at VIA explains , in lovely marketing speak :
The VIA OpenBook builds on the great success of the VIA NanoBook reference design launched last year , which has been widely adopted by numerous customers around the world .
Our unique open approach to case design customization and wireless connectivity flexibility , coupled with the higher levels of performance , further extends VIA ’s leadership in the global mini - note market .
Brown also told the New York Times that he expects OpenBooks to cost somewhere between 500 and 800 USD .
BERKELEY , Calif . —
Three researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) have proposed an innovative way to improve global climate change predictions by using a supercomputer with low - power embedded microprocessors , an approach that would overcome limitations posed by today ’s conventional supercomputers .
Berkeley Lab has signed a collaboration agreement with Tensilica� , Inc. to explore the use of Tensilica�s Xtensa processor cores as the basic building blocks in a massively parallel system design .
Tensilica�s Xtensa processor is about 400 times more efficient in floating point operations per watt than the conventional server processor chip shown here .
In a paper published in the May issue of the International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications , Michael Wehner and Lenny Oliker of Berkeley Lab ’s Computational Research Division , and John Shalf of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center ( NERSC ) lay out the benefit of a new class of supercomputers for modeling climate conditions and understanding climate change .
Using the embedded microprocessor technology used in cell phones , iPods , toaster ovens and most other modern day electronic conveniences , they propose designing a cost - effective machine for running these models and improving climate predictions .
In April , Berkeley Lab signed a collaboration agreement with Tensilica® , Inc. to explore such new design concepts for energy - efficient high - performance scientific computer systems .
The joint effort is focused on novel processor and systems architectures using large numbers of small processor cores , connected together with optimized links , and tuned to the requirements of highly - parallel applications such as climate modeling .
Understanding how human activity is changing global climate is one of the great scientific challenges of our time .
Scientists have tackled this issue by developing climate models that use the historical data of factors that shape the earth ’s climate , such as rainfall , hurricanes , sea surface temperatures and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
One of the greatest challenges in creating these models , however , is to develop accurate cloud simulations .
Although cloud systems have been included in climate models in the past , they lack the details that could improve the accuracy of climate predictions .
Wehner , Oliker and Shalf set out to establish a practical estimate for building a supercomputer capable of creating climate models at 1 - kilometer ( km ) scale .
A cloud system model at the 1 - km scale would provide rich details that are not available from existing models .
To develop a 1 - km cloud model , scientists would need a supercomputer that is 1,000 times more powerful than what is available today , the researchers say .
But building a supercomputer powerful enough to tackle this problem is a huge challenge .
Historically , supercomputer makers build larger and more powerful systems by increasing the number of conventional microprocessors — usually the same kinds of microprocessors used to build personal computers .
Although feasible for building computers large enough to solve many scientific problems , using this approach to build a system capable of modeling clouds at a 1 - km scale would cost about $ 1 billion .
The system also would require 200 megawatts of electricity to operate , enough energy to power a small city of 100,000 residents .
Berkeley Lab scientists Michael Wehner ( not pictured ) , Lenny Oliker and John Shalf have made the case that using a supercomputer with low - power embedded microprocessors would overcome limitations posed by today ’s conventional supercomputers and greatly benefit such challenges as modeling climate conditions and understanding global climate change .
In their paper , “ Towards Ultra - High Resolution models of Climate and Weather , ” the researchers present a radical alternative that would cost less to build and require less electricity to operate .
They conclude that a supercomputer using about 20 million embedded microprocessors would deliver the results and cost $ 75 million to construct .
This “ climate computer ” would consume less than 4 megawatts of power and achieve a peak performance of 200 petaflops .
“ Without such a paradigm shift , power will ultimately limit the scale and performance of future supercomputing systems , and therefore fail to meet the demanding computational needs of important scientific challenges like the climate modeling , ” Shalf said .
The researchers arrive at their findings by extrapolating performance data from the Community Atmospheric Model ( CAM ) .
CAM , developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , is a series of global atmosphere models commonly used by weather and climate researchers .
The “ climate computer ” is not merely a concept .
Wehner , Oliker and Shalf , along with researchers from UC Berkeley , are working with scientists from Colorado State University to build a prototype system in order to run a new global atmospheric model developed at Colorado State .
“ What we have demonstrated is that in the exascale computing regime , it makes more sense to target machine design for specific applications , ” Wehner said .
“ It will be impractical from a cost and power perspective to build general - purpose machines like today ’s supercomputers . ”
Under the agreement with Tensilica , the team will use Tensilica ’s Xtensa LX extensible processor cores as the basic building blocks in a massively parallel system design .
Each processor will dissipate a few hundred milliwatts of power , yet deliver billions of floating point operations per second and be programmable using standard programming languages and tools .
This equates to an order - of - magnitude improvement in floating point operations per watt , compared to conventional desktop and server processor chips .
The small size and low power of these processors allows tight integration at the chip , board and rack level and scaling to millions of processors within a power budget of a few megawatts .

Until this week , I had been putting off setting up a CL / Emacs / SLIME environment from scratch ever since I had trouble getting ASDF to work with Lispbox .
Every time I tried , I ran into some will - sapping problem like needing to find a good Windows program for .tar. gz files , or finding the command line flags to get CLISP to run right , or figuring out the best way to setup a folder structure that matches the Unix folders used by most Lispers .
Every time I fixed one problem , I ran into another .
For someone out there trying to do a setup like this , there are lots of good resources , but they are either incomplete or outdated .
For instance , the Common Lisp Cookbook has a very thorough page on Setting Up an IDE with Emacs on Windows or Max OSX , but as far as I can tell , it ’s from 2004 or earlier because it does n’t mention SBCL or SLIME , two of the most popular pieces of CL development software today .
Or when you run into a specific problem , it ’s usually not too hard to find an answer , but it might not match the setup you ’re using .
That ’s why I had to quit using Lispbox , because no one had any clue how it was configured , especially not on Windows .
n00bs did n’t know the answers and the wizards had a traditional setup .
Here are some of the variables that contribute to the combinatorial explosion of configuration , in order or pain caused :
Operating system : Linux ( many flavors ) , Mac , Windows , Cygwin
CL implementation : most common are SBCL , CMUCL , Allegro , LispWorks , CLISP
CL implementation version ( I ran into a problem here )
SLIME version ( stable 2.0 release or CVS snapshot )
Emacs version ( I did n’t run across any problems with this )
I almost forgot , now there ’s Cusp / Eclipse if you do n’t want to use Emacs / SLIME , but right now Cusp is only tested on SBCL .
Maybe someday someone will try out all of those combinations and report , but for today , I did exactly one : Windows XP , CLISP 2.44 , SLIME CVS , and Emacs 22.2 Why CLISP ?
After reading lots of internet , I came to the conclusion that ( aside from the commercial CLs ) , CLISP is the best implementation for Windows users .
The knocks against it are that it ’s slow because it ’s byte - code compiled , it does n’t have threads , and on some points , it ’s ideologically different from CL and other implementations .
Well , the performance is n’t a big concern for me ( plus as I went to press , 2.45 was released with experimental JIT compilation ) , the threads also are n’t a big deal right now , and I think the differences will help me be aware of the considerations for writing portable code .
Also regarding the SBCL windows port , it ’s still considered experimental ( currently v1.013 for Windows ) but people are saying it ’s stable and everything works except the threads .
There ’s even an msi installer for the Windows version .
One of my next projects will be to dive into the SBCL documentation and mailing lists to get a better feel for it .
As far as the philosophy behind this ( and future ) setup guides , I want them to be a ) thorough and b ) instructive .
Instructive ?
If you just want to take my word for everything , that ’s fine , but I want you to know where I got my info from , so I ’ve tried to include links to references for each step .
On to the setup guide !
0. Files to Download
If you want to get started on downloading the setup files , here are the links :
1. Setup Directories
Windows XP loves extremely long pathnames like C : \Documents and Settings \Username \Application Data .
This is okay if for GUI - driven apps , but in Emacs , you ’re not clicking , you ’re typing , and you want short path names .
Also , much ( most ? ) of the open source Common Lisp tools are developed on * nix , so there ’s less impedance mismatch when using stuff off the net if you have a * nix - ish folder structure .
Start with a root folder .
In the pathnames in the rest of this guide , I ’ll refer to it as [ HOME ] .
I used C: \home\ to match the * nix convention of having user files be in / home / username / .
You also need a username directory – I called mine peter and I ’ll refer to it as [ USR ] .
So in my case , [ HOME ] / [ USR ] would be C:\home \peter\ .
Emacs NOTE # 1 : One important point about filenames in Emacs is that they CAN be entered with ‘/’ , but if you prefer to use ‘ \’ , you have to escape it with another back slash , so in Emacs buffers and files , you would enter “ C:/home / ” or “ C:\\home\ \ ” but never “ C:\home\ ” .
The trailing slash is also important because it indicates that it ’s a directory .
Now that you have chosen your [ ROOT ] and [ USR ] values , these are the folders you should setup :
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \site \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \docs \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \lisp \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \info \
[ HOME ] \bin\
2. Setup Emacs
Emacs does not need to be “ installed ” like most Windows apps – it just runs from its directory .
Extract it to [ HOME ] \bin\ .
I changed the folder name from emacs - 22.2 to just emacs , so my path was c:\home \bin\emacs\ .
You run emacs by running the file [ HOME ]\bin\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe .
Emacs settings are stored in a configuration file called “ .emacs ” .
On Windows , the default working folder and .emacs location is C : \Documents and Settings \Username \Application Data , but that ’s too painful to type and it ’s a hidden folder so it ’s not even easy to get through with the GUI .
To have Emacs work in a different folder , create a file called site - start.el in the emacs \site - lisp folder .
In that folder , put the following line ( but change the path to match yours ) :
( setenv " HOME " " [ HOME ] / [ USR ] / " )
( Thanks Nathaniel !
This was probably the biggest annoyance of mine that made me put off finishing setup for so long . )
Emacs NOTE # 2 : Emacs has lots ( and lots and lots ) of keyboard shortcuts , many more than there are letters in the alphabet .
Many of them require multiple keys or a sequence of keys called a “ chord ” .
The two modifier keys used are Control and Alt ( also called Meta ) .
The common way to write chords is to use C- and M- for Control and Meta , so to run the command to close Emacs , you hold down Control and X , then let go , then hold down Control and C .
This is written as C-x C- c.
Sometimes a chord is followed by another letter or the name of a command .
For instance , to undo , you hold Control and x , then let go and hit u .
This is written as C-x u .
Dashes mean press at the same time , space means let go .
Easy !
I made a cheat sheet for common commands in Emacs and SLIME .
Now it ’s time to create your .emacs file .
Run emacs and hit C-x C-f .
This is the find command , which is used to create or open a file .
At the prompt “ Find file : “ , type “ ~/.emacs ” ( without quotes ) .
Right now just put a ; ( that ’s the comment marker in Emacs Lisp files ) and save it by hitting C-x C-s .
There ’s a world of stuff you can put in a .emacs file , but that ’s too much to bite off now .
3. Install CLISP
This is easy if you download the install package ( that ’s the one I linked to ) .
Run the installer and choose [ HOME ] \bin\clisp\ as the install directory .
That ’s it !
4. Setup SLIME
CLISP changed recently ( around version 2.44 – not sure exactly ) and broke compatibility with the SLIME 2.0 release .
This was fixed in development and the CVS snapshot works .
If you try to use the 2.0 release , you ’ll get an error that looks like this :
INTERN ( “ FRAME -UP - 1 ” ) : #< PACKAGE SYSTEM > is locked
So use the CVS snapshot ( which I linked to ) and you should be fine .
Extract the SLIME folder to [ HOME ] \bin\emacs\site -lisp .
( Here ’s a tip about putting emacs code in site - lisp ) .
Now in Emacs , open your .emacs file ( C-x C-f , ~ /.emacs ) and enter the following ( general SLIME instructions , CLISP specific parameters ) , changing your pathnames as usual :
( setq inferior - lisp - program “ [ HOME]/bin/clisp/full/lisp.exe
-B [ HOME ]/bin/clisp/full
-M [ HOME]/bin/clisp/full/lispinit.mem
- ansi - q ” )
( add - to - list ‘ load- path “ [ HOME ] /bin/emacs/site-lisp/slime / ” )
( require ‘ slime )
( slime - setup )
Save the .emacs file ( C- x C-s ) , then run the eval - buffer command ( M - x eval - buffer ) .
This will run the code that you just entered and tell Emacs how to run SLIME .
Now , you start slime with M-x slime and you ’re ready to go !
— — — — — — — — —— ——
–
I hope this works for you – I ran through it on another computer and it worked the first time , so if you use exactly these parts you should be OK .
Please let me know if you run into problems so I can incorporate the fix into my doc .
Many thanks to everyone who I linked to , since they did the coding , testing , and writeups that I used to get here .
More resources to come – tell me what you ’d like to see .
If it ’s something I was planning on doing anyway , I ’ll move it up my queue .
The next guide will probably be setting up your built - in documentation ( Hyperspec , etc ) .

Bill Moyers looks at the parallels between the rhetoric ramping up to the invasion and occupation of Iraq and the aggressive posturing of the White House and their minions against Iran today .
BILL MOYERS : A final update .
Last month Victor Navasky of the COLUMBIA JOURNALISM REVIEW told us about how all the talk about military strikes against Iran reminds him of the arguments made for invading Iraq five years ago VICTOR NAVASKY :
If you read Norman Podhoretz 's account ... where he says that we have a carrier right off the coast of Iran , and all the President has to do is say " go " .
And that the non-military solutions have not worked .
You can't not take it seriously .
BILL MOYERS : Since then , the talk about bombing Iran has only increased .
And the biggest talker of all is the Connecticut hawk , Senator Joe Lieberman .
The Democratic candidate for vice president eight years ago has now endorsed Republican senator John McCain for president and become his alter ego on the Middle East .
Wherever McCain goes , Lieberman is sure to show up .

And the biggest talker of all is the Connecticut hawk , Senator Joe Lieberman .
The Democratic candidate for vice president eight years ago has now endorsed Republican senator John McCain for president and become his alter ego on the Middle East .
Wherever McCain goes , Lieberman is sure to show up .
Earlier this week Lieberman called air strikes against Iran " a distinct possibility , " and on Wednesday he and talk show host Bill Bennett coupled their banter about Hillary Clinton with some hopeful praise for her own hawkish policies toward Iran .
BILL BENNETT : This is a girl who puts on her pearls , goes down , throws down a shot of liquor , and bombs Iran ... you know ... lookout Mrs. Bennett , this is my kind of girl .
JOE LIEBERMAN : ... it does have an appeal to it .
BILL MOYERS : For his part , President Bush this week once again indicates we will be in Iraq for a long , long time .
To pull out he said , to fail to maintain what he calls " a forward presence " in the Middle East , would send the wrong signals .
The President also disclosed that out of respect for the sacrifice of American soldiers and their families , he had given up golf , although there were sightings of him on the course reported after the renunciation .
I 'm not making this up .
That 's it for THE JOURNAL .

Richard Galpin reports from Moscow .
Bob Dole yesterday sent a scalding e-mail to Scott McClellan , excoriating the former White House spokesman as a " miserable creature " who greedily betrayed his former patron for a fast buck .
In an extraordinary message obtained and authenticated by Politico , Dole uses his trademark biting wit to portray McClellan as a classic Washington opportunist .
" There are miserable creatures like you in every administration who do n’t have the guts to speak up or quit if there are disagreements with the boss or colleagues , " Dole wrote in a message sent yesterday morning .
" No , your type soaks up the benefits of power , revels in the limelight for years , then quits and , spurred on by greed , cashes in with a scathing critique . "
Michael Marshall , Dole 's spokesman and colleague at the Alston Bird law firm , confirms the message came from the former senator and presidential candidate .
" Yes , it is authentic , " Marshall wrote in an e-mail .
" In my nearly 36 years of public service I 've known of a few like you , " Dole writes , recounting his years representing Kansas in the House and Senate .
" No doubt you will ' clean up ' as the liberal anti-Bush press will promote your belated concerns with wild enthusiasm .
When the money starts rolling in you should donate it to a worthy cause , something like , ' Biting The Hand That Fed Me . '
Another thought is to weasel your way back into the White House if a Democrat is elected .
That would provide a good set up for a second book deal in a few years "
Dole assures McClellan that he wo n't read the book — " because if all these awful things were happening , and perhaps some may have been , you should have spoken up publicly like a man , or quit your cushy , high - profile job . "
" That would have taken integrity and courage but then you would have had credibility and your complaints could have been aired objectively , " Dole concludes .
" You ’re a hot ticket now , but do n’t you , deep down , feel like a total ingrate ? "
He signs the email simply : " BOB DOLE "
UPDATE : Dole has sent over another e-mail explaining why he felt compelled to speak out .
Read it here .
UPDATE II : Via The Page , I see McClellan has responded to Dole 's comments .
“ I have had time to reflect and go back , and what I ’m saying is sincere , " he said .
“ I have a lot of respect for Sen. Dole . ”

Action movie terrorists , on the other hand , like their plans to have as many interlocking steps as possible , like an intricate Rube Goldberg machine of death and maniacal cackling .
Since we have entirely too much time on our hands , we 're saluting the villains who contrived the most needlessly convoluted terror plots in action movie history .
Real terrorist plots tend to have two steps : blow stuff up , take credit .
Maybe if they 're feeling creative they 'll blow themselves up or light their shoe on fire first .
5 Howard Payne from Speed

Who :
Payne is a disgruntled ex-policeman who likes to blow stuff up .
In Payne 's defense , it 's important to note that his last name is a homophone for " pain , " so after he retired from his first career as a rogue cop , his options were pretty limited to professional wrestler and action - movie bad guy .
The Plot :
In Keanu Reeves movies , even bank robbers turn out to have convoluted M.O.s and bizarre , complex motives .
Do n't all criminals rob banks to fund their search for the perfect wave ?
It 's the movie equivalent of a Mexican restaurant that distracts you from the low quality meat by piling on thick enchilada sauce and playing loud , embarrassing music whenever it 's someone 's birthday .

So what 's it going to be , Payne ?
Dress up as Napoleon and rob the US Mint to fund your life 's goal of snowboarding Mt. Everest ?
Wait , you 're going to blow up a public bus unless the cops give you what you want ?
That ... that actually might work .
It 's simple , to the point .
Christ , it 's like you 're a real terrorist or something .
Wait , why are you still talking ?
What do you mean the bus only blows up if it goes below 50 MPH ?
Goddamnit , that does n't even make sense !
Are you protesting the speed limit ?
Of course , every bus will eventually go above 50 MPH and slow back down , so you still might be in the clear .
You just need to make sure you keep your stupid loophole a secret until the bomb blows up .
And not that we should have to tell you this , but when we say you should n't tell anyone , that includes the explosives expert who , despite his dazed expression and perpetually stoned manner of speaking , is the only person who 's ever come close to being able to catch you .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You would want to keep him as far away from your convoluted , gaping loophole as possible .
Agreed ?
Why It Failed :
Goddamnit Payne , you told the bomb expert !
In fact , he 's the first person you told !
And then you let him get on the bus and spend an hour and a half trying to figure out how to screw up your plot !
It 's right around here where we have to stop questioning your intelligence and start questioning whether you want to be a terrorist at all .
The Spanish economy has been a driving force for economic activity in the euro area for more than a decade , with year - on - year GDP growth exceeding the average rate of expansion in the euro area in every quarter since 1995 .
The good times are now over .
Turmoil in the world 's financial markets has coincided with the bursting of Spain 's decade - long housing bubble , raising fears of a deeper and more abrupt economic slowdown than previously thought .
Gloom time
The weakness began last year in the housing market — the major driver of the Spanish economy over the last ten years — with a decline in residential building permits of 11 % in 2007 ( in the fourth quarter alone the number of permits slumped by a disturbing 29 % year on year ) .
And the danger signs are now spreading to other sectors of the economy .
Price - adjusted retail sales contracted by around 2 % year on year in each of the three months to February 2008 , while consumer confidence fell back to its lowest level for more than a decade in the first quarter .
The manufacturing sector is also taking a hit .
According to Eurostat data , year - on - year growth in manufacturing orders has slowed down markedly since the start of 2008 , with the European Commission 's business confidence survey revealing that sentiment in the services industry in March had fallen to its weakest level since the inception of the survey in 1996 ( admittedly a good period for the Spanish economy ) .
The Economist Intelligence Unit has cut its forecast for Spanish GDP growth to just 1 % in both 2008 and in 2009 ( previously 1.9 % in both years ) , compared with an annual average rate of expansion of 3.8 % in 1998 - 2007 .
The Economist magazine poll of major forecasters from April 19th still showed average forecasts of 2.4 % for 2008 and 2.1 % for 2009 .
Despite being well below consensus , we still see the risks primarily on the downside , particularly for 2009 .
The main reason for our pessimism stems from our view that construction and housing booms rarely peter out smoothly .
Unstable foundations
Spain has clearly gone through such a boom over the past ten years .
One of the clearest indicators of this has been the rising share of residential investment to GDP , which increased to 9.3 % in 2006 and 2007 , compared with an average for Spain since the early 1970s of 5.5 % and a current average of around 6.5 % for industrialised economies .
Rising employment in the construction sector has accounted for a substantial share of overall employment growth in recent years , while house prices are estimated to have increased by 190 % between 1997 and 2007 — only Ireland and the UK have experienced a similar hike in prices among major industrialised countries .
At the same time , household liabilities surged from 47 % of disposable income at the end of 1997 to 135 % at the end of 2007 .
Although this was backed in part by easier access to borrowing resulting from lower interest rates ( a consequence of euro area accession ) , it has also reflected increased leverage among consumers .
That said , further rises are now unlikely given the tightening in credit conditions in response to continued financial market uncertainty .
A return to a more normal level of housing investment would take off some 3 percentage points of GDP , and in order to absorb earlier excess construction , a temporary fall to below the normal level would probably be necessary .
The experience of Sweden , where housing investment declined by 71 % between the peak in 1990 and the first ( not final ) trough in 1995 , suggests that such adjustments can be dramatic .
Apart from the direct effect of weaker construction investment , private consumption would also be affected by a decline in consumer confidence and negative wealth effects .
Most estimates suggest that these wealth effects would be weaker than in the UK or the US , not least because conditions for home equity withdrawal in Spain are more stringent .
However , the high level of household indebtedness and the extraordinarily high current - account deficit ( a measure of savings of the economy as a whole ) — which widened to an estimated 9.1 % of GDP in 2007 — suggests substantial potential for an increase in household savings , which automatically would depress private consumption .
Financial fears
All these strains will be tough on the Spanish economy .
The global financial sector crisis has started to contribute to the pain by tightening access to credit , a serious concern for an economy showing signs of excessive leverage .
However , the domestic financial sector seems unlikely to be a major source of trouble itself ; it is more likely to be the victim of problems created elsewhere in the Spanish economy and internationally .
Spanish covered bonds ( the principal instrument for banks to finance housing loans ) are backed by mortgages , but the banks retain ultimate responsibility for the repayment of the bonds .
This means that unlike banks and housing lenders in the US , Spanish institutions had no incentive to sell mortgages to borrowers who could not afford to repay them .
Consequently , there is no equivalent to the sub - prime mortgage lending sector in Spain .
Spanish banks also have full recourse to all the assets of a defaulting borrower .
In the US , banks only have access to the house for which the mortgage was issued , so that borrowers with negative equity have a strong incentive to default .
This firmer incentive structure suggests that the impact on the Spanish financial system will be less dramatic .
However , the size of the housing overhang means it will still be a massive hit .
Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez , the governor of the Bank of Spain ( the Spanish central bank ) , which has key responsibilities for banking supervision , said in a speech on April 16th that banks have built provisions and buffers " that would enable shocks of an order of magnitude comparable to those experienced at the height of the crisis in the 1990s to be absorbed " .
Although data suggest that the economy is in a better position to cope with a crisis than was the case in the early 1990s , when growth slowed to 0.9 % in 1992 and contracted by 1 % in 1993 — at that time the public finances were in deficit , unemployment had risen to over 20 % and inflation was higher than it is currently — the continued uncertainty in the international financial markets means that the downturn could be just as bad and take much longer to absorb .
Limited manoeuvre
Apart from the scale of the recent housing boom , policy constraints are an important factor that could have a detrimental effect .
Although there are downside risks to growth prospects for many euro area countries , the Spanish economy is likely to perform much worse than the euro area as a whole .
Monetary policy for the euro area is generally conducted with a view to the euro area in aggregate , and with Spain 's economy accounting for just under 12 % of euro area GDP , the European Central Bank will not take much action aimed specifically at stimulating the Spanish economy .
With Spain being a member of the euro area ( and a departure from the club out of the question ) , a devaluation of the currency to improve competitiveness and boost export demand is also not an option ( although the high , and rising , current - account deficit would suggest a serious overvaluation ) .
The fiscal situation may be brighter , but support would still be limited .
The general government budget balance showed a solid surplus of 2.2 % of GDP in 2007 .
However , the surplus has been boosted in recent years by strong economic activity , and a period of slower growth would lead to a much weaker outcome ( the downturn in 1992 led to a deterioration in the fiscal balance of 3.3 percentage points in just one year ) .
The government is in the process of approving a fiscal stimulus package worth € 10bn ( US $ 16bn ) , which includes a €400 annual rebate to every taxpayer , and can be expected to boost public infrastructure investment in an effort to sustain activity and employment in the construction sector .
With social spending set to rise as the slowdown deepens , the government 's budget surplus is likely to evaporate quickly .
Although Spain 's low level of government debt — an estimated 35.2 % of GDP in 2007 — suggests ample room for stimulus measures , the restrictions of the EU 's Stability and Growth Pact , which requires the budget deficit to be kept below 3 % of GDP , will put a rein on fiscal expansion .
The Detroit News today reported an interview with GM vice - chairman Bob Lutz .
Lutz verified for the first time publicly that a Chevy Volt prototype with an actual full - sized lithium ion battery is actually running .
To me this marks a dramatic and critical turning point in the nearly year and half we 've been following the car 's development .
This is the PROOF of CONCEPT .
Yeah we have been sort of sure they could pull it off , but the running of this mule verifies it .
From what I know the mule has all of the basic components the final Chevy Volt will although in rough form , now most importantly including the full 16 kWh 40 + mile range lithium - ion battery pack .
Keep in mind the mule is using a late model Malibu shell that haswith the final design of the car .
It 's a big day here at GM - Volt.com folks , time to rejoice ... just a little over 2 years left to the showroom .
Stay tuned .

University of California , Merced professor Sean Malloy recently unearthed 10 previously - unpublished photographs illustrating the aftermath on the Hiroshima bombing .
They are not for the weak of stomach .
" I came across these will research my recent book on the bomb , Atomic Tragedy , " he tells DANGER ROOM .
" They were found in a cave outside Hiroshima by a U.S. serviceman who was part of the occupation forces .
We have no information about who took the photos , what became of him / her , or why the photos ended up in a cave .
The serviceman held onto to them in his personal collection until 1998 , when he donated them to the Hoover Archives [ at Stanford University ] with the provision that they not be reproduced until 2008 .
I included three of these photos in my book , but I wanted to make them all publicly available . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former presidential contender John Edwards said on Friday he would not be Democratic front - runner Barack Obama ’s running mate , but did not rule out taking a role in an Obama administration .
“ Wo n’t happen , ” Edwards told NBC ’s “ Today ” program when asked if he would be Obama ’s vice presidential pick .
“ This is not something I ’m interested in . ”
Edwards , the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004 , dropped out of the presidential race in January after failing to win any early primaries .
On Wednesday , he gave his coveted endorsement to Obama over rival Hillary Clinton .
Asked if he had spoken Obama about a role in his administration if he beat Republican John McCain in November , Edwards said , “ Only in the most abstract way . ”
Edwards said Obama had told him , “ I want you on my team .
I want to help you both in the campaign and with the work we want to do when I ’m the president . ”
His endorsement of Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , came the day after Clinton won a landslide victory in West Virginia that renewed doubts about Obama ’s ability to draw white low - income voters .
Edwards denied his endorsement had been deliberately timed to take the wind out of her victory .
“ It was the right time to do it .
I made the decision that the public should know at this point what my view is , ” he said .
He said he had voted for Obama in the recent North Carolina primary and had decided “ that it ’s time for Democrats to start uniting around this candidate . ”
Obama has an almost insurmountable lead over Clinton in the race for delegates to the Democratic convention in August , where the party will choose its candidate for the presidency .
His lead has increased pressure on Clinton to end her campaign , but she has vowed to remain in the race until the last of the state - by - state nominating contests on June 3 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The world is on course to halve extreme poverty by 2015 , but Africa will fall far short of the U.N. ’s Millennium Development Goals , the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday .

A new report by the global institutions also warned that urgent action was needed to tackle climate change , which threatens to exact a hefty toll on particularly poor countries and reverse progress in fighting poverty .
The 2008 Global Monitoring Report , released ahead of the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington this weekend , said strong economic growth in much of the developing world had contributed to the decline in global poverty .
It said the number of extreme poor -- those living under $ 1 a day -- declined by 278 million between 1990 and 2004 , and by 150 million in the last five years of that period .
Globally about 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty , the report added .
The largest reduction in poverty rates was in regions with the strongest growth , in particular in East Asia , including emerging powerhouses China and India , the report said .
Still , in Africa progress to cut poverty rates has been uneven , it said , with 18 countries showing strong economic growth of about 5.5 percent over the past decade .
Twenty others in Africa , however , many hit by conflict , were trapped in low growth , averaging around 2 percent annually .
The report also said that while some progress had been made in meeting eight globally agreed development goals by 2015 , prospects were gravest for reducing child and maternal mortality , with serious shortfalls also likely in primary school education , nutrition and sanitation .
Robert Zoellick , the World Bank president , said he was personally worried about shortfalls in fighting hunger and malnutrition , which he termed “ the forgotten ” millennium development goal .
He said high global food and energy prices had focused increased attention on the issue , but more was needed , especially since higher prices were likely to last for several years .
Zoellick and IMF managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , also pointed to dangers for growth in the developing world from recent financial market turbulence , which began with subprime mortgage market problems in the United States .
Turning to the environment , the report said poverty reduction may not be sustainable if forests are lost , fisheries depleted , water or air is polluted and soil degraded .
It said water scarcity and deforestation were already a factor in the developing world and are valuable assets and sources of income to poor countries .
“ The depletion of natural resources and environmental degradation undermines the long - term growth prospects of many developing countries , ” the report said .
It called for coordinated global action to avert further climate change , adding that extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods in the world ’s poorest countries may also exacerbate conflicts and cross-country migration .
A couple of weeks ago , while enjoying an adult beverage at a local pub , I had a
rare opportunity to feel pleased with a marketing campaign .
And no , it was n’t
the Lone Star beer campaign that employs a little tongue - in- cheek
Texas chauvinism to hawk its wares .
This one was for Trojan condoms .
First , you see the posters in
the bar ’s bathroom : A picture of a barful of pigs hitting on reluctant women ,
with one man talking to one very interested woman .
It ’s a reference
to the TV ad campaign that compares men who
refuse to use condoms to barnyard animals .
To reinforce the message — " Evolve : Use
a condom every time " — the bottom of the pint glasses had little
pictures of pig noses in them , with the Trojan branding and slogan on
the reverse .
It ’s a brilliant strategy ,
and could only be better if they had condom machines in the bathrooms .
This pub is n’t cruise -y , but a lot of people go there
on dates .
So Trojan is still grabbing people with a safe sex message
right before they get into a situation where unsafe sex often happens–after
a date that involves drinking alcohol .
The ads use humor to take
the edge off , but also bluntly address one of the most significant unspoken barriers to getting people to use condoms every time : a lot of the time , women are afraid to request or men actively resist condom use .
The uncomfortable
fact is that men have more of the responsibility for use with condoms , but
women run a greater risk in unprotected sex .
( I ’m sure it works the other way around , but I suspect the responsibility / risk
ratio means that it ’s more common that men resist and women cave . )
All I could think while examining
this marketing campaign was , " Why have n’t we seen more of this ?
Campaigns like this should be in high school buses and coffee shops ,
too .
Plus , this should have started long ago . "
But America is in short supply of the sort of common sense that says that
condom ads should be located where people are in danger of having unsafe sex ,
and that said ads should bluntly address barriers to using condoms properly .
When the first ads from this campaign came out , CBS and Fox balked
at showing them .
You ca n’t blame prudery .
Fox aired this blunt advertisement
for Victoria ’s Secret lingerie during the 2008 Superbowl .
The meaning –this underwear
is a preliminary for the Hawt Sex right after the game !
–could n’t
have been more explicit .
I ’m not a prudish person by any means , but
watching model Adriana Lima flop around and spread her legs while wearing
skimpy underwear in front of my friends , and suffering the knowledge
that this was supposed to inspire middle - aged sports fans around the
country to rip off their team jerseys and hump their wives atop king - sized
beds , well , it all made me blush pretty hard .
To Fox , that was acceptable ,
but a Trojan ad where everyone kept their clothes on and innuendo was
employed more effectively was somehow off - limits .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .
SUBSCRIBE
Of course , Fox explained the
decision in bluntly anti-woman tones , arguing the use of condoms
to prevent pregnancy offended their network standards .
Presumably , the Victoria’s
Secret ad is acceptable , as long as the viewer thinks she ’s posing
half - naked as if to say , " Oh you hot football fan studs , impregnate
me now . "
I should n’t be surprised .
Obvious double standards like that fly under the radar of far too many
people .
I ’m thinking specifically
of the popular right wing blogger The Anchoress , who in a bizarre
tirade that was
presumably about how everyone should shut up about sex , made it clear
she meant , " Everyone but me because it ’s different when it ’s me . "
But maybe she should have re-thought sharing information like this :
I like various positions !
With the lights on and off !
In the daytime and the nighttime !
In the
ocean and in the windowseat !
I like sex on Sunday mornings !
Can I get
an " AMEN " for Cunnilingus ?
AMEN for cunnilingus !
Can I get a " You
know how to whistle , do n’t you " for Fellatio ?
" You know how to
whistle , do n’t you ? "
Can I get a " Ride ’em Cowboy " for my husband ?
Yippeekayae !
Can I get an " arghghghghg " for Readi Whip and maraschino
cherries ?
Arghghghghghg !
What , no brownies ?
Which just made everyone wonder
if she ’s so right wing because she suffers from a staggering lack
of imagination .
Contrast her entitled attitudes about her own
sex life with her brutal lack
of generosity for others .
If you can follow : if you ’re an American married right wing nut ,
then you get to have sex in various positions with extremely silly nicknames
and you get to pat yourself on the back for it .
But if you ’re
from Myanmar and your community has been ravaged by a typhoon and your
access to health care is limited , then you deserve to die of AIDS for
" Ride ‘em Cowboy . "
Got it .
This double standard–where
explicit sex is fine but explicit discussions of safety make people
squirmy–must play a huge role in inconsistent condom use .
The squeamishness around the Trojan ad is just one example .
For
once , we have an ad that has the potential to help educate people about negotiating for condom use as well as sell a
product .
Another example that comes
to mind for me is the role of lubrication in condom usage .
A
recent episode of " Sex Is Fun " alerted me to this problem .
Many people , women especially , think they are allergic to latex who
are n’t because they had bad reactions to condoms , including pain or itching .
In fact , many of them simply are n’t using enough lubrication .
So now you have a situation where women are shunning condoms because
of these side effects , when a bit of accurate , straightforward , and , yes , explicit education would go a long way .
But even the more explicit
lubrication ads for companies like KY dance around the nitty - gritty
of how you should use their product with a condom .
This is not because they do n’t see the sales potential in that ,
I ’m sure .
It ’s because of the double standard .
You can
talk about sex explicitly , but you ca n’t talk about safety .
Campaigners say several hundred monks have joined protests
Witnesses said police were at Drepung and Sera monasteries on Thursday .
A third monastery , Ganden , was also surrounded , a US - based group said .
The move follows at least two days of protests by monks against Chinese rule .
Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that shops had been set on fire in Lhasa , amid continuing unrest .
Confirming reports from Tibet is difficult because both access and the media are tightly controlled .
But rights groups say the demonstrations are the largest in Tibet in almost two decades , and have spread from Lhasa to rural areas and neighbouring provinces .
' Three layers '
The protests began on Monday when Tibetans around the world marked the 49th anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule .
Unconfirmed reports then suggested that as many as 600 monks from Drepung and Sera monasteries joined peaceful rallies on Tuesday and that police used tear gas to disperse them .
There are also unconfirmed reports that monks have been detained , and that monks at the Sera monastery are on hunger strike .
According to the US - based International Campaign for Tibet , three major monasteries in Lhasa are now " under lockdown and surrounded by troops " .
An unidentified man inside Sera monastery told the Associated Press news agency that it was " surrounded by many people " .
Another Lhasa resident told the agency that Drepung monastery was encircled by " three layers " of troops .
Two monks there were in critical condition after attempting suicide , US - based Radio Free Asia reported .
On Thursday , Chinese authorities played down the protests - which coincided with similar demonstrations in India and Nepal .
" In the past couple of days , a few monks in Lhasa have made some disturbances in an effort to cause unrest , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gan said .
" Thanks to the efforts of the local government and the democratic administration of the temples , the situation in Lhasa has been stabilised . "
Beijing claims sovereignty over Tibet , but many Tibetans remain loyal to their spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 and currently lives in exile in India .
A surge in Tibetan activism could become a major concern for China in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics , correspondents say .
Are you in Tibet or do you know anyone currently in Tibet ?
Did you witness the rallies this week ?

Conditions are notoriously harsh for new recruits in the Russian army
Almost an entire battalion of Russian soldiers committed suicide last year , the country 's chief military prosecutor has said .
A total of 341 military personnel killed themselves in 2007 , a reduction of 15 % on the previous year .
But Sergei Fridinsky said the numbers were worrying and called for a national strategy to prepare men for service .
Bullying , often extremely violent , is rife in the army and is the most common reason for suicide .
" Almost a battalion of military servicemen - 341 people - were irrevocably lost in the past year as a result of suicide , " Mr Fridinsky said .
The BBC's Russia analyst , Steven Eke , says dedovshchina - literally , rule of the elders , a culturally specific , often very violent , form of bullying , is cited as the most frequent trigger for young soldiers taking their own lives .
Conditions of military service - compulsory for one year for Russian men - are so harsh that many parents and young men offer bribes to avoid getting conscripted .
Yet Mr Fridinsky said that about half of the suicides were among professional , contract - based soldiers , who would not face this kind of bullying .
He suggested that Russia use the experience of the US in Iraq and Afghanistan to help their troops deal with the psychological trauma of combat .
Danica Patrick WINS Indy Japan 300 ( Photos )
of Andretti Green Racing , in her 50th start in the series , won the Bridgestone Indy Japan 300 race on Sunday , April 20 , 2008 on the 1.5 mile oval track is at Twin Ring Motegi , northeast of Tokyo .
She is the first female to win an IndyCar race .
After three years on the circuit , the 26 year old finally got the breakthrough win that has eluded her until now .
Patrick completed the 200 lap race in one hour 51 minutes .
Second place went to Helio Castroneves , who won Dancing with the Stars last season with partner Julianne Hough .
A New Zealander , Scott Dixon took third place honors .
Patrick had this to say about her triumph :
Finally .
This is a long time coming .
I 've been asked so many times when I 'm going to win my first race , and finally , no more of those questions .
I had a lot of opportunities last year that were missed due to bad luck .
I can only say I 'm just glad it 's over . "
" It was a fuel strategy race , but my team called it perfectly for me .
I know I was on the same strategy as Helio and when I passed him for the lead , I could n't believe it .
This is fabulous .
I kind of knew from the start that if we had enough fuel that I was going to have a chance because I was saving fuel from the first lap and nobody else looked like they were .
I always said that I would n't do this , but on my last lap I was kind of excited .
I was as relieved as I expected I would be years ago , how I knew I would fell when I won my first race . "
Patrick made her IndyCar debut in 2005 after years on European junior formula tours and in the Toyota Atlantic series .
Her previous best finish was second place at Detroit last September .
The next race will be the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300 in Kansas in a week .
Patrick has a HOT photo portfolio with GoDaddy .
Check out Patrick 's recent remarks about the new weight rules that have her hot under the collar .

A press release from House Republican leader John Boehner asserts that Barack Obama told me that Israel is a " constant sore " that infects American foreign policy .
" Israel is a critical American ally and a beacon of democracy in the Middle East , not a `constant sore ' as Barack Obama claims , " Boehner 's statement reads .
Mr. Boehner , I 'm sure , is a terribly busy man , with many burdensome responsibilities , so I have to assume that he simply did n't have time to read the entire Obama interview , or even the entire paragraph , or even a single clause .
If he had , of course , he would have seen that Obama was clearly calling the Middle East conflict , and not Israel , a sore .
Why , there 's no one who would disagree that the Middle East conflict is a " sore , " is there ?
I have no doubt that Mr. Boehner will issue a correction to his press release in which he states the obvious , which is that Obama expressed -- in twelve different ways -- his support for Israel to me .
If he does n't , however , I would , sadly , have to agree with my colleague , the less - forgiving Andrew Sullivan , who called Boehner 's statement a " flat - out lie . "
In fact , I would add to Andrew 's post , by calling Boehner 's statement mendacious , duplicitous , gross , and comically refutable .
So Mr. Boehner , do the right thing , and correct the record .
I 'll be happy to post the correction right here .

The life of 20 - year - old Emine , and her 24 - year - old husband Ramazan Çalçoban was pretty much the normal life of any couple in a separation process .
After deciding to split up , the two kept having bitter arguments over the cellphone , sending text messages to each other until one day Ramazan wrote " you change the topic every time you run out of arguments . "
That day , the lack of a single dot over a letter — product of a faulty localization of the cellphone 's typing system — caused a chain of events that ended in a violent blood bath ( Warning : offensive language ahead . )
Advertisement
The surreal mistake happened because Ramazan 's sent a message and Emine 's cellphone did n't have an specific character from the Turkish alphabet : the letter " ı " or closed i .
While " i " is available in all phones in Turkey — where this happened — the closed i apparently does n't exist in most of the terminals in that country .
Advertisement
The use of " i " resulted in an SMS with a completely twisted meaning : instead of writing the word " sıkısınca " it looked like he wrote " sikisince . "
Ramazan wanted to write " You change the topic every time you run out of arguments " ( sounds familiar enough ) but what Emine read was , " You change the topic every time they are fucking you " ( sounds familiar too . )

Emine then showed the message to her father , who — enraged — called Ramazan , accusing him of treating his daughter as a prostitute .
Ramazan went to the family 's home to apologize , only to be greeted by the father , Emine , two sisters and a lot of very sharp knives .
Injured and bleeding , with a knife on his chest , Ramazan tried to escape .
Emine was still trying to finish him on the door , but he managed to take the knife out of his chest and attacked back , wounding her .
Ramazan finally escaped , and was caught by the police , but Emine bleed to dead as the family waited for an ambulance to cross Ankara 's hellish traffic to reach their home .

Confused by all the events , he later killed himself in jail .
Apparently it's not the first incident of this kind caused by the damned dot on top of the letter i .
The local press has pointed out that the faulty localization of cellphones in Turkey is causing " serious problems " when it comes to certain " delicate words " in Turkish , and they are calling to enhance localization of technology to avoid these mistakes .

Alternatively , the press could ask for banning knives from the homes of demonstrably stupid people .

Giving people fish or teaching them to fish ?
A few years back , I had a meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , the Ruler of Dubai , Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE .
I told him of the humanitarian work we did .
He listened attentively , and kept a silence after my explanation .
Then he said candidly : " You know , you are giving people fish , instead of teaching them how to fish .
Give a person a fish and he will eat for a day , teach him how to fish and he will have food for the rest of his life ! "
I was quick to respond : " Your Highness , when people are starving , they are not interested in being taught how to fish .
If we give them fishlings for their pond , they will eat it , rather using them for breeding .
Our organisation gives people the fish , so they are not starving anymore , and have the energy to be taught how to fish , and to fish themselves .
Other organisations we work closely with , teach them how to fish , how to breed fishlings .
After that , others come in and teach them not to overfish their pond , or even to market their excess harvest , set up funding mechanisms to sell their harvest beyond their own village .
We all work hand in hand , each of us has its own role . "
How true are we to our aid commitments ?
This was then .
But at this moment , there is a growing concern and dissatisfaction in the aid world .
How well have we done in the past decades .
Have we really followed our own reasonings and explanations ..?
Or were they mere justifications for our own existence ?
The global food crisis hitting the poorest people first , is an objective proof we - the international aid community - have not done well enough .
Have we - all of us - not concentrated too much on giving people fish , rather than teaching them how to be independent from foreign aid ?
How much of it could have been avoided ?
How can we learn from our lessons ?
While the international focus is on the global food crisis , it is the right time to highlight the importance of not only concentrating on short term solutions .
Short term solutions for hunger are like drops of water on a hot plate .
Let 's give people fish , but also concentrate on " teaching them how to fish " .
In the context of the global food crisis , this means concentrating not only on emergency food aid , but also on achieving sustainable food security and reducing poverty in developing countries through non -for - profit and transparent scientific research in the fields of agriculture , forestry , fisheries , policy , and environment .
I explicitly exclude the agricultural research done by the likes of Monsanto and Cargill , international commercial giants who only aim at increasing their profit margin , often to the detriment of the farmers in poorer countries .
Let 's rather have a look at the benevolent work of organisations like the CGIAR , the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research .
Agricultural aid research , a proven success .
The CGIAR has a proven success track record ( Source ) :
- Successful biological control of the cassava mealybug and green mite , both devastating pests of a root crop that is vital for food security in sub-Saharan Africa .
The economic benefits of this work are estimated at more than $ 4 billion .
- Increasing smallholder dairy production in Kenya improving childhood nutrition while generating jobs .
This award - winning project with smallholder dairies has contributed up to 80 percent of the milk products sold in the country .
- New rice varieties for Africa , which combine the high yields of Asian rice with African rice ’s resistance to local pests and diseases .
Currently sown on 200,000 hectares in upland areas , they are helping reduce national rice import bills and generating higher incomes in rural communities .
- An agroforestry system called “ fertilizer tree fallows , ” which renews soil fertility in Southern Africa , adopted by than 66,000 farmers in Zambia .
- Widespread adoption of resource - conserving “ zero - till ” technology in the vital rice - wheat systems of South Asia .
Employed by close to a half million farmers on more than 3.2 million hectares , this technology has generated benefits estimated at US $ 147 million through higher crop yields , lower production costs and savings in water and energy .
- A flood - tolerant version of a rice variety grown on six million hectares in Bangladesh .
The new variety enables farmers to obtain yields two to three times those of the non-tolerant version under prolonged submergence of rice crops , a situation that will become more common as a result of climate change .
- A new method for detecting and reducing by 100 % aflatoxin , a deadly poison that infects crops , making them unfit for local consumption or export benefiting farmers throughout sub-Saharan Africa .
- More than 50 varieties of recently developed drought - tolerant maize varieties being grown on a total of about one million hectares across eastern and southern Africa
- A simple methodology for integrating agriculture with aquaculture to bolster income and food supplies in areas of southern Africa where the agricultural labor force has been devastated by HIV / AIDS , doubling the income of 1,200 households in Malawi .
- Etcetera , etcetera , etcetera ....
Digging our own grave .
All good news .
Except that the focus on emergency food aid seems to have drawn worldwide attention - and funding - away from long term agricultural research .
Proof of the matter is that while U.S. President George W. Bush recently ordered up $ 200 million in emergency food aid , with a follow - up of another $ 755 million , the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) is cutting as much as 75 % of their funding to the CGIAR ( See Science Magazine ) .
USAID 's support to the CGIAR in 2006 was $ 56 million or about 12 % of the CGIAR ’s core budget .
And USAID is not the only one to blame .
Look at this graph illustrating the worldwide trend of foreign aid ( which excludes relief aid - as the graph would then look even worse ! ) going up , versus the downward trend of in agricultural aid .

Here is another interesting graph , comparing the annual budget of the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) , one of the CGIAR 's research centers , and the global rice stock pile volume , using the latter as a measure for consumption versus demand on rice .
Now is there not a strange correlation to be noticed ?
This can not be coincidence .
Talking about the IRRI , here is an example of how , by cutting back transparent and not - for - profit agricultural research is as bad as digging one 's own grave :
The brown plant hopper , an insect no bigger than a gnat , is multiplying by the billions and chewing through rice paddies in East Asia , threatening the diets of many poor people .
China , the world ’s biggest rice producer , announced on May 7 that it was struggling to control the rapid spread of the insects there .
A plant hopper outbreak can destroy 20 percent of a harvest .
The damage to rice crops , occurring at a time of scarcity and high prices , could have been prevented .
Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute say that they know how to create rice varieties resistant to the insects but that budget cuts have prevented them from doing so .

In the 1960s , population growth was far outrunning food production , threatening famine in many poor countries .
Wealthier nations joined forces with the poor countries to improve crop yields .
Yields soared , and by the 1980s , the threat of starvation had receded in most of the world .
With Europe and the United States offering their farmers heavy subsidies that encouraged production , grain became abundant worldwide , and prices fell .
Many poor countries , instead of developing their own agriculture , turned to the world market to buy cheap rice and wheat .
In 1986 , Agriculture Secretary John Block called the idea of developing countries feeding themselves “ an anachronism from a bygone era , ” saying they should " just buy American " .

And this attitude got the world into the mess it is in today : a demand ( the world population ) outgrowing the supply ( food production ) ...
The below graph clearly illustrates this trend ( the food production - in purple - is represented by the total production of grain in the world ) .
We need to push the international community for long - term agricultural research aiming solely at making developing countries food self - sufficient , without any commercial interests at heart , if we want to resolve this food crisis and avoid it from ever happening again .
Here is one way how you can help : sign the petition urging USAID to maintain its support for the CGIAR 's food research centers .
Maybe , just maybe , we will be in time to turn this food crisis , into an opportunity , and really teach people how to fish , rather than just giving them fish to eat .
Maybe , just maybe queues for food hand - outs in developing countries could be a thing of a past .

This post is in a raw , data dump format right now .
Everywhere that I ’ve seen this story being discussed on the Internet , there are a lot of anonymous comments saying that Roland Carnaby made it all up ; that he just imagined that he was in the CIA , Photoshopped himself into a picture of the lobby of CIA headquarters , created the plaques and commemorations himself .
All of that is possible .
In fact , it may even be likely .
Take some time to read , Mercenary by Tom Junod .
Was Roland Carnaby another “ Zeke ” type character ?
Again , maybe , even probably so .
However , there is a mountain of stuff here that is so odd that it practically left a bitter taste in my mouth just from reading it .
I do n’t know what the “ National Security Command Center ” is , but that ’s the organization listed as the owner of the vehicle Carnaby was driving when he was killed .
And maybe a total faker can become the president of a local chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers .
Right ?
Let ’s keep an eye out for new developments .

Click2Houston : Suspect Shot In Police Chase Dies
POSTED : 11:53 am CDT April 29 , 2008
UPDATED : 5:54 pm CDT April 29 , 2008
HOUSTON — A man died Tuesday afternoon after leading police on a high - speed chase throughout Houston that ended in gunfire , KPRC Local 2 reported .
Investigators said officers stopped a driver for speeding on the South Freeway near Orem Drive on Tuesday morning and he took off .
Detectives said the chase went onto the North and Katy freeways before the driver got onto the West Loop .
The motorist eventually stopped the SUV on the southbound feeder road of the West Loop near Post Oak Boulevard about 50 minutes later , police said .
There was a short standoff and officers tried to break out the window on the passenger ’s side of the SUV .
Officials said the driver did not respond to initial commands to exit the vehicle .
“ This went back and forth with the officers trying to get the guy to roll down his window , show his hands and exit the vehicle , ” said Sgt. John Chomiak with the Houston Police Department .
When he did step out , the driver reached for something under the driver ’s seat , officials said .
Police said they spotted a shiny object , and Sgt. A.J. Washington and Officer C.A. Foster fired once , hitting the man .
“ They see the suspect exit the vehicle , turn around , reach down underneath the driver ’s seat and that ’s when the officers shot , ” Chomiak said .
The man then tumbled out of the vehicle and fell to the ground .
Officers handcuffed the driver , who lay motionless on the pavement until an ambulance arrived .
Officers leaned down and spoke to him as they waited for the ambulance to arrive .
The driver , whose name was not released , died at Ben Taub Hospital .
He was only identified as a 52 - year - old man .
Investigators said two handguns and a shotgun were found inside the SUV , including one that was within the driver ’s reach .
No vehicles were hit during the chase .
Traffic along the West Loop South was backed up for miles while police conducted an investigation on the frontage road and shut down the busy area for more than three hours .

Click2Houston : Friend : Chase Suspect Was In Intelligence
By Elizabeth Scarborough
POSTED : 10:02 am CDT April 30 , 2008

THE WOODLANDS , Texas —
Family and friends said Roland Carnaby was the man shot by Houston officers after a police chase and that he was in intelligence , KPRC Local 2 reported .
Local 2 obtained a photograph of him standing next to Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt .
Alan Helfman said Carnaby , 52 , was a wonderful friend who would not say much about his work .
“ I just know he was involved in intelligence , ” said Helfman .
“ He was highly intelligent .
He spoke seven languages fluently , and he always wanted to meet law enforcement . ”
His family also said he worked in law enforcement for the federal government with the CIA and FBI .
“ He knows better than to run .
He should have never run , ” said Helfman .
The chase started around 10:15 a.m. Tuesday on Highway 288 at Orem .
It lasted nearly 50 minutes .
“ The officers , when they discharged their weapons , were in fear of their safety , ” said Sgt. John Chomiak with the Houston Police Department .
Local 2 caught the final standoff on tape .
Once the black SUV stopped on the West Loop feeder road near Woodway , the vehicle was surrounded .
Officer C.A. Foster tried to break out the window on the passenger side .
Sgt. A.J. Washington kept his gun trained on the driver .
The driver opened his door like he was getting out .
Washington walked around front , and the driver looked like he was reaching under his seat for something .
That ’s when both officers fired .
“ It ’s just horrible when you know someone that well and watch him fall like a dog , ” said Helfman .
The officers said they saw something shiny in the driver ’s hand , and knew he had a concealed handgun license at the time of the shooting .
Detectives later found three weapons in the SUV — a shotgun and two pistols .
They said one was within reach .
Helfman said that ’s no surprise but believes it was just a big misunderstanding .
His family said Carnaby was on the phone with the FBI moments before he was shot , trying to get them to verify that he was an intelligence officer to HPD .
They said they hope Carnaby is remembered above all else for being a patriot .
His autopsy is supposed to be performed Wednesday .

Click2Houston : Credentials Show Chase Suspect In CIA
POSTED : 4:40 pm CDT April 30 , 2008
UPDATED : 5:10 pm CDT April 30 , 2008
HOUSTON — Police are trying to verify whether a man officers shot and killed after a chase was a CIA agent , ” KPRC Local 2 reported on Wednesday .
Investigators found credentials that showed Roland Carnaby , 52 , worked for the Central Intelligence Agency .
Carnaby died after a nearly hour - long police chase Tuesday morning that started on Highway 288 and ended on Woodway .
Friends and family said there was proof inside Carnaby ’s SUV that he was an intelligence officer , as they claimed .
Investigators are working to verify the documents and Carnaby ’s real identity .
“ There are credentials in the car that we have seized and that was the indication — that he worked with the CIA , ” said Capt .
Steve Jett with the Houston Police Department .
Police said a top CIA official was headed to Houston to verify the documents .
The CIA did not comment .
“ They could have been made up .
They look authentic , but you can do a lot of things with a computer , ” Jett said .
As condolences poured into the Carnaby home in Pearland , his family proudly showed off pictures , plaques and other mementos that they said confirmed Carnaby ’s distinguished service to his country .
The family said the reason for all the confusion was that Carnaby went by other names .
A book signed by the former director of the CIA was autographed to “ Tony ” — one of his aliases .
“ Mr. Carnaby never mentioned to me that he was a CIA agent , ” said David Adler , a former CIA officer .
Adler said he recently met Carnaby at a dinner for the local chapter for the Association of Intelligence Officers .
Carnaby was the president .
“ He certainly seemed like a nice guy .
He did not strike me as irrational or unusual , ” Adler said .
Adler said he was stunned by Tuesday ’s chase and shooting .
He said Carnaby ’s bizarre actions are an example of how someone in the CIA would not behave .
“ There is no legitimate reason for a CIA officer in the U.S. to have weapons in his car .
And certainly , there ’s no legitimate reason for a CIA officer in the U.S. to not comply with uniformed local law enforcement officers , ” Adler said .
“ They certainly do n’t engage in this sort of dangerous behavior that happened yesterday . ”
Police said that they believe Carnaby was reaching for a cell phone and not one of the three weapons in his car , as first thought .
“ He did not grab the gun .
The officers presumed that ’s what he was grabbing and the pistol was in relatively close proximity to where he was reaching , ” Jett said .
Carnaby had a concealed carry permit , which would not be needed if he were an intelligence agent .
His family released the following statement .
“ He lived and breathed his work , loved his country and risked his life for it on an ongoing basis .
My family and his associates in the intelligence community believe he deserves real acknowledgement for his many years of service , ” said Robert A. Kouts , Carnaby ’s brother - in - law .

Houston Chronicle : HPD Pursuit Shooting Leads to Deep Mystery
By Mike Tolson
The Houston Chronicle
HOUSTON — Mystery continues to envelop a man shot and killed by Houston police Tuesday morning after a high - speed chase that ended near the Galleria .
The victim was identified by friends as Roland Vincent Carnaby , 52 , of Houston .
But who he really was — or more precisely , what he was — is something police are still trying to piece together .
Carnaby held himself out as a federal intelligence agent but was sometimes cagey about his precise job and employer .
At times he mentioned the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Homeland Security .
He was the president of the local chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers , a legitimate national organization whose board contains luminaries such as former President George H.W. Bush .
Friends said they have seen him in the company socially of local law enforcement officials and high - level CIA bureaucrats .
The CIA told KHOU that Carnaby was not an employee of the intelligence agency .
Car dealer Alan Helfman met Carnaby more than a decade ago when “ a mutual friend high in law enforcement ” brought him by the dealership .
“ He bought eight or nine cars from me over the years , ” Helfman said .
Carnaby told Helfman he was a federal officer who worked in intelligence .
The two men struck up a close friendship .
“ He was always teasing me about being a reserve constable , ” said Helfman , who volunteers for Harris County Precinct 7 .
Friends insist Carnaby was very much who he said he was , even if he was less than specific about his duties .
One recalled a recent party in Washington that they both attended for retired intelligence agents .
‘ A blank page ’
“ Most of what he does is so classified that regular homicide ( detectives ) will come up with a blank page and then a question about why you are asking , ” said Fred Platt , the vice president of the local chapter of intelligence agents .
“ He ’s here because of homeland security .
The port and the airport .
He knows everybody on the command staff of every agency . ”
Local law enforcement officials , however , say they do n’t know him , including Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt and Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas .
The local FBI office also claims to have no knowledge of him .
Hurtt said he ’d attended a function held by the Association last year and may have met Carnaby there .
He said he did not remember him well , though the two were photographed together .
“ I do n’t know the gentleman , ” he said .
Carnaby traveled frequently for work , Helfman said , but whenever he was in Houston , he visited the dealership on a daily basis .
Helfman said Carnaby spoke seven languages and always carried an arsenal of weapons , including several guns and a knife .
“ He was always showing me his knife tricks , ” he said .
“ He was real good at karate , too . ”
Carnaby was tight - lipped about his work and his private life , and Helfman said he did n’t question him .
“ His entire life has always been clandestine .
His girlfriends did n’t even know what he was doing , ” Helfman said .
Even mundane details of Carnaby ’s life were tinged with mystery .
His address listed with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles is a private mailbox at a UPS Store near downtown .
The address at which he registered his Jeep Commander was a different UPS Store in Pearland .
Whatever his real story , Carnaby ’s life came to an end about 11 a.m. after police forced his vehicle to a stop .
He did n’t acknowledge the officers who encircled him with guns drawn .
And he “ refused to put his hands where the officers could see him , ” said Houston Police Sgt. John Chomiak .
“ The driver refused to comply , talk or roll down the window , ” Chomiak said .
He opened the driver ’s side door only after one of the officers smashed the passenger - side window , police said .
“ He stepped out of his vehicle , turned around and reached under the seat , ” Chomiak said .
When he did , two officers each fired one time , authorities said .
The officers were identified by police officials as HPD Sgt. A.J. Washington and Officer C.A. Foster .
Carnaby was later pronounced dead at Ben Taub Hospital .
The incident lasted most of an hour .
It began with a routine traffic stop when Carnaby was pulled over for speeding along Texas 288 near Orem .
Carnaby raced away after the officers learned he had a license to carry a concealed weapon , police said .
120 - mph chase
With the officers in close pursuit , the Jeep raced north along the South Freeway , with speeds reaching 120 mph toward downtown Houston before heading west on the Katy Freeway .
Carnaby then headed south along the West Loop , exiting at Woodway where the chase finally came to an end .
Harris County medical examiners said the autopsy will probably be performed today .
Washington , a 22 - year HPD veteran , and Foster , who has been on the force for about 15 years , later told investigators they fired because they were in fear for their safety , police said .
Police said the shooting was apparently captured by the dashboard cameras of the HPD patrol cars .
Carnaby slumped to the ground after the officers began firing .
He was motionless when they placed him in handcuffs .
‘ This does n’t smell right ’
Although an initial examination revealed no weapons inside the man ’s car , that changed once it was taken into custody for a more detailed search .
“ We have located three weapons inside the vehicle — two pistols and a shotgun , ” said HPD spokesman John Cannon .
“ At least one of them was within reach of the suspect . ”
The frontage road was closed for several hours Tuesday as investigators questioned the officers behind long lines of crime scene tape .
“ What ’s going on ? ” a passing motorist shouted out as he crawled along the clogged West Loop .
That ’s the question his friends want answered .
They say Carnaby had no reason to run or disobey police .
Platt said he had dined with Carnaby both Saturday and Sunday and nothing seemed out of the ordinary .
Carnaby was engaged to be married , he said , and led a happy life .
“ I ca n’t fathom any reason why he would be running from the police because he is the police , ” Platt said .
“ This does n’t make any sense .
I ca n’t understand him running or why they opened up on him .
This does n’t smell right . ”

Houston Chronicle : Was it a Spy , or Would - Be Spy , in that SUV ?
Despite CIA mementos and other evidence , Roland Carnaby ’s life remains an enigma
By LINDSAY WISE , DALE LEZON and MIKE TOLSON
Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle
Much about Roland Carnaby ’s life speaks to a long career as a devoted intelligence officer — from his effort to build a local chapter of the professional association to his personal friendships with current and former members of the intelligence community to his respect and affection for law enforcement and its dignitaries .
His home in Pearland is filled with pieces of his patriotic past .
Plaques honor his years of service to the Central Intelligence Agency .
A book written by former CIA Director George Tenet is inscribed with a warm and playful message .
Photos of him at CIA headquarters , in front of military aircraft and with various dignitaries are prominently displayed .
A small room off the front foyer was Carnaby ’s study .
There ’s an American flag on the wall and a “ CIA ” coffee mug on the desk .
Now , in the wake of his strange death Tuesday at the conclusion of a high - speed police chase , doubts have been raised about his oft - projected persona as a CIA operative by the agency itself .
It bluntly disavowed employing him .
Might the denial be little more than standard operating procedure , as his wife suggests ?
Or could it be that he spent years constructing an elaborate fraud , with a home filled more with artifice than artifacts ?
When his wife , Susan , was asked if she now thinks it possible her husband could have been lying to her for more than a decade , she hesitated .
“ How would you know ? ” she replied quietly .
“ How would you know if what anybody told you was true ? ”
As family and friends gathered to mourn his loss , her wavering confidence loomed large .
A day after police shot him as he made an ill - advised move upon exiting his SUV , the Carnaby that so many thought they knew had become a shadowy figure , one who apparently concealed from his wife his true whereabouts and from his friends many of the pertinent details of his private life .
Even some who stand by him admit they never got to know him really well .
“ He never really wanted to talk about his personal life , ” said one friend who asked not to be named .
“ Obviously there are some missing pieces . ”
This friend , and others , remain loyal , both to the warm and engaging man they knew and to the intelligence agent he claimed to be .
They insist his bona fides were too solid and his recognition by former intelligence personnel too genuine for him to be a fake .
A caller identifying himself only as “ Chuck ” and responding to an inquiry sent to chapters of the Association for Intelligence Officers insisted Carnaby worked with the CIA in the 1980s in its Soviet Union unit .
The CIA disputes this , which if true means that the agency identification he carried with him at the time of his death and which he occasionally flashed to friends and law enforcement officers would have been bogus .
“ While we do not as a rule publicly deny or confirm employment , I will tell you in this case that Mr. Carnaby was not an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency , ” CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said .
“ He was never a CIA officer . ”
Wife doubts CIA denial
Of course , the denial does n’t prove that the agency never used him as a contractor .
Carnaby was fluent in many languages , family and friends say , including Arabic and French , and could have been useful in the Mideast , especially in the waning days of the Cold War .
Susan Carnaby does not put much stock in the CIA denial .
“ No , because why would they even admit it ? ” she said .
“ How many cases could that blow ?
I think that ’s not their policy to make comments on that type of thing .
Roland always told me that if anything ever happened to him do n’t expect anyone to stand up and say that ’s what he did for a living .
They keep these things undercover for a reason . ”
A former wife , however , is less convinced .
Sha’rie Burch , who lives in Willis , said much about her ex-husband struck her as odd when they were married .
He told her he worked with the CIA and even had a small badge , but never explained what he did .
If she asked for more details , she said , he ’d get defensive and not answer .
“ He had very big , tall stories that were hard to believe , ” Burch said .
“ It was kind of a suspicious thing . ”
Port Authority connection
On the other hand , he was friends with local federal agents and they often came to the couple ’s Spring home for dinner , Burch said .
The couple had private dinners with the head of the Houston Port Authority , she said , and Carnaby also was close friends with former Harris County Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen , who she said was best man at their wedding in 1986 .
Klevenhagen died in 1999 .
The Port Authority connection could make sense for a strictly commercial reason .
Carnaby ’s family , which used the different spelling of Karnabe , was involved in the shipping industry , which was the apparent source of his considerable but undetermined income .
He paid cash for his cars .
Burch said she first met him when she was about 19 .
Friends introduced them .
He was 10 years older , drove a Ferrari and boasted about his family homes in New York and Geneva .
He was the son of a wealthy Lebanese family that owns a shipping business , she said .
She said he told her that he was born and raised in New York City .
His father , Vincent Said Carnaby , was a Lebanese ambassador to several countries , she said , and son Roland worked for the family business and often traveled for business .
He and Burch divorced in 1993 .
Part of the reason , she said , was his hot temper .
By the time of their divorce , Carnaby already had another romance brewing .
A petite woman with curly brown hair and glasses , Susan Carnaby teaches eighth grade in Northshore .
The 55 - year - old met her husband about 17 years ago when she worked as the manager of a men ’s store in the Galleria .
She described him as a gentleman , worldly and traveled .
“ He ’s one of those people who ’s very unique , very vibrant , the life of the party , knows everybody , ” she said .
“ He likes to be around people .
He ’s a people person . ”
He told her he was a CIA agent and she had no reason to doubt him , she said .
After dating for about five years , the couple married in Las Vegas on Nov. 10 , 1997 .
“ He planned the whole thing , ” she said .
Susan Carnaby said her husband often traveled overseas , leaving for months at a time .
If he was in Washington , he would tell her , but most of the time she had no idea where he had gone , she said .
It was top secret , he told her .
The last time she saw her husband was in March , she said .
The news that he was in town when he was supposedly traveling , and the mention of a supposed fiancee , stunned her when she learned it after his death .
She said she and her husband were not separated .
“ Not as far as I know , ” she said , adding that the couple just moved into their new house in Pearland last June .
“ All his things are here . ”
Police Wednesday were still trying to fit together the series of events that ended when Carnaby was shot by officers who surrounded his vehicle after a chase that ended near the Galleria .
During the chase , Carnaby called a friend on his cell phone .
The friend , whom police have not identified , was supposed to have lunch with Carnaby that day .
“ The guy was telling him , ‘ You need to pull over .
You need to do what the officers are telling you , ’ ” said Capt .
Steve Jett , commander of HPD ’s homicide division .
“ His answer was , ‘ I can ’t . ’ ”
Tapes back HPD ’s account
Police do n’t know why Carnaby felt unable to comply with the officers ’ demands .
He appeared shaky and nervous when pulled over for speeding on Texas 288 near West Orem .
He presented a card identifying himself as a CIA employee .
The card was laminated and bore the seal of the espionage agency .
Police said they are waiting for federal officials to determine if the document was legitimate or a fabrication .
Investigators said the three weapons discovered in his car appeared to be Carnaby ’s and were legally owned .
One pistol was under the passenger - side floor mat while a second was between the seats .
A pistol - grip shotgun was on the floor board of the back seat .
Jett said a round was in the shotgun and the safety was off .
“ All he would have to do was reach over the console and pick it up , ” Jett said .
The officers told investigators they feared for their safety when he reached back into the Jeep for what turned out to be a “ shiny ” personal assistant - cellular phone .
Jett said there is video and audio that backs up the officers ’ contention that Carnaby acted “ erratically , ” before making a “ very quick overt move ” toward an officer .
He said the HPD would probably seek to prevent release of the audio and video until the investigation concludes .
“ We have no idea why he ran .
We are investigating that , ” he said .
“ He was very nervous .
The officer said that he was shaking , and the officer did n’t understand because most law enforcement would have been friendly . ”
A review of public records showed that Carnaby had a clean record save for two speeding tickets , including one last summer in Fairfax , Va .
Reporters Mike Glenn , Stewart M. Powell and Matt Stiles contributed to this report .

Houston Chronicle :
In his final moments , Carnaby made calls to FBI , HPD as he fled
By LINDSAY WISE and DALE LEZON
Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle
The patrol officer who stopped Roland Carnaby for speeding Tuesday morning was about to detain him as a possible CIA agent impersonator when he took off in his SUV , Houston police said Thursday .
Two days after officers shot Carnaby to death at the conclusion of a high - speed chase , more details emerged about the bizarre chain of events , including phone calls Carnaby made after he was pulled over .
First Carnaby called an acquaintance in Houston Police Department ’s internal affairs division , trying to get someone to vouch for him to the patrolman .
Later , as he raced away from pursuing officers at speeds up to 120 mph , the man who had for years projected the persona of a federal intelligence officer apparently called a contact he knew in the FBI .
Carnaby initially had thought that by showing an ID card bearing the seal of the Central Intelligence Agency he could be on his way .
But the officer who stopped him along Texas 288 near West Orem , already suspicious because of Carnaby ’s nervous behavior , did not recognize the ID card and told Carnaby he would check it out , HPD homicide Capt .
Steve Jett said .
“ The officer went back and checked the guy , and when he checked the license , the handgun permit came up and he was like , ‘ Why does a federal agent need a concealed handgun permit ? ’ ” Jett said .
Increasingly suspicious , the officer asked Carnaby for proof of his connection with the CIA .
“ He asked him questions like who ’s your supervisor ?
Do you have a contact number you can call and verify ?
And the answers were n’t very good , ” Jett said .
That was when Carnaby called someone he knew at HPD ’s internal affairs division .
The officer asked the acquaintance if Carnaby really worked for the CIA .
“ The answer was ‘ possibly yes , ’ ” Jett said .
“ But the officer was obviously not inclined to just let him go .
He was being very thorough and probably was going to write him a ticket , if not put him in jail for something , probably for not presenting a concealed handgun permit when he was stopped . ”
State law requires holders of concealed carry permits to present them when stopped by police if they have weapons in the car .
Doubts about Carnaby ’s true identity were compounded by conflicting information , Jett said .
The officer also had contacted HPD ’s criminal intelligence and major offenders divisions to ask them to check Carnaby ’s credentials , he said .
“ They told him ‘ No , we think he ’s a fraud , ’ ” Jett said .
“ Something apparently triggered on his name , but again nobody was sure .
Nobody ’s still sure .
They ’d heard his name before and they thought no , he ’s not ( CIA ) . ”
The officer was told to “ find something to arrest him on ; you ca n’t arrest him for speeding , ” Jett said .
Carnaby had not shown his concealed weapon permit , which was sufficient violation to hold him .
But when he was asked to step out of his SUV , Carnaby sped away , Jett said .
As HPD patrol cars began their pursuit , Carnaby called a friend on his cell phone .
The friend , described by Jett as “ possible FBI , ” urged Carnaby to pull over and obey police .
HPD investigators are still trying to get in touch with the friend to talk to him , Jett said .
Local FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap declined to comment , saying it is inappropriate for the FBI to discuss an ongoing HPD investigation .
Autopsy video refused
Carnaby ’s lawyer , Kenneth Brooten , said the fatal shooting , which occurred after Carnaby exited his car at the end of the chase , did not appear necessary .
“ All of this has a smell factor , ” Brooten said .
“ What was the justification for the use of deadly force ?
Was this man a felon that was fleeing the scene of an armed robbery ?
Had he pulled a gun on them previously ?
That ’s a public policy issue .
That affects every person who drives around Houston or lives there . ”
Brooten said he sent a letter to the Harris County Medical Examiner ’s office asking that Carnaby ’s autopsy be videotaped , but county attorney Barbara Callistien wrote him back to say HCME does not videotape autopsies .
Brooten also wants the Texas Rangers to examine the case and the FBI to look at whether evidence has been tampered with .
A former chief counsel of the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations , Brooten met Carnaby several years ago and served as an attorney for the Houston branch of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers , which Carnaby headed .
He said he attended an annual symposium for the AFIO at the CIA headquarters at Langley with Carnaby , who seemed well - known there , albeit under the pseudonym of “ Tony . ”
“ I recall people coming out recognizing him , ‘ Hey Tony , how are you ? ’
This is what I saw .
Did I know those people personally ?
No .
Was I introduced by Tony ?
Yes . ”
One of Carnaby ’s most obvious signs of legitimacy came through the AFIO .
Carnaby had led the revival of a dormant Houston chapter , which periodically hosted banquets that featured speakers well known in the intelligence community and were well attended by local law enforcement officials .
The executive director of the AFIO , Elizabeth Bancroft , said she met Carnaby several years ago at the group ’s functions held near McLean , Va .
The organization , which is open to U.S. citizens , holds an annual symposium and monthly luncheons .
Bancroft said Carnaby never mentioned being a former CIA employee , and the stories about his connection to the agency shocked her .
“ Is this genuine or is this a very overactive fantasy life ? ” she said .
Carnaby was a very eager , enthusiastic AFIO member , Bancroft said .
When she told him that the group ’s Houston chapter had been inactive for years , he volunteered to get it going again .
She said he was an excellent organizer and boosted chapter membership to about 200 members .
He also had extensive contacts with law enforcement , which helped him book speakers for the chapter ’s meetings .
HPD defends officers
Carnaby asked the national headquarters if he could name the Houston chapter after CIA agent William Francis Buckley , who was kidnapped , tortured and killed in Lebanon in 1985 .
“ He talked about Buckley , how much he admired him and the bravery it must have taken to endure that type of torture that ends your life , ” she said .
For a person who was so supportive of law enforcement , Carnaby ’s final agony angers lawyer Brooten , who criticized the officers present for handcuffing him instead of administering medical care .
“ All of this other stuff ( about Carnaby ’s mysterious life ) is all very interesting , but it is of no consequence when you consider a man is dead and he died handcuffed and nobody tried to stop the bleeding or anything , ” Brooten said .
“ You know what you call that ?
You call that an assassination . ”
Jett defended the officers at the scene , saying they are not trained to assist people with serious gunshot wounds .
“ We would handcuff people and try to get them comfortable , but we ’re not paramedics , and most officers do n’t know about giving first aid like that other than CPR , and you do n’t want to give CPR to a gunshot victim , ” he said .
Investigators later found three weapons in Carnaby ’s car , police said .
One pistol was under the passenger - side floormat .
A second was between the seats .
On the back seat floorboard lay a pistol - grip shotgun with a round in the chamber and the safety off .
Brooten said he has no idea why his friend and client ran from police , but he has a difficult time believing HPD ’s account .
“ Maybe he thought he was being set up .
That ’s speculation only , ” he said .
“ The answer is no , I do n’t know .
But there are multiple reasons why an experienced professional would feel threatened .
And given the actions after the shooting , maybe his instinct was correct . ”
CIA repeats its denial
The CIA on Thursday reiterated its denial that Carnaby had any connection with the intelligence agency .
“ This individual was not a CIA officer , and I have seen no indication whatsoever that he had a contract with the CIA , ” said agency spokesman George Little .
True or not — his friends claim disavowing any affiliation is standard procedure in clandestine intelligence work —
Carnaby had certainly been successful at constructing the appearance of a longtime intelligence officer and a well - connected guy .
His Pearland home contains several photos of him taken with local dignitaries , including former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt .
Both insist they do not know him .

Fox News : Former FBI Agent : I Knew Chase Suspect By Different Name
Former FBI Agent : I Knew Chase Suspect By Different Name

HOUSTON — Roland Carnaby claimed to work for the CIA .
But the suspect who police shot at the end of a citywide car chase Tuesday was known by a different name to the former agent in charge of the Houston FBI .
“ I only knew him as Tony , ” said Don Clark , FOX 26 ’s security and law enforcement analyst and former FBI agent .
“ I had no idea what his name may have been or was .
The name that was in the newspaper , I had never seen that name before . ”
Carnaby , 52 , was pulled over Tuesday morning for speeding and then led police on a chase when the officer discovered he possessed a concealed weapon license .
His death was ruled a homicide Thursday afternoon after medical examiner ’s officials determined he died from a gunshot wound to the torso .
Investigators and FBI and CIA officials have said they could not trace Carnaby ’s connection to either agency , but family members said Carnaby had awards , pictures and books signed with several officials , including former CIA Director George Tenet and former Secretary of State James Baker .
But Clark says he thought Carnaby was too talkative for an intelligence agent .
“ People who are involved in those types of activities are very closed mouth , ” Clark said .
Federal credentials also were found inside the SUV , but police say the CIA is sending someone to Houston to examine Carnaby ’s alleged Agency credentials .
“ If the person was portraying to be something that he was n’t , I think they have a responsibility to see if there ’s been any damage that ’s been done , ” Clark said .
Carnaby was the president of the Association For Intelligence Officers , a non-profit organization for current or former intelligence professionals and supporters of the intelligence community .
Organization officials posted a note on their Web site Thursday , extending their sympathy to family and friends “ over his untimely and inexplicable death . ”
“ A man gifted with remarkable people skills and charm , Roland called upon his wide range of contacts — particularly those in the Houston and Federal law enforcement communities — to support an impressive speaker series and other local activities in the Houston chapter he reactivated a few years ago , ” the Web site states .
“ Mr. Carnaby underscores the achievements and energy associate members bring to the association to assist in the educational mission of AFIO . ”
Officers shot at Carnaby as he exited his vehicle because they thought he was reaching for a gun .
A thorough investigation of his vehicle after the chase revealed Carnaby had two pistols and a shotgun , and one of the weapons was within his reach .
“ One of the officers , on the passenger side , saw the suspect reach down and make an obvious and overt movement underneath the seat .
Fearing for his safety , he fired the weapon one time , ” HPD Sgt. John Chomiak said .
But Randall Kallinen , an attorney representing Carnaby ’s wife of 11 years , said his death should have never occurred .
“ The police did not follow procedure , ” Kallinen said .
“ They escalated the situation and then two individuals , two police officers , shot an individual who was unarmed . ”
Houston police are still investigating the case .

KHOU : ‘ CIA Operative ’ Faced Arrest for Impersonating Federal Agent
11:58 AM CDT on Saturday , May 3 , 2008
By TJ Aulds & Allison Triarsi / 11 News
HOUSTON —
The widow of a man gunned down by Houston police after a high - speed chase Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit against the Houston Police Department on Friday .
Susan Carnaby claims the chase that lead to her husband ’s death was unnecessary and that police failed to follow proper chase procedures .
The wife ’s attorney revealed that Roland Carnaby was shot in the back by police , who said they opened fire on the man because they saw the man reach for something shinny – possibly a gun – after he had exited his vehicle .
Carnaby led police on a high - speed chase after he had been pulled over for speeding .
Houston police confirmed that the officer who pulled over Carnaby was about to arrest the 52 - year - old Pearland man on suspicion that he was impersonating a federal agent .
Carnaby had presented identification that indicated he was with the CIA to the HPD officer who had pulled him over on Highway 288 near Orem Tuesday afternoon .
Houston police said the officer made several calls trying to confirm if the identification was legit , to the point that superiors said Carnaby should be arrested for impersonating a federal agent .
It was during that verification of Carnaby ’s identification that the self - proclaimed CIA operative sped off .
Photo provided by Carnaby family
Randall Kallinen , Mrs. Carnaby ’s attorney , called the chase of Mr. Carnaby , “ silly , ” and accused Houston police of failing to follow acceptable chase policies .
He also accused police of not rendering medical aid to Carnaby after he had been shot .
“ He lay on the ground , bled to death , a massive bleeding while officers had him handcuffed and administered no aid whatsoever , ” said Kallinen , shortly after filing the lawsuit .
But Dr. Paul Radelat , who examined Carnaby ’s body on behalf of the family told 11 News that the gunshot wound to his back was so devastating , that even if he had been in the “ lobby of a hospital , ” when he was shot he would likely have not survived .
Meanwhile , the mystery surrounding Carnaby and just who he is continues .
Friends and family said Carnaby has for years presented himself as having worked for the CIA .
He even had a series of mementos and plaques that indicated he was a member of the U.S. intelligence community .
He was also the president of a local chapter of an intelligence officer ’s association .
While an officer in the Houston chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers , the association ’s national office identified him as an “ associate ” member .
The association has several classifications for members including designations for confirmed current and past members of the intelligence community .
Associate members are considered to not have been an intelligence operative or agent , but rather citizens who support the intelligence community .

Houston Chronicle : Wife of Man Who Claimed CIA Link Sues
Federal case says HPD officers who shot , killed Carnaby violated his civil rights
By DALE LEZON
Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle
The wife of a man fatally shot by Houston police and who claimed to be a CIA agent filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the city , accusing the officers of violating his civil rights .
Roland Vincent Carnaby , 52 , was killed after he led police on a high - speed chase after a traffic stop Tuesday morning .
The CIA has denied that Carnaby was connected to the agency .
The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Houston , also names Houston Police Department Sgt. Andrew J. Washington and Officer Charles Foster .
Both fired at Carnaby .
It states that the officers violated Carnaby ’s right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure and his right to due process .
Police actions defended
The shooting was unjustified , Randall Kallinen , the attorney for Susan Carnaby , said in a news conference after filing the suit .
HPD spokesman Victor Senties said the department does not comment on pending litigation and directed questions to the city attorney ’s office .
“ I think ( the officers ) operated the way they should have according to proper police procedures and according to constitutional requirements , ” said Arturo Michel , Houston city attorney .
Police officials said Washington and Foster fired because they were in fear for their safety .
Excessive force alleged
After the chase ended , Carnaby stopped and was getting out out of his Jeep Commander but refused officers ’ commands to put his hands in plain sight , officials said .
Carnaby then reached under the driver seat and grabbed an object as he began to get out of his car , police said .
That ’s when the officers fired .
“ When a person has their back to you , the officer cannot be in reasonable , objective fear for his life , ” Kallinen said .
Kallinen said Susan Carnaby hopes the suit will make the city change its methods about use of excessive force on suspects .
She is also asking for unspecified monetary damages .
Police said the chase started after Carnaby was stopped for speeding along Texas 288 .
Hard to verify
The officer who stopped him became suspicious when Carnaby appeared nervous and claimed to be connected to the CIA .
Police were trying to determine if Carnaby ’s claim was true when he sped off .
Officers chased the Jeep north along the South Freeway , with speeds reaching 120 mph , toward downtown Houston and then west on the Katy Freeway .
Carnaby then headed south along the West Loop , exiting at Woodway , where the chase ended .
Police said officers would find three weapons in Carnaby ’s SUV , including two pistols and a pistol - grip shotgun .
Dozens of blog posts refer to Carnaby as a noted intelligence service veteran .
The blog posts have been difficult to verify .
Kallinen said that questions surrounding Carnaby ’s life do not justify his death .
Discipline problems
He also said that the officers who shot him have had several disciplinary problems at the department .
Foster , who has been on the force for about 28 years , has been reprimanded twice for rules violations , according to city records .
City records show that Washington , on the force for about 22 years , has been suspended once for five days for striking a suspect and once for one day for speeding .
He also was suspended for three days for insubordination and violating department rules .
That suspension was reduced to one day in arbitration .

Premel ’s Intel Chief Retires
Following the first series of interviews Alan Premel gave with Channel 1 in Moscow , the first series was posted online last week and i have already seen two other additional stories which tie in with Premel and his dealings with the private firm in Houston .
This is one and let me find the other .
One of the CIA ’s former counter - terrorism chiefs and pioneers in covert operations , Roland Carnaby retires .
In the past few months , Mr. Carnaby , who has led a private intelligence firm in Houston , Texas has been delegating more and moredaily responsibilities to his lietenants and is completing his succession planning , say people familiar with the matter .
A decision about his departure could come within weeks , though the situation remains fluid , say these people .
Alan Premel , 32 years old , whom CIA recruited in 1997 and whom Carnaby personally recruited in 2002 to work with the private intelligence firm in Houston has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed him , added these people .
A spokesperson familiar with the retirement plans stated that Premel and his current worries with the US Senate over allegations and ties to the CIA ’s Rendition program and his recent resignation from CIA amid a slew of disclosure cases pulls him out of the race for President and chief of such a power position within the intelligence community .
The departure of Mr. Carnaby , 52 , would mean the loss of CIA ’s most experienced , talented and high profile clandestine officers in management .
Few executives who helped pioneer the commercialization of private intelligence and private security firms have remained on top for as long , except for some who can also claim founder titles , such as Patriot Oil , and Pan - American Shipping and Consulting Group .
Mr. Carnaby ’s retirement would come at a critical point for CIA .
Any efforts to reveerse the slow - down at his private firm could involve drastic changes that may be more palatable under a new CEO like Premel .
Mr. Premel , at CIA , was very instrumental in many changes at CIA as a successful supervisor in the Balkans .
His management experience at CIA is 25 years behind Carnaby ’s but with the firm already warning investors in recent months that it will be raising fees in the absence of Mr. Carnaby .
Mr. Premel wrestled with how to reverse the declining momentum before having to exit left stage last summer from the firm after his public disclosure .
The firm ’s third quarter numbers , a key barometer of the firm ’s health fell 63 % without Premel .
Before leaving he implemented some changes that were never fully set into motion causing the down - turn after his sudden departure .
The timing of Mr. Carnaby ’s retirement is of his own choosing , say people familiar with the situation , unlike Premel ’s pre-mature departure which came 20 - years too soon say experts .
Not long after he jonied CIA , Roland Carnaby declared that no one person should stay in the same cover in covert operations more than two years .
A standard practice used by the firm .
This philosophy has accredited the firm with a lot of success claims Mr. Premel in his interview with CNN ’s David Ensor late of last year .
Under James Pavitt and Roland Carnaby , the firm has become the intelligence community ’s most successful private consulting business on counter - terrorism , security consulting and intelligence gathering where they pioneered a way for private officers to carry out day to day functions in the field , relay them back to CIA , DoD , DIA or other foreign agencies .
In 2004 , Mr. Premel streamlined a way for collecting , compliling and disseminating vast amounts of data and breaking it down by himself .
The process which is only done by one person , Mr. Premel himself is the work of what 7 - 9 officers would typically do .
When Carnaby and Premel shared the reigns from 2004 - 2007 , they have delivered more than 10 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth .
Profit increase every year and the company now has 248 licensed contract officers working for the firm globally , and $ 297 million in classified contracts over 5 continents .
Those figures are up from the firms $ 18 million in 1997 .
To maintain momentum , Mr. Premel , using $ 40 million from a settlement with CIA , purchased a private lending company in Houston as well as acquiring a private shipping business and a private internet ticketing business .
There were missteps :
Last year , the firm took a $ 80.4 million write - down for its purchase of a private airline business in DC , Houston and Vegas .
And threats loomed when recruitment of some of the firm ’s top and most talented officer ’s .
To keep top talent , Mr. Carnaby and Mr. Premel kicked in an extra $ 2.4 million for salaries and bonuses to keep the firm afloat .
Mr. Carnaby has long planned for his eventual exit , say people familiar with the matter .
He often rotated top officer ’s into different operational roles as a way to groom potential successors and to give the board a slate of candidates from which to choose .
In his departing emails to friends , firm and CIA colleagues , Mr. Carnaby wrote how much he was pleased by the professionalism and careers of each and all of the persons who have served under him and with him during his 32 - year tenure in the US Intelligence Community .

Fox News : Investigators Sorting Fact from Fiction in Fatal Chase
Man Fatally Shot by Police Claimed to be CIA Agent
Last Edited : Thursday , 01 May 2008 , 10:17 AM CDT
Created : Thursday , 01 May 2008 , 10:12 AM CDT
HOUSTON — Two days after a man was fatally shot following a police chase through Houston , investigators are still trying to determine who the man was and if really worked for the CIA or as a national intelligence officer .
Family members on Wednesday invited FOX 26 News inside the home of a man who claimed to work for the CIA and who was fatally shot at the end of a police chase earlier this week .
Relatives said Roland Carnaby , a 52 - year - old Lebanese man who lived in Pearland with his wife of 11 years , was a secret federal agent for the FBI and CIA despite local and federal authorities not being able to verify that claim .
“ There was no record of him being an employee of the FBI or CIA , ” Houston Police Department Chief Harold Hurtt said Wednesday .
Officials with the FBI and CIA also said that Carnaby did not work for them , even though Carnaby had pictures of himself with former Secretary of State James Baker and Hurtt .
“ I ’ve taken pictures with probably another thousand Houstonians in the last four years , ” Hurtt said .
Carnaby was pulled over Tuesday for speeding and then led police on a chase .
He was fatally shot after officers said they thought he reached for a gun .
“ One of the officers , on the passenger side , saw the suspect reach down and make an obvious and overt movement underneath the seat .
Fearing for his safety , he fired the weapon one time , ” HPD Sgt. John Chomiak said .
A second officer also opened fire but it is not clear how many times Carnaby was shot .
Carnaby , dressed in a suit , died on the way to the hospital .
Investigators initially only found a cell phone but then said they discovered two pistols and a shotgun inside Carnaby ’s sport utility vehicle .
They said one was in the suspect ’s reach when the officers shot him .
“ At any one time , he ’s got three or four shotguns , two guns on him , a knife , ” said Alan Helfmen , owner of the River Oaks Chrysler dealership and one of Carnaby ’s good friends .
“ I ’d like to believe that he would not have tried to shoot somebody .
That ’s not his mentality . ”
Helfman said Carnaby told people he was a CIA agent or some kind of national intelligence officer .
He said Carnaby donated large amounts of money to HPD fundraisers , was highly intelligent , spoke seven languages and was the president of the Houston branch for the Association For Intelligence Officers .
“ He thought he was one of them … or maybe one of them with a little higher pecking order , ” Helfman told FOX 26 News .
Helfman said he met Carnaby a dozen years ago when the man showed up at his dealership to buy a vehicle .
The two quickly became good friends , sharing a love of cars and law enforcement .
The black Jeep Commander Carnaby was driving is registered to the National Security Command Center .
Federal credentials were also found inside the SUV but investigators are still trying to determine if the identification is real .
“ We do n’t know .
They could ’ve been made up , ” HPD Homicide Capt .
Steve Jett said .
Relatives said they have plenty of proof that Carnaby was CIA , including an autographed book from , they say , his very close friend , former CIA Director George Tenet .
However , plaques , paperwork and the people who love him say one thing : the truth seems to be just as much of a mystery as Carnaby himself .
HPD officials said they are questioning officers about why medical attention was not given to Carnaby after he was shot and before paramedics arrived .
The two officers that fired their guns have nearly 40 years of law enforcement experience combined .
Officials within the police department ’s internal affairs and homicide divisions , along with the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office , are investigating the shooting .

Wayne Madsen Reports : Another 9/11 Waiting to Happen
June 16 , 2008 — SPECIAL REPORT .
Another 9/11 waiting to happen
publication date : Jun 15 , 2008
Roland “ Tony ” Carnaby , the one - time CIA station chief for the Southeast Region slain by Houston police on April 29 , was an advocate of increasing “ HUMINT ” resources in and around the sprawling Houston port complex , from Houston to Galveston .
Houston is the largest port in the United States for foreign tonnage .
Carnaby had in his possession the morning of April 29 information that someone wanted and wanted badly enough to order the Houston police to treat the well - known former CIA clandestine agent and president of the local chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers ( AFIO ) as a dangerous armed criminal .
After an extensive investigation , WMR has learned that those who ordered the “ hit ” on Carnaby were part of a team , including smugglers tied to the Russian - Israeli mob , who were involved in terrorist planning activities in the greater Houston area .
Carnaby and his intelligence and federal and county law enforcement associates were concerned about the potential for a “ 9/11 - like ” false flag attack on either Houston ’s port facility , airports , or all of them in and around the Memorial Day and Independence Day weekends .
WMR has learned that at a meeting of tugboat captains last week in Houston , the possibility of an imminent terrorist attack on the Houston port was discussed .
Carnaby ’s belief in HUMINT as a determinant of terrorist plans likely caused him to believe that Houston was in imminent danger for an attack .
WMR spoke to Carnaby ’s intelligence and law enforcement colleagues who share his concerns .
Suspiciously , the Houston police , in violation of US Judge Keith Ellison ’s order to preserve all evidence related to Carnaby ’s shooting by the Houston police , admitted that it disposed of the evidence .
Moreover , after having secured Carnaby ’s Blackberry , which is known to contain contact numbers for CIA and other federal agents , as well as their informants , was returned to the custody of the Houston police by Secret Service Special Agent R. Jennings , the reported SAC ( Special Agent in Charge ) of the Houston office .
Jennings has been accused by Carnaby ’s colleagues of cooperating with the very same elements , including individuals connected to Israeli intelligence activities in the Houston area and their well - placed moles inside the Houston Police Department , who wanted access to Carnaby ’s contacts and other information .
The compromise of Carnaby ’s information represents a potentially devastating compromise of national security and are in direct violation of the National Security Act of 1947 , according to Carnaby ’s colleagues .
It still remains unknown what happened to Carnaby ’s Mac laptop computer as well as a number of other cell phones , including an I - Phone and a Bang and Olufsen mobile phone in Carnaby ’s possession at the time of his shooting .
Carnaby ’s colleagues revealed that Carnaby possessed a number of cell phones because some were dedicated to activating video and camera systems placed in strategic locations in and around Houston ’s ports and airports and downloading images to his phones and eventually to his laptop .
At least three phones in Carnaby ’s possession on the morning of April 29 were used to activate cameras and download photos and videos from sites in and around Houston .
One mobile phone number was reportedly used for this surveillance activity — 713 208-0000 .
The spot on Houston ’s West Loop where CIA agent Roland “ Tony ” Carnaby was gunned down by Houston police in a pre-planned “ hit ” on April 29 .
The shooting of Carnaby took place close to former President George H. W. Bush ’s Tanglewood residence .
On May 16 , 2008 , WMR reported : “ The CIA was concerned that details of Carnaby ’s classified and covert work for the CIA in the Port of Houston , as well as his non-official cover Carnaby Shipping Company Ltd. and American Global Enterprise contacts in the United States and Lebanon may have been compromised to Israeli Mossad agents who have infiltrated the Houston Police Department primarily through blackmail techniques .
The Israeli Consulate General in Houston is reportedly at the center of the Israeli influence and intelligence ring in the fourth largest city in America and the home to the largest port for imports in the United States . ”
The evening before Carnaby was shot , a man approached Carnaby and two friends at Houston ’s Capital Grille , a favorite meeting spot for Houston ’s business elite .
A man , pretending to be inebriated , went up to Carnaby and acted as though he was an old friend .
He was carrying an open bag , the type in which “ to go ” food orders are usually placed .
Carnaby reportedly reached for his concealed handgun and told the man he had never seen him or met him before .
The man apologized , quickly left the restaurant , and drove off in a car with diplomatic license plates .
Carnaby ’s associates now believe the man was assigned to the Israeli Consulate General in Houston .
The I - Phone and Mac in Carnaby ’s possession were officially owned by American Global Enterprise .
Carnaby ’s American Global cover firm operated a warehouse in the Houston port area , a reported center from which traffic from the port into Mexico and outbound via the ship channel was monitored .
The actual security for the Port of Houston is maintained not by the Houston Police Department but by the Harris County Sheriff .
The jurisdictional problems affected Carnaby ’s relationship with both agencies .
Whereas the Harris County Sheriff ’s office was usually cooperative , the Houston Police was generally not as willing to work on increasing the security of the port .
Pasadena , Texas liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) terminal along the Houston ship channel , where LNG tankers are loaded and off - loaded .
This area is one of the most vulnerable targets in the Houston port complex and is located next to San Jacinto Battlefield Monument and Park , also the location of the battleship USS Texas .
Carnaby ’s fear about lax port security was borne out when this editor easily gained access through the main gate into the Port of Houston in a rental car .
Although containers in bound and out bound from the port are x-rayed and checked for radioactive materials , the overall security is poor and that prompted Carnaby into calling for a better HUMINT program .
However , better HUMINT would also result in the arms , drugs , and auto theft activities of the Russian - Israeli mob , Israeli intelligence assets , and their allies in the pro-Mojahedin e Khalq ( MEK ) Iranian expatriate community in Houston being identified by federal authorities .
For example , WMR learned from US intelligence and customs agents that the 1998 terrorist bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania had a Houston connections .
The terrorist attacks were blamed on Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda .
The two trucks used in the two East Africa bombings were stolen vehicles that were shipped from Houston via Guatemala .
In addition , the bombs used passed though the same Guatemalan smuggling route .
In 1998 , Israel ’s Mossad and Guatemala ’s intelligence services continued to enjoy a close relationship and the Central American nation ’s successive military juntas could count on the support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) and other Israeli lobbying organizations in Washington .
Carnaby also had under surveillance a widespread vehicle smuggling ring that operated out of Houston , location of one of the largest vehicle import port facilities in the United States .
One of Carnaby ’s law enforcement colleagues revealed that a network of body shops in Houston have been used to strip and smuggle stolen vehicles out of the United States , mostly to Mexico .
Some of the theft operations operate under cover of “ import - export ” businesses and one operation has laundered $ 250 million in proceeds from the vehicle thefts .
These illegal enterprises have been linked to Middle East expatriates linked to Israeli intelligence operations , including the Iranian MEK terrorist group and far right Lebanese Phalangists allied with Israel who are supported by the Israeli Lobby in Washington .
Houston ’s vulnerable ship channel .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is opposed to increasing HUMINT collection in this area lest the operations of his Israeli friends become exposed .
In one Emergency Rapid Deployment exercise carried out by the US Coast Guard , an unmarked Zodiac raft with an outmoded machine gun with two US Coast Guardsmen on board , sailed up the ship channel from Galveston to Houston without anyone challenging them .
Chertoff wold prefer to keep “ security ” for Houston this way , but for what purpose ?
One of WMR ’s colleagues , German journalist Jurgen Cain Kulbel , has been imprisoned in Berlin for reporting that the UN chief investigator of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , Detlev Mehlis , was once employed by the Israeli intelligence front organization , Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) .
Mehlis steered UN investigators away from the real assassins of Hariri , Israeli intelligence who hired a number of rogue agents from Syrian intelligence , Lebanon ’s Druze and Christian Phalangist communities , and Palestinian refugees .
Kulbel ’s imprisonment is a direct result of pressure from Washington and Jerusalem on the German government .
Some of Carnaby ’s associates were also critical of the security contract for the Houston that involved ex-British commando Tim Spicer , whose Aegis Defense Services , the recipient of a number of private military contracts from the Defense Department and the former U.S. - run Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq .
Spicer , in 2002 , managed to convince Per Christiansen , a retired Norwegian naval officer whose Hudson Maritime won a Homeland Security Department to secure various American ports , including Houston , to bring him on as a partner .
Thus was born Hudson Trident ( the Trident being Spicer ’s interest in the firm ) .
However , Spicer ’s work on Houston ’s port security was soon criticized by the government , including Carnaby and his associates .
Spicer , who had previously received a port security contract in Haiti around the time of the U.S. - sponsored coup against democratically - elected President Jean - Bertrand Aristide , a coup that saw a number of weapons enter Haiti ’s ports illegally .
Spicer ’s lack of performance on the Houston port security contract soon saw him lose out on similar port contracts for Morocco and Chittagong , Bangladesh , according to sources with whom WMR spoke in Houston .
A U.S. intelligence source in Houston said , “ Spicer fucked up the ship channel contract , ” adding , “ this guy merely did plausible deniability work for MI6 and MI5 , ” Britain ’s foreign and domestic intelligence services , respectively .
A closer view of Pasadena ’s LNG terminal .
An attack here would have devastating and deadly results and bottle up the ship channel , affecting the entire United States .
It is clear that a number of Carnaby and his intelligence colleagues are skeptical about the “ official version ” of 9/11 and fear another such attack , possibly during the upcoming Fourth of July holiday .
WMR can also report that a close friend of former President George H. W. Bush has taken a keen and supportive interest in our reports on the Carnaby shooting .
Bush is the honorary president of the Houston William Buckley Chapter of AFIO , for which Carnaby served as president at the time of his death .
Carnaby was also close to the former President , who has reportedly been outraged at the wanton killing of his friend .
Carnaby was also reportedly close to Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who has made no public comment on the death of Carnaby .

No indictments in death of man claiming CIA ties

No indictments in death of man claiming CIA ties
2 officers shot driver after chase ; civil suit continues
By BRIAN ROGERS
Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle
A Harris County grand jury Thursday declined to indict two Houston police officers in the shooting death of a man who claimed to be a CIA agent .
Roland Carnaby was fatally wounded on April 29 after fleeing from a traffic stop and leading police on a high - speed chase through the city .
Carnaby was killed after stepping out of his vehicle on a feeder road off Loop 610 West , turning around and reaching under the seat for a shiny object that turned out to be a cell phone .
The grand jury declined to indict Sgt. Andrew Washington and officer Cecil Foster , said Donna Hawkins , a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office .
“ Fatal shootings involving law enforcement are referred directly to a grand jury , ” Hawkins said .
“ After careful consideration , the grand jury chose not to indict the two officers involved . ”
Initially placed on administrative leave , both officers returned to duty days after the shooting .
Carnaby , 52 , of Pearland , was stopped for speeding on Texas 288 .
He showed the officer an identification card that he claimed was issued by the Central Intelligence Agency but fled after police learned he had a license to carry a concealed weapon .
The CIA insisted that Carnaby was not connected to the agency .
His widow , Susan Carnaby , has maintained that Carnaby was a longtime CIA employee who frequently left the country on assignments .
Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt has said he was told by the FBI that Carnaby “ may have ” been an informant at one time for them but had no other details about the relationship .
At the time , a Houston FBI spokeswoman said the agency “ cannot confirm nor deny the names of people who provide us with information . ”
Susan Carnaby has filed a lawsuit against the city saying HPD violated its own policies when officers pursued him .
Her attorney , Randall Kallinen , said it was unfortunate the two officers were not indicted , but the no-bill does not preclude the city from liability .
If the officers were acting in the scope of their duties , their employer would be liable for the death instead of the officers individually , Kallinen said .
Kallinen also said Carnaby was an independent contractor for the CIA , the FBI and the Secret Service .
He said Carnaby ’s ability to speak seven languages enabled him to do in - depth background checks for the federal agencies .
He also said HPD ’s chase policy is “ highly flawed . ”
Hurtt said the department is reviewing the policy .
“ Anytime we have an incident like that , we go back and look at training policy and procedures .
If there are changes that need to be made or training that needs to be improved , we do that , ” Hurtt said .
“ It appears that they ( the officers ) did a pretty fair job of following what our policy states and what the law was . ”
Chronicle reporter Mike Glenn contributed to this report .
One of the creation stories in Genesis may be an explanatory myth wherein the Bible attempts to find a cause for why human males lack this particular bone .
Our opinion is that Adam did not lose a rib in the creation of Eve .
Any ancient Israelite ( or for that matter , any American child ) would be expected to know that there is an equal ( and even ) number of ribs in both men and women .
Moreover , ribs lack any intrinsic generative capacity .
We think it is far more probable that it was Adam ’s baculum that was removed in order to make Eve .
That would explain why human males , of all the primates and most other mammals , did not have one .
The Hebrew noun translated as “ rib , ” tzela ( tzade , lamed , ayin ) , can indeed mean a costal rib .
It can also mean the rib of a hill ( 2 Samuel 16:13 ) , the side chambers ( enclosing the temple like ribs , as in 1 Kings 6:5,6 ) , or the supporting columns of trees , like cedars or firs , or the planks in buildings and doors ( 1 Kings 6:15,16 ) .
So the word could be used to indicate a structural support beam .
Interestingly , Biblical Hebrew , unlike later rabbinic Hebrew , had no technical term for the penis and referred to it through many circumlocutions .
When rendered into Greek , sometime in the second century BCE , the translators used the word pleura , which means “ side , ” and would connote a body rib ( as the medical term pleura still does ) .
This translation , enshrined in the Septuagint , the Greek Bible of the early church , fixed the meaning for most of western civilization , even though the Hebrew was not so specific .
One of the unexpected pleasures of reading right - wing tracts is the excuse to indulge in a heady few minutes of utopian fantasy .
According to folk like David Gelernter of the American Enterprise Institute , the feminist revolution is a done deal .
In this case , Gelernter sets out how feminists have ruined modern English for sexists such as himself , with our ‘ he or she ’ and our ‘ chairperson ’ .
Encountering such a viewpoint is a refreshing change from the real world , where our language is absolutely permeated with patriarchal norms .
Where the casual use of ‘ he ’ to refer to both men and women has been replaced with ‘ guys ’ ( except when it has n’t been replaced at all ) ; words like woman or girl , and all those terms associated with being female or feminine , are seen as heinous insults ; I could go on …
“ College students and full - fledged young English teachers emerge from [ a ] feminist incubator in which they have spent their whole lives , ” Gelernter asserts .
If only it were true !
But his main concern , we are meant to believe , is not to return to a mythical time when men were men and women were women ( and mended his socks ) , but the impact of feminism on written English .
How can I ( how can any teacher ) get students to take the prime rule seriously when virtually the whole educational establishment teaches the opposite ?
When students have been ordered since first grade to put “ he or she ” in spots where “ he ” would mean exactly the same thing , and “ firefighter ” where “ fireman ” would mean exactly the same thing ?
I am sure I do n’t need to explain to a writer that fireman does not mean the same as firefighter – one could be either a woman or a man , and the other is a man , or perhaps a rare woman allowed by some quirk of fate or leftist politics into a job generally set aside for a man .
A male firefighter is the default , a female firefighter the exception , we understand .
The column is riddled with telling phrases , such as this :
The fixed idea forced by language rapists upon a whole generation of students , that “ he ” can refer only to a male , is ( in short ) wrong .
Language rapists ?
What better phrase for those pesky feminists and their silly insistence on consent !
Even Gelernter does n’t believe that one pronoun can stand in for men and women , though , as becomes clear when he describes his reaction to hearing ‘ she ’ used in exactly the way that ‘ he ’ supposedly is :
At the bottom of this junkpile is a maneuver that seems to be growing in popularity , at least among college students : writing “ she ” instead of neutral “ he , ” or interchanging “ he ” and “ she ” at random .
This grotesque outcome follows naturally from the primordial lie .
If you make students believe that “ he ” can refer only to a male , then writers who use “ he ” in sentences referring to men and women are actually discussing males only and excluding females–and might just as well use “ she ” and exclude males , leaving the reader to sort things out for himself .
The she - sentences that result tend to slam on a reader ’s brakes and send him smash - and - spinning into the roadside underbrush , cursing under his breath .
( I still remember the first time I encountered such a sentence , in an early - 1980s book by a noted historian about a Jesuit in Asia . )
It ’s tempting to quote this whole article :
Why should I worry about feminist ideology while I write ?
Why should I worry about anyone ’s ideology ?
Writing is a tricky business that requires one ’s whole concentration , as any professional will tell you ; as no doubt you know anyway .
Who can afford to allow a virtual feminist to elbow her way like a noisy drunk into that inner mental circle where all your faculties ( such as they are ) are laboring to produce decent prose ?
Bargaining over the next word , shaping each phrase , netting and vetting the countless images that drift through the mind like butterflies in a summer garden , mounting some and releasing others–and keeping the trajectory and target always in mind ?
Yeah , who cares !
Misogyny makes for good copy , so go for it .
Why not throw the n-word in that tricky paragraph a couple of times for good measure .
However , this is the most deluded paragraph of all :
The depressing trail continues one last mile .
What happens to a nation ’s thinking when you ban such phrases as “ great men ” ?
The alternatives are so bad –“ great person ” sounds silly ; “ great human being ” is a casual tribute to a friend –that it ’s hard to know where to turn .
“ Hero ” does n’t work ; “ Wittgenstein was a great man ” is a self - sufficient assertion , but “ Wittgenstein was a hero ” is not .
Was he a war hero , a philosophical hero ?
( Yes and yes . )
“ Wittgenstein was a great heart ” ( also true ) ca n’t be rephrased in hero - speak , and ca n’t substitute for “ great man ” either .
Whatever fantasies anyone might indulge about ‘ he ’ acting as a gender - neutral pronoun , surely nobody could be as idiotic as to think that this is a comparable phrase .
Was Jane Austen ( almost the sole woman named in the column ) a “ great man ” ?
Or are women simply incapable of achieving enough to qualify for this high praise ?
To answer Gelernter ’s question , what happens to a nation when phrases such as “ great men ” fall out of favour , is that greatness is no longer narrowed down to a purely male attribute .
Which terrifies men like him .
The test was designed to be answered either by husbands or their wives themselves , and was meant to provide couples with feedback on the quality of their marriage , and point out where they might be going wrong .
IRAN'S WEAPONS .... Tina Susman of the LA Times reports that Iranian involvement in Iraq 's civil war may not be everything it 's been cracked up to be :
There was something interesting missing from Maj.
Gen. Kevin Bergner 's introductory remarks to journalists at his regular news briefing in Baghdad on Wednesday : the word " Iran , " or any form of it .
It was especially striking as Bergner , the U.S. military spokesman here , announced the extraordinary list of weapons and munitions that have been uncovered in recent weeks since fighting erupted between Iraqi and U.S. security forces and Shiite militiamen .
.... A plan to show some alleged Iranian - supplied explosives to journalists last week in Karbala and then destroy them was canceled after the United States realized none of them was from Iran .
A U.S. military spokesman attributed the confusion to a misunderstanding that emerged after an Iraqi Army general in Karbala erroneously reported the items were of Iranian origin .
When U.S. explosives experts went to investigate , they discovered they were not Iranian after all .
Conyers subpoenas Karl Rove over Justice Department scandal
Rove 's attorney slams Judiciary Chairman
UPDATE ( PDF ) : ROVE'S LAWYER RIDICULES SUBPOENA .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) issued a subpoena Thursday to former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove for testimony about politicization of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , including the case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , who was jailed for bribery in what was widely seen as a political prosecution .
In response , Rove 's attorney Robert Luskin questioned why the subpoena was necessary and mocked Conyers in a letter copied to RAW STORY .
" I do not misunderstand either the Committee 's procedures or the scope of its interest in Mr. Rove ; nor , in light of your reported remarks about the need for ' someone ' to ' kick his ass , ' am I the least bit confused about the Committee 's motives and intentions , " Luskin wrote .
" I confess , however , that I do not understand why the Committee is threating a subpoena to Mr. Rove for information related to the alleged ' politicization of the Department of Justice , ' when , as the Committee is surely aware , Mr. Rove has already received a subpoena for the same subject matter from the Senate Judiciary Committee . "
" I also do not understand why the Committee refuses to acknowledge that , in these matters , Mr. Rove is not a free agent , " he adds .
Read the letter here .
The subpoena comes on the heels of a letter from Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , who told the Judiciary Committee Wednesday that the president 's former top advisor would refuse to testify voluntarily .
" It is unfortunate that Mr. Rove has failed to cooperate with our requests , " Conyers said in a release .
" Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate .
Unfortunately , I have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters . "
Reacting to the news on NBC , correspondent Pete Williams said that the Justice Department most likely wo n't enforce the subpoena .
Separately , Chairman Conyers recently received a letter from DOJ's Office of Professional Responibility ( OPR ) indicating that the office has opened an investigation into allegations of selective prosecution of Siegelman and others .
The subpoena issued Thursday orders Rove to testify before the House panel on July 10 .
He is expected to face questions about the White House 's role in firing nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 and the prosecution of former Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama , a Democrat .
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers had negotiated with Rove 's attorneys for more than a year over whether the former top political adviser to President Bush would testify voluntarily .

May 22 , 2008
Mr. Robert D. Luskin
Patton Boggs LLP
2550 M Street , N.W .
Washington , DC 20037- 1350
Dear Mr. Luskin :
We were disappointed to receive your May 21 letter , which fails to explain why Mr. Rove is willing to answer questions in writing for the House Judiciary Committee , and has spoken on the record to the media , but continues to refuse to testify voluntarily before the Committee on the politicization of the Department of Justice , including allegations regarding the prosecution of former Governor Don Siegelman .
Because of that continuing refusal , we enclose with this letter a subpoena for Mr. Roves appearance before the Committees Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee at 10:00 a.m. on July 10 , 2008 .
In light of specific statements in your letter , we want to clarify several points .
Your letter is incorrect in suggesting that the enclosed subpoena will raise the same issues as the Senate Judiciary Committees subpoena to Mr. Rove and the pending lawsuit concerning our Committees subpoena to Harriet Miers .
Both these matters focus on the firing of U.S. Attorneys in 2006 and efforts to mislead Congress and the public on that subject .
Here , as we have made clear from the outset , the Siegelman case is a principal focus of our request for Mr. Rove to testify .
In addition , unlike Harriet Miers , Mr. Rove has made a number of on - the - record comments to the media about the Siegelman case and the U.S. Attorney firings , extending far beyond " general denials of wrongdoing . "
There is no question that both the prior subpoenas to Mr. Rove and Ms. Miers should have been complied with .
But it is even more clear that Mr. Rove should testify as we have now directed .
We would also dispute your contention that we are " provoking a gratuitous confrontation while the issues raised by the Committees request are being litigated in U.S. District Court or why the Committee refuses to consider a reasonable accommodation . "
There are a variety of mechanisms for resolution of any dispute between us , and we need not wait for resolution of separate and ongoing litigation to attempt to employ or consider those other mechanisms .
We have also previously noted that we do not believe your proposal to respond in writing to written questions is reasonable or consistent with the precedents of this Committee .
Your letter also suggests that Mr. Rove is not a " free agent " and would follow the requests of the White House with respect to his testimony .
Particularly in light of the factors discussed above , we hope that the White House will not take the position that Mr. Rove should not testify .
Other former White House officials , including Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings who worked with Mr. Rove in the White Houses political office , have in fact testified in response to
congressional subpoenas , and dealt with questions of privilege on a question - by - question basis .
Mr. Rove should follow the same course .
We should make clear , however , that Mr. Rove , as a private party not employed by the government , is himself responsible for the decision on how to respond to the enclosed subpoena , which is a legally binding directive that he appear before the Committee on July 10 .
In an analogous situation in the 1970s , when the White House attempted to instruct a private party , AT&T , not to comply with a House Subcommittee subpoena , AT&T " felt obligated to disregard those instructions and to comply with the subpoena , " resulting in a lawsuit by the Administration seeking to enjoin such compliance .
1
We very much hope that will not be necessary in this case , but we also hope that you will understand that Mr. Roves obligation , as a private party , is to seek to comply with the enclosed subpoena .
Indeed , you appeared to recognize this yourself when you responded to an earlier media inquiry as to whether Mr. Rove would comply with such a subpoena by e-mailing " sure . "
Finally , we want to make clear that we are very willing to meet with you and your client to discuss this matter .
Please direct any questions or communications to the Judiciary Committee office , 2138 Rayburn House Office Building , Washington , DC 20515 ( tel : 202-225-3951 ; fax : 202-225-7680 ) .
Sincerely ,
John Conyers , Jr.
Chairman

A student teacher who uses a service dog for his epilepsy has had to leave his position early after a Muslim student harassed the animal , and worse .
Tyler
Hurd needs the dog for his protection and for emergency supplies for first - aid responders , but apparently Technical High School in St Cloud believes that Hurd ’s needs are secondary to providing a dog - free zone for its Muslim students .
Hurd says he feels threatened by the action , as well he should — because the student threatened to kill the dog :
A St. Cloud State University student in a teacher - training program at Technical High School left the school in late April because he says he feared for the safety of his service dog .
The school district calls it a misunderstanding , and officials there say they hoped Tyler Hurd , a 23 - year - old junior from Mahtomedi who aspires to teach special education , would continue his training in the district .
Hurd said a student threatened to kill his service dog named Emmitt .
The black lab is trained to protect Hurd when he has seizures .
…
Hurd trained at Talahi Community School and Tech .
He said his experience at Talahi was good .
The Somali students there warmed to the dog and eventually petted him using paper to keep their hands off his fur , Hurd said .
Things did n’t go as well at Tech , Hurd said .
Students there taunted his dog , and he finally felt he had to leave after he was told a student made a threat .
Hurd met with Lockhart but said he did not feel comfortable continuing .
King Banaian notes the ridiculous nature of the school ’s response :
So let ’s take a look at this as a case of competing rights .
On one side we have a student with a medical disability .
One would think that the Americans with Disabilities
Act would allow this student to participate to the fullest extent possible in pursuing his goals , which is to teach in special education .
To do so , he is supposed to train in both elementary and secondary school settings .
( The article notes that Hurd had no such problems with Somali students at his elementary school assignment . )
On the other side , we have a student at Tech HS whose faith considers dogs unclean and is asserting his right to education in an institution without dogs .
This not only affects student teachers ; any student with a sight or hearing disability may use a dog for assistance and might want to also attend Tech HS . …
But when rights collide , as they did here , whose rights did they choose to uphold first ?
That ’s easy .
They upheld the rights of the side that threatened capitulation or violence .
Instead of expelling the student for his threat and making an example of him , they chose to coddle the student and chase the teacher out of his job .
Afterwards , they issued the normal multi-culti mewlings of “ misunderstanding ” , “ growth process ” , and emphasizing respect for different cultures .
I ’ve got a suggestion : how about teaching that respect to the people who issue threats , instead of their victims ?
Which person needed an object lesson in respect more , the Somali student or Tyler Hurd ?
The First Mate used to use guide dogs here and in California .
On more than one occasion , she initially got refused cab service when using Cory .
Only after she explained that the law required them to give her access did the cabbies relent .
We have laws in this country , decided on by democratically - elected representatives .
If Muslims do n’t like these access laws , then let them elect representatives that will reverse them , or failing that , go back to Somalia where violence trumps the law and they would be more comfortable .
Shame , shame on Technical High School for buckling under to thugs and abandoning their responsibilities in such a cowardly manner .
Update :
When I first read the article and King ’s post , I had the impression that the school got complaints from the Muslim students , but the story does n’t explicitly say that .
I ’ve reworded the first sentence , although it ’s still entirely possible that they complained to the administration .
If they did n’t , it makes the administration ’s move even worse .

US ISPs are generally perceived by users here to offer unlimited and fairly neutral connections to the ' Net for a monthly fee .
Or they were , anyway , until Comcast admitted that it was " delaying " P2P traffic at peak times .
New research from Germany now demonstrates that it's not just Comcast ; Cox is getting a piece of the P2P blocking action , too .
What 's more , neither company blocks only at peak usage times .
Paging the FCC !
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems have just released results of their own tests into BitTorrent blocking from around the world , and the results are startling : almost no one does it .
In fact , out of 1,224 measured ISPs , only 13 were found to block BitTorrent traffic out .
And where are the blocks coming from ?
Predominantly from the USA , where nine of the 13 ISPs were located .
Singapore , Malaysia , Canada , and Ireland each had one ISP apiece that engaged in blocking , though only Singapore 's StarCom did so with regularity ( 26 out of the 45 tests that used its network were blocked with TCP reset packets ) .
Image courtesy Max Planck Institute ; ISPs who block are in red
Of the nine ISPs in the US found to block BitTorrent , Comcast and Cox were far and away the most aggressive .
Both blocked more than half of all attempted BitTorrent tests on their networks ( 82 of 151 tests on Cox were blocked , while 491 of 788 tests on Comcast met the same fate ) .
The tests were done using a piece of open source software called Glasnost that users around the world downloaded and installed on their machines .
8,000 users took part in the test , which used Glasnost to establish BitTorrent sessions with a set of test servers in Germany .
Since the researchers can collect information about both sides of the connection , they can determine when a connection is artificially broken using TCP reset packets ( Comcast 's preferred method ) .
One limit of such testing is that it can't uncover throttling or shaping of any kind , so the Max Planck researchers are clear to note that their work represents a strongly conservative estimate of the number of ISPs who interfere with P2P traffic .
Only at peak hours ?
The researchers also took a look at time of day to see if the blocks occurred only during times of peak usage ( generally in the evenings ) .
They did not .
Blocks , in fact , were pretty consistent throughout the day , as the Comcast chart below shows .
Image courtesy Max Planck Institute
Free Press , one of the groups pressuring the FCC to take action in the current proceeding involving Comcast , responded with even more than its usual outrage to the news .
Ben Scott , the group 's policy director , said in a statement , " Consumers have no reason left to trust their cable company .
These Internet experts have also unequivocally demonstrated that blocking is not limited to times of supposed congestion .
Their sophisticated testing shows that Comcast and Cox block BitTorrent applications at all times of the day — not just at times of peak traffic .
This research proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that consumers , Congress and the FCC must urgently pursue the complaints against network providers . "
Methodology
Previous research into TCP reset packets by Vuze drew the wrath of AT&T , which said that it does not use reset packets as a network management tool and that simply seeing resets on its network meant nothing .
Vuze admitted that its methodology generated inconclusive results , but the new research appears much more rigorous .
The Max Planck Institute has published its methodology for inspection .
The Glasnost program establishes several TCP streams before and after the BitTorrent connection ; if none of these experience reset packets or other network problems , but the BitTorrent stream does get blocked , the researchers conclude that it was BitTorrent specifically that triggered a reset from a machine in the middle .
In addition , the researchers only counted a reset packet as a block if it was generated just after protocol - specific " bitfield " messages but before any actual data transfer .
Requests for comment to both Cox and Comcast were not returned by press time .
Update :
Comcast comments to Ars. Parse this as you will :
" Comcast does not , has not , and will not block any websites or online applications , including peer - to - peer services like BitTorrent .
We have acknowledged that we manage peer - to - peer traffic in a limited manner to minimize network congestion .
While we believe our current network management approach was a reasonable choice , we are now working with a variety of companies including BitTorrent and confirm our March announcement that we will move to a protocol - agnostic network management technique no later than December 31 , 2008 . "
It ’s no secret on the Internet that Superman is a dick .
But I ’ve been reading a new collection of 1950s Supergirl comics , and I ’m now convinced that “ dick ” is probably a super - understatement .
Consider how the Man of Steel treats his cousin–his only living relative , in fact : Kara “ Supergirl ” Zor -El .
Check out “ the happiest moment in Superman ’s life , ” from Supergirl ’s first comic book appearance , in 1959 :
“ See , I ’ve got this pretty sweet job and apartment in Metropolis and stuff .
But wait !
I have a better idea … ”
“ Surprise !
When I say ‘ take care of you like a big brother , ’ what I really mean is ‘ dump you in this small - town orphanage ’ !
Well , I have to be getting back . ”
Of course , Linda ’s life is n’t all peaches and cream , even with the fun of living in a state facility !
Superman evidently did n’t think of this , but what if someone were to actually adopt her ? Â
That would ruin his little plan .
So Linda spends most of her days humiliating herself in various ways so that no one will ever , ever be tempted to adopt her and give her the loving home she so yearns for .
Like this :
Or this :
Or this :
While Linda wallows in super - filth , the better to protect Superman ’s swingin ’ Metropolis lifestyle , her cousin sometimes drops by on Visitors ’
Day to “ test ” her in various sadistic ways .
But even once she ’s mastered life on Earth , he comes up with new excuses to leave her in the orphanage :
“ See , I plan to leave you in the orphanage and exploit your abilities for my own career !
If I were a better mechanic , I would n’t need to , but my robots are sort of crap , so you ’ll fill in at my beck and call instead !
Okay , better get back to your room now .
I think Tuesday is Lima Bean Night ! ”
Silver Age Superman stories usually end with a jaunty wink .
Supergirl stories end in tears !
Yep , there ’s Supergirl , the second most powerful person on Earth , sitting in a lonely orphanage , watching her friends get adopted one at a time into happy families .
Meanwhile , Superman ’s probably off cutting the ribbon at the new Superman Museum of Wonders or flirting with mermaids or dressing Perry White up like a time - traveling medieval knight to fool Jimmy Olsen for some reason .
What a jerk .
My previous entry has the amazingly interesting title " Blogging is hard " .
Gee , what a wuss , says the occasional passer - by .
Gotta fix my image , fast .
Think , think , think !
OK , here 's what I 'm going to tell you : low - level programming is easy .
Compared to higher - level programming , that is .
I 'm serious .
For starters , here 's a story about an amazing developer , who shall rename nameless for the moment .
See , I know this amazing developer .
Works for Google now .
Has about 5 years of client - side web programming under his belt .
And the word " nevermore " tattooed all over his body ( in the metaphorical sense ; I think ; I have n't really checked ) .
One time , I decided that I have to understand this nevermore business .
" Amazing Developer " , I said , " why have you quit the exciting world of web front - ends ? "
" I do n't like it " , says the Amazing Developer .
" But , but !
What about The Second Dot Com Bubble ?
VC funds will beg you to take their $ 1 M to develop the next Arsebook or what - not .
Do n't you wanna be rich ? "
" I really do n't like web front - ends very much " , he kept insisting .
Is n't that strange ?
How do you explain it ?
I just kept asking .
Now that I think of it , he probably was a little bit irritated at this point .
" Look , pal " , he said ( in the metaphorical sense ; he did n't actually say it like that ; he 's very polite ) .
" I have a license to drive a 5 - ton truck .
But I do n't want a career in truck driving .
Hope this clarifies things " .
He also said something about your average truck driver being more something than your typical web developer , but I do n't remember the exact insult .
Now , I 've been working with bare metal hardware for the last 4 years .
No OS , no drivers , nothing .
In harsh environments in terms of hardware , by comparison .
For example , in multi- core desktops , when you modify a cached variable , the cache of the other processor sees the update .
In our chips ?
Forget it .
Automatic hardware - level maintenance of memory coherency is pretty fresh news in these markets .
And it sucks when you change a variable and then the other processor decides to write back its outdated cache line , overwriting your update .
It totally sucks .
A related data point : I 'm a whiner , by nature .
Whine whine whine .
You 've probably found this blog through the C++ FQA , so you already know all about my whining .
And it 's not like I have n't been burnt by low - level bugs .
Oh , I had that .
Right before deadlines .
Weekends of fun .
So how come I do n't run away from this stuff screaming and shouting ?
Heck , I do n't mind dealing with bare metal machines for the rest of my career .
Well , trying out other stuff instead can be somewhat more interesting , but bare metal beats truck driving , I can tell you that .
To be fair , I can't really be sure about that last point – I can't drive .
At all .
Maybe that explains everything ?
I 'll tell you how I really explain all of this .
No , not right in this next sentence ; there 's a truckload of reasons ( about 5 tons ) , so it might take some paragraphs .
Fasten your seatbelts .
What does " high level " basically mean ?
The higher your level , the more levels you have below you .
This is n't supposed to matter in the slightest : at your level , you are given a set of ways to manipulate the existing lower - level environment , and you build your stuff on top of that .
Who cares about the number of levels below ?
The important thing is , how easily can I build my new stuff ?
If I mess with volatile pointers and hardware registers and overwrite half the universe upon the slightest error , it sucks .
If I can pop up a window using a single function , that 's the way I like it .
Right ?
Well , it is roughly so , but there are problems .
Problem 1 : the stuff below you is huge at higher levels .
In my humble opinion , HTML , CSS , JavaScript , XML and DOM are a lot of things .
Lots of spec pages .
A CPU is somewhat smaller .
You have the assembly commands needed to run C ( add / multiply , load / store , branch ) .
You have the assembly commands needed to run some sort of OS ( move to / from system co-processor register ; I dunno , tens of flavors per mid-range RISC core these days ? ) .
And you have the interrupt handling rules ( put the reset handler here , put the data abort handler here , the address which caused the exception can be obtained thusly ) .
That 's all .
I keep what feels like most of ARM946E - S in my brain ; stuff that 's still outside of my brain probably never got in my way .
It 's not a particularly impressive result ; for example , the fellow sitting next to me can beat me ( " physically and intellectually " , as the quote by Muhammad Ali goes ; in his case , the latter was a serious exaggeration – he was found too dumb for the US army , but I digress ) .
Anyway , this guy next to me has a MIPS 34Kf under his skull , and he looks like he 's having fun .
That 's somewhat more complicated than ARM9 .
And I worked on quite some MFC - based GUIs ( ewww ) back in the Rich Client days ; at no point I felt like keeping most of MFC or COM or Win32 in my head .
I doubt it would fit .
Problem 2 : the stuff below you is broken .
I 've seen hardware bugs ; 1 per 100 low - level software bugs and per 10000 high - level software bugs .
I think .
I feel .
I did n't count .
But you probably trust me on this one , anyway .
How many problems did you have with hardware compared to OS compared to end - user apps ?
According to most evidence I got , JavaScript does whatever the hell it wants at each browser .
Hardware is not like that .
CPUs from the same breed will run the user - level instructions identically or get off the market .
Memory - mapped devices following a hardware protocol for talking to the bus will actually follow it , damn it , or get off the market .
Low - level things are likely to work correctly since there 's tremendous pressure for them to do so .
Because otherwise , all the higher - level stuff will collapse , and everybody will go " AAAAAAAAAA !! "
Higher - level things carry less weight .
OK , so five web apps are broken by this browser update ( or an update to a system library used by the browser or any other part of the pyramid ) .
If your web app broke , your best bet is to fix it , not to wait until the problem is resolved at the level below .
The higher your level , the loner you become .
Not only do you depend on more stuff that can break , there are less people who care in each particular case .
Problem 3 : you can rarely fix the broken things below your level .
Frequently you do n't have the source .
Oh , the browser is open source ?
Happy , happy , joy , joy !
You can actually dive into the huge code base ( working below your normal level of abstraction where you at least know the vocabulary ) , fix the bug and …
And hope everyone upgrades soon enough .
Is this always a smart bet ?
You can have open source hardware , you know .
Hardware is written in symbolic languages , with structured flow and everything .
The only trouble is , people at home can't recompile their CPUs .
Life cycle .
It 's all about life cycle .
Your higher - level thingie wants to be out there in the wild now , and all those other bits and pieces live according to their own schedules .
You end up working around the bug at your end .
Sometimes preventing the lower - level component author from fixing the bug , since that would break yours and everybody else 's workaround .
Whoopsie .
How complicated is your workaround going to be ?
The complexity raises together with your level of abstraction , too .
That 's because higher - level components process more complicated inputs .
Good workarounds are essentially ways to avoid inputs which break the buggy implementation .
Bad workarounds are ways to feed inputs which should n't result in the right behavior , but do lead to it with the buggy implementation .
Good workarounds are better than bad workarounds because bad workarounds break when the implementation is fixed .
But either way , you have to constrain or transform the inputs .
Primitive sets of inputs are easier to constrain or transform than complicated sets of inputs .
Therefore , low - level bugs are easier to work around .
QED .
Low - level : " Do n't write that register twice in a row ; issue a read between the writes " .
* Grump * stupid hardware .
OK , done .
Next .
High - level : " Do n't do something , um , shit , I do n't know what exactly , well , something to interactive OLE rectangle trackers ; they will repaint funny " .
I once worked on an app for editing forms , much like the Visual Studio 6 resource editor .
In my final version , the RectTracker would repaint funny , exactly the way it would in Visual Studio 6 in similar cases .
I think I understood the exact circumstances back then , but have n't figured out a reasonable way to avoid them .
Apparently the people working at that abstraction level at Microsoft could n't figure it out , either .
What 's that ?
Microsoft software is always crap ?
You 're a moron who thinks everything is absolutely trivial to get right because you 've never done anything worthwhile in your entire life .
Next .
Problem 4 : at higher levels , you can't even understand what 's going on .
With bare metal machines , you just stop the processor , physically ( nothing runs ) , and then read every bit of memory you want .
All the data is managed by a single program , so you can display every variable and see the source code of every function .
The ultimate example of the fun that is higher - level debugging is a big , slow , hairy shell script .
" rm : No match . "
Who the hell said that , and how am I supposed to find out ?
It could be ten sub - shells below .
Does it even matter ?
So what if I could n't remove some files ?
Wait , but why were they missing – someone thought they should be there ?
Probably based on the assumption that a program should have generated them previously , so that program is broken .
Which program ?
AAARGH !!
OK , so shell scripts are n't the best example of high - level languages .
Or maybe you think they are ; have fun .
I do n't care .
I had my share of language wars .
This is n't about languages .
I want to move on to the next example .
No shell scripts .
You have JavaScript ( language 1 ) running inside HTML / CSS ( languages 2 & 3 ) under Firefox ( written in language 4 ) under Windows ( no source code ) , talking to a server written in PHP ( language 5 , one good one ) under Linux ( yes source code , but no way to do symbolic debugging of the kernel nonetheless ) .
I think it somewhat complicates the debugging process ; surely no single debugger will ever be able to make sense of that .
Problem 5 : as you climb higher , the amount of options grows exponentially .
A tree has one root , a few thick branches above it , and thousands of leaves at the top .
Bend the root and the tree falls .
But leaves , those can grow in whichever direction they like .
Linkers are so low - level that they 're practically portable , and they 're all alike .
What can you come up with when you swim that low ?
Your output is a memory map .
A bunch of segments .
Base , size , bits , base , size , bits .
Kinda limits your creativity .
GUI toolkits ?
The next one is of course easier to master than the first one , but they are really different .
What format do you use to specify layouts , which part is data - driven and which is spelled as code ?
How do you handle the case where the GUI is running on a remote machine ?
Which UI components are built - in ?
Do you have a table control with cell joining and stuff or just a list control ?
Does your edit box check spelling ?
How ?
I want to use my own dictionary !
Which parts of the behavior of existing controls can be overridden and how ?
Do you use native widgets on each host , surprising users who switch platforms , or roll your own widgets , surprising the users who do n't ?
HTML and Qt are both essentially UI platforms .
Counts as " different enough " for me .
Inevitably , both suck in different ways which you find out after choosing the wrong one ( well , it may be obvious with those two from the very beginning ; Qt and gtk are probably a better example ) .
Porting across them ?
Ha .
The fundamental issue is , for many lower - level problems there 's The Right Answer ( IEEE floating point ) .
Occasionally The Wrong Answer gains some market share and you have to live with that ( big endian ; lost some market share recently ) .
With higher - level things , it 's virtually impossible to define which answer is right .
This interacts badly with the ease of hacking up your own incompatible higher - level nightmare .
Which brings us to …
Problem 6 : everybody thinks high - level is easy , on the grounds that it 's visibly faster .
You sure can develop more high - level functionality in a given time slot compared to the lower - level kind .
So what ?
You can drive faster than you can walk .
But driving is n't easier ; everybody can walk , but to drive , you need a license .
Perhaps that was the thing mentioned by the Awesome ( Ex - Web ) Developer : at least truck drivers have licenses .
But I 'm not sure that 's what he said .
I 'll tell you what I do know for sure : every second WordPress theme I tried was broken out of the box , in one of three ways : ( 1 ) PHP error , ( 2 ) SQL error and ( 3 ) a link pointing to a missing page .
WordPress themes are written in CSS and PHP .
Every moron can pick up CSS and PHP ; apparently , every moron did pick them up .
Could n't they keep the secret at least from some of them ?
Whaaaam !
The speedy 5 - ton truck goes right into the tree .
Pretty high - level leaves fall off , covering the driver 's bleeding corpse under the tender rays of sunset .
And do n't get me started about the WordPress entry editing window .
Now , while every moron tries his luck with higher - level coding , it 's not like everyone doing high - level coding is … you get the idea .
The other claim is not true .
In fact , this entry is all about how the other claim is n't true .
There are lots of brilliant people working on high - level stuff .
The problem is , they are not alone .
The higher your abstraction level , the lower the quality of the average code snippet you bump into .
Because it 's easy to hack up by the copy - and - paste method , it sorta works , and if it does n't , it seems to do , on average , and if it broke your stuff , it quite likely your problem , remember ?
Problem 7 : it 's not just the developers who think it 's oh - so - easy .
Each and every end user thinks he knows exactly what features you need .
Each and every manager thinks so , too .
Sometimes they disagree , and no , the manager does n't always think that " the customer is always right " .
But that 's another matter .
The point here is that when you do something " easy " , too many people will tell you how it sucks , and you have to just live with that ( of course having 100 million users can comfort you , but that is still another matter , and there are times when you can't count on that ) .
I maintain low - level code , and people are sort of happy with it .
Sometimes I think it has sucky bits , which get in your way .
In these cases , I actually have to convince people that these things should be changed , because everybody is afraid to break something at that level .
Hell , even bug fixes are treated like something nice you 've done , as if you were n't supposed to fix your goddamn bugs .
Low - level is intimidating .
BITS !
REGISTERS ! HEXADECIMAL ! HELP !!
Some people abuse their craft and actively intimidate others .
I 'm not saying you should do that ; in fact , this entry is all about how you should n't do that .
The people who do it are bastards .
I 've known such a developer ; I call him The Bastard .
I might publish the adventures of The Bastard some day , but I need to carefully consider this .
I 'm pretty sure that the Awesome Developer wo n't mind if someone recognizes him in a publicly available page , but I 'm not so sure about The Bastard for some reason or other .
What I 'm saying is , maintaining high - level code is extremely hard .
Making a change is easy ; making it right without breaking anything is n't .
You can drive into a tree in no time .
High - level code has a zillion of requirements , and as time goes by , the chance that many of them are implicit and undocumented and nobody even remembers them grows .
People do n't get it .
It 's a big social problem .
As a low - level programmer , you have to convince people not to be afraid when you give them something .
As a high - level programmer , you have to convince them that you can't just give them more and more and MORE .
Guess which is easier .
It 's like paying , which is always less hassle than getting paid .
Even if you deal with a Large , Respectful Organization .
Swallowing is easier than spitting , even for respectful organizations .
Oops , there 's an unintended connotation in there .
Fuck that .
I 'm not editing this out .
I want to be through with this .
Let 's push forward .
The most hilarious myth is that " software is easy to fix " ; of course it refers to application software , not " system " software .
Ever got an e-mail with a " > From " at the beginning of a line ?
I keep getting those once in a while .
Originally , the line said " From " and then it got quoted by sendmail or a descendant .
The bug has been around for decades .
The original hardware running sendmail is dead .
And that hardware had no bugs .
The current hardware running sendmail has no bugs , either .
Those bugs were fixed somewhere during the testing phase .
Application software is never tested like hardware .
I know , because I 've spent about 9 months , the better part of 2007 , writing hardware tests .
Almost no features ; testing , exclusively .
And I was just one of the few people doing testing .
You see , you can't fix a hardware bug ; it will cost you $ 1 M , at least .
The result is that you test the hardware model before manufacturing , and you do fix the bug .
But with software , you can always change it later , so you do n't do testing .
In hardware terms , the testing most good software undergoes would be called " no testing " .
And then there 's already a large installed base , plus quick - and - dirty mailbox - parsing scripts people wrote , and all those mailboxes lying around , and no way to make any sense of them without maintaining bugward compatibility ( the term belongs to a colleague of mine , who – guess what – maintains a high - level code base ) .
So you never fix the bug .
And most higher - level code is portable ; its bugs can live forever .
And the deadlines .
The amount of versions of software you can release .
1.0 , 1.1 , 1.1.7 , 1.1.7.3 …
The higher your abstraction level , the more changes they want , the more intermediate versions and branches you 'll wind up with .
And then you have to support all of them .
Maybe they have to be able to read each other 's data files .
Maybe they need to load each other 's modules .
And they are high - level .
Lots of stuff below each of them , lots of functionality in them .
Lots of modules and data files .
Lots of developers , some of whom mindlessly added features which grew important and must be supported .
Damn …
I bet that you 're convinced that " lower - level " correlates with " easier " by now .
Unless you got tired and moved elsewhere , in which case I 'm not even talking to you .
QED .
Stay tuned for The Adventures of The Bastard .
Government regulation of the Internet would impede our ability to respond to consumers in innovative ways , and it would impair the ability of broadband providers to address the serious and rampant piracy problems occurring over their networks today .
MPAA chief Dan Glickman made it official today : Hollywood will fight Net neutrality regulations being considered by Congress and the FCC .
Glickman 's comments , which were in his annual " state of the industry " speech at ShoWest , were n't exactly surprising , given that the MPAA had urged the FCC last year not to adopt neutrality rules that would hurt anti-piracy efforts .
Today , though , the nuance was gone .
Said Glickman :
It 's a bit strange to see content companies lining up with cable operators and telcos on this issue .
Thanks to the paucity of competition today in broadband , DSL and cable - modem services are content bottlenecks online .
One of the motives for pro-neutrality forces is the fear that those service providers will favor their own or their partners ' offerings over competitors ' fare .
That fear lies at the heart of the complaint by Vuze -- whose Bit Torrent - powered online video service competes with the cable industry 's VOD -- against Comcast 's surreptitious interference with Bit Torrent traffic .
Yet Hollywood 's vision is focused on the near - term risk of piracy , rather than the long - term risk of its distribution pipelines deciding to collect extra tolls .
Glickman argued in his speech that neutrality regulations would bar the use of emerging tools that ISPs can use to prevent piracy .
That 's what some studio lobbyists have been telling lawmakers , too , in their efforts to derail neutrality legislation .
And depending on how the regulations are written , they could be right .
But the bill that 's awaiting action in the House Energy and Commerce Committee , by Reps .
Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) and Chip Pickering ( R - Miss . ) , does n't fit that description .
It would make it U.S. policy to preserve the public 's access to " lawful " content , applications and services online , carving out wide latitude for ISPs to interfere with infringing works .
For example , ISPs could n't block all Bit Torrent traffic simply because it might be used for piracy , but they could use video fingerprints to try to stop Bit Torrent from being used to deliver bootlegged movies .
Sure , it would be easier just to do what Comcast has done -- clamp down on Bit Torrent when traffic gets too heavy , regardless of what it was being used for .
The studios make so little money online relative to the amount of piracy they endure , it 's easy for them to accept approaches that throw out a little bit of good with a lot of bad .
But what happens when the revenue from downloads and commercials online becomes significant , as it surely will ?
On the bright side , while sales of the music industry 's main product continue to plummet , Glickman noted that Hollywood enjoyed its second banner year in a row at the box office .
And so far , at least , the Internet and 60 - inch plasma screens have n't dented the public 's demand for a seat in front of a really big screen :
We found , contrary to conventional wisdom , that the more folks “ pimp their living room , ” as they might say on MTV , the more they go to the movies .
High - tech consumers go to the movies 50 % more often than their lower - tech counterparts — an extra four trips each year .
And , overwhelmingly consumers say the ultimate movie experience is going to the movies .
Too bad movie production and marketing costs are so high , few films break even on box office alone .
That 's why Hollywood is so dependent on home video revenue , and why it is more afraid of today 's online bootleggers than tomorrow 's toll - collectors .
I do n't want to spoil your mood , but this column addresses the dreaded topic of multithreaded programming .
If  as the previous installment of Generic < Programming > says  exception - safe programming is hard , it 's child 's play compared to multithreaded programming .
Programs using multiple threads are notoriously hard to write , prove correct , debug , maintain , and tame in general .
Incorrect multithreaded programs might run for years without a glitch , only to unexpectedly run amok because some critical timing condition has been met .
Needless to say , a programmer writing multithreaded code needs all the help she can get .
This column focuses on race conditions  a common source of trouble in multithreaded programs  and provides you with insights and tools on how to avoid them and , amazingly enough , have the compiler work hard at helping you with that .
Just a Little Keyword
Although both C and C++ Standards are conspicuously silent when it comes to threads , they do make a little concession to multithreading , in the form of the volatile keyword .
Just like its better - known counterpart const , volatile is a type modifier .
It 's intended to be used in conjunction with variables that are accessed and modified in different threads .
Basically , without volatile , either writing multithreaded programs becomes impossible , or the compiler wastes vast optimization opportunities .
An explanation is in order .
Consider the following code :
class Gadget { public : void Wait ( ) { while (! flag_ ) { Sleep ( 1000 ) ; // sleeps for 1000 milliseconds } } void Wakeup ( ) { flag_ = true ; } ... private : bool flag_ ; } ;
The purpose of Gadget : : Wait above is to check the flag_ member variable every second and return when that variable has been set to true by another thread .
At least that 's what its programmer intended , but , alas , Wait is incorrect .
Suppose the compiler figures out that Sleep ( 1000 ) is a call into an external library that cannot possibly modify the member variable flag_ .
Then the compiler concludes that it can cache flag_ in a register and use that register instead of accessing the slower on - board memory .
This is an excellent optimization for single - threaded code , but in this case , it harms correctness : after you call Wait for some Gadget object , although another thread calls Wakeup , Wait will loop forever .
This is because the change of flag_ will not be reflected in the register that caches flag_ .
The optimization is too ... optimistic .
Caching variables in registers is a very valuable optimization that applies most of the time , so it would be a pity to waste it .
C and C++ give you the chance to explicitly disable such caching .
If you use the volatile modifier on a variable , the compiler wo n't cache that variable in registers  each access will hit the actual memory location of that variable .
So all you have to do to make Gadget 's Wait / Wakeup combo work is to qualify flag_ appropriately :
class Gadget { public : ... as above ... private : volatile bool flag_ ; } ;
Most explanations of the rationale and usage of volatile stop here and advise you to volatile - qualify the primitive types that you use in multiple threads .
However , there is much more you can do with volatile , because it is part of C++'s wonderful type system .
Using volatile with User - Defined Types
You can volatile - qualify not only primitive types , but also user - defined types .
In that case , volatile modifies the type in a way similar to const .
( You can also apply const and volatile to the same type simultaneously . )
Unlike const , volatile discriminates between primitive types and user - defined types .
Namely , unlike classes , primitive types still support all of their operations ( addition , multiplication , assignment , etc. ) when volatile - qualified .
For example , you can assign a non- volatile int to a volatile int , but you cannot assign a non- volatile object to a volatile object .
Let 's illustrate how volatile works on user - defined types on an example .
class Gadget { public : void Foo( ) volatile ; void Bar ( ) ; ... private : String name_ ; int state_ ; } ; ... Gadget regularGadget ; volatile Gadget volatileGadget ;
If you think volatile is not that useful with objects , prepare for some surprise .
volatileGadget.Foo( ) ; // ok , volatile fun called for // volatile object regularGadget .
Foo( ) ; // ok , volatile fun called for // non-volatile object volatileGadget .
Bar( ) ; // error !
Non-volatile function called for // volatile object !
The conversion from a non-qualified type to its volatile counterpart is trivial .
However , just as with const , you cannot make the trip back from volatile to non-qualified .
You must use a cast :
Gadget& ref = const_cast < Gadget&>( volatileGadget ) ; ref.Bar( ) ; // ok
A volatile - qualified class gives access only to a subset of its interface , a subset that is under the control of the class implementer .
Users can gain full access to that type 's interface only by using a const_cast .
In addition , just like const ness , volatile ness propagates from the class to its members ( for example , volatileGadget.name_ and volatileGadget.state_ are volatile variables ) .
volatile , Critical Sections , and Race Conditions
The simplest and the most often - used synchronization device in multithreaded programs is the mutex .
A mutex exposes the Acquire and Release primitives .
Once you call Acquire in some thread , any other thread calling Acquire will block .
Later , when that thread calls Release , precisely one thread blocked in an Acquire call will be released .
In other words , for a given mutex , only one thread can get processor time in between a call to Acquire and a call to Release .
The executing code between a call to Acquire and a call to Release is called a critical section .
( Windows terminology is a bit confusing because it calls the mutex itself a critical section , while " mutex " is actually an inter - process mutex .
It would have been nice if they were called thread mutex and process mutex . )
Mutexes are used to protect data against race conditions .
By definition , a race condition occurs when the effect of more threads on data depends on how threads are scheduled .
Race conditions appear when two or more threads compete for using the same data .
Because threads can interrupt each other at arbitrary moments in time , data can be corrupted or misinterpreted .
Consequently , changes and sometimes accesses to data must be carefully protected with critical sections .
In object - oriented programming , this usually means that you store a mutex in a class as a member variable and use it whenever you access that class ' state .
Experienced multithreaded programmers might have yawned reading the two paragraphs above , but their purpose is to provide an intellectual workout , because now we will link with the volatile connection .
We do this by drawing a parallel between the C++ types ' world and the threading semantics world .
Outside a critical section , any thread might interrupt any other at any time ; there is no control , so consequently variables accessible from multiple threads are volatile .
This is in keeping with the original intent of volatile  that of preventing the compiler from unwittingly caching values used by multiple threads at once .
a critical section , any thread might interrupt any other at any time ; there is no control , so consequently variables accessible from multiple threads are .
This is in keeping with the original intent of  that of preventing the compiler from unwittingly caching values used by multiple threads at once .
Inside a critical section defined by a mutex , only one thread has access .
Consequently , inside a critical section , the executing code has single - threaded semantics .
The controlled variable is not volatile anymore  you can remove the volatile qualifier .
In short , data shared between threads is conceptually volatile outside a critical section , and non- volatile inside a critical section .
You enter a critical section by locking a mutex .
You remove the volatile qualifier from a type by applying a const_cast .
If we manage to put these two operations together , we create a connection between C++'s type system and an application 's threading semantics .
We can make the compiler check race conditions for us .
LockingPtr
We need a tool that collects a mutex acquisition and a const_cast .
Let 's develop a LockingPtr class template that you initialize with a volatile object obj and a mutex mtx .
During its lifetime , a Locking Ptr keeps mtx acquired .
Also , LockingPtr offers access to the volatile - stripped obj .
The access is offered in a smart pointer fashion , through operator -> and operator* .
The const_cast is performed inside Locking Ptr .
The cast is semantically valid because Locking Ptr keeps the mutex acquired for its lifetime .
First , let 's define the skeleton of a class Mutex with which Locking Ptr will work :
class Mutex { public : void Acquire ( ) ; void Release ( ) ; ... } ;
To use Locking Ptr , you implement Mutex using your operating system 's native data structures and primitive functions .
LockingPtr is templated with the type of the controlled variable .
For example , if you want to control a Widget , you use a Locking Ptr < Widget > that you initialize with a variable of type volatile Widget .
LockingPtr 's definition is very simple .
LockingPtr implements an unsophisticated smart pointer .
It focuses solely on collecting a const_cast and a critical section .
template < typename T > class LockingPtr { public : // Constructors / destructors LockingPtr( volatile T& obj , Mutex& mtx ) : pObj_(const_cast<T*>( &obj ) ) , pMtx_ ( &mtx ) { mtx .
Lock ( ) ; } ~ Locking Ptr ( ) { pMtx_->Unlock ( ) ; } // Pointer behavior T& operator *() { return * pObj_ ; } T* operator ->( ) { return pObj_ ; } private : T* pObj_ ; Mutex * pMtx_ ; LockingPtr(const LockingPtr& ) ; LockingPtr& operator= ( const Locking Ptr& ) ; } ;
In spite of its simplicity , Locking Ptr is a very useful aid in writing correct multithreaded code .
You should define objects that are shared between threads as volatile and never use const_cast with them  always use Locking Ptr automatic objects .
Let 's illustrate this with an example .
Say you have two threads that share a vector < char > object :
class SyncBuf { public : void Thread1 ( ) ; void Thread2 ( ) ; private : typedef vector < char > BufT ; volatile BufT buffer_ ; Mutex mtx_ ; // controls access to buffer_ } ;
Inside a thread function , you simply use a Locking Ptr < BufT > to get controlled access to the buffer_ member variable :
void SyncBuf :: Thread1 ( ) { LockingPtr< BufT > lpBuf ( buffer_ , mtx_ ) ; BufT : : iterator i = lpBuf -> begin( ) ; for ( ; i != lpBuf ->end ( ) ; ++i ) { ... use * i ... } }
The code is very easy to write and understand  whenever you need to use buffer_ , you must create a Locking Ptr < BufT > pointing to it .
Once you do that , you have access to vector 's entire interface .
The nice part is that if you make a mistake , the compiler will point it out :
void SyncBuf :: Thread2 ( ) { // Error !
Cannot access ' begin ' for a volatile object BufT ::iterator i = buffer_.begin( ) ; // Error !
Cannot access ' end ' for a volatile object for ( ; i != lpBuf ->end ( ) ; ++i ) { ... use * i ... } }
You cannot access any function of buffer_ until you either apply a const_cast or use Locking Ptr .
The difference is that LockingPtr offers an ordered way of applying const_cast to volatile variables .
LockingPtr is remarkably expressive .
If you only need to call one function , you can create an unnamed temporary Locking Ptr object and use it directly :
unsigned int SyncBuf : : Size ( ) { return Locking Ptr< BufT >( buffer_ , mtx_ ) -> size ( ) ; }
Back to Primitive Types
We saw how nicely volatile protects objects against uncontrolled access and how Locking Ptr provides a simple and effective way of writing thread - safe code .
Let 's now return to primitive types , which are treated differently by volatile .
Let 's consider an example where multiple threads share a variable of type int .
class Counter { public : ... void Increment ( ) { ++ctr_ ; } void Decrement ( ) { ctr_ ; } private : int ctr_ ; } ;
If Increment and Decrement are to be called from different threads , the fragment above is buggy .
First , ctr_ must be volatile .
Second , even a seemingly atomic operation such as ++ ctr_ is actually a three - stage operation .
Memory itself has no arithmetic capabilities .
When incrementing a variable , the processor :
Reads that variable in a register
Increments the value in the register
Writes the result back to memory
This three - step operation is called RMW ( Read - Modify - Write ) .
During the Modify part of an RMW operation , most processors free the memory bus in order to give other processors access to the memory .
If at that time another processor performs a RMW operation on the same variable , we have a race condition : the second write overwrites the effect of the first .
To avoid that , you can rely , again , on Locking Ptr :
class Counter { public : ... void Increment ( ) { ++* Locking Ptr<int >( ctr_ , mtx_ ) ; } void Decrement ( ) { * Locking Ptr<int > ( ctr_ , mtx_ ) ; } private : volatile int ctr_ ; Mutex mtx_ ; } ;
Now the code is correct , but its quality is inferior when compared to SyncBuf 's code .
Why ?
Because with Counter , the compiler will not warn you if you mistakenly access ctr_ directly ( without locking it ) .
The compiler compiles ++ ctr_ if ctr_ is volatile , although the generated code is simply incorrect .
The compiler is not your ally anymore , and only your attention can help you avoid race conditions .
What should you do then ?
Simply encapsulate the primitive data that you use in higher - level structures and use volatile with those structures .
Paradoxically , it 's worse to use volatile directly with built - ins , in spite of the fact that initially this was the usage intent of volatile !
volatile Member Functions
So far , we 've had classes that aggregate volatile data members ; now let 's think of designing classes that in turn will be part of larger objects and shared between threads .
Here is where volatile member functions can be of great help .
When designing your class , you volatile - qualify only those member functions that are thread safe .
You must assume that code from the outside will call the volatile functions from any code at any time .
Do n't forget : volatile equals free multithreaded code and no critical section ; non- volatile equals single - threaded scenario or inside a critical section .
For example , you define a class Widget that implements an operation in two variants  a thread - safe one and a fast , unprotected one .
class Widget { public : void Operation ( ) volatile ; void Operation ( ) ; ... private : Mutex mtx_ ; } ;
Notice the use of overloading .
Now Widget 's user can invoke Operation using a uniform syntax either for volatile objects and get thread safety , or for regular objects and get speed .
The user must be careful about defining the shared Widget objects as volatile .
When implementing a volatile member function , the first operation is usually to lock this with a Locking Ptr .
Then the work is done by using the non- volatile sibling :
void Widget :: Operation ( ) volatile { LockingPtr< Widget > lpThis ( * this , mtx_ ) ; lpThis -> Operation ( ) ; // invokes the non-volatile function }
Summary
When writing multithreaded programs , you can use volatile to your advantage .
You must stick to the following rules :
Define all shared objects as volatile .
.
Do n't use volatile directly with primitive types .
directly with primitive types .
When defining shared classes , use volatile member functions to express thread safety .
If you do this , and if you use the simple generic component Locking Ptr , you can write thread - safe code and worry much less about race conditions , because the compiler will worry for you and will diligently point out the spots where you are wrong .
A couple of projects I 've been involved with use volatile and Locking Ptr to great effect .
The code is clean and understandable .
I recall a couple of deadlocks , but I prefer deadlocks to race conditions because they are so much easier to debug .
There were virtually no problems related to race conditions .
But then you never know .

At least for Copyblogger , that is .
It ’s been a good run .
From last fall , I ’ve grown this blog from 6,000 subscribers to close to 29,000 .
My strategy for 2007 relied on appealing to social media news and bookmarking sites using the copywriting techniques I teach here , plus the goodwill of bloggers around the world who thought my content was worth mentioning .
Digg certainly played a part in that .
Mostly , landing on the Digg front page a couple times a month resulted only in a server - shaking stampede of worthless traffic .
But mixed in with the basement - dwelling little boys who momentarily refrained from Playstationing with their Wiis long enough to tell me I sucked , I picked up new subscribers .
No longer .
After a scientifically - sound amount of testing , it ’s clear that Copyblogger has been placed on the dreaded Digg auto - bury list .
Never heard of that ?
That ’s because Digg refuses to acknowledge that auto - bury exists , but it most certainly does .
Ironically , I was buried by success .
In September , my content made the Digg front page six times , with three articles making it in a single week .
After that , it became obvious that Kevin Rose and his in - house nerd brigade could n’t tolerate quality content making the Digg home page that frequently .
After all , what would Ron Paul think ?
If you think I ’m whining , I ’m not .
All good things must come to an end .
But all you social media utopians out there , pay heed .
Social media is a reflection of society .
Dorks like Mark Zuckerberg and Kevin Rose are not about openness and idealism , no matter what load they shovel to the masses .
They ’re just like anyone else — susceptible to the corrupting influence of quick and unchecked power .
In fact , they may be worse than most people .
The tortured nerd seems to exact terrible retribution , no ?
Throughout all the Web 2.0 hoopla that made Michael Arrington rich and no one else , there is one bright spot .
There ’s one amazing force that is actually changing the world for the better .
Blogs .
Human nature wo n’t change .
But for the first time in history , the rest of us have the collective ability to point out the bullshit and hold people and companies accountable , thanks to our blogs .
Like right now .
Former presidential candidate calls Clinton ' soft ' on corporate crime and abuse .
Nader throws support to Edwards
MUSCATINE , Iowa — Ralph Nader unleashed on Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton Monday — criticizing her for being soft on defense spending and a chum of big business — and expressed his strong support for John Edwards .
In an eleventh hour effort to encourage liberal Iowans to " recognize " the former North Carolina senator by " giving him a victory , " the activist and former presidential contender said in an interview that Clinton will " pander to corporate interest groups " if elected .

Nader specifically accused Clinton of failing to challenge military spending because " she is a woman who does n't want to be labeled as soft on defense , and she does n't want to be shown as taking on big business . "
As Clinton campaigned through a snowstorm in southeast Iowa , pledging to " bring about the changes we need , " Nader accused the Democratic senator from New York of using empty rhetoric .
" [ Clinton ] has not led the way against the avalanche of military contracting , corporate crime , fraud and abuse , " he said .
" We want to inform the people of Iowa about Hillary Clinton because all the focus is on , do they have the experience and do they have the personal charisma , and can they cross the aisle " Nader said .
" The issue is corporate power and who controls our political system and it's not who has experience for six years or two years , " he said , alluding to an ongoing debate over experience between Clinton and freshman Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
" She has experience in the Senate , and what that experience has meant is going soft on cracking down on corporate crime , fraud , and abuse , soft on cutting tens of millions in corporate subsidies , " he continued .
The Clinton campaign declined to comment on Nader 's criticism .
Nader , a four - time presidential candidate , called Edwards a Democratic " glimmer of hope . "
He has long criticized Democrats as indistinguishable from Republicans , chiding both parties as slaves to corporate financing and interests .
It was Nader who famously — or infamously to many Democrats — siphoned off enough liberal votes from Al Gore in 2000 to hand New Hampshire and Florida , and as a result , the presidency , to George W. Bush .
Since 2004 , however , Nader has been increasingly controversial within the political left .
He was booed at a national conference of progressives earlier this year .
But he remains a popular figure among some liberals .
Activists are particularly influential in the Iowa caucuses , if only because participation asks hours of voters ' time .
Only a small portion of Iowa Democrats caucused in 2004 .
Clinton is currently locked in a heated three - way race with Obama and Edwards in Iowa , the first contest of the presidential primaries .
On Monday , Nader also issued a public statement criticizing Clinton as a " corporate Democrat , " echoing the exact words Edwards uses to challenge Clinton .
Nader said he has watched Edwards from afar and sees his more pugilistic brand of populism as an encouraging sign .
" It 's the only time I 've heard a Democrat talk that way in a long time , " Nader said , acknowledging what was , for him , a rare moment of praise for a Democratic leader .
" Iowa should decide which candidate stands for us , " he added .
" Edwards is at least highlighting day after day that the issue is who controls our country : big business or the people ? "

peeing with people
I cannot , for the life of me , pee when someone else is in the bathroom .
I will have to pee so bad and when I get to the bathroom and realize someone is in the stall next to me , my bladder seizes up and then I get paranoid that someone thinks I ’m waiting for them to leave so I can take a poop .
Still struggling to pee in public ,

LEGO Tower
A new LEGO tower in the UK has taken over the title of “ world ’s tallest ” .
Constructed using over 500,000 bricks , it towers 100 - feet above LEGOLAND Windsor .
The kids who visit the park helped built this massive structure , 20 cm levels at a time — levels were stacked atop each other using a crane .

Filing Cabinet Tower
Standing 65 - feet tall , this filing cabinet tower is n’t just for looks .
In each drawer , you ’ll find the parts of a dismantled MG sports car , sorted by weight ( heaviest – lightest ) .
However , getting the parts out is another story .
It was created by artist Sam Yates .

MPR —
The students came from schools all around the Twin Cities to the plaza outside the Hennepin County Government Center .
They expressed their stance on the war through chants , signs and song .
One of the organizers , Tyrus Thompson , who calls himself Tyrus A , sang a protest song in front of a group of charged - up teenagers .
“ … looking to stop a rogue regime , the first one that we must confront is Washington D.C. , ” sang Thompson , who sports a mohawk completely spiked , reminiscent of early British punk rockers .
Thompson is with Youth Against War and Racism and a group called Socialist Alternative .
The two groups were the main sponsors of the rally .
Kelsey Grinke from the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley recited the latest death tolls for U.S. soldiers and Iraqi citizens .
“ It has been the bloodiest year of the war so far , ” Grinke said .
“ I ask you , are these deaths really bringing justice and democracy to Iraq ? ”
Other speakers focused on the cost of the war in financial terms .
They complained that the government should take the money being spent on the war and use it for their schools .
Speakers called for smaller class sizes and to make more money available for college scholarships .

Protest rock
Students also chanted against military recruiters who look for enlistees at their schools .
One student protester claimed that one of his friends was coached by a recruiter on how to beat a drug test .
Other students , like Selena Kane came to the rally because they have loved ones who are either in Iraq or in the process of going there .

Critics say tinkering with human embryos is ' immoral '
The government has survived two big challenges to its controversial plans to change the law on embryo research for the first time in 20 years .
A cross-party attempt to ban hybrid human animal embryos was defeated on a free vote , by 336 to 176 .
Catholic cabinet ministers Ruth Kelly , Des Browne and Paul Murphy voted for a ban .
PM Gordon Brown and Tory leader David Cameron both opposed it .
A bid to ban " saviour siblings " was voted down by 342 votes to 163 .
The votes followed two impassioned debates in the committee stage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill , aimed at updating laws from 1990 in line with scientific advances .
' Ethically wrong '
On Tuesday , MPs have a further free vote on the emotive issue of cutting the abortion time limit .
Mr Cameron , along with Mr Brown , has backed the use of hybrid embryos as a means to develop treatments for cancer and conditions such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease .
They also both support the creation of " saviour siblings " .
BILL'S KEY VOTES
Use of hybrid embryos - Monday ' Saviour siblings ' - Monday Role of fathers in IVF - Tuesday Abortion limits - Tuesday
How ministers voted Research ' gives me hope ' Q&A : Hybrid embryos
However , the majority of the Tory shadow cabinet , including shadow foreign secretary William Hague and shadow home secretary David Davis , backed the unsuccessful attempt to ban hybrids .
Ex-minister Edward Leigh , who led the fight against the creation of hybrid " admixed " embryos , said they were " ethically wrong and almost certainly medically useless " .
He said there was " no evidence yet to substantiate " claims the work could lead to treatment for degenerative diseases like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
The bill would allow regulated research using hybrid or " admix " embryos , where the nuclei of human cells are inserted into animal eggs .
The resulting embryos would be kept for up to 14 days to harvest stem cells .
Health Minister Dawn Primarolo says any research done using human embryos " must satisfy the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that it was necessary or desirable " .
No human " admix " embryo would be implanted into a woman or animal , she says .
' Too human ' ?
But Mr Leigh said : " We do not believe that regulation is enough .
We believe this is a step too far and therefore should be banned .
" In embryos , we do have the genetic make up of a complete human being and we could not and should not be spliced together with the animal kingdom . "
How hybrid embryos might be created And ex-Labour minister Sir Gerald Kaufman , agreed , adding : " How far do you go ?
Where do you stop ?
What are the limits and what are the boundaries ?
" If you permit the creation of hybrid embryos now , what will you seek to permit next time , even if you have no idea where it will lead ? "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Labour 's Chris Bryant , a former Anglican curate , said Mr Leigh 's arguments were like those used by church leaders against the smallpox vaccine .
" They were wrong and I think you are wrong today , " he said .
Liberal Democrat Evan Harris criticised those who argued hybrid embryos were too human .
" If it 's ethically acceptable to use up and destroy fully human embryos with all the potential they have , how is it right to provide for hybrid embryos , with less potential of viability , greater protection ? " he said .
A separate attempt to ban " pure " hybrid embryos , that would mix a human egg with animal sperm or vice versa , was also defeated in the Commons by 286 votes to 223 , a government majority of 63 .
Tory David Burrowes ' attempt to stop parents having so - called " saviour siblings " - babies selected to provide genetic material for seriously ill relatives - also suffered defeat .
The Bill would allow the selection of embryos that are a tissue match for a sick older brother or sister .
But Mr Burrowes said it was wrong to create a child for the benefit of another , regardless of " the need " .
MPs are being given a free vote on four controversial parts of the bill .
The other two areas are : Role of fathers in fertility treatment :
Would end the requirement for IVF clinics to consider the " welfare " of any child created in terms of need for a father .
Debate from 1530 BST Tuesday , with vote at about 1830 BST .
The upper limit for abortion : Amendments have been put down to the bill to cut from 24 weeks the time limit for abortions .
Debate on Tuesday from 1830 BST , with votes at about 2200 BST .
The Roman Catholic Church has branded the use of hybrid embryos as " monstrous " and says tinkering with life in this way is immoral .
Catholic bishops in Britain and the Irish Republic have given £ 25,000 to scientists using adult stem cells , which is less controversial than using immature ones .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There are ethical alternatives to what is , in effect , creating a Frankenstein hybrid Paul , Belfast Such cells can be used to create brain , skin , heart and other tissue for treating diseases .
But Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , chief executive of the Medical Research Council , said the result would keep the UK at the forefront of embryo research .
Conservative leader David Cameron , along with Mr Brown , has backed the use of hybrid embryos as a means to develop treatments for cancer and conditions such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease .
They also both support the creation of " saviour siblings " .
Scientists at Newcastle University announced last month that they had created the first part - human , part- animal hybrid embryos in the UK .
They were created by injecting DNA derived from human skin cells into eggs taken from cows ' ovaries which had had virtually all their genetic material removed .
Researchers say these human- animal " admixed " embryos could help solve the current problem of the lack of human eggs from which to generate embryos .

As death toll climbs , Chinese earthquake exposes deep social divide
By John Chan
15 May 2008
The major earthquake that hit China ’s Sichuan province on May 12 is a huge human tragedy .
The official death toll is now almost 15,000 and is expected to rise .
At least 26,000 people are believed to be buried in the debris and many of those may be dead .
According to estimates from Premier Wen Jiabao ’s working meeting yesterday , the affected area is 65,000 square kilometres , with 6 cities and 44 counties .
Half the 20 million residents in the area have been directly affected by the earthquake .
Although Chinese troops and armed police have begun to reach the most isolated areas , including the town of Wenchuan at the epicentre , severe weather and damaged roads have prevented the transport of bulldozers and other heavy equipment .
Wen has ordered parachute drops into the worst - affected counties and the deployment of 90 more helicopters .
So far , the aid supplied by 20 helicopters has been insufficient .
The number of soldiers mobilised has increased to 100,000 .
However , time is running out as soldiers and civilians use primitive tools and their bare hands to try to locate and extricate trapped victims .
TV footage has shown the flattened town of Yingxiu , which has been virtually wiped off the map .
Rescuers found only 2,300 people alive — out of a population of 10,000 .
Half the survivors are seriously injured .
Apart from the difficulties facing the rescue effort , tens of thousands of homeless people lack shelter and emergency supplies .
Yesterday afternoon , the Mianyang city government ordered 700,000 residents to evacuate all buildings after warnings of a sizeable aftershock .
The Associated Press reported : “ Homeless victims begged for aid on roadsides , and people settled in for a third night in a growing sprawl of refugee camps littered with garbage .
In Hanwang , a town in one of the hardest - hit counties , survivors stood hoping for handouts from cars , jostling with each other to reach one vehicle where a passenger handed bottled water out the window . ”
Hanwang Hospital , a seven - storey building , collapsed .
The surviving medical staff set up in a tyre factory driveway to provide basic care .
Zhao Xiaoli , a 25 - year - old nurse , told the Associated Press : “ I ’m numb .
The first day , hundreds of kids died when a school collapsed .
The rest who came in had serious injuries .
There was so little we could do for them . ”
There has been an outpouring of sympathy throughout China and internationally , and offers of assistance for the earthquake victims .
Ordinary working people in many Chinese cities have lined up to donate blood or money to assist the survivors .
Although the earthquake is a natural disaster , the extent of the destruction and death has exposed the monstrous reality of an irrational social order that puts private profit ahead of the safety and well being of people .
Anger is mounting at the shoddy character of the buildings in the impoverished towns and villages and the stark inequality between rich and poor .
Many schools and hospitals were flattened in Sichuan .
The death of school children has focussed resentment on “ tofu ” buildings — substandard constructions that look good on the outside but are like soybean curd on the inside .
Limited safety regulations are often subverted by corrupt collusion between developers and government officials .
An online comment cited in the Los Angeles Times yesterday asked : “ Why did so many schools collapse but all the government buildings were fine ?
It ’s outrageous ! ”
Dr. Tian has been treating the injured from Juyuan Middle School in Dujiangyan city , where collapsed buildings buried 900 students .
He told today ’s Australian newspaper : “ It ’s nothing but corruption — they must have used substandard cement and steel ... The morgue is full of children ’s bodies .
It ’s hell on earth . ”
A teacher who was lucky to escape explained : “ The school has been sending requests , at least since 2000 , to the local government asking for it to rebuild more safely , but it took no action . ”
Another staff member said : “ They [ the two main buildings ] were constructed from prefabricated cement boards that were inserted between steel poles to create walls .
They were very fragile compared with concrete walls made of cement poured on site . ”
By contrast , major transnational and Chinese corporations operating in Sichuan have survived largely intact , except for mining operations and power supplies .
Japanese plants in Chengdu , such as the Toyota auto factory and the Yamaha electronic components facility , have been shut for the safety concerns , but suffered little damage .
US operations , including the Intel assembly plant , did the same .
Wal - Mart closed three stores .
Microsoft and Motorola reported minor damage .
China ’s largest rice cake manufacturer , Want Want China Holdings , shut seven plants , but none were damaged .
The presence of these well - known corporations in Sichuan demonstrates the growing penetration of foreign capital into China ’s inland regions , although the investments are still relatively small compared to coastal regions .
Building codes have been enforced to protect the property of large investors , while other constructions have been ignored .
William Gormley , a former China manager of the US - based aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney , told the Los Angeles Times that when its joint venture was built in Chengdu in 1996 , Chinese officials insisted that the size of the piers was doubled and the foundations dug deeper to meet the seismic codes .
As a result , the factory withstood Monday ’s earthquake .
Gormley , who is still working in Chengdu as a business consultant , added that there were lots of “ unregulated ” buildings in Sichuan .
“ You do n’t find out how many until a tragedy like this happens , ” he said .
The Wall Street Journal yesterday contrasted the new high - rise buildings and office towers in Chengdu , equipped with anti-quake technology , with the flattened towns and villages .
“ Despite the recent growth of these outlying areas , the imbalance persists , as the rich get richer and the poor struggle to make ends meet .
There is so little work in many of Sichuan ’s rural areas that it is one of China ’s biggest sources of migrant labour . ”
The newspaper said the massive migration of rural labour into urban areas — 15 million people every year — has created the world ’s largest construction zone .
China built 1.8 billion square metres of property in 2006 and another 4.1 billion square metres are under construction .
Thousands of little - known towns and cities have sprouted up , but many buildings have been built cheaply and quickly , with little concern for safety .
Construction in Sichuan ranked fifth among China ’s provinces in 2006 , with almost twice as much property completed as in Beijing .
Poor planning and corruption associated with frenzied , often speculative construction has had other consequences .
The Chinese government is relieved that the Three Gorges Dam , the world ’s largest , has no reported damage .
However , according to the Ministry of Water Resources , 391 mainly small dams have suffered quake damage that could produce more disasters .
Some 2,000 troops have been sent to the two - year - old Zipingpu Dam in Sichuan , where cracks have appeared , threatening downstream communities , including the city of Dujiangyan .
During a government meeting in 2000 , seismologists opposed the plan to build the dam as it is close to a known fault line .
However , as with other infrastructure projects , the overriding preoccupation of Chinese authorities was to rush to provide power for rapidly expanding industry .
The Chinese government has been attempting to present a humane image , appealing to the broadly felt shock and sympathy .
Premier
Wen has been at the heart of this carefully managed PR operation .
He has toured the worst - hit areas and spoken of the need for a “ united ” effort behind the Communist Party leadership .
He wept before the cameras .
He slipped due to the rain on May 13 , but stoically refused to be treated by medical staff .
Authorities have even scaled back the Olympic torch relay inside China so as to not appear indifferent .
In the age of the Internet , the Chinese leaders are aware that the old methods of blanket censorship are not effective .
A similar PR operation took place in February when anger threatened to erupt over the “ snow havoc ” that left millions of rail passengers stranded and many areas without power .
Senior Politburo members were dispatched to all affected areas to make a show of concern .
In the midst of the crisis , the Los Angeles Times reported that the Chinese leadership had employed a US public relations firm to provide top - level schooling in crisis management .
So far , the latest campaign appears to be working .
The New York Times noted : “ Commentary on Chinese Web sites and in chat rooms has been full of praise for the government ’s emergency response .
On Tianya , a popular forum where antigovernment postings sometimes find a home , users have been quick to shout down those who criticise Mr. Wen and the military ’s delay in reaching some quake victims .
‘ Those who can only do mouth work please shut up at this key moment , ’ says one posting . ”
The Beijing bureaucracy , however , is concerned that the mood could change if stories of incompetence , corruption and callous indifference for the suffering of victims begin to emerge .
The propaganda bosses have issued an instruction to the state media to report developments “ positively ” .
The massive deployment of troops is not just for rescue efforts , but to prevent any protests breaking out .

I loved my dick when I was 13 and had a nice 7 inch tool .
I 'd put it through its paces regularly and just could n't wait to share it with some of my female classmates .
At 14 I was starting to get just a little concerned as I then had a 9 inch member .
It was great , but I was hoping for no further growth .
No such luck .
By the time I was 16 or 17 , the growth finally ended .
Unfortunately , not before I had reached my freakish proportions .
It 's 12 inches long .
It 's about as big around as one of those tall cans of Coors Light ( horrible beer , by the way ) .
It does n’t help that I ’m a shower , not a grower .
When flaccid it ’s still 9 inches .
In high school I picked up nicknames like cackyderm ( creative ) , kickstand , and “ the plunger . ” I was smart , funny , athletic , and well liked , though , so the kidding was not mean spirited .
I know that some awkward big dicked guys must go through much worse in high school .
Now , I ’m sure some guys are thinking that this does n’t sound like a problem and they would n’t mind swinging a stick like this around .
Trust me , it sucks .
To understand what it ’s like to live with a giant dick you have to throw out everything you know about normal life .
I love sports and athletic activities .
Unfortunately , my dick loves this too and celebrates by flopping around like a frog on a frying pan .
An extra large heavy - duty athletic supporter is an absolute must .
Go without , and I could end up with a black eye .
Of course , by the time I get everything stuffed into the supporter I look like I ’ve crammed a grapefruit down my shorts in case I need a snack at half time .
If the supporter fails , my dick will fly out of there like the spring snakes in one of those novelty cans of mixed nuts .
I hope there are n’t any kids watching the game .
I really enjoy swimming , but water + swim trunks = cling = gasps .
My next house will have a pool and a tall fence .
How about non-athletic activities like , say , walking down the street ?
First off , boxers are out .
No one wants to see that coming toward them .
Even briefs only do a marginal job of keeping everything from swinging around .
All new clothes must be tried on to see if they pass my dick visibility test ( DVT ) .
Jeans fail .
Many slacks fail .
Most shorts fail .
Need to sit on the toilet ?
Hold on to snakey or he ’s going swimming .
Fine , but it ’s gotta rock in the sack , right ?
Wrong .
Do n’t get me wrong , it gets hard as a rock and stays that way , but finding someone able to work with it has been difficult .
I ’m a nice , attractive , and successful guy so I have met a lot of women who wanted to get down with me .
That is , until they see my dick .
My first time was when I was 18 with a friend ’s older sister ( 23 ) .
The look on her face when she saw it erect was one of surprise , incredulity , and fear .
To her credit , she was willing to give it a go , but it would only go so far .
Guys , you know how great it feels to pound away “ balls deep ” ?
I do n’t .
I have yet to find a woman who can take it all .
A lot of women have simply said , “ Forget it ” once they see it .
Last month I met a really nice woman who followed me back to my place from a Belltown bar .
We got close and it was getting hot until ol ’ dicky came out .
The look on her face was one of actual horror ( you know , eyes bulged , hand over a gaping mouth ) .
Without saying a word , she bolted up , grabbed her clothes , and was out the door .
You ’d think it had five dragon heads at the end ( it does n’t , by the way ) .
How about a nice blowjob ?
Maybe if there were a bunch of female versions of Steve Tyler out there I ’d actually be able to get one .
That leaves few options .
I ’ve gotten very good at going down and handjobs are about all that works with most ladies .
Given the crap shoot of reactions from new partners , masturbation has been my best option overall .
I know things could be worse .
I ’m 6 ’ 2 ” and 220 pounds , so at least it does n’t look like an actual third leg like it would if I were 5 ’ 1 ” .
It ’s also not bent , does n’t just get to half mast , or have any of the other physical problems a dick can have .
But it ’s a damn hassle every day .
I ’d give my left nut to give up 4 inches and some girth .
To those guys who wish they had a massive dick instead of their average or below average one , I say enjoy what you have .
Things could be worse : your wish could come true .
How does Microsoft get those 3D models for Virtual Earth that make its Live Maps service so darn good ?
The answer is simple : if you want something done right , you have to do it yourself .
It turns out that Microsoft manufacturers its own UltraCam to get the job done .
Although the 3D models created for Virtual Earth come from more than just one source , the majority of the data comes from the large format digital aerial UltraCamX ( UCX ) .
Mark Brown , Senior Product Manager for Virtual Earth , describes the device by saying :
This thing is incredible , 216 mega- pixels with a panchromatic image size of 14,430 x 9,420 pixels , capturing data at over 3 GBits / sec , 13 CCD's - 7 pan and 4 color ( RGB + Near IR ) and 14 CPU 's to process the raw images and data in real - time .
The data units for the camera hold 1.7TB , enough for about 4,700 images .
Since they are swappable the only limitation to how much imagery you can collect is how big your aircraft is to hold these units .
The image quality can be very high , thanks to a 1:3 pan - to - color ratio .
The UCX collects pixels at a sustained rate of 3 Gb per second , and the average image has a size of 380 MB !
Who wants to take a guess at the price tag for this baby ?

OTTAWA --
In candid testimony before Parliament Tuesday , John Manley and Derek Burney , members of the independent panel on Afghanistan , said progress there has been hampered by what Mr. Manley called the American “ folly ” in Iraq .
But Mr. Burney , a former Canadian ambassador to Washington , said that with all the U.S. presidential candidates viewing Afghanistan as the “ good war , ” the United States can be re-engaged to make a difference on the ground there .
On the eve of a parliamentary vote on Canada ’s future in the war - torn country , Mr. Manley warned that the international commitment to Afghanistan has been inadequate and that unless NATO comes up with more troops and equipment , “ Afghanistan could be lost -- again . ”
Mr. Manley , the former Liberal cabinet minister , and MR .
Burney were testifying before the Commons foreign affairs committee , days before the House of Commons votes on extending the military mission to 2011 .
The key recommendations of Manley ’s panel have been adopted by the Stephen Harper government .
The prime minister has told NATO and its partners in the International Security Assistance Force , or ISAF , that Canadian troops would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan next February if the alliance cannot find an additional 1,000 combat troops in the south .
Canada has also committed itself to finding transport helicopters to minimize the risks to soldiers from roadside bombs .
“ We ’re trying to highlight for the other countries in ISAF , which is more than NATO , that this is not going well .
And it requires a greater commitment , ” Mr. Manley told the all - party committee of MPs .
Mr. Manley said the Taliban was able to take its time and regroup after being driven from power in late 2001 .
“ They waited until the attention of the international community , particularly the West , was distracted by what I ’d call the folly in Iraq , ” Mr. Manley said .
“ Before we knew it , we had an all out insurgency on our hands partly because of neglect . ”
Mr. Burney echoed MR .
Manley ’s assessment of the impact of the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
“ There ’s no question that the commitment in Afghanistan has been distracted by events in Iraq , by the No. 1 player in the military mission and the civilian mission . ”
But Mr. Burney added that it is encouraging that , “ in the eyes of the aspirants for the presidency in the United States today , from either party , this is the good war . ”
“ It seems to me that some of the distraction of NATO and the reluctance of NATO is a bit of a reflection of the distraction in Washington about the priority Afghanistan has had .
I do n’t think that that ’s going to be a problem going forward . ”
The chief of the Dutch military said Tuesday he is confident that Canada will receive the extra troops and equipment it needs to remain in southern Afghanistan .
Gen. D.L. ( Dick ) Berlijn said he is also hopeful that Parliament will , as expected , vote later this week to extend to 2011 the Canadian Forces ’ participation in the Afghan war .
Gen .
Berlijn said it would be “ a very bad turn of events if Canada would leave ” Kandahar when the current commitment expires next February .
What is the secular basis of Judaism ?
Practical need , self - interest .
What is the worldly religion of the Jew ?
Huckstering .
What is his worldly God ?
Money .
Very well then !
Emancipation from huckstering and money , consequently from practical , real Judaism , would be the self - emancipation of our time . "
- Karl Marx ; essay , The Jewish Question ; 1844
Not having a theology degree , nor even a Ph.D. , and being , too , a bit naïve regarding matters of high - brow philosophical currents throughout the ages , I have to admit that when I first read Karl Marx ' essay , The Jewish Question , I was actually stunned by its contents .
First off , my rather cursory education in various philosophies and in Marxism , particularly , did not prepare me for the bitter thrust of old Karl 's potent anti-Semitism .
In fact , until reading this particular essay , I would have never , in a million years , connected much of anything whatsoever Marxian with Jew hate .
Who would ?
After all , Karl Marx , himself , was a Jew .
Hitler and many others blamed the Jews for Communism , thanks to the number of Jews who played prominent roles in the Russian Revolution .
I naturally associated twentieth century Anti-Semitism with Adolph Hitler and the Nazis .
Ironically , if Karl Marx had still been alive and residing in Germany or any of the Nazi- occupied countries during WWII , he would have perished along with his brethren , despite his own " self - loathing - Jew " status .
Marx envisioned a society " which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering , and therefore the possibility of huckstering , " because this classless society " would make the Jew impossible . "
Personally , I find the opinion of some that Marx was a genius , to be downright laughable .
Regarding his opinions on the Jews , one is left to ponderously consider which ones were dumb , and which were dumber .
Evidently Karl Marx was as utterly ignorant of the true tenets of Judaism ( Self - sufficiency does not equate to " huckstering . " ) as he was of the diabolical possibilities inherent in his own words , once they were in the hands of one Adolph Hitler .
This atrocious irony might be merely a historical oddity if old Karl 's words were not still bouncing around in the heads of those who wish to lead new revolutions based upon them .
But Marx ' words still dominate much of what happens on the world stage today , even in our own republic .
The word emphasis has changed a bit .
The industrial proletariat is no longer the focus .
But as a newly prominent American politician is wont to remind us : words do matter .
Yes , of course , words matter , as many leaders of ambitious movements have mightily declared .
... the power which has always started the greatest religious and political avalanches in history rolling has from time to immemorial been the magic of power of the spoken word , and that alone .
Particularly the broad masses of the people can be moved only by the power of speech .
- Adolph Hitler , Mein Kampf .
The Oppressed Vs. the Oppressors
Just words .
But where do they come from , and what do they mean in America today ?
I might never have delved into the subject of the oppressed vs. the oppressors if I had not gone to Chicago in January seeking answers about a man who would be president .
When I visited Obama 's church , still under the directorship of Jeremiah Wright , I came away with far more questions than answers , and one thing leading to another , have spent the last several months trying to fathom how Marxist political philosophy wound up emblazoned with a cross and a pulpit , and pretending to rely on the Bible for its authority .
It is somewhat difficult to imagine a more contorted blasphemy , with the single possible exception of Hitler himself claiming to be acting by divine decree in the interests of Christianity .
Which is precisely what Hitler did do , while hoodwinking the German people into electing him Chancellor .
Hitler sprinkled Mein Kampf with Christian language , most likely to fit with the predominantly Christian German population , and appealed to voters on the strength of his Christian " calling " :
" I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator : by defending myself against the Jew , I am fighting for the work of the Lord . . "
As most junior - high Sunday schoolers know , however , a Christian is judged on actions , not words , and Hitler was no Christian .
He was a bamboozler of the lowest imaginable order .
Jeremiah Wright is the tiny tip of Obama 's spiritual iceberg
The phenomenon that raised so many questions for me in January , when I visited Trinity United Church of Christ , was not Jeremiah Wright 's sermon , which turned out to be just a call for all good congregants to support Barack Obama for President .
It was n't the sermon that caught me off guard ; I was prepared for that .
I had watched video of Wright , giving five of his fiery sermons .
The thing that really got me to thinking , reading and searching for answers was the church bookstore .
Having been a practicing Christian for more than 40 years now , and a practicing Catholic for 26 of those years , I have visited perhaps 100 various Christian bookstores , both Protestant and Catholic .
In all of those places , one thing tied together the books for sale : Christianity .
Not so in Obama 's church bookstore .
I spent more than an hour perusing available books , and found as many claiming to represent Muslim thought as those representing Christian thought .
Black Muslim thought , to be specific .
And the books claiming to support Christianity were surprisingly of a more political than religious nature .
The books by James H. Cone , Wright 's own mentor , were prominent and numerous .
Now that I have read a number of the books that presumably Wright 's congregants ( including Barack Obama ) have also read , I can only conclude that the thing tying these volumes together is not Christianity , nor any real religion , but the political philosophy of Karl Marx .
" The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . "
" Freeman and slave , patrician and plebeian , lord and serf , guild - master and journeyman , in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another , carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden , now open fight , a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes . " ( emphasis mine )
- Marx and Engels ; The Communist Manifesto ; 1848
If Marxism can be summed up in only a couple of phrases , now familiar to nearly every modern person , they would be " class struggle " and " oppressed vs. oppressors . "
James H. Cone , the unquestioned modern - day mentor of all the black power preachers , claims to have created a new theology , uniting the Muslim black power tenets of Malcolm X and the Christian foundations of Martin Luther King , Jr .
All he has really done , in my opinion , is take original liberation theology from Latin America , developed in the early 1960s by Catholic priests , and painted it black .
Liberation Theology vs. Traditional Christianity
The teaching authorities of the Catholic Church , have for more than 20 years now , been attempting to stamp out these heretical liberation theologies , denouncing them as vehemently antithetical to the Catholic Christian faith , and have been strenuously combating this Marxist counterfeit Christianity on many fronts within the Church herself .
Of course , the Medieval , iron - fisted clamp of the Catholic Church 's authority , even within the Church herself , is routinely overstated , and there are renegade priests all over the place ( more on another of Obama 's spiritual mentors , a liberation theology Catholic priest in Chicago , in Part Two next week ) .
Not to mention the fact that the Catholic Church has no authority whatsoever over those claiming to represent protestant interpretations of the Christian faith , such as Cone and Wright .
But it is important to note here that liberation theology , including black liberation theology , has not gone unnoticed by the learned biblical scholars within the Vatican , and liberation theology has been roundly denounced as both heretical and dangerous , not only to the authentic Christian faith , but even more so to the societies which come to embrace it .
Just one nugget from the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , " Instruction on Certain Aspects of the ‘ Theology of Liberation ' :
" ... it would be illusory and dangerous to ignore the intimate bond which radically unites them ( liberation theologies ) , and to accept elements of the marxist analysis without recognizing its connections with the ( Marxist ) ideology , or to enter into the practice of the class - struggle and of its marxist interpretation while failing to see the kind of totalitarian society to which this process slowly leads . "
- ( Author : Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger , Prefect , now Pope Benedict XVI ; written in 1984 )
Understanding that black liberation theology is Marxism dressed up to look like Christianity helps explain why there is no conflict between Cone 's " Christianity " and Farrakhan 's " Nation of Islam . "
They are two prophets in the same philosophical ( Marxist ) pod , merely using different religions as backdrops for their black - power aims .
As Cone himself writes in his 1997 preface to a new edition of his 1969 book , Black Theology and Black Power :
" As in 1969 , I still regard Jesus Christ today as the chief focus of my perspective on God but not to the exclusion of other religious perspectives .
God 's reality is not bound by one manifestation of the divine in Jesus but can be found wherever people are being empowered to fight for freedom .
Life - giving power for the poor and the oppressed is the primary criterion that we must use to judge the adequacy of our theology , not abstract concepts .
As Malcolm X put it : ‘ I believe in a religion that believes in freedom .
Any time I have to accept a religion that wo n't let me fight a battle for my people , I say to hell with that religion ' . " ( p. xii ; emphases mine )
And , to drive his Marxist emphasis even further , Cone again quotes Malcolm X :
" The point that I would like to impress upon every Afro - American leader is that there is no kind of action in this country ever going to bear fruit unless that action is tied in with the overall international ( class ) struggle . " ( p. xiii )
( Ironically , considering the formal Church teaching regarding liberation theologies , this book of Cone 's was published by Orbis , owned and managed by The Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America , a Maryknoll religious entity .
So much for the totalitarianism of the Catholic Church . )
It is this subjugation of genuine Christianity to the supremacy of the Marxist class struggle , which marks the true delineation between traditional Christianity and black liberation theology , as Pope Benedict XVI ( writing in 1984 as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger ) sums up thusly :
" For the marxist , the truth is a truth of class : there is no truth but the truth in the struggle of the revolutionary class . "
Which is precisely why Cone and his disciples are able to boldly proclaim that if the Jesus of traditional Christianity is not united with them in the Marxist class struggle , then he is a " white Jesus , " and they must " kill him . "
( Cone ; A Black Theology of Liberation ; p. 111 )
And Cone brings it all the way home with this proclamation of liberation from traditional Christianity itself :
" The appearance of black theology means that the black community is now ready to do something about he white Jesus , so that he can not get in the way of our revolution . "
Move over Jesus and make way for Cone , Wright and Obama .
The revolution is at hand .
And presto- chango , once we 've followed Marx , Cone , Wright and Obama down the yellow brick road to revolution , Christianity as we 've known it for millennia ceases to exist .
Obama was raised by his mother , the agnostic anthropologist , to regard religion as " an expression of human culture ... not its wellspring , just one of the many ways -- and not necessarily the best way -- that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives . "
( Audacity of Hope ; p. 204 )
However , when Barack Obama met Jeremiah Wright in the mid-eighties , between his years at Columbia and Harvard Law , he found a " faith " perfectly accommodating to his already well - formed worldview .
From The Audacity of Hope :
" In the history of these ( African people 's ) struggles , I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death ; rather , it was an active , palpable agent in the world . " ( p. 207 )
As Obama explains further , it was Wright 's ( and presumably Cone's , as required of new members at Trinity ) peculiar form of Christianity that Obama found palatable :
" It was because of these newfound understandings ( at Trinity under Wright ) -- that religious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking , disengage from the battle for economic and social justice ... that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity ... and be baptized . "
Wright 's vision of Christianity was perfectly appetizing to Barack Obama ; he did n't need to change a thing .
Liberation Theology and the New Order of Things
James
Cone devotes many words in all of his books to instructing his disciples to beware of those resistant to the necessary change in the power structure , warning that ,
" those who would cast their lot with the victims must not forget that the existing structures are powerful and complex ... Oppressors want people to think that change is impossible . "
( James H. Cone ; Speaking the Truth ; p. 49 )
Pope Benedict XVI ( writing as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger ) give an equally stringent message to Catholics about liberation theology regarding the perversion of the Christian understanding of the " poor " :
" In its positive meaning the Church of the poor signifies the preference given to the poor , without exclusion , whatever the form of their poverty , because they are preferred by God ... But the theologies of liberation ... go on to a disastrous confusion between the poor of the Scripture and the proletariat of Marx .
In this way they pervert the Christian meaning of the poor , and they transform the fight for the rights of the poor into a class fight within the ideological perspective of the class struggle . "
According to Pope Benedict 's instruction on liberation theology , our understanding of the virtues , faith , hope and charity are subjugated to the new Marxist order :
Faith becomes " fidelity to history . "
We are the ones we 've been waiting for , to bring about the final fruition of the class struggle .
Hope becomes " confidence in the future . "
Yes , we can change the world ; we do n't need God .
Our collective redemption comes when we engage in the Marxist class struggle .
Charity becomes " option for the poor . "
All are not created equal .
Special political privilege for the oppressed , socialism , will set us free .
It 's the dawn of a new age .
Although digitization has made the printing and typesetting process much faster , distribution still takes time , especially in a country as big as America .
( In Britain , with its smaller size and more insular literary culture , things move faster . )
But once a book hits the market , the product has to move .
“ For all the weeks and months that go into the gestation of the book , we ’re up against the so - called lettuce test once we get into the stores , ” Kirshbaum said .
“ If we do n’t get sales fast , the book wilts . ”
Some stores like Target and Wal - Mart reserve room in advance for mass - market paperbacks by authors like Janet Evanovich or Nora Roberts .
If an author is late with a deadline and misses the target publication date , the stores wo n’t have room on the shelf , since they ’re expecting next month ’s crop of projected best sellers .
“ Unless you have a major author , you probably have to wait another four to six months to publish that book , ” said Matthew Shear , the publisher of St. Martin ’s Press , which puts out Evanovich ’s Stephanie Plum mysteries .
Like movie studios jockeying over opening dates to score huge first - weekend box office numbers , publishers often change publication dates to avoid competition for reader attention and marketing buzz .
The publishers of Stephen King , John Grisham and James Patterson do n’t want their books appearing at the same time , since all three hope to make No. 1 on the best - seller list .
Last year , Little , Brown & Company moved up the publication date of “ Her Way , ” a biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton by Don Van Natta Jr. , a New York Times reporter , and Jeff Gerth , a former Times reporter , so it would appear around the same time as “ A Woman in Charge , ” by Carl Bernstein , published by Knopf .
The Bernstein book sold more copies , though perhaps not as many as it would have without a rival book on the market .
“ You ’re competing for retail space , you ’re competing for bandwidth , you ’re competing for column inches , ” said Paul Bogaards , the director of publicity at Knopf .
“ Both books wind up suffering because readers have to make a choice . ”
The same thing happened last year when two books on sushi 
“ The Sushi Economy , ” by Sasha Issenberg ( Gotham ) , and “ The Zen of Fish , ” by Trevor Corson ( HarperCollins )  appeared nearly simultaneously .
“ You never want to get in a horse race with another book on the same subject , ” said William Shinker , the president and publisher of Gotham .
Real - world events  the 9/11 attacks , the death of the pope , Hurricane Katrina  can either distract from books or provide a hook .
This year , publishers are scheduling a range of titles to coincide with the Beijing Olympics , including “ The Last Days of Old Beijing , ” by Michael Meyer ( Walker ) , about the destruction of old neighborhoods to make way for the Olympics , and “ Wolf Totem ” ( Penguin Press ) , a novel by Jiang Rong that just won the Man Asia Literary Prize .
Members of the sect deny abusing their children
An appeal court has ruled that US officials had no right to seize 463 children from a polygamist sect in western Texas last month .
The court said that the reasons given for the children 's removal were " legally and factually insufficient " .
But it did not immediately order the return of the children to the ranch .
In April , officials raided a compound of the sect , saying young girls were being forced into marriage and sex .
The children were placed into foster care .
But the Texas Third Court of Appeals ruled that officials failed to demonstrate the children were in any immediate danger , which is the only legally allowable reason for taking children from their homes without court proceedings .
Confusion The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has denied abuse and says it is being persecuted .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Correspondents say the case , which began with a raid on 3 April , has been marked by confusion .
So far , 168 mothers and 69 fathers of the children have been identified - reflecting the polygamist practices of the sect - the Associated Press news agency reports .
More than 100 children have still not been matched with mothers .
Some of the parents say they do not know where their children have been placed , while others have complained that their sons and daughters are living at different locations , forcing them to criss - cross Texas to see them .
Officials have said that several of the sect members they had listed as minors are in fact adults .
They said the situation was complicated because some women and children had given different names and lied about ages .
Initially , officials said more than half of the underage girls were either mothers or were pregnant .
The children were taken from the sect 's Yearning For Zion ranch
The legal age of sexual consent in Texas is 17 and polygamy is illegal in the US .
The children were removed from the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado after someone called a domestic abuse hotline claiming to be a pregnant 16 - year - old abused by a much older husband .
The girl has never been found and authorities are investigating whether the calls were a hoax .
Earlier this month , investigators said they had found signs of physical injuries among the children , but added it was unclear whether these were due to abuse .
Members live in large extended families , making it hard to determine exact parenthood , and the state is using DNA tests in its investigation .
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) is an offshoot of the Mormon Church .
It broke away from the mainstream Mormons more than a century ago .
FLDS members are taught that a man must marry at least three wives in order to ascend to heaven .
The church denies forcing young girls into polygamy .

What are these ?
Maybe they should be called the Oboptimists .
The latest New York Times / CBS
News poll found a striking difference between the way that Senator Barack Obama ’s voters think about the future and the that way Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s voters do .
Both groups overwhelmingly say that the country is in rough shape — headed in the wrong direction , with an economy that is bad and getting worse .
But when they are asked how well the next generation will live , the two groups diverge .
Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters fall into three roughly equal - sized camps : those who say the next generation will live better than people do today ( 35 percent ) , those who say living standards will remain roughly the same ( 31 percent ) and those who say living standards will decline ( 30 percent ) , according to a poll analysis done by my colleague , Marjorie Connelly .
( For details on how the poll was conducted , click here . )
These attitudes closely track those of the population as a whole , 33 percent of whom say the next generation will be better off .
Clinton supporters have a similar outlook about the future as Republican voters do — and are somewhat more upbeat than people not voting in this year ’s primaries .
But Clinton supporters are far less optimistic than Obama supporters .
Among people who say they have voted for Mr. Obama already or plan to do so in an upcoming contest , 50 percent predict that the next generation will live better than people do now ; only 23 percent say it will live worse .
This is one of the main ways that Obama supporters stand out , both from other Democrats and from the rest of the public .
Perhaps this is not so surprising , given the Obama campaign ’s call for “ change we can believe in ” and given the large number of young people supporting him .
But in a year when the Democrats have split into two groups of similar size , optimism about the country ’s future still stands out as a notable dividing line .
Speaking with evident condescension , Arizona Sen .
John McCain needled Barack Obama on Wednesday by offering to travel to Iraq with the Illinois senator to help him gain a better understanding of the war and the consequences of withdrawing troops .
The attack by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was in line with his campaign ’s recent attempts to portray Obama as too young and inexperienced to lead the nation .
Speaking before a boisterous crowd of 500 who gathered for a town - hall - style meeting here , McCain accused his Democratic rival of ignoring the successes of the U.S. troop buildup in Iraq and suggested that Obama was ignorant of the facts .
“ To say that we failed in Iraq and we ’re not succeeding does not comport with the facts on the ground , so we ’ve got to show him the facts on the ground , ” McCain said .

McCain also said Obama ’s proposal to set a date for troop withdrawal would “ lead to chaos , genocide and increased Iranian influence . ”
At a late - afternoon news conference in Beverly Hills , McCain said he was glad to learn via news accounts that Obama is considering a trip to Iraq this summer -- although not a joint trip with McCain , which the Obama campaign branded “ a political stunt . ”
“ It ’s long overdue ; it ’s been 871 days since he was there , ” McCain said , referring to a 2006 trip Obama took to Iraq .
“ And I ’m confident that when he goes he will then change his position on the conflict in Iraq . ”
Obama spokesman Bill Burton fired back that it was “ odd that Sen.
McCain , who bought the flawed rationale for war so readily , would be lecturing others on their depth of understanding about Iraq . ”

Burton said Obama challenged President Bush ’s rationale for the war “ from the start . ”
“ Sen . McCain stubbornly insists on pursuing the failed Bush policy that continues to cost so much , while Sen .
Obama believes it ’s time to begin a deliberate , careful strategy to remove our troops and compel the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future . ”
Obama , in a session with reporters while flying back to Chicago from Colorado , spoke of the coming conclusion of his contest with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for the Democratic nomination .
He said he believed the winner of the race should be known by the end of the day Tuesday , and that he believes he will be the victor .
By Tuesday evening , the three remaining primaries , in Puerto Rico , Montana and South Dakota , will be over .
That also will be three days after the Saturday meeting of party officials in Washington to resolve a dispute over how to account for Democratic delegates from Michigan and Florida , two states whose primary results are considered unofficial because the contests were held earlier on the calendar than party rules allowed .

“ At that point , all the information will be in , ” Obama said .
He signaled he was counting on the party insiders known as superdelegates to provide the decisive support , saying that “ they will make their decisions pretty quickly ” after the final primaries .
He also brushed aside the possibility that a lawsuit or a floor challenge by Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in August could block his nomination .
“ If we ’ve got the number of delegates to secure the nomination , then I ’m the nominee , ” he said .
Earlier in the day , he focused on education policy .
He appeared at a school in Thornton , Colo. , north of Denver , on the last day of his three - day swing through Western battleground states .
Obama reserved special attention for the federal No Child Left Behind law that , critics say , has placed unfunded federal burdens on public schools .
Advertisement
“ Forcing our teachers , our principals , and our schools to accomplish all of this without the resources they need is wrong , ” Obama said .
Clinton , appearing in Kyle , S.D. , made the case that she remained a serious contender for the presidency .
“ I view my run for president as a solemn obligation , ” she said , appearing before about 300 people outside of a school .
“ I do n’t run for president because I need any more publicity or because I need the adulation or the celebrity or to live in the White House again , ” she added .
“ I run because I believe we can do so much better in our country . ”
Clinton , after reviewing some of her policy positions , turned to her contest with Obama and described the race as still very tight .
“ It is so close that neither of us have the number of delegates needed to be president , ” she said .

Making her familiar argument , Clinton said her primary wins in many of the biggest states showed that she would be the more formidable Democratic candidate in November .

Times staff writer Louise Roug also contributed to this report from South Dakota .
Reston reported from Nevada and Los Angeles , and Martelle from Colorado .
Senator John McCain appeared on this morning 's Fox News Sunday and as is common with the aging GOP presidential candidate , he has a hard time grasping reality and dealing with pesky details .
McCain rightly states that the Democratic presidential candidates have energized younger voters -- and he honestly believes he has as well .
How is he pulling this off ?
He appeared on David Letterman :
Download Download ( h/t BillW )
" ... It 's pretty clear that Senator Obama and Senator Clinton have energized the younger voters and I believe I have and I believe I 've got to compete on that grounds too .
That 's why I go on shows that young people watch , so I 'm not sure that the old red state , blue state scenario that prevailed for the last several elections really works . "
Yes , Grandpa McWar sure has fired up the kids , has n't he ?
This conversation started with Wallace handing McCain voting maps put together by none other than Karl Rove , ( who is now officially advising the McCain campaign while on the Fox payroll , a fact they still have n't publicly admitted ) citing un - sourced polling data showing many traditionally blue states being in play this year for the GOP .
McCain even believes that California could go his way this year and says high Hispanic and African American turnout could work to his benefit .
WTF ?

Htaccess - Evolved
AskApache Htaccess Journey
What Is .htaccess
. htaccess
SKIP : History of Htaccess in 1st Apache .
One of the design goals for this server was to maintain external compatibility with the NCSA 1.3 server --- that is , to read the same configuration files , to process all the directives therein correctly , and in general to be a drop - in replacement for NCSA .
On the other hand , another design goal was to move as much of the server 's functionality into modules which have as little as possible to do with the monolithic server core .
The only way to reconcile these goals is to move the handling of most commands from the central server into the modules .
However , just giving the modules command tables is not enough to divorce them completely from the server core .
The server has to remember the commands in order to act on them later .
That involves maintaining data which is private to the modules , and which can be either per-server , or per-directory .
Most things are per-directory , including in particular access control and authorization information , but also information on how to determine file types from suffixes , which can be modified by AddType and DefaultType directives , and so forth .
In general , the governing philosophy is that anything which can be made configurable by directory should be ; per-server information is generally used in the standard set of modules for information like Aliases and Redirects which come into play before the request is tied to a particular place in the underlying file system .
Another requirement for emulating the NCSA server is being able to handle the per-directory configuration files , generally called .htaccess files , though even in the NCSA server they can contain directives which have nothing at all to do with access control .
Accordingly , after URI -> filename translation , but before performing any other phase , the server walks down the directory hierarchy of the underlying filesystem , following the translated pathname , to read any .htaccess files which might be present .
The information which is read in then has to be merged with the applicable information from the server 's own config files ( either from the < directory > </ directory > sections in access.conf , or from defaults in srm.conf , which actually behaves for most purposes almost exactly like < directory ></ directory > ) .
Finally , after having served a request which involved reading .htaccess files , we need to discard the storage allocated for handling them .
That is solved the same way it is solved wherever else similar problems come up , by tying those structures to the per-transaction resource pool .

htaccess is a very ancient configuration file that controls the Web Server running your website , and is one of the most powerful configuration files you will ever come across .
.has the ability to control access / settings for the HyperText Transfer Protocol ( ) using Password Protection , 301 Redirects , rewrites , and much much more .
This is because this configuration file was coded in the earliest days of the web ( HTTP ) , for one of the first Web Servers ever !
Eventually these Web Servers ( configured with htaccess ) became known as the World Wide Web , and eventually grew into the Internet we use today .
This is not an introduction to htaccess .
This is a guide for using htaccess to the fullest .
Originally ( 2003 ) this guide was known in certain hacker circles and hidden corners of the net as an ultimate htaccess due to the powerful htaccess tricks and tips to bypass security on a webhost , and also because many of the htaccess examples were pretty impressive back then in that group .
The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) was initiated at the CERN in Geneve ( Switzerland ) , where it emerged ( together with the HTML presentation language ) from the need to exchange scientific information on a computer network in a simple manner .
The first public HTTP implementation only allowed for plain text information , and almost instantaneously became a replacement of the GOPHER service .
One of the first text - based browsers was LYNX which still exists today ; a graphical HTTP client appeared very quickly with the name NCSA Mosaic .
Mosaic was a popular browser back in 1994 .
Soon the need for a more rich multimedia experience was born , and the markup language provided support for a growing multitude of media types .
I discovered these tips and tricks mostly while working as a network security penetration specialist hired to find security holes in web hosting environments .
Shared hosting is the most common and cheapest form of web - hosting where multiple customers are placed on a single machine and " share " the resources ( CPU / RAM / SPACE ) .
The machines are configured to basically ONLY do HTTP and FTP .
No shells or any interactive logins , no ssh , just FTP access .
That is when I started examining htaccess files in great detail and learned about the incredible untapped power of htaccess .
For 99 % of the worlds best Apache admins , they do n't use .htaccess much , if AT ALL .
It 's much easier , safer , and faster to configure Apache using the httpd .conf file instead .
However , this file is almost never readable on shared - hosts , and I 've never seen it writable .
So the only avenue left for those on shared - hosting was and is the .htaccess file , and holy freaking fiber - optics .. it 's almost as powerful as httpd .conf itself !
Most all .htaccess code works in the httpd.conf file , but not all httpd .conf code works in .htaccess files , around 50 % .
So all the best Apache admins and programmers never used .htaccess files .
There was no incentive for those with access to httpd .
conf to use htaccess , and the gap grew .
It 's common to see " computer gurus " on forums and mailing lists rail against all uses and users of .htaccess files , smugly announcing the well known problems with .htaccess files compared with httpd.conf - I wonder if these " gurus " know the history of the htaccess file , like it's use in the earliest versions of the HTTP Server - NCSA 's HTTPd , which BTW , became known as Apache HTTP .
So you could easily say that htaccess files predates Apache itself .
Once I discovered what .htaccess files could do towards helping me enumerate and exploit security vulnerabilities even on big shared - hosts I focused all my research into .htaccess files , meaning I was reading the venerable Apache HTTP Source code 24/7 !
I compiled every released version of the Apache Web Server , ever , even NCSA's , and focused on enumerating the most powerful htaccess directives .
Good times !
Because my focus was on protocol / file / network vulnerabilites instead of web dev I built up a nice toolbox of htaccess tricks to do unusual things .
When I switched over to webdev in 2005 I started using htaccess for websites , not research .
I documented most of my favorites and rewrote the htaccess guide for webdevelopers .
After some great encouragement on various forums and nets I decided to start a blog to share my work with everyone , AskApache.com was registered , I published my guide , and it was quickly plagiarized and scraped all over the net .
Information is freedom , and freedom is information , so this blog has the least restrictive copyright for you .
Feel free to modify , copy , republish , sell , or use anything on this site ;) Specifically , is the default file name of a special configuration file that provides a number of directives ( commands ) for controlling and configuring the Apache Web Server , and also to control and configure modules that can be built into the Apache installation , or included at run-time like mod_rewrite ( for htaccess rewrite ) , mod_alias ( for htaccess redirects ) , and mod_ssl ( for controlling SSL connections ) .
allows for decentralized management of Web Server configurations which makes life very easy for web hosting companies and especially their savvy consumers .
They set up and run " server farms " where many hundreds and thousands of web hosting customers are all put on the same Apache Server .
This type of hosting is called " virtual hosting " and without .htaccess files would mean that every customer must use the same exact settings as everyone else on their segment .
So that is why any half - decent web host allows / enables ( DreamHost , Powweb , MediaTemple , GoDaddy ) .htaccess files , though few people are aware of it .
Let 's just say that if I was a customer on your server - farm , and .htaccess files were enabled , my websites would be a LOT faster than yours , as these configuration files allow you to fully take advantage of and utilize the resources allotted to you by your host .
If even 1/10 of the sites on a server - farm took advantage of what they are paying for , the providers would go out of business .
Htaccess files use the default filename " " but any unix - style file name can be specified from the main server config using thedirective .
The file is n't , its literally just namedUnlike the main server configuration files like httpd .conf therefore changes in these files take immediate effect .
Apache searches all directories and subdirectories that are htaccess - enabled for an .htaccess file which results in performance loss due to file accesses .
I 've never noticed a performance loss but OTOH , I know how to use them .
If you do have access to your main server configuration file , you should of course use that instead , and lucky for you ALL the .htaccess tricks and examples can be used there as well ( just not vice versa ) .
Htaccess files follow the same syntax as the main Apache configuration files , for powerusers here 's an apache.vim for VI .
The one main difference is theof the directive , which means whether or not that directive is ALLOWED to be used inside of an .htaccess file .
Htaccess files are incredibly powerful , and can also be very dangerous as some directives allowed in the main configuration files would allow users / customers to completely bypass security / bandwidth - limits / resource - limits / file - permissions , etc . .
About 1/4 of all Apache directives cannot be used inside an .htaccess file ( also known as a per- directory context config ) .
The Apache Developers are well - regarded throughout the world as being among some of the best programmers , ever .
To enable a disallowed directive inside a .htaccess file would require modifying the source code and re-compiling the server ( which they allow and encourage if you are the owner / admin ) . , but I personally downloaded each major / beta release of the Apache HTTPD source code from version 1.3.0 to version 2.2.10 (! ) , then I .
This allowed me to findfor each particular version , which has never been done before , or since .
I think that is so cool ..is basically a command that is specific to a module or builtin to the core that performs a specific task or sets a specific setting for how Apache serves your WebSite .
Directives placed in Htaccess files .
Here 's the 3 top links ( official Apache Docs ) you will repeatedly use , bookmark / print / save them .
Now lets take a look at some htaccess examples to get a feel for the syntax and some general ideas at the capabilities .
Some of the best examples for .htaccess files are included with Apache for main server config files , so lets take a quick look at a couple of them on our way down to the actual .htaccess examples further down the page ( this site has thousands , take your time ) .
The basic syntax is :

Examples of protecting your files and securing with password protection .
Here are some specific htaccess examples taken mostly from my WordPress Password Protection plugin , which does alot more than password protection as you will see from the following mod_rewrite examples .

In the case where all URIs should be sent to the same place ( including potentially requests for static content ) the method to use depends on the type of the handler .
For php scripts , use :
For other handlers such as php scripts , use :
If the existing files you wish to have handled by your script have a common set of file extensions distinct from that of the hander , you can bypass mod_rewrite and use instead mod_actions .
Let 's say you want all .html and .tpl files to be dealt with by your script :
Keep the existing query string using the Query String Append flag , but add var=val to the end .
Rewrite URLs like http://askapache.com/url1?var=val to http://askapache.com/url2?var=val but do n't rewrite if val is n't present .
Change any single instance of val in the query string to other_val when accessing / path .
Note that % 1 and % 2 are back - references to the matched part of the regular expression in the previous RewriteCond .
Undocumented techniques and methods will allow you to utilize mod_rewrite at an " expert level " by showing you how to unlock its secrets
If you have a php.cgi or php.ini file in your / cgi - bin / directory or other pub directory , try requesting them from your web browser .
If your php.ini shows up or worse you are able to execute your php cgi , you 'll need to secure it ASAP .
This shows several ways to secure these files , and other interpreters like perl , fastCGI , bash , csh , etc.for you !
Check out the Cookie Manipulation and environment variable usage with mod_rewrite !
I also included a couple Mod_Security .htaccess examples .
Want to block a bad robot or web scraper using .htaccess files ?
Here are 2 methods that illustrate blocking 436 various user - agents .
You can block them using either SetEnvIf methods , or by using Rewrite Blocks .
By using some cool .htaccess tricks we can control PHP to be run as a cgi or a module .
If php is run as a cgi then we need to compile it ourselves or use .htaccess to force php to use a local php.ini file .
If it is running as a module then we can use various directives supplied by that modules in .htaccess
This is freaking sweet if you use SSL I promise you !
Basically instead of having to check for HTTPS using afor every redirect that can be either HTTP or HTTPS , I set an environment variable once with the value " http " or " https " if HTTP or HTTPS is being used for that request , and use that env variable in the RewriteRule chmod .htpasswd files 640 , chmod .htaccess 644 , php files 600 , and chmod files that you really dont want people to see as 400 .
( NEVER chmod 777 , try 766 ) The order of merging is :

Some very detailed and helpful .htaccess articles , such as the " .htaccess - gzip and cache your site for faster loading and bandwidth saving . "
Stupid .htaccess tricks is probably thefor many of the best .htaccess solutions , including many from this page .
Unlike me they are fantastic writers , even for technical stuff they are very readable , so its a good blog to kick back on and read .
They also have a fantastic article detailing how to block / deny specific requests using mod_rewrite .
Mostly a site for ... blog security ( which is really any web - app security ) this blog has a few really impressive articles full of solid information for Hardening WordPress with .htaccess among more advanced topics that can be challenging but effective .
This is a good site to subscribe to their feed , they publish plugin exploits and wordpress core vulnerabilities quite a bit .

The name of the command
The function which handles it a ( void *) pointer , which is passed in the cmd_parms structure to the command handler --- this is useful in case many similar commands are handled by the same function .
A bit mask indicating where the command may appear .
There are mask bits corresponding to each AllowOverride option , and an additional mask bit , RSRC_CONF , indicating that the command may appear in the server 's own config files , but not in any .htaccess file .
A flag indicating how many arguments the command handler wants pre-parsed , and how they should be passed in .
TAKE2 indicates two pre-parsed arguments .
Other options are TAKE1 , which indicates one pre-parsed argument , FLAG , which indicates that the argument should be On or Off , and is passed in as a boolean flag , RAW_ARGS , which causes the server to give the command the raw , unparsed arguments ( everything but the command name itself ) .
There is also ITERATE , which means that the handler looks the same as TAKE1 , but that if multiple arguments are present , it should be called multiple times , and finally ITERATE2 , which indicates that the command handler looks like a TAKE2 , but if more arguments are present , then it should be called multiple times , holding the first argument constant .
Finally , we have a string which describes the arguments that should be present .
If the arguments in the actual config file are not as required , this string will be used to help give a more specific error message .
( You can safely leave this NULL ) .

Hundreds of writers have been prosecuted in Turkey for " insulting Turkishness " , but Sarah Rainsford discovers that there are still some people willing to publish controversial books .
It is a very difficult time to be a writer in Turkey .
Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel prize for literature in 2006 Last year the prominent Turkish - Armenian journalist , Hrant Dink , was murdered .
This year , an ultra-nationalist gang allegedly had the Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk on its hit list .
Both men had been prosecuted for " insulting Turkishness " .
Today , many writers once known for their forthright views have fallen silent .
But one man is still putting himself on the line in a fight for free speech .
I found Ragip Zarakolu in one of the dimly - lit corridors of the Sultanahmet courthouse waiting to be called for his latest trial .
A small man with grey curls and crinkled kindly eyes , Mr Zarakolu is a publisher on a mission to shatter every taboo in Turkey .
Ragip Zarakolu : Time to confront the past
As a result , he once admitted to me with characteristic chuckle he is now the most prosecuted publisher in the country .
This time he is also accused of " insulting Turkishness " under article 301 of the penal code .
The case was opened after he published the work of a British writer .
It was the story of the writer 's family in 1915 , when hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Armenians were deported as traitors during World War I .
Turkey 's taboos Ragip Zarakolu is one of very few Turks to challenge the official line , but it comes at a cost .
Shortly before his trial I visited his office just across the tram lines from Grand Bazaar .
In a basement beneath McDonalds I discovered an Aladdin 's cave of Turkey 's taboos .
Crammed on to shelves and piled high on tables and on the floor were books on every controversial topic in Turkey , and an American ambassador 's memoir of the Armenian massacres side by side with books on Kurdish nationalism .
" My late wife and I began by publishing the history of the Turkish Communist Party .
That was the first taboo , " Ragip Zarakolu explained , a pretty unlikely looking subversive in his woollen overcoat and brown moccasins .
The book came out in 1982 , in the wake of a military coup .
It was banned and later burned by the generals as a threat to social order and Ragip 's wife was brought to trial .
A decade later the pair shifted focus to the plight of Turkey 's Kurds .
It was the height of the separatist insurgency and the mainly Kurdish south - east was under martial law .
Undaunted by yet another court case , they then published texts about the fate of the Ottoman Armenians .
" We decided it was time to confront our past and discuss it , " Ragip explained .
But in 1993 that approach was not welcome .
Ragip 's wife was sentenced to two years in jail - under anti-terror legislation - for publishing the work of a French scholar about the Armenian massacres .
EU accession efforts
Turkey has changed enormously since then , working towards membership of the European Union .
But the trials of writers and publishers continue .
Ironically , the book Mr Zarakolu is currently being prosecuted for is among his least controversial .
It tells how a Turkish official protected the author 's Armenian grandmother in 1915 - a Turkish Oskar Schindler .
Our society has traumas that we are avoiding
Ragip Zarakolu
But the insult charge was brought as nationalist feeling began to soar here , partly linked to Turkey 's EU accession efforts .
The Justice Ministry recently revealed that 1,700 people were tried under Article 301 in 2006 alone .
The best - known cases have all involved comments on the Armenian massacres .
" If you believe you are great , clean , and honest it is hard to face something like 1915 , " Ragip Zarakolu explained .
" Our society has traumas that we are avoiding .
" Really , we should see a therapist ! "
Fuelling discussion
What Turkey has instead is Ragip Zarakolu relentlessly publishing books that delve into the darkest chapters of the past .
And , despite the nationalist backlash , he is sure he is making a difference .
His books are read mainly by students and academics , but they have helped fuel a cautious discussion on topics that were once utterly off - limits .
And now the law may be changing too , to protect people 's freedom to do just that .
The charges against Istanbul - based Orhan Pamuk were dropped Under immense pressure from the EU , the Turkish government has proposed softening Article 301 on " insulting Turkishness " .
Nationalist politicians are outraged , but for Ragip Zarakolu it was a well - timed move .
His trial was postponed until parliament decides whether the crime he is accused of should actually exist .
As we filed out of the courthouse into the sunshine , the veteran publisher was pleased .
But he believes even a " reformed " Article 301 is dangerous , so his fight goes on .
" My wife went to prison for publishing the first book here on the Armenian genocide .
Now I plan to print that book again and to include the notes from her trial , " Ragip Zarakolu confided .
" Fifteen years later we 'll see what happens ! " he said .
Then , chuckling as usual , he wandered away from the court and down the street .

One particular pirate prop was a must for David Waterman as he organised a themed party for his daughter 's birthday .
With cutlass - wielding youngsters running around in eye patches , he thought , a Jolly Roger flag would add the perfect finishing touch - and he duly hung the Skull and Crossbones from the side of the family home .
Unfortunately the local council did n't see the jolly side and Mr Waterman has been threatened with prosecution unless he removes the 5ft by 3ft banner .

All aboard : Firefighter David Waterman with children Ewan and Madeleine
Last night , the fireman and former soldier hit out at the " disgraceful " waste of taxpayers ' money .
While his daughter Madeleine 's eighth birthday party went off successfully , he is so angry at the council 's pettiness that he has decided to leave the flag in place on a point of principle and pay the £ 95 administration fee to apply for ' advertising consent ' which would enable him to continue flying it outside his home in Ashtead , Surrey .
A senior council officer has warned him it is unlikely to be granted .
Father - of - four Mr Waterman , who works at Battersea fire station in South London , said : " I find it ridiculous that the council are fighting me over this .
" It 's a £ 5 flag , not hurting anyone , and they 're probably spending hundreds of pounds of our cash getting me to take it down .
That could be spent on improving the local area . "
The problems started when the council received a complaint about the flag from a neighbour on April 16 .

Causing a flap : Mr Waterman is paying £ 95 to apply for advertising consent for the flag after a neighbour complained
Mr Waterman , 41 , was sent a letter on April 21 informing him he had seven days to remove it .
He was told that the flying of flags was controlled by the Town and Country ( Control of Advertisements ) Regulations 1992 .
These stipulate that only 'a national flag of any country , the flag of the European Union , the Commonwealth , the United Nations , English County flags and saints ' flags associated with a particular county ' can be flown .
The regulations also set out commercial flags that are normally allowed , such as those used by housebuilders and car showrooms .
But they state that specific permission has to be granted to fly any other type of flag - such as a Jolly Roger .
Mr Waterman , a former trooper with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , said he believed the complaints made about the flag were linked to a dispute about his children - playing outside .
" My kids are well - behaved but there 's one set of neighbours who would rather they sat inside playing computer games than run around on the lawn , " he said .
" They do n't like my kids being outside but they can't complain to anyone about it so they 've picked on the flag .
" I can't believe the council is backing them .
This is a point of principle and I 'm standing firm . "
A spokesman for Mole Valley District Council said it had not yet launched legal proceedings against Mr Waterman and would consider his application .
" We received a complaint about the flag flying outside Mr Waterman 's house and are duty - bound to investigate complaints and enforce Government regulations , " he added .
The term Jolly Roger is used to describe various flags flown to identify a ship 's crew as pirates .
The Skull and Crossbones is the most famous .
WOULD you take an offer if you knew that by refusing it you ’d get a better one ?
Tehran ’s answer to the latest “ generous package ” offered to end its uranium - enrichment program is an emphatic “ No . ”
The offer comes from the Six Powers , the UN Security Council ’s five permanent members plus Germany ; it was shaped in London in days of hard bargaining between the United States and the European Union on one side and Russia and China on the other .
Yet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is already ignoring three Security Council resolutions and swallowing the bitter medicine of sanctions .
And he has reason to believe that time is on his side .
He knows America will have a new president in nine months ; the “ mad Bush ” will be gone .
Sen .
Barack Obama has said he ’d invite Ahmadinejad for unconditional talks , ignoring UN resolutions that call on Tehran to stop uranium enrichment .
So why pay now what one may not have to pay tomorrow ?
Even if Sen. John McCain wins the White House , he ’d need time before he has his team in place and is capable of taking any significant action against Iran .
Then , too , Ahmadinejad himself must seek reelection next year – and it wo n’t be easy .
Iran ’s economy is suffering double - digit inflation , soaring unemployment and deepening structural fissures .
“ Supreme Guide ” Ali Khamenei and the commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may well decide to blame it all on Ahmadinejad and ditch him in favor of another Guard officer .
Ahmadinejad ’s main hope for winning a second term lies in perpetuating the fiction that he ’s fighting to preserve Iran ’s independence against predatory powers bent on dictating to weaker nations .
He ’d be courting political suicide if he backed down now .
He has other reason to play for time .
Russia has a new president , with Vladimir Putin becoming prime minister .
The new arrangement in Moscow needs time to settle and be tested .
The last thing the Putin - Medvedev tandem wants is a hot crisis over Iran .
With the summer Olympics in Beijing , the Chinese do n’t want anything to distract attention from their big show , least of all another war in the Mideast , which supplies 70 percent of their oil .
Britain is heading for a general election in ’09 , which Labor now looks likely to lose .
The German coalition is showing fissures that could force an election next year .
And this new “ package ” is far more generous than anything that his predecessor as president , Mullah Muhammad Khatami , could have imagined .
In 2003 , Khatami agreed to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a package of gifts .
He kept his end of the bargain for two years but received nothing .
As soon as Ahmadinejad resumed enrichment , the Six Powers rushed to him with gifts .
Each time he ’s hardened his position , he ’s gotten an even better offer .
So why say yes now when he knows that in a year ’s time , hopefully on the eve of his election campaign , he might get an even better offer ?
The Six Powers are clearly unable to agree on a diagnosis of the problem .
The British wanted the London statement to refer to Iran ’s nuclear program as “ a threat China refused , insisting the dispute was “ a technical one . ”
In other words , while the British and Americans think Ahmadinejad wants the atomic bomb for mischief , the Chinese and , presumably , the Russians see the whole thing as no more worrying than a case of bad plumbing .
This failure to agree produced the “ Iranian nuclear crisis ” in the first place , and it will prevent its resolution .
Ahmadinejad ’s best bet is to continue his prevarications .
If Iran is no threat to anyone , where ’s the problem ?
Uranium enrichment is perfectly legal , something that the Six Powers , among others , have been doing for decades .
If , on the other hand , Iran is a threat , one should ask why before trying to do anything about it .
This is precisely the debate , however , that the Six Powers have n’t succeeded in holding among themselves .

Advertisement Police in Manchester have released CCTV images showing up to 200 football fans chasing officers and attacking one of them after the Uefa Cup final .
The footage shows Rangers supporters tripping up the Greater Manchester Police officer and jumping on him after the match with Zenit St Petersburg .
Assistant Chief Constable Justine Curran described the fans as being " like a pack of baying wolves " .
Eleven supporters have been charged with criminal offences .
The charges include public order offences , assault and throwing a missile .
A further 11 Rangers fans who were arrested have been bailed pending further inquiries .
Twelve Rangers fans arrested were cautioned , and seven men , including one Zenit St Petersburg fan , were released without charge .
Scottish Labour , Tories and Lib Dems have called for an inquiry .
Trouble flared in Piccadilly Gardens ( Pic : Jeevandra Sivarajah ) Scottish Conservative deputy leader Murdo Fraser initially said the decision to deploy riot police was an " over - reaction " which may have inflamed the situation .
But he was later forced to temper his comments after viewing the CCTV footage .
Ambulance crews dealt with 52 cases of assault after the match , in which Rangers were beaten 2 - 0 by Zenit St Petersburg .
Assistant Chief Constable Curran said violent clashes were sparked when police officers came under a " severe level of attack " .
Riot police were deployed after a city centre big screen failed and several arrests were made , including six men who were held after a Russian fan was stabbed inside the City of Manchester stadium .
The police officer whose attack was captured on CCTV footage suffered bad bruising to his arms and body and hurt his elbow .
Screen inquiry Greater Manchester Police said a total of 15 officers suffered minor injuries and a police dog cut its paw after treading on broken glass .
Despite the scenes , council leader Sir Richard Leese said the city would not be put off hosting future international sporting events .
Sir Richard said it was one of the biggest movements of people ever seen for such an event , and paid tribute to the authorities for the handling of the crowds .
He also said there would be an inquiry into the failure of the screen in Piccadilly Gardens .
The company behind the five screens erected in the city centre , Lightmedia Display , said the failure was due to a technical signalling problem .
Police used dogs during the clashes
The city council said next week 's Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea , in Moscow , would not now be shown on big screens in Manchester .
Uefa said Manchester did a " fantastic job " in staging the final despite the trouble .
Communications director William Gaillard said : " Both the municipal government and Manchester police have done a fantastic job given they were faced with well over 100,000 fans coming from Scotland .
" I can't believe that any other city would have done anything better . "
The general secretary of the Rangers ' Supporters Association , John MacMillan , said he was disappointed with the behaviour of some fans .
He added : " There is no excuse for it to be honest .
From what I saw before the game there was no need for attacking paramedics and the police , it is indefensible . "
But Rangers Football Club said many of those causing trouble had no history of following the team .
Rangers chief executive Martin Bain said : " Those scenes obviously are dreadful and I 've seen them myself and we have been informed ... that those scenes were caused by supporters that do n't normally attach themselves to our support .
" We 're extremely disappointed and we 'll do everything we possibly can to help police find out who those perpetrators are . "
Rangers security chief Kenny Scott said the club would take " appropriate action " against those responsible .

( CNN ) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has warned against outside influences in next month 's run-off election , likening one American diplomat to a " prostitute " and threatening to oust another from his country .
Robert Mugabe tries to stir voters with a blistering speech criticizing the U.S. and Britain .
" Zimbabwe cannot be British , it cannot be American .
Yes , it is African , " said Mugabe , whose speech Sunday was quoted Monday in The Herald , the state - run newspaper .
" You saw the joy that the British had , that the Americans had , and saw them here through their representatives celebrating and acting as if we Zimbabwe are either an extension of Britain or ... America .
You saw that little American girl [ U. S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer ] trotting around the globe like a prostitute ... "
Mugabe went on to say that U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee would be expelled from the country if he " persisted in meddling in Zimbabwe 's electoral process , " the newspaper reported .
The fallout from Zimbabwe 's stalled election has brought international criticism , with Frazer taking the most emphatic stance .
In April , Frazer accused Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades , of " trying to steal the election " and " intimidating the population and election officials as well . "
The first election was March 29 .
An announcement of the winner of the presidential election was delayed for weeks as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed he had won .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission , after a long delay , ruled that neither candidate had won the required majority of votes , and scheduled a runoff election for June 27 .
Since the March balloting , there have been numerous reports from Tsvangirai 's party and church groups about kidnappings , torture and other violence , including the deaths of opposition party members .
They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party .
At about the same time Sunday that Mugabe was giving his campaign speech , Tsvangirai was speaking at a funeral .
Tsvangirai spoke harshly as he stood near the casket of a man he claimed was killed by Mugabe 's supporters .
Watch Tsvangirai address mourners »
" This is a clear testimony of the callousness of this regime , " said Tsvangirai to a funeral procession of hundreds gathered outside the capital city of Harare .
" They can kill us .
They can maim us .
But we are going on the 27th of June , our hearts dripping with blood , to vote him out of office . "
Mugabe denies his supporters were responsible for election - related violence .

Want to see a 3D map that is OS independent today ?
Swedish search and mapping site hitta.se has just added an embedded 3D map of Stockholm to its web offering — one that only requires Java and works with Mac , Linux and Windows browsers .
It is remarkably accurate and looks like this :
While Hitta.se has the working example , the 3DMaps EX software powering it is by Agency9 , which in turn uses technology by C3 Technologies , a subsidiary of Saab , the Scandinavian military technology giant .
The technology is different to what Google and Microsoft are pursuing .
Best to let the C3 site explain :
The technology is based on high - resolution aerial photography with carefully calibrated cameras .
For every picture , the camera ’s position and angle are calculated with extremely high precision , using a very advanced navigation system .
This is what enables us to give each pixel its geographical position with decimetre accuracy .
Then , using stereovision technology , we combine two sequential pictures to measure the area ’s height profile .
The result is an aerial photograph with each pixel positioned in three dimensions .
Over an entire city , thousands of such photos are combined into one coherent 3D model — through an automated process in our unique 3D - processor .
Thanks to all this , there is no one today who can take pictures with the same precision and speed as we can .
One example is when we filmed all of Stockholm in October 2007 and created a realistic , yet zoomable and turnable , 3D model of the city in just 3 days .
Hitta.se ’s FAQ is especially keen to explain how it is different from Google Earth .
Translating and abridging severely now :
Google Earth ’s 3D city models are built by traditional means .
Because the used images are flat , Google Earth often misses out on displaying heights for buildings and trees .
Hitta.se ’s technology is completely automated .
Any object larger than a VW bus is included in 3D in the final image .
Google Earth has a limited numbers of buildings in each city .
Hitta.se will show all the buildings in a city automatically .
Do go explore Stockholm for a while .
My own take is that this technology is great for suburbs and wooded areas , where trees do make a difference .
As for Hitta.se ’s 3D buildings , they sometimes seem suffer from slightly misplaced textures , which gives them that Daliesque molten clock look .
Still , this looks very scalable , though it is not clear how fast the Java engine is compared to Google ’s just released browser plugin .
I still prefer the details of Google ’s and Microsoft ’s “ traditional ” 3D models over 3 C ’s output , but I definitely prefer 3 C ’s output over a raw height mesh ( DEM ) model .

Have you ever looked up in the sky and thought “ Hey !
That cloud looks just like the McDonald ’s arches ” .
If you have , there ’s a good chance that cloud may have actually been engineered to look that way by a special effects company called SnowMasters .
They ’ve developed something they call Flogos , which are basically flying custom logos .
Made from a proprietary soap based foam , the Flogos are filled with gases such as helium rather than air .
As we all know , helium is lighter than air , so once the Flogo comes out of the machine , they just float away .
Depending on the soap mixture , the Flogos can last for just a few minutes or up to an hour .
They can also travel 20 - 30 miles and fly as high as 20,000 feet , though the weather conditions ( particularly wind speed ) play an important factor in how far they go .
The standard Flogos range in size from 24 inches to 48 inches , though the company is working on an even more impressive 6 foot generator .
The Flogo machines can produce a flying logo every 15 seconds , and the soap based material is 100 % environmentally safe .

Stigma can be a powerful force in changing behavior .
Just ask smokers , whose once accepted habit is now so marginalized that the prevalence of smoking has dropped to about 19 percent of U.S. adults from nearly 24 percent just a decade ago .
A lot of factors figured into the decline since smoking 's mid-20th - century peak , but the sense that smoking is disgusting as well as unhealthful and socially costly has certainly contributed to many people 's decision to quit .
Now that smokers have been taken care of , the obese are the new scapegoats for a lot of our ills .
Last week , a letter published in the Lancet noted that the obese contribute more than their thinner compatriots to food scarcity and global warming , given that they eat more and require more transportation energy to move themselves around .
While the authors ' intent was probably not to make the obese feel worse , the media translations of the study in my quick Google search turned up headlines such as " Fat People Cause Global Warming , Higher Food Prices " and " Scientists Blame Fat People for Global Warming . "
You might think that the obese could use some blame .
As obesity increasingly becomes the norm , maybe society has grown too accepting .
Perhaps what is lacking is the same thing that helped smokers lose their butts : a healthy dose of social stigma .
If only there were more shame in being fat , maybe more people would be motivated to lose weight .
But in fact , researchers say , stigma does very little to motivate overweight or obese people to change .
Why , first , are we increasingly intolerant of the obese even as more of us are joining their ranks ?
" At the same time that weight has gone up , we 've had an increased emphasis on the thin ideal in society , " says Janet Latner , a psychologist who studies stigma at the University of Hawaii — Manoa in Honolulu .
( Think Us Weekly 's celebrating Mariah Carey 's recent weight loss . )
People also see family and friends lose weight and believe that body weight is completely under our control .
( As my colleague Sarah Baldauf has reported , that 's not 100 percent true . )
" In one sense , people make the final decisions over what goes in their mouths , " says Kelly Brownell , director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University .
But there are plenty of social and environmental determinants , too , he says .
Immigrants to the United States tend to gain weight , for example , while people who move out of the country tend to lose it .
Even rats will get overweight when given unlimited access to processed junk food , which shows the potential influence of one 's surroundings .
" If you change the environment in negative ways , you get obesity , " Brownell says .
" The solution is n't to blame people who are responding in predictable ways to the environment . "
Brownell authored a 2006 study showing that when overweight people feel stigmatized because of their weight , they respond by eating more and giving up on diets .
" Obese people are under such enormous pressure to lose weight , " he says .
" They understand the health consequences , they see fat jokes on TV , they were teased and ridiculed as kids .
To think that you could add much more to that pressure is wishful thinking . "
The stress may make them turn to food for comfort or , as one researcher hypothesizes , might even contribute to the physiological processes of obesity through , say , stress hormones .
It can also keep people out of the gym , most likely thanks to embarrassment and shame .
A study published this year in the Journal of Health Psychology suggests , at least among the college - aged , that having more experience with weight stigma makes people less motivated to exercise .

Oh , I admit it ; I ’ve fallen hard for Obama .
Perhaps it is his handsome face or eloquent manner of speech , or perhaps it is because he is the first viable candidate ( sorry Kucinich and Nader ) to speak the truth .
First , Obama opposed the gas tax holiday , designed to distract Americans from the bigger picture of our energy usage .
Now , he is blaming the Iraq war for America ’s utter failure as a climate leader .
Shortly after last week ’s primaries , Obama stated :
I think the way we have run this war in Iraq has lessened our ability to move our allies .
It has led us to ignore the critical needs for us to focus on a sound energy policy in this country .
It has left us unable to lead on critical global issues like global warming .
And it has led us to neglect what ultimately is the most important thing to keeping America safe , and that is having an economy that is the envy of the world and that gives us the resources and the power to project ourselves around the world .
I could n’t agree more .
Not only is the Iraq
War being fought over false pretenses , but it has strained the US budget and distracted Americans from the greatest threat to national security : climate change .
Many lives have been lost in Iraq , although Americans have been largely shielded from the realities of this war by the media .
The media will not be able to shield Americans from the increasing effects of climate change .
Of course , Obama is not perfect when it comes to energy policies .
In 2007 , he reintroduced the Coal - to - Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 , which supported research and plant construction in order to convert coal into diesel engine fuel .
This is not the right climate solution to lessen our foreign oil dependency .
Considering that “ Illinois basin coal has more untapped energy potential than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined “ , is Obama supporting liquid coal fuel for political reasons ?
This presidential race is not about race or gender .
This race is about climate change , and which candidate will lead America to become an environmental role model in the world .
As Obama stated in his interview on CNN , “ … if the United States regains its — its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals , that we will continue to set the tone for creating a more peaceful and more prosperous world . ”

Israeli press reports US pledge of war on Iran — is Bush preparing an October Surprise ?
By Bill Van Auken
21 May 2008
An Israeli press report that US President George W. Bush intends to launch a military attack on Iran before he leaves office at the beginning of next year prompted a heated denial from the White House Tuesday .
The article , which appeared in Tuesday ’s Jerusalem Post , cited a report on Israeli Army Radio , quoting Israeli officials who had met with Bush and his delegation during their visit to Israel last week .
“ A senior member of the president ’s entourage said during a closed meeting that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were of the opinion that military action was called for , ” the article quoted an Israel official as saying .
The report cited the US official as stating that “ the hesitancy of Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ” had delayed a decision on military action against Iran .
The recent crisis in Lebanon and the evident ease with which the Iranian - backed Hezbollah movement seized control of Beirut , according to the report , had placed a US attack on the Islamic Republic back on the front burner .
Bush expressed the opinion that “ the disease must be treated , not the symptoms , ” according to the Israeli officials .
The White House denial — issued within hours of the story appearing on the Jerusalem Post ’s web site — was notably harsh in its tone .
“ An article in today ’s Jerusalem Post about the president ’s position on Iran that quotes unnamed sources — quoting unnamed sources — is not worth the paper it ’s written on , ” read the statement .
Later on Tuesday , however , Bush ’s spokesperson Dana Perino was pressed by several reporters , who expressed skepticism in regard to the denial .
“ Do the President and the Vice President feel that an attack is called for — whether someone said that in Israel , or not ? ” asked one .
Dana Perino refused to answer , reiterating the official position that Washington is working to resolve its confrontation with Iran “ diplomatically ” but that it would not take any “ options off the table . ”
In reality , the Jerusalem Post story is hardly the only indication that the Bush administration is preparing for a military attack on Iran .
Ample physical evidence exists in the stepped up US military deployments in the region , with the Navy once again having two aircraft carrier battle groups — the USS Lincoln and the USS Harry S. Truman — within striking distance of Iran .
Meanwhile , the flagship of the 6th Fleet , the USS Mount Whitney , has been deployed off the coast of Lebanon , in what the Navy has described as an “ unscheduled mission . ”
The ship is the Navy ’s most advanced command , control and intelligence vessel , capable of coordinating a major attack over a wide region .
It joined the USS Cole , a missile destroyer , already there .
In Washington , Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , appeared before a Senate committee Tuesday to reiterate the Pentagon ’s unsubstantiated charges that Iran is responsible for violence in Iraq .
The lack of a US military response thus far , he stressed , “ does not signal lack of resolve or capability to defend ourselves against threats . ”
In his speech before the Israeli Knesset last week , Bush placed Iran at the center of his pledge of unconditional support for Israel .
“ America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran ’s nuclear weapons ambitions , ” he said .
“ Permitting the world ’s leading sponsor of terror to possess the world ’s deadliest weapons would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations .
For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . ”
After Bush ’s visit , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the press that Olmert and Bush had agreed on the need for “ tangible action ” to thwart Iran ’s supposed drive to develop a nuclear weapon .
“ We are on the same page .
We both see the threat ....
And we both understand that tangible action is required to prevent the Iranians from moving forward on a nuclear weapon , ” Olmert spokesman Mark Regev told the Israeli daily Ha’aretz .
Referring to diplomatic efforts to exert pressure on Iran , Regev added , “ It is clearly not sufficient , and it ’s clear that additional steps will have to be taken . ”
Even as the US and Israel stepped up the drumbeat about an alleged Iranian nuclear threat , Mohammad El - Baradei , the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) spoke before a World Economic Forum session in Egypt Monday , declaring that the UN nuclear watchdog agency has no evidence that Iran is building a bomb .
Well before the story appeared in the Jerusalem Post , Ha’aretz reported that “ Iran ’s nuclear program has held center stage ” in the talks between Bush and Olmert .
Israeli officials , the paper reported , presented Bush with intelligence data that supposedly contradicted the National Intelligence Estimate produced by US spy agencies last year , which concluded that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
“ Will this be enough to alter the position of the administration on the possibility of a US strike of the nuclear installations in Iran ?
It is not clear , ” the paper reported .
It added , however , that the Israeli government is insisting that Iran is approaching the “ point of no return , ” and immediate action is required .
As for Bush , it commented , the closer he “ comes to the end of his tenure , he is certainly thinking about the legacy of his presidency , beyond the contentious war in Iraq . ”
The suggestion being made is that one way to change the subject from the disastrous legacy embodied in the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the launching of yet another act of military aggression , one which would undoubtedly throw the entire region into chaos .
One clue to the political thinking within the top echelons of the Bush administration came in the form of an audiotape .
The tape was part of the material the Pentagon turned over recently to the New York Times in response to a Freedom of Information
Act request for its article exposing the Defense Department ’s relationship to a group of retired officers who regularly appeared on television news , promoting the administration ’s line on Iraq .
The tape was of a December 2006 luncheon meeting between then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and a group of these “ military analysts ” — referred to by the Pentagon itself as “ message force multipliers . ”
The mood at the meeting was clearly one of dismay and even anger over the results of the 2006 midterm election , in which a wave of popular antiwar sentiment delivered control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats .
Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Delong is heard noting to Rumsfeld that with the new political configuration on Capitol Hill , “ you ’re not going to have a lot of sympathetic ears up there until it [ a terrorist attack ] happens . ”
Rumsfeld agreed , responding : “ We have n’t had an attack in five years .
The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it ’s not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment ...
The correction for that , I suppose , is an attack .
And when that happens , then everyone gets energized for another [ inaudible ] and it ’s a shame we do n’t have the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats ... the lethality , the carnage , that can be imposed on our society is so real and so present and so serious that you ’d think we ’d be able to understand it ... ”
The “ correction ” for the failure of the American people to support the war in Iraq and the global eruption of American militarism under the mantle of the “ war on terrorism ” is , in Rumsfeld ’s view , another “ attack , ” along the lines of September 11 , 2001 .
Clearly , the conception is that another round of “ lethality ” and “ carnage ” would serve to stun the public and create conditions for the administration to impose its political will by extraordinary means .
Certainly , one means of making such an attack all the more likely would be the launching of a military strike against Iran .
The reports from Israel and the military buildup in the region raise an obvious question :
With the approach of the 2008 elections , are elements within the Bush administration preparing an “ October Surprise ” in the form of an unprovoked attack on Iran ?
A United States Supreme Court judge says it is not clear that the American constitution protects people from torture .
Justice Antonin Scalia says the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments .
But he says it would be absurd not to inflict pain on someone when they had key knowledge of an imminent attack .
" Once you acknowledge that we 're into a different game , how close does the threat have to be and how severe can the infliction of pain be ? " he asked .
" I do n't think these are easy questions at all , in either direction , but I certainly know you can't come in smugly and with great self - satisfaction and say , 'oh it 's torture and therefore it 's no good ' , " he said .
" You would not apply that in some real life situations . "

Nepal declared secular republic
Shirish B Pradhan in Kathmandu | May 28 , 2008 23:42 IST
Last Updated : May 29 , 2008 00:36 IST
Nepal on Wednesday scripted a new chapter in its turbulent history as the new Constituent Assembly abolished the 240 - year - old monarchy and declared the country a " secular , federal democratic republic . "
The 601 - member assembly met at the Birendra International Convention Centre on Wednesday evening where a motion was passed to declare the country the world 's newest republic .
After a series of meetings , the Seven Party Alliance agreed to table the motion of republic in the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly , dominated by Maoists .
Out of 601 members of the Constituent Assembly , 572 were present during Wednesday 's meeting .
The motion to declare the country a republic was moved by Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitola on behalf of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala .
The motion was passed by 560 votes in favour while four members opposed it .
The motion said that Nepal will be a secular , federal , democratic republic nation and the king , Gyanendra will be reduced to a common citizen .
The king will lose all the cultural , administrative and political powers .
The king and the royal family members will enjoy the rights that are meant for any common man , the motion said .
It said the May 28 will be celebrated as the Republic Day of the nation every year .
There will be president who will be the head of the state while the prime minister will be the executive head .
The four members who opposed the motion are members of the pro-king Rashtriya Prajatantra Party - Nepal , Constituent Assembly Chairman Kulbahadur Gurung announced after the voting .
The country was declared republic as per Article 159 of the interim Constitution , he said .
The ruling alliance had earlier agreed to give 15 days time to the king to leave the Narayanhiti palace , which will be converted into a museum .
The then king in Nepal , Mahendra had dismissed the elected government in 1960 when B P Koirala , the brother of Prime Minister G P Koirala , was heading it .
The Cabinet is yet to nominate 26 members and three were absent .
Earlier on Wednesday the CA meeting was postponed in the morning as more time was needed for the political parties to arrive at consensus regarding the issue of making separate provision of president .
Besides lawmakers , a large number of diplomats , senior government officials , journalists and civil society members were present at the CA meeting venue .
The political parties have already agreed to create a post of president , armed with the powers of imposing emergency and carrying the title of the Supreme Commander of the Nepal Army , according to Nepali Congress sources .
More than a lakh people were present outside the Constituent Assembly when the motion to declare Nepal a republic was being put to vote .
Besides lawmakers , a large number of diplomats , senior government officials , journalists and civil society members were present at the CA meeting venue .
The political parties have already agreed to create a post of president , armed with the powers of imposing emergency and carrying the title of the Supreme Commander of the Nepal Army , according to Nepali Congress sources .
Koirala , who tabled the motion , said , " Nepal has entered into a new age .
Such a historical occasion comes once in a lifetime of the nation .
The Nepalese people 's 60 - year old dream to write their Constitution by themselves has come true today . "
" Mutual cooperation and trust is powerful than any other weapon , and we need to maintain the same spirit of cooperation , coordination and trust in days to come for prosperity and development of the country , " he said .
Sitola also tabled a separate motion seeking amendment in the Constitution to make separate provision of president as head of the state .
There is also a provision for vice president in the amendment .
The president will be the supreme commander of Nepal Army and will have powers to declare emergency .
Koirala in his address said , now CPN - Maoist being the largest party will now head a national government .
The other key issues including formation of a new government and election of the president will be done in a few days .
The government has declared Thursday and Friday as public holidays to celebrate historic republic declaration .

Anyone who was around in the 80′s will remember these little nasty critters .
I for one , geeky as I am , am glad to see them make a reappearance , even in an advert for a product as dull as this one !
I find it interesting that the characters seem to still be the same puppets from the original movies .
No CGI technology update here .
Could this licensing be a sign of a new Gremlins movie in the works ? …
A POPULAR named culprit in the sub - prime melt down has been the ignorance of borrowers ; people conned into taking loans with low teaser rates and high repayment penalties .
How can we protect such people in the future ?
Perhaps things would have been different if they knew better .
Even before the sub - prime crisis , there had been a frenzy of financial literacy campaigns .
But is financial education really the answer ?
Not so , according to a new paper by law professor Lauren Willis .
She believes promoting financial literacy does more harm than good .
She highlights several reasons why even an educated consumer might make a bad choice .
Actually , educated consumers may fare worse because they suffer from over confidence or take a false sense of security in their limited knowledge .
According to Ms Willis promoting financial literacy actually harms consumers because it also absolves predatory lenders and the like of responsibility .
They can claim their prey knew better .
Consumers generally do not serve as their own doctors and lawyers , and for reasons of efficient division of labor alone , generally should not serve as their own financial experts .
Even the most effective financial education will not give the average person the ability to run their own successful hedge fund .
Ms Willis seems to view being financial literate as a binary state .
Either people have a thorough knowledge of markets and financial products or are completely ignorant .
She uses the analogy of people being their own doctors .
It would be silly to have lay people rely on themselves for medical advice .
But we do benefit from a basic knowledge of how human bodies function .
It allows us to maintain a healthy lifestyle and effectively communicate with our doctor .
Ms Willis may underestimate how much many people do know .
Olivia Mitchell and Annamaria Lusardi found many people do not even have the most basic financial knowledge .
Most people do not know the difference between debt and equity , yet are responsible for saving and investing for their retirement .
We have a population of people responsible for their financial future and ill - equipped to do so .
Ms Willis does raise some good points .
We can not expect everyone to acquire the knowledge necessary to make complex financial decisions .
But , she underestimates the value of teaching people the basics .
The average borrower might not understand all the terms of their mortgage , but they might know the right questions to ask rather than feeling over - whelmed and completely hopeless .
Relying on a third party may help , but its not realistic .
Education can not replace qualified and unbiased advice , but most people do not have access to this .
The best solution is giving people some knowledge and presenting them with choices they can understand .
Empowering individuals to control their financial future can have many benefits , but they need to be prepared .
Like any of the 796 superdelegates in this highly - charged presidential election cycle , Tom Ryan says he 's taking his responsibility of choosing a Democratic nominee for president very seriously .
Meet Tom Ryan , the fake superdelegate .
Image courtesy of Howard ThomasSo seriously that the putative candidate for mayor of Scranton , Pennsylvania , has posted several YouTube videos describing what it 's like to be a superdelegate .
" Many of you do n't know what it 's like to be in my shoes , " Ryan agonized in an April 17 video shot at what looks like his kitchen table .
" If Hillary wins Pennsylvania , do I go with the will of the people of the state and support Hillary ?
Or do I go with the will of the people of the nation and support Obama ?
This is why I 'm undecided . "
Ryan asked his viewers to help him to make the decision , and thousands responded , while the site 's address was passed from one political website to the next .
There was only one problem : Tom Ryan does n't exist .
He 's a character played by actor Ron Rogell who was hired in January 2007 to star in an online sitcom called The Party .
The tremendous response that the fake superdelegate character received illustrates how quickly grassroots supporters in this heated political climate can pick up and transmit information regardless of its accuracy , in what has up until recently been a closely - fought race where every delegate counts .
" We assumed that people online and in the blog communities would watch the videos and realize that we were doing thinly - veiled satire , but that 's not what happened , " says Howard Thomas , a 27 - year - old Democratic political consultant in Scranton , Pennsylvania , and the show 's creator and executive producer .
In order to win the party 's nomination for president , the Democratic candidates must win 2,025 delegates .
There are 796 superdelegates , none of whom have to declare their support for a candidate until the
Democratic National Convention in August .
Nor are they obligated to support any candidate in line with any constituency , unlike the pledged delegates who are .
Though he has since pulled ahead , and the Democratic race is largely seen as over , Barack Obama was still behind in the superdelegate count at the time Thomas released the video on YouTube .
The official comment sections on Clinton 's and Obama 's campaign sites are littered with messages urging peers to support their candidate in a web poll featured on the fake Tom Ryan 's site .
Server logs that Thomas showed Threat Level show that traffic came in droves through other online political forums supporting Clinton , and from the leading liberal weblog DailyKos , and from
Facebook messages .
By the end of the week , Ryan 's site recorded more than 20,000 hits .
The Vote Tom Ryan site is a trial balloon for a project that Thomas launched early in 2007 .
" I 'm primarily a writer , and I just wanted to see how far we could take this idea , and it turns out that we could take it pretty far , "
says Thomas .
" Whereas West Wing ( and all other political shows ) are national and idealistic , I 'd wanted to do a show that was local and corrupt , " he explains , saying that he wants to tell a story that focuses on the grittier aspects of politics .
" There 's never been a really gritty , edgy show about local politics in the vein of the Sopranos or Rescue Me . "
Thomas says that he 's hired 15 actors and he has two directors .
The plan is to release another superdelegate - related video sometime next week , and then to start releasing the first of a full 13 episodes starting just before the Democratic National Convention in August .
" It has to be said – this project is not a hit job on the Democrats , "
Thomas says .
" The Democrats in the story are just the lesser of two evils . "
Thomas says that he wants to make the point because his career up until now has been in politics .
He worked for then presidential candidate
Howard Dean in 2004 as a field organizer in New Hampshire , and for senator John Kerry 's presidential campaign in 2004 in Pennsylvania .
And he says that he has n't had any complaints from the DNC , or the Clinton or Obama campaigns .
" I think they realize that we were n't trying to destroy the election , "
he says .
" If this project does n't work out ,
I 'm going to need to be employed somewhere – there was no harm intended . "

Recently I discussed my own take on middle - class piracy .
To recap , I ’m talking about pirates who can easily turn into legitimate customers if the goods they steal are made more convenient to buy than to download illegally .
They are n’t poor , so they can afford it – they just prefer whatever ’s easiest .
And everything I discuss here is from my friend ’s perspective .
My friend is a pirate .
He ’s really a good guy , but a pirate .
The software industry generally has some of the best and some of the worst anti-piracy measures available .
It stands to reason , because software has been plagued by piracy pretty much since it began – anything that ’s representing digitally can be copied with no loss , unlike things like cassette tapes or VHS movies .
So the industry has been scrambling since I was a kid ( waaaaaay back in the 80s ) to stop piracy .
I only know what my friend ( the pirate ) can remember , so I will not cover every piracy - prevention method here .
Mainly the ones that tended to be common on games .
Disk errors
Initially there were things like intentionally putting errors on floppy disks so a direct copy would n’t work , but of course the pirates got smart and came up with ways to copy the errors as well as the data .
End result :
Legitimate users with flaky drives could lose out on a product they paid for .
Pirates did n’t have this problem .
Decoder-ring
Then there were the manual - based protections , or decoder - ring / wheel protections .
These were designed to make the user look something up in a manual or move a decoder - ring or decoder - wheel to find a word .
Presumably the pirates did n’t want to copy an entire manual .
Of course pirates can reverse - engineer source code to force the game to skip the protection , or hack the random number generator so that the same word is always chosen .
In extreme cases , they just hit the protection dozens of times and write down a matrix of the most common cases .
End result :
Legitimate users who lose their manual are screwed .
Even when they do n’t , they have to dig it out every time they want to play the game .
Pirates every once in a while can’t answer the question , and sometimes have a cracked game that ’s broken because the crack was applied incorrectly .
Overall , they usually had a better experience than the legit users .
Dongles
Dongles were a travesty , and are still used today … .
The thing about these items is the user must have this hardware “ key ” plugged into their computer in order to use the product .
This adds a point of failure for legitimate users – lose software CD , you ’re screwed .
Lose dongle , you ’re screwed .
The greatest thing about these is they ’re almost always easy to crack .
My friend , the pirate , says he went through a brief tutorial on some Sentinel thing and found that even though he was never better than an intermediate cracker , that particular hardware key was a breeze to get past .
End result :
Legitimate users suffer greatly .
Dongles are usually used only for high - end items , making the double failure points that much more concerning .
Couple that with the annoyance of having to find a port ( often on the back of one ’s computer back when these things were really popular ( parallel port ) ) , and you have a big ass - raping of your customers .
Pirates love this shit .
Usually easy to crack , often high - end software .
Sometimes so easy to crack big pirate rings can manufacture and sell illegal dongles , possibly taking revenue away from the idiots who sought the dongle protection in the first place .
Think about it – if the company did n’t waste money on the dongle protection , maybe their prices could be more reasonable .
Size of media
CDs were initially only protected by being big .
When CD burners were totally infeasible ( $ 1000 and more ) and hard drives were small ( say 500 MB ) , it was impossible to pirate CDs .
This was the golden age of anti-piracy measures .
Users knew they needed the CD in the drive because there really were n’t any other options given the size of data – we put up with it because we understood why we had to .
Pirates just got pissy and bitched a lot .
Which was n’t really out of the ordinary anyway .
Even when CD burners became semi-feasible , the media was still unreliable and expensive .
My friend , the pirate , recalls such a time :
I bought a burner for about $ 250 , 2 x write [ that ’s about an hour to burn a CD if you did a simulation , and back then he did that every time because media sucked so much ] , figured it would pay for itself after what , 5 games right [ at $ 50 a game ] ?
No such luck actually .
It was $ 10 a cd to burn on , and at least 3 in ten was bad , so I think it was an overall loss even after ten games , heheh .
And nobody wanted to go in on the game and the media and wait around for it all just to get a copy so like you just had to rely on borrowing shit .
End Result :
Annoying for legit users , but totally understandable necessity .
When your game is 600MB and the average user has less than that much hard drive space , you do n’t have the option of being consumer - friendly .
Annoying for pirates , but they knew they ’d have the last laugh .
Technology always gets better , so it was only a matter of time before they could get their stuff free again .
Serial codes / instant activation
Then we have instant activation products .
Technically this stuff is older than CD media .
Games for BBSes were my friend , the pirate ’s first experience .
He wrote key generators for many door games .
He ’s very proud of stealing from small companies apparently .
So you download it for evaluation , and if you pay for it ( to remove the annoying nag screen for instance ) , you just enter a serial number , unlocking it instantly .
Nice idea , and actually makes it more likely to keep all your customers happy .
Some companies do this wrong , making it too easy to crack or too many “ anti- crack ” checks that cost them some users , but overall it ’s a pretty decent system .
End result :
Legitimate users have to worry a bit about losing their activation codes , but a good company will store purchase info or have account data so you can reactivate at any time in the future ( Alcohol - soft and Stardock both do a great job of that ) .
Pirates are also happy , because the download contains the full product , so they just have to crack a serial and get a free piece of software without any obviously illegal network activity .
The beginnings of evil
Serial numbers and product activation codes could be copied , and CDs were eventually burnable .
Internet connections could be used to check validity but nobody would put up with an internet check on every use of a product until recently ( and if you look at steam ’s forums you ’ll see a good number of people still are n’t ) .
So the next logical step ( for the paranoid idiots who ( a ) thought they could stop piracy , and ( b ) were so paranoid they thought it was costly enough to invest in trying to stop ) was hard - core CD protection .
This stuff was nasty early on .
I personally remember the problems I had with Diablo 2 on an old CDROM drive .
My friend , the pirate , says many games had similar issues .
He often grabbed the crack for games he bought because of these problems .
Some companies that do n’t suck , such as Firaxis , had so many problems with copy protections that they actually released their own fully legal cracks .
End result :
Consumers are screwed time and again by poorly - implement copy protections .
Just like it ’s a guarantee that all software will have bugs , all copy protections ( being software ) will also have bugs .
This means some number of users will be FUCKED .

The reason I 'm getting rid of him is because after two years of trying , I realized I 'm not a tree hugger and would rather mow my weeds than wait for the stupid goat to eat them .
Now that you know what to expect from him , and your still interested keep in mind that I will not give him to someone just to make tacos out of .
I want him to go somewhere to be a companion to a horse , or someone thats willing to put in the time to make him tame & friendly .
He is cut so the billy goat thing is n't an issue .
Below are a couple of pic's including his head stuck , and a pic of his replacement .
Thanks ,

ARCHIVES | SEARCH SQL Injection Attacks Becoming More Intense Posted by Patrik @ 23:20 GMT
The mass SQL injection attacks we 've mentioned here and here are increasing in number and we 're seeing more domains being injected and used to host the attack files .
We believe that there is now more than one group using a set of different automated tools to inject the code .
Previously , these attacks have primarily pointed to IP addresses in China and we 've seen the following domains being used in addition to the ones we 've mentioned previously :
www.wowgm1.cn
www.killwow1.cn

SecureWorks has a nice write - up available .
The direct84.com domain fast - fluxes to several different IPs in Europe , Israel and North America .
The injected link eventually leads to a backdoor detected as Backdoor : W32 / Agent .DAS .
This is a good time to again mention that it's not a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS or Microsoft SQL that is used to make this happen .
If you are an administrator of a website that is using ASP / ASP .

Boris Johnson last night notched up the Tories ' greatest electoral success since John Major 's surprise victory in the 1992 general election when he unseated Ken Livingstone as mayor of London .
Ecstatic Conservatives cheered at London 's City Hall , at the end of a count lasting more than 15 hours , as the man who had been dismissed as the Bertie Wooster of British politics took charge of one of the biggest political offices in Britain .
Johnson won just over 1 m first preference votes to secure 42.48 % ; Ken Livingstone came second with 893,877 first preference votes ( 36.38 % ) ; Brian Paddick , the Liberal Democrat candidate , came third with 236,685 votes to give him 9.63 % .
Paddick was then eliminated along with the seven other candidates .
Their second preference votes were distributed , giving Johnson 1,168,738 votes ( 53 % ) and 1,028,966 for Livingstone ( 47 % ) .
Johnson , who was declared the winner shortly before midnight , reassured London that he would do his best to maintain his new serious image .
" I was elected as new Boris and I will govern as new Boris , or whatever the phrase is , " he joked this morning in a pun on Tony Blair 's famous New Labour declaration .
David Cameron quickly hailed the result , and there was even a congratulatory phone call from Michael Bloomberg , mayor of New York .
In a sign of his determination to reach across party lines , Johnson adopted a more serious pose in his acceptance speech as he paid a warm tribute to his defeated rival .
Turning to Livingstone , standing behind on a platform at City Hall , the new mayor said : " I think you have been a very considerable public servant and a distinguished leader of this city .
You shaped the office of mayor .
You gave it national prominence and when London was attacked on July 7 2005 you spoke for London .
" And I can tell you that your courage and the sheer exuberant nerve with which you stuck it to your enemies , especially in New Labour , you have thereby earned the thanks of millions of Londoners even if you think that they have a funny way of showing it today . "
Johnson made clear that he still envisaged a role for Livingstone , who had suggested he would have offered his Tory rival a job if he had held office .
" When we have that drink together , which we both so richly deserve , I hope we can discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London , a city whose energy conquered the world and which now brings the world together in one city , " Johnson said .
Livingstone , who will have to watch as Johnson represents London at the Beijing Olympics in August as the torch is passed over for the 2012 games , apologised for losing after eight years in office .
With his voice almost breaking with emotion , Livingstone said : " I 'm sorry I could n't get an extra few points that would take us to victory and the fault for that is solely my own . "
He said he could n't be mayor for eight years and then blame someone else for not getting a third term .
" I accept that responsibility and I regret that I could n't take you [ Labour supporters ] to victory . "
Johnson 's victory capped a highly successful 24 hours for the Tories , who won 44 % of the vote in the separate council elections in England and Wales , convincing many Conservatives that they are on their way to Downing Street .
" This is like the March on Rome in 1922 , " one shadow minister said as Johnson inched towards victory .
Johnson will not march into London 's City Hall surrounded by blackshirts in the manner of Benito Mussolini 's supporters when they staged their coup d'état in 1920s Italy .
But the lighthearted reference to 1922 gave a taste of the high Tory spirits .
Johnson 's victory was particularly sweet for the Tories because London has been , until relatively recently , hostile territory for the Conservatives , who lost a string of parliamentary seats in the capital in the Labour landslide of 1997 .
" It is impossible to overestimate the significance of victory , " said one senior Tory .
Cameron , who praised Johnson this morning for a " remarkable victory " , will reap a huge personal dividend .
The Tory leader took what shadow cabinet ministers freely admit was a gamble in throwing his weight behind his fellow Etonian as the best " out - of - the - box " candidate to take on Livingstone .
" David and George [ Osborne ] made two significant calculations about this contest some time ago , " one senior Tory figure said .
" They clocked its symbolic importance for us and they realised that a traditional Tory in a pinstriped suit would be trounced by Ken . "
Johnson , who announced that he would resign as MP for Henley after organising an " orderly timetable " to choose a new Tory candidate , indicated in his acceptance speech that London had yet to embrace the Tory party fully .
" I do not for one minute believe that this election shows that London has been transformed overnight into a Conservative city but I do hope it does show that the Conservatives have changed into a party that can again be trusted after 30 years with the greatest , most cosmopolitan , multi-racial generous - hearted city on Earth on which there are huge and growing divisions between rich and poor . "
The Lib Dems will be disappointed that they failed to secure 10 % of the vote .
Sian Berry , the Green candidate , came fourth with 3.15 % .
Richard Barnbrook , the British National Party candidate , came fifth with 2.84 % .
Barnbrook , who was elected to the London assembly , sparked a walkout by the main mayoral candidates when he took to the podium to speak .
When bombs shatter bones with compound fractures , it can take multiple surgeries and lots of rehab to set things right .
So Darpa , the Pentagon 's premiere research shop , wants to " develop a dynamic putty - like material " that can be packed around a shattered bone , support the body while the patient heals – and bio - degrade , once it 's all over .
If successful , this " Fracture Putty " could " rapidly restore a patient to ambulatory function while normal healing ensues , with dramatically reduced rehabilitation time and the elimination of infection and secondary fractures , " the agency notes .
But , like all Darpa programs , it 'll be tough .
Challenges for the program include :

A company specialising in removing failed asylum - seekers is to approach the Government with plans to use specially adapted aircraft to deport hundreds of " disruptive " refugees .
Asylum Airways , run by an Austrian aviation consultant with ties to British security firms , will operate aircraft for European countries which do not wish to use established airlines for the forced removal of asylum - seekers .
The planes will have specially designed seats so that the " passengers " can be strapped down and restrained by guards .
A deal could save the Government millions of pounds compared with the piecemeal contracts it has negotiated with dozens of airlines as well as reduce the number of aborted deportations .

Hundreds of asylum - seeker removals have had to be aborted in the past two years because of what the Home Office describes as " disruptive behaviour " .
And in the past few months airlines have been criticised for carrying failed asylum - seekers , many of whom allege they have been physically and racially abused by private security guards paid to escort them .
Earlier this year XL airlines announced that it would no longer work with the Home Office in removing failed asylum - seekers .
But British Airways and others argue that they have a legal duty to take asylum - seekers on their aircraft .
Heinz Berger , who has set up the Asylum Airlines company and has worked with British companies providing security at British airports , says that he is still involved with the " bureaucracy " of the scheme but has identified Britain as a key market for his service .
Mr Berger said that Britain was on a list of countries with whom he was seeking to do business .
He said there was " ongoing interest all over Europe " for an airline that will organise flights around Europe , picking up failed asylum - seekers from various countries and then flying them back to their home nations around Africa , the Middle East and Asia .
A special feature will be bespoke aircraft with padded rooms and restraining equipment .
Figures released under the Freedom of Information
Act show that the removal of hundreds of asylum - seekers each year has to be cancelled because of " disruptive behaviour " .
But this can include medical problems as well as complaints from passengers .
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said that while the Government was " open to new ideas " she said the present arrangements were working " pretty well " .

GOP cancer : Party could lose 20 more seats
For the past 18 months , ever since the 2006 elections , congressional Republicans have been like a hospital patient trying to convince visitors that he is not really all that sick : a bit under the weather ; actually feel better than I sound ; should be up and about any day ; thanks for asking .
Suddenly — belatedly — all pretense is gone .
Advertisement
The Republican defeat in Tuesday ’s special election in Mississippi , in a deeply conservative district where , in an average year , Democrats cannot even compete , was a clear sign that the GOP has the political equivalent of cancer that has spread throughout the body .
Many House GOP operatives are privately predicting that the party could easily lose up to 20 seats this fall .
Combined with the 30 seats that the GOP lost in 2006 , that would leave the party facing a 70 - vote deficit against Democrats in the House — a state of powerlessness reminiscent of Republicans ’ long wilderness years in the 1960s and ’70s .
Things are not particularly more hopeful on the Senate side , where most analysts say Democrats have a strong chance of adding five or more seats to their current majority .
Panic and blame - casting for the dire condition were flowing in equal measures Wednesday inside the House Republican Conference and among party elders and operatives outside .
In the crossfire , there was a bracing new spirit of candor that has largely been missing since 2006 , when many Republicans tried to convince the public — and perhaps themselves — that the defeat was the result of temporary setbacks , such as the House page scandal or bad headlines for Tom DeLay , rather than something more fundamental .
“ The political atmosphere facing House Republicans this November is the worst since Watergate and is far more toxic than the fall of 2006 , when we lost 30 seats ( and our majority ) and came within a couple of percentage points of losing another 15 seats , ” Rep . Tom Davis , a moderate Northern Virginia Republican who previously headed the National Republican Congressional Committee , wrote in a 20 - page memo to colleagues .
Former Rep. Mickey Edwards , an Oklahoma Republican , said : “ I do n’t know that I have seen a year like this , ever .
The general attitude toward Republicans is so bad nationally . ”
By coincidence , the current NRCC chairman — Rep. Tom Cole ( R - Okla . ) , the target of much finger - pointing for his strategy — got his start in politics as a young aide to Edwards .
Like many in his party , Edwards said the GOP ’s main hope for avoiding a blowout this fall rests in having candidates liberate themselves from their national party label and run on local issues .
But that is easier said than done .
The Mississippi district won by Travis Childers is the third consecutive Republican - leaning district that Democrats have won in a special election this year .
Party strategists , most of whom spoke anonymously , said the implications of this record reverberate in all manner of ways that are not necessarily obvious at first blush .
Newly vulnerable Republicans : Suddenly , all sorts of districts that in typical years should be safe for the GOP , no matter the national trend , are clearly in jeopardy .
Those seats include the open seats of retiring Reps.
Kenny Hulshof in northeast Missouri , Jim McCrery in northwest Louisiana , Steve Pearce in rural New Mexico and Terry Everett in Alabama .
Democrats breathing easy : Some of the freshman Democrats who were once viewed as highly vulnerable in their reelection bids are now looking to be in surprisingly good shape .
Republicans have n’t been able to field credible recruits against freshman Democratic Reps .
John Hall of New York , Brad Ellsworth of Indiana , Heath Shuler of North Carolina and Zack Space of Ohio — all of whom represent traditionally GOP districts that the party lost in the 2006 election .
One of the Republicans ’ perennial targets , Rep. Melissa L. Bean ( D - Ill. ) , is now heavily favored to win reelection after her once highly touted Republican challenger reported a near - empty campaign account at the end of March .
Money meltdown :
The NRCC has now spent about $ 3 million to defend three House seats in the most conservative parts of the county — Dennis Hastert ’s seat in exurban Chicago , Richard Baker ’s seat in the Baton Rouge , La. , area and Roger Wicker ’s seat in northeast Mississippi .
Until this year , Republicans rarely had to break a sweat to hold on to these seats .
They have now lost all three of them , and the committee is even less - equipped financially to compete fully in an ever - widening playing field for November .
That $ 3 million total is about 42 percent of all cash on hand the committee reported at the end of March ( in its latest filing ) .
The playing field of competitive races in 2008 will comprise at least 40 seats , and possibly as many as 70 .
The committee just does not have money to help its stronger candidates — and it wo n’t even have enough money to help all of its vulnerable incumbents .
What ’s more , in fundraising , just as success breeds more success , defeat is self - reinforcing .
With the clear signs of how much trouble the party is in , it is going to be harder than ever to persuade donors to open their wallets on behalf of candidates this fall .
“ If I ’m those members , I ’m very concerned .
You look at what the NRCC spent last cycle in those races — who ’s going to do that next time ?
All these Republicans are used to having more money ; they ’ve never been in a situation where Democrats have been able to outspend them , ” said a top GOP strategist .
Heading for the hills :
Plainly , there are large headwinds blowing that no operative or party leader , no matter how skilled , could counteract .
But this fact does not mean that Cole and his team have not made matters worse through what many Republican members see as poor fundraising and candidate recruitment , as well as faulty judgments about message and resource allocation .
The second - guessing on the Republican side is going to make it virtually impossible for leaders to impose any kind of discipline on their caucus when it comes to showdown votes in 2008 or to running on a unified message .
At times such as this , it is every man and woman for themselves — plainly the smartest move for individuals but not necessarily for the party as a whole .
“ It is not beyond the realm of possibility that we could be down to 170 seats .
It ’s like back to where we were in the ’ 80s , ” said an aide to a top GOP lawmaker .
“ The only solace we ’ll have is maybe we can run against [ Barack ] Obama in 2010 . ”

Democrats And The Iron Law Of Institutions
Read this if you 're driven insane by the Democrats .
John Caruso of a Distant Ocean is pissed off at Medea Benjamin :
Medea Benjamin complains that Nancy Pelosi makes time to meet with Democratic coffee klatches and " high - dollar donors " but wo n't meet with activists from Benjamin's CODEPINK .
My response : The Democrats generally ( and Nancy Pelosi in particular ) learned that they could ignore people like CODEPINK generally ( and Medea Benjamin in particular ) in 2004 , when progressives made it eminently clear that they would vote for a Democrat who was as bad as ( or worse than ) George Bush on the most crucial issues -- especially Iraq ...
So if Nancy Pelosi wo n't meet with you now , Medea , it 's because she knows that there 's absolutely no need for her to do so .
You can sputter all you want about how " Pelosi has alienated CODEPINK and most of the peace movement " and how " disillusioned " you are , but you 've already proven that in the only place that Democrats care about what you do -- the voting booth -- you 're willing to sacrifice your principles and give them your support ...
Let me gently suggest that John , in his understandable frustration , is not perceiving this situation clearly .
What he 's overlooking is that the Democrats operate according to the Iron Law of Institutions .
The Iron Law of Institutions is : the people who control institutions care first and foremost about their power within the institution rather than the power of the institution itself .
Thus , they would rather the institution " fail " while they remain in power within the institution than for the institution to " succeed " if that requires them to lose power within the institution .
This is true for all human institutions , from elementary schools up to the United States of America .
If history shows anything , it 's that this can not be changed .
What can be done , sometimes , is to force the people running institutions to align their own interests with those of the institution itself and its members .
I 'll get to back momentarily to today 's Democrats , but first it 's useful to look at how the Iron Law plays out in other cases .
At the country level , Saddam Hussein is an extreme example : during his thirty years in power , he made choices that led to the obliteration of Iraq — not because there was nothing else he could have done , but because choices that would have strengthened Iraq would have made him less individually powerful within Iraq .
And this is a constant occurrence in the history of dictators .
When Stalin purged many of the Red Army 's most competent officers in the late thirties it made the Soviet Union itself far weaker — in particular , more vulnerable to a Nazi invasion — but what mattered to Stalin was eliminating internal rivals to his power .
The same dynamic is displayed in less virulent form with Bush and Cheney : whenever they 've had to choose between sharing power with others within a stronger America , and holding more power within a weaker America , they 've chosen the latter .
Probably the best writing about this at the political party level was done by the late Walter Karp .
Karp points out in Buried Alive that before the 1972 elections there was a huge influx of new people and energy into the Democratic party from the anti-war and civil rights movements .
This was enough to get McGovern nominated .
But here 's what happened then , as Karp describes it :
As soon as McGovern was nominated , party leaders began systematically slurring and belittling him , while the trade union chieftains refused to endorse him on the pretense that this mild Mr. Pliant was a being wild and dangerous .
A congressional investigation of Watergate was put off for several months to deprive McGovern 's candidacy of its benefits .
As an indiscreet Chicago ward heeler predicted in the fall of 1972 , McGovern is " gonna lose because we 're gonna make sure he 's gonna lose " ... So deftly did party leaders " cut the top of the ticket " that while Richard Nixon won in a " landslide , " the Democrats gained two Senate seats .
Could McGovern have won if he'd been fully supported by the status quo powers with the Democratic party ?
Impossible to say .
But they did n't want to take any chances : they preferred to make sure he lost the election , because his winning it would have meant newcomers would dilute their power within the party .
That 's the Iron Law of Institutions in action .
In The Politics of War Karp examines a similar situation in the election of 1912 .
The incumbent was William H. Taft , a Republican .
However , he was extremely unpopular both nationally and with the progressive movement within the Republican party .
First the National Progressive Republican League ( essentially a party within the party , like the Progressive Democrats of America today ) backed Robert La Follette .
They eventually deserted him for Teddy Roosevelt , because he seemed more likely to wrest the nomination away from Taft .
Karp writes :
If a presidential nomination were decided by the sentiments of a party 's rank and file , Roosevelt would have won the nomination by a landslide .
Of the 388 convention delegates chosen by popular vote , Taft won a mere 71 , or less than 20 percent .
If a presidential nomination were decided by money , Roosevelt again would have won .
He had the preponderance of money on his side .
If a presidential nomination were dictated by the party leaders ' desire to win the general election , they would have nominated Roosevelt themselves .
The Republican oligarchy , however , was fighting for its life .
Compared to the prospect of losing power within the party , rank - and - file sentiment meant little .
Winning in November meant least of all .
The oligarchy was determined to renominate Taft , a certain loser , solely to keep control of the party .
" When we get back in four years , " explained a machine senator from Indiana , " instead of the damned insurgents , we will have the machine . "
So what does this mean for John Caruso's ( and everyone 's ) frustration with the Democrats today ?
A lot of things , such as :
1 . The voting booth is by no means " the only place that Democrats care about what you do . "
In fact , from their perspective , by the time you get to the general election much of the game is over .
Withholding your November vote from candidates they like but you do n't will , at most , make them a little sad .
Often they 'd prefer it , if that 's the price of keeping you out of their hair the rest of the time .
That 's why they do n't try to appeal to the ~ 50 % of Americans who do n't vote .
2 . If you want to motivate powerful Democrats , attempt to threaten their power within the party , not the well - being of the party overall .
Of course , this is easier said than done , particularly because much of the power within the party is ( as Karp would put it ) an unelected Democratic oligarchy .
For instance , Pelosi 's status as Speaker can be challenged straightforwardly .
Getting at the source of the party oligarchy 's power , which is money and institutions outside of electoral politics , is much more difficult .
3 . Any serious attempt to transform the Democratic party would include a conscious attempt to change its culture , into one that celebrates different people : organizers rather than elected officials and donors .
Culture only seems like a weak reed .
It 's in fact the most powerful motivation people have .
If people are celebrated for acting for the good of the whole rather than just themselves , they 'll act for the good of the whole .
Likewise , a better culture would humble the " leaders , " to discourage those with individualistic motivations from seeking the positions .
A Democratic party that worked would require Charles Schumer and Steny Hoyer and anyone who donated over $ 5000 a year to clean the Capitol toilets .
4 . If you do n't believe the Democratic party is redeemable , do n't get your hopes up that another party would end up being much better .
Any other party would also be subject to the Iron Law of Institutions .
It thus would be quickly just as dreadful as the Democrats ... unless people put in the same amount of work as would be required to clean out the Democrats ' Augean stables .
5 . Generally speaking , do n't expect too much from political parties , and certainly do n't expect them to change much in less than a generation .
And in any case , keep in mind much of the power in society lies elsewhere .
UPDATE : American Coprophagia points out another of Karp 's favorite stories , which appears in Indispensable Enemies :
It was a Republican state party boss , Senator Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania , who early this century stated with notable candor the basic principle and purpose of present - day party politics .
In the face of a powerful state and national resurgence of reform and the sentiments of the majority of the Republican rank and file , Penrose put up a losing slate of stand - pat party hacks .
When a fellow Republican accused him of ruining the party , Penrose replied , " Yes , but I 'll preside over the ruins . "
AND : I 've removed an anecdote I was using about Egypt and the 1967 War because of doubts about its accuracy .
GARDINER , Montana ( CNN ) --
More than half of Yellowstone National Park 's bison herd has died since last fall , forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program .
Between harsh weather , hunting and an annual cull , fully half of Yellowstone National Park 's bison have died .
More than 700 of the iconic animals starved or otherwise died on the mountainsides during an unusually harsh winter , and more than 1,600 were shot by hunters or sent to slaughterhouses in a disease - control effort , according to National Park Service figures .
As a result , the park estimates its bison herd has dropped from 4,700 in November to about 2,300 today , prompting the government to halt the culling program early .
" There has never been a slaughter like this of the bison since the 1800s in this country , and it 's disgusting , " said Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign , a group seeking to stop the slaughter program for good .
Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park .
Brucellosis can cause miscarriages , infertility and reduced milk production in domestic cattle .
Watch Yellowstone bison search for pasture »
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that half of Yellowstone 's bison herd is infected with the bacterium .
Previously , under the Interagency Bison Management Plan , wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis .
( The meat -- which experts say is safe to eat if cooked -- and hides were distributed to Native American groups . )
Late this winter the slaughter was limited to animals that tested positive for the disease .
Now the program has been further curtailed ; no bison have been killed in the past week .
" The plan requires all of us to do two things : protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle .
We 're required to keep bison and cattle separate , " National Park Service spokesman Al Nash said .
The USDA acknowledges that bison - to - cattle transmission is difficult to document , but it says investigations indicate that bison were the likely source of infections in cattle herds in Wyoming and North Dakota .
But critics call the culling an overreaction .
There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle , they said .
" I mean , it 's hype , it 's a hysteria , " Mease said .
" And it 's not a fatal disease . "
Last month , two women chained themselves to a railing inside the park 's visitor center to protest the policy .
" The Park Service is meant to protect and preserve wildlife in national parks , not indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of [ bison ] , " one of the protesters , 20 - year - old Miriam Wasser , wrote in a leaflet she distributed .
Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a bison population has persisted since prehistoric times , according to the Park Service .
Herds once numbered in the tens of millions across the continent but were hunted nearly to extinction by the late 1800s .
Protected since the early 20th century , the species has recovered .
Bison graze high on Yellowstone 's grassy plateaus during the summer .
When the weather becomes too harsh and food becomes scarce , they often roam outside the park .
That 's the problem .
Nash explained the situation in its simplest terms :
" Bison are bison .
Bison are nomadic animals .
Bison are looking for food .
Food is difficult and scarce to come by at the end of the winter .
They 're leaving the interior of the park [ and going ] to lower places , in part , to look for food .
There 's limited tolerance for bison outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park . "
That 's because just two cases of brucellosis would trigger stringent limits on export of cattle from Montana .
" Montana has spent millions of dollars over the years to get brucellosis eradicated from our livestock , " said Martin Davis , who has a cattle ranch within roaming distance north of the park .
" And to put that in jeopardy -- no one wants that to happen . "
Control of the bison population is essential , Davis said .
" Bottom line is , there 's too many of them .
They 've got to be managed .
They ran out of pasture .
...
They 're eating themselves out of house and home . "
Under the management plan , rangers and cowboys hired by various government agencies try to harass stray animals back onto park property .
Officials shoot animals that can't be persuaded .
( Ranchers are not permitted to kill wild bison ) .
Meanwhile , hundreds of bison are rounded up inside the park every winter and slaughtered to reduce competition for food and therefore the need for animals to wander onto private land .
" It becomes a private property issue , " said Davis , who has never had a bison encroach on his ranch .
" They walked down onto private property .
And if you do n't want a buffalo on your private property , you should n't have to have them there . "
Mease , the activist , portrays the conflict as a simple turf war .
" The Montana cattle ranchers do n't want the competition for grass , " he said .
" They want the national forests and public lands to be all their public - lands grazing allotments , and in that process , they do n't want bison . "
Federal and state officials said last week they will lease private land bordering the park where up to 100 bison eventually will be allowed to graze during the winter .
But the problem is not likely to go away .
" The reality of the situation is that whether you have 4,000 bison or whether you have 200 bison , bison are a nomadic species and they will always be looking out to the horizon and expanding their boundaries , " said Tim Reid , chief deputy ranger at Yellowstone .
So the culling program is expected to return next winter .
" It is our job to protect the viability of this population , " the Park Service 's Nash said .
" We take that seriously .
We are not taking any actions that will have a serious ongoing negative impact on this population .
" The Yellowstone bison population is healthy , it 's strong , it 's vibrant .
We continue to take actions to protect that herd . "
But to activists like Mease , it 's just not right to kill healthy bison .
" There 's less than 5,000 wild , genetically pure buffalo left in America , " he said , " and this is how we treat them ? "

Rhodium - based catalyst works like " a bit of ' golden dust ' "
BUFFALO , N.Y . --
A new chemical synthesis method based on a catalyst worth many times the price of gold and providing a far more efficient and economical method than traditional ones for designing and manufacturing extremely novel pharmaceutical compounds is described by its University at Buffalo developers in a review article in the current issue of Nature .
The chemistry , the basis of a new biotech startup company called Dirhodium Technologies , LLC in Buffalo , has the potential to improve dramatically the design and production of new drugs based on small molecule organic compounds , which comprise the great majority of new drug applications .
" If you tend to make things by methods that have been around for 100 years , there 's a decent chance that you 'll make something that 's already known or is very close to something that is , " said Huw M.L. Davies , Ph.D. , UB Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry and lead author on the Nature paper .
" But if you use an entirely new strategy like the one we developed , virtually every reaction you run will result in a new structural entity .
That 's critical to drug development . "
The chemical strategy Davies developed depends on the use of proprietary catalysts his company manufactures .
Minute amounts of the rhodium - based catalyst can have a major impact , he explained , with 1 gram capable of producing 10 kilograms of a pharmaceutical product .
" So it 's like a bit of ' golden dust ' to get everything going , " said Davies , a researcher at UB 's New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences and president and chief executive officer of Dirhodium Technologies .
" As rhodium metal costs 10 times the price of gold , the catalyst is a high - value material , " he said .
Available through chemical supply companies , the reagents are being used by pharmaceutical scientists in both industry and academia .
Already , one major pharmaceutical company is using the reagents to synthesize a compound now in clinical trials .
" Demand for our catalysts has gone from gram to kilogram quantities , from fractions of an ounce to multiple pounds , " said Davies .
So far , the new synthesis strategy has generated compounds that have potential activity against a broad range of disease states , from cancer to central nervous system disorders , such as depression , to inflammatory and microbial diseases and medications for treating cocaine addiction .
" This method is like an enabling technology , making available new targets and materials that previously were out of range , " said Davies .
Its ability to result in never - before - seen chemical structures is making Davies ' collaborations with scientists in partner institutions on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus especially fruitful .
" We 're using this as a platform for drug discovery , collaborating through the Center of Excellence with biologists at UB , Roswell Park and Hauptman Woodward Medical Research Institute , " said Davies .
Davies ' company is one of 10 life sciences spinoffs based in the Center of Excellence , which has the dual mission of promoting life sciences research while facilitating economic development in Upstate New York .
In addition to helping drug companies design novel leads for new products , the new chemistry also allows pharmaceutical companies to synthesize efficiently and economically large quantities of novel compounds .
Through catalysis , the chemical synthesis method the UB researchers developed allows for highly unusual functionalizations of carbon - hydrogen bonds , Davies explained .
" The method allows you to transform a molecule from a simple structure to a much more elaborate , drug - like material , " he said , " so it goes from a cheap building block to a potential drug - like candidate .
Without a catalyst , it wo n't happen . "
A major advantage of Davies ' chemical strategy is that the resulting compounds are produced selectively as single mirror images .
Pharmaceutical companies prefer to develop new chiral drugs ( chiral meaning " handed " ) as a single isomer because opposite mirror images can have different biological effects and may be harmful .
" A small amount of our catalyst can be used to generate large amounts of the active mirror image of the pharmaceutical ingredient , " Davies said .
The UB research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation , both of which were recently renewed for a total of $ 1.6 million .
The work also has been supported by the UB Center for Advanced Biomedical and Bioengineering Technology ( UB CAT ) , located in the Center of Excellence .
The Nature paper was co-authored by James R. Manning , a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry in the UB College of Arts and Sciences .
The New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences was created in Buffalo in 2002 as part of more than $ 200 million dollars in investment from state , federal , industrial and philanthropic sources to create a hub of life sciences expertise and innovation in Upstate New York .
The COE brings a strong foundation in life sciences research and discovery to its mission and collaborative efforts with industry , government and researchers around the world to improve the health and well - being of the population .
The Center of Excellence is a major UB research center ; its research partners are Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Hauptman - Woodward Medical Research Institute .
The University at Buffalo is a premier research - intensive public university , the largest and most comprehensive campus in the State University of New York .
UB 's more than 28,000 students pursue their academic interests through more than 300 undergraduate , graduate and professional degree programs .
Founded in 1846 , the University at Buffalo is a member of the Association of American Universities .
GRESHAM , Oregon ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama said on Sunday he would pursue a vigorous antitrust policy if he becomes U.S. president and singled out the media industry as one area where government regulators would need to be watchful as consolidation increases .
“ I will assure that we will have an antitrust division that is serious about pursuing cases , ” the Illinois senator told an audience of mostly senior citizens in Oregon .
“ There are going to be areas , in the media for example where we ’re seeing more and more consolidation , that I think ( it ) is legitimate to ask ... is the consumer being served ? ”
Obama , the front - runner for the Democratic nomination to contest November ’s presidential election against Republican Sen.
John McCain , criticized President George W. Bush ’s administration for lax supervision of major mergers , though he did not cite specific examples or companies .
“ We ’re going to have an antitrust division in the Justice Department that actually believes in antitrust law .
We have n’t had that for the last seven , eight years , ” he said .
“ Some of the consolidations that have been taking place , I think , may be anti-competitive . ”
Obama advisers have said previously that he would crack down on any competition lapses in the energy sector that have resulted from big corporate mergers .
E - Fuel 's MicroFueler , the home - based ethanol production system that makes gas from sugar or stale beer , was unveiled for the first time today in New York .
E- Fuel says it will now take preorders for the $ 10,000 system , and will ship it by the end of the year .
As you can see , it 's not the smallest thing — no wonder the original image of it only showed a corner .
Given its bulk and its price , what makes investing in this particular ethanol machine really worth it ?

The system takes feedstock ( a combination of sugar and yeast ) or discarded alcohol , and combines it with water to distill 100 % pure ethanol .
Turning sugar into gas may sound like the work of mad scientists , but according to CEO Tom Quinn , home ethanol production was advocated and used by Henry Ford when he created the Model T . I imagine that home - made ethanol was n't as easy to make back then , because if it was , we probably would n't have switched to gasoline in the first place .

The MicroFueler produces ethanol using membrane distillation .
Sugar , yeast and water are blended together to create the chemical reaction that produces ethanol .
After two days , the fermented sugar water is turned into vapor , and the ethanol is separated from the water .
By the end of the week , the MicroFueler reservoir will hold 35 gallons of pure ethanol , enough to fill at least two cars .
This is a lot like Dean Kamen 's water purifier , except in reverse .
In fact , creator Floyd Butterfield says the water by - product is clean enough to drink .

The most astounding part is that a car does n't require pure ethanol to run , due to its higher - than - gasoline octane content .
E- Fuel says you can fill up your tank with 75 % ethanol and 25 % water and your car will run fine .
The price tag may seem steep , but federal , state and local tax credits can bring the price as low as $ 5000 — average cost with credits is more like $ 7000 .
The creators say an average home will save around $ 4200 on gas each year , and the machine will pay for itself in about a year and a half .

That said , people have been doing this on their own for a while .
Plans available online estimate a true DIY machine costs about $ 500 to build , but for those who do n't want to run the risk of spontaneous combustion ( like me ) , the MicroFueler seems like a wise alternative .

And for those reasons he probably will offer her the No. 2 spot on the ticket .
Obama should choose her as his running mate to honor and woo those Clinton supporters .
He should choose her as his running mate to help soothe the still escalating intra-party hostilities .
He should choose her as his running mate because she runs far stronger than he does among certain core Democratic constituencies .
I know , I know .
More than 15 million Democrats have voted for Hillary Clinton in the primaries and many of them are so invested in her candidacy that they 're threatening to stay home in November or vote for Republican in waiting John McCain in the very likely event that the Democrats nominate Barack Obama for president .
1. Choosing Clinton would belie Obama 's message of change .
Whether you admire her or not , you have to acknowledge that Clinton 's an old - style , legacy Democrat .
Obama 's candidacy is premised on a break with the past .
2. Choosing Clinton would belie Obama 's repudiation of the old way of doing politics .
Clinton and her surrogates are tough campaigners who have gone hard after Obama ( see below ) trying to draw him into the fight .
And on those occasions where he and his team have responded in kind , Team Clinton has smirkingly asked whatever happened to the politics of hope ?
3. Bill Clinton .
He 's a brilliant man and an amazing politician , but he 's shown an inability to stay on message and keep his foot out of his mouth as he campaigns for his wife .
Obama already has Rev. Jeremiah
Wright to worry about -- he does n't need another loose cannon out there ready to fire .
4 . She 's polarizing .
For all that she 's shown how popular she can be with certain groups of primary voters , Hillary Clinton also remains a controversial and unpopular figure .
Here are her " unfavorable " ratings among all voters in a set of recent national polls , with Obama 's unfavorability ratings in parenthesis : 37 ( 30 ) ; 45 ( 37 ) 46 ( 38 ) 49 ( 40 ) 54 ( 39 ) 53 ( 37 ) .
5 . She 'll be the star of anti-Obama commercials : " It ’s imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander - in - chief threshold , " she said on March 6 .
" I believe that I ’ve done that .
Certainly , Sen. McCain has done that and you ’ll have to ask Sen. Obama with respect to his candidacy . ”
6 . She 's gone beyond the pale in attacking Obama : " I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House .
Sen . John McCain has a lifetime of experience that he'd bring to the White House .
And Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002 , " she said on March 4 .
Clinton delivered this insulting , dismissive , destructive critique several times , and it's a bell she can't unring .
7 . She 's toting unpacked baggage .
Clinton likes to claim that she 's been thoroughly vetted and withstood all the Republican attacks of the 1990s and now any bad news about her is simply old news .
It 's not so .
Obama has n't called her on this claim because he 's trying to preserve the image that he 's above the politics of scandal .
And the Republican operatives are lying in the weeds , boosting Clinton 's candidacy and licking their chops , waiting to pounce .
Not only are there all the " - - gate " scandals from her husband 's administration that were set aside rather than fully resolved in the public 's mind ( travel , file , cattle and so on ) , but the issue of the pardons Bill Clinton granted on his way out of the door and the mysterious funding sources from the Clinton Presidential Library are still out there .
8 . Picking a real teammate is better than picking a political counterweight .
Bill Clinton of Arkansas himself surprised the pundits in 1992 when he chose as his No. 2 another young moderate Democrat from the mid-South -- Al Gore of Tennessee -- and the two ran a vigorous , consistent campaign .
Obama would do better to pick someone of his generation who shares his general outlook and who can speak passionately and convincingly to voters about why they should support Obama .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush will veto legislation on Saturday banning U.S. intelligence agents from using waterboarding and other controversial interrogation methods , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said on Friday .

Last month , Congress sent Bush a broad intelligence authorization bill that contained new limits on CIA interrogation techniques , despite Bush administration warnings that such a measure would be rejected .
“ The president will veto the intelligence authorization bill tomorrow , ” Fratto told reporters .
The legislation was approved by the Senate and House of Representatives on partisan votes that did not indicate there was enough support in Congress to overturn Bush ’s veto .
Waterboarding , in which suspects are subjected to simulated drowning , has been widely criticized by many members of Congress , human rights organizations and other countries .
The technique was used on three suspects captured after the September 11 attacks , CIA Director Michael Hayden informed Congress last month .
In writing the legislation , supporters said it would put CIA interrogation techniques in line with the U.S. Army Field Manual , which prohibits waterboarding and other controversial methods .
The Bush administration has countered that the CIA should not be held to the U.S. military ’s interrogation standards because intelligence agents are dealing with terrorists who are not lawful combatants operating under traditional battlefield tactics .
“ President Bush ’s veto will be one of the most shameful acts of his presidency , ” charged Sen .
Edward Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat who supported the legislation outlawing waterboarding .
Quoting the Army Field Manual , Kennedy said , “ ‘ Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results , may damage subsequent collection efforts , and can induce the source to say what he thinks the wants to hear . ’”

Here is the entire text of Keith ’s comment :
Finally tonight as promised , a Special Comment on Senator Clinton ’s “ assassination ” remark to the editorial board of the Argus - Leader newspaper of Sioux Falls , South Dakota .
Once again , it was this :
Asked if her continuing fight for the nomination against Senator Obama hurts the Democratic party , she replied , quote … “ I do n’t .
Because again , I ’ve been around long enough .
You know , my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the
California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ?
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in ** June ** in California .
You know , I just do n’t understand it .
You know , there ’s lots of speculation about why it is . “
The comments were recorded and we showed them to you earlier and they are on - line as we speak .
She actually said those words .
** Those ** words , Senator ?
You actually invoked the nightmare of political assassination .
You actually invoked the spectre of an inspirational leader , at the seeming moment of triumph , for himself and a battered nation yearning to breathe free , silenced forever .
You actually used the word “ assassination ” in the middle of a campaign with a loud undertone of racial hatred — and ** gender ** hatred — and ** political ** hatred .
You actually used the word “ assassination ” in a time when there is a fear , unspoken but vivid and terrible , that our again - troubled land and fractured political landscape might target a black man running for president .
Or a white man .
Or a white woman !
You actually used those words , in ** this ** America , Senator while running against an African - American against whom the death threats started the moment he declared his campaign ?
You actually used those words , in ** this ** America , Senator , while running to break your “ greatest glass ceiling ” and claiming there are people who would do anything to stop ** you **?
You !
Senator — never mind the implications of using the word “ assassination ” in any connection to Senator Obama …
What about ** you **?
You can not say this !
The references , said her spokesperson , were not , in any way , weighted .
The allusions , said Mo Uh - leathee , are , quote … “ … historical examples of the nominating process going well into the summer and any reading into it beyond that would be inaccurate and outrageous . ”
I ’m sorry .
There is **no** inaccuracy .
Not for a moment does any rational person believe Senator Clinton is actually ** hoping ** for the worst of all political calamities .
Yet the outrage belongs , not to Senator Clinton or her supporters , but to every other American .
Firstly , she has previously bordered on the remarks she made today …
Then swerved back from them and the awful skid they represented .
She said , in an off - camera interview with ** Time ** on March 6th …
“ Primary contests used to last a lot longer .
We all remember the great tragedy of Bobby Kennedy being assassinated in June in L.A .
My husband did n’t wrap up the nomination in 1992 until June , also in California .
Having a primary contest go through June is nothing
particularly unusual .
We will see how it unfolds as we go forward over the next three to four months . ”
In retrospect , we failed her when we did not call her out , for that remark , dry and only disturbing , in a magazine ’s pages .
But somebody obviously warned her of the danger of that rhetoric :
After the Indiana primary , on May 7th , she told supporters at a Washington hotel :
“ Sometimes you gotta calm people down a little bit .
But if you look at successful presidential campaigns , my husband did not get the nomination until June of 1992 .
I remember tragically when Senator Kennedy won California near the end of that process . ”
And at Shepherdstown , West Virginia , on the same day , she referenced it again :
“ You know , I remember very well what happened in the California primary in 1968 as , you know , Senator Kennedy won that primary . ”
On March 6th she had said “ assassinated . ”
By May 7th she had avoided it .
Today … she went back to an awful well .
There is no ** good ** time to recall the awful events of June 5th , 1968 …
Of Senator Bobby Kennedy , happy and alive — perhaps , for the first time since his own brother ’s death in Dallas in 1963 …
Galvanized to try to lead this nation back from one of its darkest eras …
Only to fall victim to the same scurge that ** took ** that brother , and Martin Luther King …
There ** is** no good time to recall this .
But certainly to invoke it , two weeks before the exact 40th anniversary of the assassination , is an insensitive and heartless thing .
And certainly to invoke it , three days ** after * * the awful diagnosis , and heart - breaking prognosis , for Senator ** Ted * * Kennedy , is just as insensitive , and just as heartless .
And both actions , open a door wide into the soul of somebody who seeks the highest office in this country , and through that door shows something not merely troubling , but frightening .
And politically inexplicable .
What , Senator , do you suppose would happen if you withdrew from the campaign , and Senator Obama formally became the presumptive nominee , and then suddenly left the scene .
It does n’t even have to ** be** the ‘ dark curse upon the land ’ you mentioned today , Senator .
Nor even an issue of health .
He could simply change his mind …
Or there could unfold that perfect - storm scandal your people have often referenced , even predicted .
Maybe he could get a better offer from some other , wiser country .
What happens then , Senator ?
You are not allowed ** back * * into the race ?
Your delegates and your support vanish ?
The Democrats do n’t run ** anybody ** for President ?
What happens , of course , is what ** happened * * when the Democrats ’ Vice Presidential choice , Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri , had to withdraw from the ticket , in 1972 after it proved he had not been forthcoming about previous mental health treatments .
George McGovern simply got ** another ** Vice President .
Senator , as late as the late summer of 1864 the Republicans were talking about having a ** second * * convention , to withdraw Abraham Lincoln ’s re-nomination and choose somebody else because until Sherman took Atlanta in September it looked like Lincoln was going to ** lose ** to George McClellan .
You could theoretically ** suspend ** your campaign , Senator .
There ’s plenty of time and plenty of historical precedent , Senator , in case you want to come back in , if something bad should happen to Senator Obama .
Nothing serious , mind you .
It ’s just like you said , “ We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . ”
Since those awful words in Sioux Falls , and after the condescending , buck - passing statement from her spokesperson , Senator Clinton has made something akin to an apology , without any evident recognition of the true trauma she has inflicted .
“ I was discussing the Democratic primary history , and in the course of that discussion mentioned the campaigns both my husband and Senator Kennedy waged in California in June in 1992 and 1968 , ” she said i
n **Brandon ** , South Dakota .
“ I was referencing those to make the point that we have had nomination primary contests that go into June .
That ’s a historic fact .
“ The Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Senator Kennedy .
I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation , particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive , I certainly had no intention of that whatsoever . ”
“ My view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to and I ’m honored to hold Senator Kennedy ’s seat in the United States Senate in the state of New York and have the highest regard for the entire Kennedy family .
Thanks .
Not a word about the inappropriateness of referencing assassination .
Not a word about the inappropriateness of implying — whether it was intended or not — that she was hanging around waiting for somebody to try something terrible .
Not a word about Senator Obama .
Not a word about Senator McCain .
Not : I ’m sorry …
Not : I apologize …
Not : I blew it …
Not : please forgive me .
God knows , Senator , in this campaign , this nation has ** had ** to forgive you , early and often …
And despite your now traditional position of the offended victim , the nation ** has ** forgiven you .
We have forgiven you your insistence that there have been widespread calls for you to end your campaign , when such calls had been few .
We have forgiven you your misspeaking about Martin Luther King ’s relative importance to the Civil Rights movement .
We have forgiven you your misspeaking about your under - fire landing in Bosnia .
We have forgiven you insisting Michigan ’s vote would n’t count and then claiming those who would not count it were Un - Democratic .
We have forgiven you pledging to not campaign in Florida and thus disenfranchise voters there , and then claim those who stuck to those rules were as wrong as those who defended slavery or denied women the vote .
We have forgiven you the photos of Osama Bin Laden in an anti-Obama ad …
We have forgiven you fawning over the fairness of Fox News while they were still calling you a murderer .
We have forgiven you accepting Richard Mellon Scaife ’s endorsement and then laughing as you described his “ deathbed conversion . ”
We have forgiven you quoting the electoral predictions of Boss Karl Rove .
We have forgiven you the 3 A - M Phone Call commercial .
We have forgiven you ** President ** Clinton ’s disparaging comparison of the Obama candidacy to Jesse Jackson’s .
We have forgiven you Geraldine Ferraro ’s national radio interview suggesting Obama would not still be in the race had he been a white man .
We have forgiven you the dozen changing metrics and the endless self - contradictions of your insistence that your nomination is mathematically probable rather than a statistical impossibility .
We have forgiven you your declaration of some primary states as counting and some as not .
We have forgiven you exploiting Jeremiah Wright in front of the editorial board of the lunatic - fringe Pittsburgh Tribune - Review .
We have forgiven you exploiting William Ayers in front of the debate on ABC .
We have forgiven you for boasting of your “ support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans ” …
We have even forgiven you repeatedly praising Senator McCain at Senator Obama ’s expense , and your ** own ** expense , and the Democratic ** ticket ’s ** expense .
But Senator , we can not forgive you this .
“ You know , my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ?
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . ”
We cannot forgive you this — not because it is crass and low and unfeeling and brutal .
** This ** is ** un**- forgivable , because this nation ’s deepest shame , its most enduring horror , its most terrifying legacy , is political assassination .
Lincoln .
Garfield .
McKinley .
Kennedy .
Malcolm X
Martin Luther King .
** Robert ** Kennedy .
And , but for the grace of the universe or the luck of the draw , Reagan , Ford , Truman , Nixon , Andrew Jackson , both Roosevelts , even George Wallace .
The politics of this nation is steeped enough in blood , Senator Clinton , you cannot and must not invoke that imagery !
Anywhere !
At any time !
And to not appreciate , immediately — to ** still * * not appreciate tonight — just ** what ** you have done … is to reveal an incomprehension of the America you seek to lead .
This , Senator , is too much .
Because a senator — a politician — a ** person ** — who can let hang in mid-air the prospect that she might just be sticking around in part , just in case the other guy gets shot — has no business being , and no capacity ** to** be , the President of the United States .
Good night and good luck .
Rove refuses to testify on role in prosecutor firings Nick Juliano

White House senior adviser Karl Rove has rebuked a Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena and will not appear Thursday to testify about his role in the firing of nine US Attorneys , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) said late Wednesday .
The Senate Judiciary chairman chided the White House for allowing Rove to give public speeches about the attorney firing scandal but not permit his testimony under oath .
" Mr. Rove has given reasons for the firings that have now been shown to be inaccurate after - the - fact fabrications , " Leahy said in a statement .
" Yet , he now refuses to tell this Committee the truth about his role in targeting well - respected U.S. Attorneys for firing and in seeking to cover up his role and that of his staff in the scandal . "
The House Judiciary Committee initiated criminal contempt of Congress charges against former White House counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton last month after they refused to comply with subpoenas demanding their testimony .
It remains unclear whether Rove will face similar charges .
A Judiciary Committee spokeswoman told RAW STORY Wednesday night that if Rove followed through in refusing to testify , the committee could decide to issue criminal charges later .
The aide said no decisions had been made yet .
 It is a shame that this White House continues to act as if it is above the law .
That is wrong , " Leahy said .
" The subpoenas authorized by this Committee in connection with its investigation into the mass firings of U.S. Attorneys and the corrosion of federal law enforcement by White House political influence deserve respect and compliance . "
Scott Jennings , the White House deputy director of political affairs , is expected to appear before the committee Thursday , but his testimony will be limited by Bush 's claim of executive privilege .
A letter to the Judiciary Committee from White House counsel Fred F. Fielding claimed Rove " is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure ( as an immediate presidential adviser ) and that relate to his official duties in that capacity . "
There have been a few discussions lately about how to do quick and easy typesafe extensible records in Haskell .
And there have been a number of discussions lately about extensions to do it more cleanly ( see , e.g. this one on haskell - cafe ) .
This came up on the channel the other day and somebody immediately suggested HList , which seems too heavyweight for this sort of thing to me .
HaskellDB , for example , also rolls its own fairly heavyweight new records system .
Anyway , in discussion , we cooked up an idea which Kamina , who originally asked the question , later implemented very cleanly .
The gist is that one defines a map of properties , and implements a typeclass for accessing them .
Subsequently , one defines a typeclass for each property , whose default methods know how to query them from the properties map .
Then , providing any data type with a new property is just a quick instance declaration away .
There ’s a slight messiness in that one needs to directly index properties by strings , or by a Property enumeration that ’s set in stone .
( One can actually index them by TypeReps using Typeable , but that ’s sort of messy . )
However , there ’s another issue as well — we want records extensible in two ways .
The typical way is just being able to reuse an accessor and setter function over multiple data types with the same property .
But we also want to be able to actually extend records with something like inheritance — i.e. to declare some records strict supersets of others .
The following solution , with generics , both solves that issue , and is significantly more lightweight , although it still requires mild boilerplate .
Additionally , while the former solution lets one “ break ” it by circumventing the typeclass - bound “ smart accessor ” functions and operating on the properties map directly , this solution can also be “ broken ” by giving it a bad instance declaration .
Both solutions , one should note , can easily be augmented with Template Haskell to reduce the boilerplate still further .
We start by realizing that rather than creating a properties map , it would be nice if we could walk directly over the data in our record and select something of the right type .
This , of course , is something that the Scrap Your Boilerplate generics library excels at .
In fact , it turns out we have the function we need right at our fingertips : gfindtype , which is of type ( Data x , Typeable y ) => x ->
Maybe y .
We ask it for a specific type , and if that type is an immediate subterm of x , then it returns it , otherwise it fails .
Now we need a modifier .
There is n’t one built in , but its simple enough to add one .
The type signature is immediately evident : greplace :: ( Data a , Typeable b ) => a -> b ->
Maybe a .
However , what to do with this type signature is a bit trickier .
Data .
Generics gives us gmapMo of type ( Data a , MonadPlus m ) => ( a -> m a ) -> a -> m a .
It traverses the immediate subterms of a type , and applies a transformation .
We build our traverser using `extM` which composes a chain of actions to try , matching from right to left the first with an appropriate type .
Our default action when nothing matches is to const Nothing ( i.e. , to leave the term unchanged ) .
When the term does match , we return just the term .
This gives us :
greplace x y = gmapMo ( const Nothing `extM` ( const ( Just y ) ) ) x
And indeed , this does what we want .
However , we do n’t have any type safety constraints yet .
Every query and update gives us a maybe , depending if it matches .
But we can combine this system with the typeclass constraints from the other system and get a very clean interface .
Assume we have properties of type Color and Size :
data Color = Red | Yellow | Green | Blue | White | Black deriving ( Show , Data , Typeable )
data Size = Size Int deriving ( Show , Data , Typeable )
Now we can just write :
class Data a =>
HasColor a where color :: a ->
Color color = fromJust .
gfindtype setColor :: a -> Color -> a setColor = ( fromJust . ) .
greplace
And for anything with a Color , e.g. , a car , we just can write instance HasColor Car .
Not too shabby !
However , as we ’ve written it , this only works for immediate subterms .
So , just like our old solution with an explicit properties map , we still ca n’t extend our records just by wrapping them as part of a larger record .
Luckily , the generics libraries make it trivial to do deep searches as well .
We can replace gfindnew with gfind = something ( const Nothing `extQ` Just ) .
This function is built much the same as our greplace was — yielding Just a value of the appropriate type , or Nothing otherwise .
The something combinator just maps our query function deeply over every term , from top to bottom , until it hits a match .
And as for greplace , we can just replace gmapMo with “ somewhere ” for a similar effect .
Now , if we have data DrivenCar = DrivenCar Person
Car we can give the appropriate instance declarations , and get and set the color of the car directly here as well .
One more problem though : the somewhere combinator will apply our transformation at least once — which means that it might apply it many multiple times , and even if it does n’t , it ’ll keep working ever after it succeeds .
This too is easy enough to fix .
Look at the source and we see that somewhere is just defined as f x `mplus` gmapMq ( somewhere f ) x .
So its trying the transform , and if the transform fails , its mapping the transform over all the immediate subterms , recursively .
All we have to do is write a function “ once ” that looks exactly the same , but with gmapMo instead of gmapMq , and we have what we really need .

PREFACE
In the early hours of March 3 , 1991 , a police chase in Los Angeles ended in an incident that would become synonymous with police brutality : the beating of a young man named Rodney King by members of the Los Angeles Police Department .
An amateur video , televised nationwide , showed King lying on the ground while three officers kicked him and struck him repeatedly with their nightsticks .
No one who viewed that beating will ever forget its viciousness .
The Rodney King incident projected the brutal reality of police abuse into living rooms across the nation , and for a while , the problem was front page news .
Political leaders condemned police use of excessive force and appointed special commissions to investigate incidents of brutality .
The media covered the issue extensively , calling particular attention to the fact that police abuse was not evenly distributed throughout American society , but disproportionately victimized people of color .
But six years later , police abuse is still very much an American problem , as the following examples from three recent months demonstrate :
In December 1996 , two men in two weeks died in handcuffs at the hands of the Palm Beach County sheriff 's deputies in Florida .
Lyndon Stark , 48 , died of asphyxia in a cloud of pepper spray while handcuffed behind the back in a prone position .
Several days earlier , Kevin Pruiksma , 27 , died after being restrained by a sheriff 's deputy .
In January 1997 , Kurt DeSilva , 34 , was shot and killed by a Pawtucket , Rhode Island police officer after a low - speed car chase .
DeSilva , who was unarmed , was suspected of driving a stolen car .
In February 1997 , James Wilson , 37 , an unarmed motorist , was kicked and punched by three Hartford , Connecticut police officers after a brief chase which ended in front of a Bloomfield , Connecticut police station .
The beating was so severe that a group of Bloomfield police intervened to stop it .
" They saw activity that appeared inappropriate , " the Bloomfield Police Chief stated .
" He did n't resist officers ...
He was struck . "
The fact that police abuse remains a significant problem does not mean there has been no progress .
In communities all across the United States people have organized to bring about change , and some of the most successful strategies are described in this manual , now in its 3rd printing .
This manual was not inspired by , nor is it intended to generate , animosity toward the police , or to promote the perception that all police officers are prone to abuse .
They are not .
Rather , it arose out of our realization that , ultimately , it will take a strong and sustained effort by community groups to bring about real and lasting reform .
And it is to those efforts that this manual is dedicated .

1. SOME OPERATING ASSUMPTIONS
THE BAD NEWS is ...
police abuse is a serious problem .
It has a long history , and it seems to defy all attempts at eradication .
The problem is national : no police department in the country is known to be completely free of misconduct .
Yet it must be fought locally : the nation 's 19,000 law enforcement agencies are essentially independent .
While some federal statutes specify criminal penalties for willful violations of civil rights and conspiracies to violate civil rights , the United States Department of Justice has been insufficiently aggressive in prosecuting cases of police abuse .
There are shortcomings , too , in federal law itself , which does not permit " pattern and practice " lawsuits .
The battle against police abuse must , therefore , be fought primarily on the local level .
THE GOOD NEWS is ...
the situation is not hopeless .
Policing has seen much progress .
Some reforms do work , and some types of abuse have been reduced .
Today , among both police officials and rank and file officers , it is widely recognized that police brutality hinders good law enforcement .
To fight police abuse effectively , you must have realistic expectations .
You must not expect too much of any one remedy because no single remedy will cure the problem .
A " mix " of reforms is required .
And even after citizen action has won reforms , your community must keep the pressure on through monitoring and oversight to ensure that the reforms are actually implemented .
Nonetheless , even one person , or a small group of persistent people , can make a big difference .
Sometimes outmoded and abusive police practices prevail largely because no one has ever questioned them .
In such cases , the simple act of spotlighting a problem can have a powerful effect that leads to reform .
Just by raising questions , one person or a few people — who need not be experts — can open up some corner of the all - too - secretive and insular world of policing to public scrutiny .
Depending on what is revealed , their inquiries can snowball into a full blown examination by the media , the public and politicians .
2. GETTING STARTED — IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM
You 've got to address specific problems .
The first step , then , is to identify exactly what the police problems are in your city .
What 's wrong with your police department is not necessarily the same as what 's wrong in that of another city .
Police departments differ in size , quality of management , local traditions and the severity of their problems .
Some departments are gravely corrupt ; others are relatively " clean " but have poor relations with community residents .
Also , a city 's political environment , which affects both how the police operate and the possibilites for achieving reform , is different in every city .
For example , it is often easier to reform police procedures in cities that have a tradition of " good government , " or in cities where racial minorities are well organized politically .
The range of police problems includes —
1 ) Excessive use of deadly force .
2) Excessive use of physical force .
3 ) Discriminatory patterns of arrest .
4 ) Patterns of harassment of the homeless , youth , racial minorities and gays , including aggressive and discriminatory use of the " stop - and - frisk " and overly harsh enforcement of petty offenses .
5 ) Chronic verbal abuse of citizens , including racist , sexist and homophobic slurs .
6 ) Discriminatory non-enforcement of the law , such as the failure to respond quickly to calls in low - income areas and half - hearted investigations of domestic violence , rape or hate crimes .
7 ) Spying on political activists .
8 ) Employment discrimination — in hiring , promotion and assignments , and internal harassment of minority , women and gay or lesbian police personnel .
9 ) The " code of silence " and retaliation against officers who report abuse and / or support reforms .
10 ) Overreaction to gang problems , which is driven by the assumption that those who associate with known gang members must be involved in criminal activity , even in the absence of concrete evidence that this is the case .
This includes illegal mass stops and arrests , and demanding photo IDs from young men based on their race and dress instead of on their criminal conduct .
11 ) The " war on drugs , " with its overbroad searches and other tactics that endanger innocent bystanders .
This " war " wastes scarce resources on unproductive " buy and bust " operations to the neglect of more promising community - based approaches .
12 ) Lack of accountability , such as the failure to discipline or prosecute abusive officers , and the failure to deter abuse by denying promotions and / or particular assignments because of prior abusive behavior .
13 ) Crowd control tactics that infringe on free expression rights and lead to unnecessary use of physical force .
HOW MUCH BRUTALITY ?
How common is police brutality ?
Unfortunately , measuring this problem in a scientific fashion has always been very difficult .
In the first systematic study , The Police and the Public ( 1971 ) , Albert Reiss found the overall rate of unwarranted force to be low — only about one percent of all encounters with citizens ; even less than that by another calculation .
But Reiss hastened to point out that individual incidents accumulate over time , and since poor men are the most frequent victims of police abuse , they experience both real and perceived harassment by the police .
In 1982 , the federal government funded a " Police Services Study , " in which 12,022 randomly selected citizens were interviewed in three metropolitan areas .
The study found that 13.6 percent of those surveyed had cause to complain about police service in the previous year ( this included verbal abuse and discourtesy , as well as physical force ) .
Yet , only 30 percent of the people filed formal complaints .
In other words , most instances of police abuse go unreported .
Community activists , take note :
Your local police department or local news media may produce official figures showing a low rate of alleged abuse , but those figures do not reflect unreported incidents .
Moreover , a low overall rate masks the higher rate of abuse suffered by poor men — poor men of color in particular .
3. GATHER THE FACTS
Obtaining the most relevant information on the activities of your police department can be a tough task .
That 's the first thing to bear in mind about the " homework " community residents have to do in order to build a strong case for reform .
In answer to critics , police chiefs often cite various official data to support their claim that they are really doing a great job .
" Look at the crime rate , " they say .
" It 's lower than in other cities . "
Or : " My department 's arrest rate is much higher than elsewhere . "
The catch is that these data , though readily available to citizens , are deeply flawed , while the most important information is not always easy to get .
Forget the " crime rate . "
The " crime rate " figures cited by government officials are based on the FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports ( UCR ) system , which has several serious flaws .
To name only a few : First , the UCR only measures reported crime .
Second , since the system is not independently audited there are no meaningful controls over how police departments use their crime data .
Police officers can and do " unfound " crimes , meaning they decide that no crime occurred .
They also " downgrade " crimes — for example , by officially classifying a rape as an assault .
Third , reports can get " lost , " either deliberately or inadvertently .
There are many other technical problems that make the UCR a dubious measure of the extent of crime problems .
The National Crime Survey ( NCS ) , published by another part of the U.S. Justice Department , provides a far more accurate estimate of the national crime rate and of long - term trends in crime .
But it is a national - level estimate and does not provide data on individual cities .
So the NCS is n't much help on the local level .
Forget the " clearance rate . "
A police department 's official data on its " clearance rate , " which refers to the percentage of crimes solved , do not accurately reflect that department 's performance .
The fact that one department " clears " 40 percent of all robberies , compared with 25 percent by another department , does n't necessarily mean it is more effective .
There are too many ways to manipulate the data , either by claiming a larger number of crimes " cleared " ( inflating the numerator ) , or by artificially lowering the number of reported crimes ( lowering the denominator ) .
Forget the arrest rate .
Police officers have broad discretion in making and recording arrests .
The Police Foundation in Washington , D.C. , which conducts research on policing issues , has found great variations among police departments in their recording of arrests .
In many departments , police officers take people into custody , hold them at the station , question and then release them without filling out an arrest report .
For all practical purposes , these people were arrested , but their arrests do n't show up in the official data .
Other departments record such arrests .
Thus , the department that reports a lower number of arrests may actually be taking more people into custody than the department that reports more arrests .
Forget the citizen complaint rate .
Official data on the complaints filed by citizens regarding police conduct are important but present a number of problems .
Many departments do not release any information on this subject .
Some publish a smattering of information on complaints and the percentage of complaints sustained by the department .
In more and more cities , a civilian review agency publishes this data .
Data on citizen complaints are difficult to interpret .
Some examples —
In 1990 , it was widely reported that San Francisco , with less than 2,000 police officers , had more citizen complaints than Los Angeles , which has more than 8,000 officers .
What that may mean , however , is that Los Angeles residents are afraid to file reports or do n't believe it would do any good .
San Francisco has a relatively independent civilian review process , which may encourage the filing of more complaints .
Also in 1990 , New York City reported a decline from previous years in the number of citizen complaints filed .
But many analysts believe that simply reflected New Yorkers ' widespread disillusionment with their civilian review board .
Citizen complaints filed in Omaha , Nebraska doubled after the mayor allowed people to file their complaints at City Hall , as well as at the police department .
Another problem is that in some police departments with internal affairs systems , officers often try to dissuade people from filing formal complaints that will later become part of an officer 's file .
And the number of complaints counted is also affected by whether or not the internal affairs system accepts anonymous complaints and complaints by phone or mail , or requires in - person , sworn statements .
Thus , the official " complaint rate " ( complaints per 1,000 citizens ) , rather than being a reliable measure of police performance , more than likely reflects the administrative customs of a particular police department .
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW , AND WHY
A. Police shootings .
You need to know about police firearm discharges , which refer to the number of times a police weapon has been fired .
This information is more complete than statistics on the number of persons shot and wounded or killed .
( However , information on the race of persons shot and wounded or killed is important . )
Particularly important is data on repeat shooters , which can tell you whether some officers fire their weapons at a suspiciously high rate .
POLICE SHOOTINGS — A CLOSER LOOK
Do some officers shoot more often than others ?
Do white officers shoot more often that black officers ?
Do young officers shoot more often than veteran officers ?
The most detailed analysis of police shootings was produced by James Fyfe , a former police officer who is now a criminologist and expert on police practices .
He concluded that the single most important factor determining patterns of shooting is place of assignment .
Fyfe 's findings showed that : Black and white officers assigned to similar precincts fired their weapons at essentially the same rate ; since new officers are assigned to less desirable , high crime precincts based on the seniority system , younger officers shoot more often than older officers ; and since a disproportionate number of black officers are young due to recent affirmative action programs , black officers shoot more often than white officers — but as a function of assignment , not race .
Fyfe found significant differences in shooting patterns between police departments .
The overall shooting rate in some departments was significantly higher than in others , a disparity that he attributed to differences in department policy .
SOURCE : James J. Fyfe , " Who Shoots ? - - A Look At Officer , Race And Police Shooting . "
Journal of Police Science And Administration ; Volume 9 , December 1981 ; pp. 367-382 .
With this information , you can evaluate the use of deadly force in your department .
You can also evaluate the long - term trends in shootings .
Are shootings increasing or decreasing ?
Has there been a recent upsurge ?
How does the department compare with other departments — are officers shooting at a significantly higher rate in your department than elsewhere ?
B. Use of physical force .
You need to know how frequently police officers in your city use physical force in the day - to - day course of their encounters with citizens .
Do officers try to refrain from using such force against citizens , or do they quickly and casually resort to force ?
In its report on the Los Angeles Police Department in the aftermath of the March 1991 beating of Rodney King , the Christopher Commission confirmed a long held suspicion : A small number of officers were involved in an extraordinarily high percentage of use - of - force incidents .
Ten percent of the officers accounted for 33.2 percent of all use - of - force incidents .
The Commission was able to identify 44 such officers who were not disciplined despite the fact that they were the subjects of numerous citizen complaints .
In 1981 , the U.S. Civil Rights Commission found a similar pattern in Houston and recommended , as a remedy , that police departments establish " early warning systems " to identify officers with high rates of citizen complaints .
Patterns in the use of physical force reveal a lot about the " culture " of a particular police department .
Clearly , a department whose officers repeatedly engage in physically coercive conduct needs reform .
Police officials often deny that their personnel are prone to using force inappropriately , so if your community believes it has a problem in this area citizens must be able to support their claims with existing data , or data they have gathered themselves .
C. Official policies .
You need to know what your local police department 's formal , written policies are on how officers are supposed to behave in particular situations .
How does the department treat domestic violence complaints ?
What is the policy on how officers are supposed to deal with homeless people ?
Does the department use canine patrols and , if so , under what circumstances ?
In examining official policies , you need to evaluate them in comparison to recommended standards .
D. Lawsuits .
You need to know how many lawsuits citizens have filed against your local police department .
You 'll want to know what the charges were , the number of officers involved , whether certain officers are named repeatedly in suits , what was the outcome and , in the case of successful suits , how much the city paid in damages .
The number of lawsuits filed against a police department can be very revealing .
For example , according to the Christopher Commission the taxpayers of Los Angeles spent $ 67.5 million between 1991 and 1995 to resolve lawsuits brought by victims of police abuse .
In 1990 alone , New York City paid victims of police misconduct a record high of more than $ 13 million .
This kind of information can be used to mobilize middle - class taxpayers and " good - government " activists , who can then be brought into a community coalition against police abuse .
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN POLICE SHOOTINGS
These data indicate a clear pattern of racial discrimination .
The disparity between whites and blacks shot and killed is extreme in the category of persons " unarmed and not assaultive . "
POLICE SHOOTINGS IN MEMPHIS 1969 - 1974 Person Shot and Killed Number Shot and Killed White Black Armed and Assaultive 5 7 Unarmed and Assaultive 2 6 Unarmed and Not Assaultive 1 13
These are classic " fleeing felon " situations in which , prior to 1985 , Memphis Police Department policy and the common law of many states permitted officers to use deadly force .
In 1985 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for a police officer to shoot a suspected felon in flight who does not pose an immediate danger to the officer or public .
The case — Tennessee v. Garner — involved Edward Garner , a 15 year - old black youth who , though unarmed , was shot and killed while trying to flee the scene of a suspected burglary .
SOURCE : James J. Fyfe , " Blind Justice : Police Shootings in Memphis , " Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , 73 ( 1982 , No. 2 ) ; pp. 707-722 .
E. Minority employment .
You 'll need to know how many African Americans , Latinos , Asians , other minorities and women are employed by your police department and their distribution throughout the department 's ranks .
This information is useful in assessing , again , the " culture " of your local police department — is it internally diverse , fair and equitable ?
It also suggests how much value the department places on the " human relations " aspects of its work , and how responsive it is to community concerns .
WHERE TO GET INFORMATION , AND HOW
Police business is generally shrouded in secrecy , which conceals outdated policies and departmental inertia , encourages cover-ups and , of course , breeds public suspicion .
But remember : Police departments are an arm of government , and the government 's business is your business .
Police policies , procedures , memoranda , records , reports , tape recordings , etc. should not be withheld from public view unless their release would threaten ongoing investigations , endanger officers or others , or invade someone 's personal privacy .
Demanding information about police practices is an important part of the struggle to establish police accountability .
Indeed , a campaign focused solely on getting information from the police can serve as a vehicle for organizing a community to tackle police abuse .
Regarding all of the following categories , one of the tactics your community could employ is to interest a local investigative journalist in seeking information from the police for a series of articles .
Once in hand , the information your community has collected or helped to expose is a tool for holding the police accountable for their actions .
ON DRUGS , GANGS AND POLICE OFFICER SAFETY
Police work remains dangerous , and many police officers contend that they need greater freedom to use deadly force today because of the increase in heavily armed drug gangs .
But in fact , police work is much less dangerous than it used to be .
The number of officers killed in the line of duty is half of what it was nearly 20 years ago .
According to the FBI , the number of officers killed dropped from 134 in 1973 to 67 in 1990 .
That reduced death rate is even more dramatic considering the increase in the number of police officers on duty in the field .
Police officers are rarely the victims of " drive - by " gang shootings .
Innocent by - standers and rival gang members have been the victims .
The police do n't need more firepower .
A. Police Shootings .
Virtually every big city police department has this information on hand , since officers are required to file a report after every firearms discharge .
However , departments do n't usually release the information voluntarily .
Strong civilian review boards in a few cities now publish the information .
As for repeat shooters , this information exists in police reports , but police departments vigorously resist identifying repeat shooters .
There are several ways to proceed —
As an organizing strategy , demand that the police department publish this data , identify repeat shooters and take appropriate remedial action ( counseling , retraining , formal discipline , transfer , etc . )
Alternatively , since it is n't essential that officers be identified by name , demand that they be identified simply by a code number , which can focus public attention on the problem of excessive shooters .
Visit your local civilian review agency , if one exists .
These agencies often have the authority to collect and release a range of information about local police conduct .
B. Physical Force .
There are three potential sources of data on police use of physical force —
Data developed by community residents .
Community residents can make a significant contribution to documenting physical force abuses and , in the process , organize .
They can bear witness to , and record , abuse incidents , take information from others who have witnessed incidents , refute police department arguments that there is no problem and help document the inadequacies of the police department 's official complaint review process .
Police Watch in Los Angeles compiles such data .
Police Watch can be contacted at 611 South Catalina , Suite 409 , Los Angeles , CA 90005 ; ( 213 ) 387-3325 .
Check with your local ACLU to see if an organization in your community does the same .

Formal complaints filed by citizens .
Most police departments do not make this information public .
Some publish summary data in their annual report , so consult that document .
In a number of cities , civilian review agencies publish it , so check with that agency in your city .
The annual reports of the New York City Citizen Complaint Review Board ( CCRB ) and San Francisco 's Office of Citizen Complaints ( OCC ) provide fairly detailed summaries .

The annual reports of the New York City Citizen Complaint Review Board ( CCRB ) and San Francisco 's Office of Citizen Complaints ( OCC ) provide fairly detailed summaries .
Internal police reports .
An increasing number of police departments require officers to fill out reports after any use of physical force .
This is a larger set of data than the citizen complaints would provide , since many citizens do n't file complaints even when they have cause to do so .
Ask to see physical force reports .
C. Official Policies .
Your police department has a Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) manual ( it may have another title ) that contains the official policies of the department .
The SOP manual is a public document and should be readily available .
Some departments place current copies in local libraries .
Others treat it as an internal document not available to the public — a practice which is unacceptable .
Demand to see the manual , if your department withholds it .
As a last resort , you may be able to file suit under your state 's open records law to obtain the SOP manual .
D. Lawsuits .
Lawsuits brought against police departments are matters of public record .
Records of suits brought in state courts reside at your local state courthouse ; of suits brought in federal district court , at the nearest federal courthouse .
The Lexis computer database is a source of published opinions in civilian suits brought against the police .
However , collecting information from any of these sources is a very laborious task .
It 's better to contact your local ACLU affiliate and / or other relevant public interest groups , which may have done most of the work for you .
In the back of this manual , find the name and address of your local ACLU and other organizations .
E. Minority Employment .
Official data on this issue are generally available from your local police department .
If the police stonewall , you can get the information from the city 's personnel division .
The point is to evaluate the police department 's minority employment record relative to local conditions .
Using current data , compare the percentage of a particular group of people in the local population with that group 's representation on the police force .
If , for example , Latinos are 30 percent of the population but only 15 percent of the sworn officers , then your police department is only half way toward achieving an ideal level of diversity .
4. CONTROLLING THE POLICE — COMMUNITY GOALS
GOAL # 1 — A CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD
Civilian review of police activity was first proposed in the 1950s because of widespread dissatisfaction with the internal disciplinary procedures of police departments .
Many citizens did n't believe that police officials took their complaints seriously .
They suspected officials of investigating allegations of abuse superficially at best , and of covering up misconduct .
The theory underlying the concept of civilian review is that civilian investigations of citizen complaints are more independent because they are conducted by people who are not sworn officers .
At first , civilian review was a dream few thought would ever be fulfilled .
But slow , steady progress has been made , indicating that it's an idea whose time has come .
By the end of 1997 , more than 75 percent of the nation 's largest cities ( more than 80 cities across the country ) had civilian review systems .
Civilian review advocates in every city have had to overcome substantial resistance from local police departments .
One veteran of the struggle for civilian review has chronicled the stages of police opposition as follows —
The " over our dead bodies " stage , during which the police proclaim that they will never accept any type of civilian oversight under any circumstances ;
during which the police proclaim that they will never accept any type of civilian oversight under any circumstances ;
The " magical conversion " stage , when it becomes politically inevitable that civilian review will be adopted .
At this point , former police opponents suddenly become civilian review experts and propose the weakest possible models ;
when it becomes politically inevitable that civilian review will be adopted .
At this point , former police opponents suddenly become civilian review experts and propose the weakest possible models ;
The " post - partum resistance " stage , when the newly established civilian review board must fight police opposition to its budget , authority , access to information , etc .
Strong community advocacy is necessary to overcome resistance , even after civilian review is established .
WHAT IS CIVILIAN REVIEW ?
Civilian review systems create a lot a confusion because they vary tremendously .
Some are more " civilian " than others .
Some are not boards but municipal agencies headed by an executive director ( who has been appointed by , and is accountable to , the mayor ) .
The three basic types of civilian review systems are —
Type I. Persons who are not sworn officers conduct the initial fact - finding .
They submit an investigative report to a non -officer or board of non-officers , who then make a recommendation for action to the police chief .
This process is the most independent and most " civilian . "
They submit an investigative report to a non -officer or board of non-officers , who then make a recommendation for action to the police chief .

Type II .
Sworn officers conduct the initial fact - finding .
They submit an investigative report to a non -officer or board of non-officers for a recommendation .
They submit an investigative report to a non -officer or board of non-officers for a recommendation .
Type III .
Sworn officers conduct the initial fact - finding and make a recommendation to the police chief .
If the aggrieved citizen is not satisfied with the chief 's action on the complaint , he or she may appeal to a board that includes non-officers .
Obviously , this process is the least independent .
Although the above are the most common , other types of civilian review systems also exist .
WHY IS CIVILIAN REVIEW IMPORTANT ?
Civilian review establishes the principle of police accountability .
Strong evidence exists to show that a complaint review system encourages citizens to act on their grievances .
Even a weak civilian review process is far better than none at all .

Even a weak civilian review process is far better than none at all .
A civilian review agency can be an important source of information about police misconduct .
A civilian agency is more likely to compile and publish data on patterns of misconduct , especially on officers with chronic problems , than is a police internal affairs agency .

Civilian review can alert police administrators to the steps they must take to curb abuse in their departments .
Many well - intentioned police officials have failed to act decisively against police brutality because internal investigations did n't provide them with the facts .
TEN PRINCIPLES FOR AN EFFECTIVE CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD Independence .
The power to conduct hearings , subpoena witnesses and report findings and recommendations to the public .
Investigatory Power .
The authority to independently investigate incidents and issue findings on complaints .
Mandatory Police Cooperation .
Complete access to police witnesses and documents through legal mandate or subpoena power .
Adequate Funding .
Should not be a lower budget priority than police internal affairs systems .
Hearings .
Essential for solving credibility questions and enhancing public confidence in process .
Reflect Community Diversity .
Board and staff should be broadly representative of the community it serves .
Policy Recommendations .
Civilian oversight can spot problem policies and provide a forum for developing reforms .
Statistical Analysis .
Public statistical reports can detail trends in allegations , and early warning systems can identify officers who are subjects of unusually numerous complaints .
Separate Offices .
Should be housed away from police headquarters to maintain independence and credibility with public .
Disciplinary Role .
Board findings should be considered in determining appropriate disciplinary action .
The existence of a civilian review agency , a reform in itself , can help ensure that other needed reforms are implemented .
A police department can formulate model policies aimed at deterring and punishing misconduct , but those policies will be meaningless unless a system is in place to guarantee that the policies are aggressively enforced .
A police department can formulate model policies aimed at deterring and punishing misconduct , but those policies will be meaningless unless a system is in place to guarantee that the policies are aggressively enforced .
Civilian review works , if only because it's at least a vast improvement over the police policing themselves .
Nearly all existing civilian review systems — reduce public reluctance to file complaints reduce procedural barriers to filing complaints enhance the likelihood that statistical reporting on complaints will be more complete enhance the likelihood of an independent review of abuse allegations foster confidence in complainants that they will get their " day in court " through the hearing process increase scrutiny of police policies that lead to citizen complaints increase opportunities for other reform efforts .
Nearly all existing civilian review systems —
A campaign to establish a civilian review agency , or to strengthen an already existing agency , is an excellent vehicle for community organizing .
In Indianapolis , for example , a civilian review campaign brought about not only the establishment of a civilian review agency , but an effective coalition between the Indiana ACLU , the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) and other community groups that could take future action on other issues .
Your community 's campaign should seek a strong , fully - independent and accessible civilian review system .
But even with a weak system , you can press for changes to make it more independent and effective .
GOAL # 2 — CONTROL OF POLICE SHOOTINGS
Considerable progress has been made in the area of police misconduct in the use of deadly force .
Although the rate of deadly force abuse is still intolerably high , national data reveal reductions in the number of persons shot and killed by the police since the mid-1970s — as much as 35 - to 40 percent in our 50 largest cities .
This has been accompanied by a significant reduction in the racial disparities among persons shot and killed : since the 1970s , from about six people of color to one white person , down to three people of color to one white .
This progress serves as a model for controlling other forms of police behavior .
And was achieved though hard work and perseverance .
In the mid-1970s , police departments began developing restrictive internal policies on the use of deadly force .
They adopted the " defense of life " standard : the use of deadly force only when the life of an officer or some other person is in danger .
In 1985 , the Supreme Court finally upheld this standard in the case of Tennessee v. Garner ( see table ) .
However , the majority of policies adopted by police departments go beyond the Court 's Garner decision , prohibiting warning shots , shots to wound and other reckless actions .
Most important , these policies require officers to file written reports after each firearm discharge , and require that those reports be reviewed by higher - ranking officers .
To meet goal # 2 , your community must —
Ensure that the police department has a highly restrictive deadly force policy ( see sample policy ) .
Most big city departments do .
But the national trend data on shootings suggest that medium - sized and small departments have not caught up with the big cities , so much remains to be done there .
Much remains to be done as well in county sheriff and state police agencies , which have not been subject to the same scrutiny as big city police departments .
Ensure enforcement of the deadly force policy through community monitoring .
To be accountable , the police department and / or the local civilian review agency should publish summary data on shooting incidents .
Citizens should also be able to find out whether the department disciplines officers who violate its policy , and whether certain officers are repeatedly involved in questionable incidents .
THE HOUSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT'S DEADLY FORCE POLICY ( 1987 ) POLICY —
The Houston Police Department places its highest value on the life and safety of its officers and the public .
The department 's policies , rules and procedures are designed to ensure that this value guides police officers ' use of firearms .
RULES —
The policy stated above is the basis of the following set of rules that have been designed to guide officers in all cases involving the use of firearms – RULE 1 — Police officers shall not discharge their firearms except to protect themselves or another person from imminent death or serious bodily injury .
RULE 2 — Police officers shall discharge their firearms only when doing so will not endanger innocent persons .
RULE 3 — Police officers shall not discharge their firearms to threaten or subdue persons whose actions are destructive to property or injurious to themselves but which do not represent an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or others .
RULE 4 — Police officers shall not discharge their firearms to subdue an escaping suspect who presents no imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury .
RULE 5 — Police officers shall not discharge their weapons at a moving vehicle unless it is absolutely necessary to do so to protect against an imminent threat to the life of the officer or others .
RULE 6 — Police officers when confronting an oncoming vehicle shall attempt to move out of the path , if possible , rather than discharge their firearms at the oncoming vehicle .
RULE 7 — Police officers shall not intentionally place themselves in the path of an oncoming vehicle and attempt to disable the vehicle by discharging their firearms .
RULE 8 — Police officers shall not discharge their firearms at a fleeing vehicle or its driver .
RULE 9 — Police officers shall not fire warning shots .
RULE 10 — Police officers shall not draw or display their firearms unless there is a threat or probable cause to believe there is a threat to life , or for inspection .
The citizens of Houston have vested in their police officers the power to carry and use firearms in the exercise of their service to society .
This power is based on trust and , therefore , must be balanced by a system of accountability .
The serious consequences of the use of firearms by police officers necessitate the specification of limits for officers ' discretion ; there is often no appeal from an officer 's decision to use a firearm .
Therefore , it is imperative that every effort be made to ensure that such use is not only legally warranted but also rational and humane .
The basic responsibility of police officers to protect life also requires that they exhaust all other reasonable means for apprehension and control before resorting to the use of firearms .
Police officers are equipped with firearms as a means of last resort to protect themselves and others from the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury .
Even though all officers must be prepared to use their firearms when necessary , the utmost restraint must be exercised in their use .
Consequently , no officer will be disciplined for discharging a firearm in self - defense or in defense of another when faced with a situation that immediately threatens life or serious bodily injury .
Just as important , no officer will be disciplined for not discharging a firearm if that discharge might threaten the life or safety of an innocent person , or if the discharge is not clearly warranted by the policy and rules of the department .
Above all , this department values the safety of its employees and the public .
Likewise it believes that police officers should use firearms with a high degree of restraint .
Officers ' use of firearms , therefore , shall never be considered routine and is permissible only in defense of life and then only after all alternative means have been exhausted .
GOAL # 3 — REDUCE POLICE BRUTALITY
Your community 's principal aim here should be to get the police department to adopt and enforce a written policy governing the use of physical force .
This policy should have two parts —
It should explicitly restrict physical force to the narrowest possible range of specific situations .
For example , a policy on the use of batons should forbid police officers from striking citizens in " non-target " areas , such as the head and spine , where permanent injuries can result .
Mace should be used defensively , not offensively .
The use of electronic stun guns should be strictly controlled and reviewed , since they have great potential for abuse because they do n't leave scars or bruises .
The policy should require that a police officer file a written report after any use of physical force , and that report should be automatically reviewed by high ranking officers .
Your community 's second objective should be to get the police department to establish an early warning system to identify officers who are involved in an inordinate number of inappropriate physical force incidents .
The incidents should then be investigated and , if verified , the officers involved should be charged , disciplined , transferred , retrained or offered counseling , depending on the severity of their misconduct .
The Christopher Commission 's report on the Rodney King beating ascertained that L.A. police leadership typically looked the other way when officers were involved in questionable incidents , a tolerance of brutality that helped create an atmosphere conducive to police abuses .
GOAL # 4 — END POLICE SPYING
Police spying or intelligence gathering on legal but politically unpopular activities is a problem .
And it 's particularly difficult to deal with because spying , by definition , is a covert activity , unknown to either the victim or other witnesses .
During the 1970s , the ACLU and other organizations brought lawsuits against unconstitutional police surveillance in several cities around the country , including New York City , Chicago , Memphis and Los Angeles .
The result was increased controls on police spying .
In 1976 , Seattle residents discovered local police were spying on organizations of black construction workers , local Republican Party operatives , Native Americans , advocates for low - income housing and other activists whose conduct was perfectly lawful .
In response to the revelations , the ACLU , along with the American Friends Service Committee and the National Lawyers Guild , formed the Coalition on Government Spying .
After several years of hard work and lobbying , the coalition succeeded in bringing about passage of a comprehensive municipal law — the first of its kind in the country — that governs all police investigations and restricts the collection of political , religious and sexual information .
Called the Seattle Police Intelligence Ordinance , this law is a model for responsible police intelligence operations —
" Restricted " information ( i.e. , about religious , political or sexual activity ) can be collected only if a person is reasonably suspected of having committed a crime , and the information must be relevant to that crime .
An independent civilian " auditor , " appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council , must review all police authorizations to collect restricted information and have access to all other police files .
The auditor must notify the police officers who are the subjects of the unlawful investigations if violations are found .
Any individual subjected to unlawful surveillance can bring a civil action in court to stop the surveillance , and to collect damages from the city .
GOAL # 5 — OVERSIGHT OF POLICE POLICY
Police policies should be subject to public review and debate instead of being viewed as the sole province of police insiders .
Open policy - making not only allows police officials to benefit from community input , but it also provides an opportunity for police officials to explain to the public why certain tactics or procedures may be necessary .
This kind of communication can help anticipate problems and avert crises before they occur .
The Police Review Commission ( a civilian review body ) of Berkeley , California , holds regular , bi-monthly meetings that are open to the public where representatives of community organizations can voice criticisms , make proposals and introduce resolutions to review or reform specific police policies .
The Police Practices Project of the ACLU of Northern California successfully pressured the San Francisco Police Department to adopt enlightened policies regarding the treatment of the homeless ; the use of pain - holds and batons ; the deployment of plainclothes officers at protests and demonstrations ; intelligence gathering ; the selection of field training officers , and AIDS / HIV education for police officers .
The Project has also prevented the adoption of an anti-loitering rule , a policy that would have made demonstrators financially liable for police costs , and other bad policies .
In Tucson , Arizona , a Citizens ' Police Advisory Committee was incorporated into the city 's municipal code in July 1990 .
Composed of both civilian and police representatives , it has the authority to initiate investigations of controversial incidents or questionable policies , and other oversight functions .
CITIZEN -POLICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TUCSON , ARIZONA
( Created by the Tucson Code , Sec. 10A - 86 ) FUNCTIONS — 1 — Consult with the governing body from time to time as may be required by the Mayor and [ City ] Council .
2 — Assist the police in achieving a greater understanding of the nature and causes of complex community problems in the area of human relations , with special emphasis on the advancement and improvement of relations between police and community minority groups .
3 — Study , examine and recommend methods , approaches and techniques to encourage and develop an active citizen - police partnership in the prevention of crime .
4 — Promote cooperative citizen - police programs and approaches to the solutions of community crime problems , emphasizing the principal that the administration of justice is a responsibility which requires total community involvement .
5 — Recommend procedures , programs and / or legislation to enhance cooperation among citizens of the community and police .
6 — Strive to strengthen and ensure throughout the community the application of the principle of equal protection under the law for all persons .
7 — Consult and cooperate with federal , state , city and other public agencies , commissions and committees on matters within the committee 's charge .
8 — The committee may ask for and shall receive from the Police Department , a review of action taken by the Department in incidents which create community concern or controversy .
9 — The committee shall have the authority , should it so desire , to use a specific incident as a vehicle for the examination of police policies , procedures and priorities .
10 — At the discretion and express direction of the Mayor and Council , assume and undertake such other tasks or duties as will facilitate the accomplishment of these goals and objectives .
GOAL # 6 — IMPROVED TRAINING
Citizens ' groups in some communities have historically demanded more education and training for police officers as part of their efforts to solve the problem of police abuse .
But today , this seems a less crucial issue in many police departments because the educational levels of American police officers have risen dramatically in recent years .
In 1970 , only 3.7 percent of the nation 's police officers had four or more years of college .
By 1989 that figure had risen to 22.6 percent , and a whopping 65 percent had at least some college experience .
The levels of education are highest among new recruits , who in many departments have about two years of college .
The training of police personnel has also improved significantly in recent years .
The average length of police academy programs has more than doubled , from about 300 to over 600 hours ; in some cities , 900 or even 1200 hours are the rule .
As the time devoted to training has increased , the academies have added a number of important subjects to their curricula : race relations , domestic violence , handling the mentally ill , and so on .
Unquestionably , a rigorously trained , professional police force is a desirable goal that should be pursued depending on local conditions .
If citizens in your community feel that this is an important issue —
You should aim for a first - rate police academy curriculum .
The curriculum should be near the high end of the current scale — 800 hours or more .
It should include a mix of classroom and supervised field training .
The curriculum should be near the high end of the current scale — 800 hours or more .
It should include a mix of classroom and supervised field training .
It should include training in violence reduction techniques .
In addition to being given weapons and taught how to use them , police recruits should also learn special skills — especially communications skills — to help them defuse and avert situations that might lead to the necessary use of force .
In addition to being given weapons and taught how to use them , police recruits should also learn special skills — especially communications skills — to help them defuse and avert situations that might lead to the necessary use of force .
It should include community sensitivity training .
Training recruits to handle issues of special significance in particular communities can lead to a reduction in community - police tensions .
In the early 1990s , the ACLU of Georgia , after a series of incidents occurred in Atlanta involving police harassment of gays , helped provide regular training at the local police academy to sensitize new recruits on gay and lesbian concerns .
During the same period , the Police Practices Project of the ACLU of Northern California , working with other groups , organized a group of homeless people to create a video for use in sensitivity training at the San Francisco police academy .
In response to complaints that state police were harassing minority motorists and entrapping gay men during an undercover operation in the men's room of a highway service area , in the late 1980s the ACLU of New Jersey joined the NAACP and the Lesbian and Gay Coalition in initiating a series of meetings with the new superintendent of the Division of State Police .
The three groups now participate in a two - day seminar on " Cultural Diversity and Professionalism " introduced by the superintendent 's office .
Attendance is required by all employees of the Division .
Training recruits to handle issues of special significance in particular communities can lead to a reduction in community - police tensions .
Unfortunately , even the most enlightened training programs can be undermined by veteran officers , who traditionally tell recruits out in the field to " forget all that crap they taught you in the academy . "
In San Francisco some years ago , men selected as field training officers ( FTOs ) were found to have some of the worst complaint and litigation records in the department .
The evaluation scores they gave recruits revealed their systematic attempts to weed out minority and women officers .
They labeled women recruits " bad drivers , " gave Asians low scores in radio communication and unfairly criticized African Americans for their report - writing .
The Northern California ACLU 's Police Practices Project joined other community groups in successfully pressuring the police department to adopt stricter selection criteria for FTOs to ensure greater racial and gender integration , fairer evaluations of recruits and higher quality training .
GOAL # 7 — EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
Historically , police departments , like other government agencies , have engaged in employment discrimination .
People of color have been grossly underrepresented , and women were not even accepted as full - fledged officers until the 1970s .
Some progress has been made in the last 20 years or so .
Police departments in several cities now have significant numbers of officers who are people of color .
A few departments even approach the theoretically ideal level of maintaining forces that reflect the racial composition of the communities they serve .
Most departments now recruit and assign women on an equal basis with men .
Improvements in police employment practices have come about largely as the result of litigation under existing civil rights laws .
However , the courts may not be hospitable to employment discrimination claims in the future .
Therefore , community groups and civil rights organizations should prepare to fight in the political arena for the integration of police departments .
In the short term , the recruitment of more women and minority officers may not result in less police abuse .
Several social science studies suggest that minority and white officers do not differ greatly in their use of physical or deadly force , or in their arrest practices .
( Female officers , on the other hand , are involved in citizen complaints at about half the rate of male officers , according to the New York City CCRB . )
Still , in the long term , an integrated police force is a very important goal for these reasons —
Integration will break down the isolation of police departments , as they reflect more and more the composition of the communities they serve .
A representative police force will probably be less likely to behave like an alien , occupying army .
The visible presence of officers of color in high - ranking command positions engenders public confidence in the ability of police department personnel to identify , on human terms , with community residents .

This is a crucial message for the primary enforcement arm of " the law " to send .
This is a crucial message for the primary enforcement arm of " the law " to send .
Integration might , over time , reduce overtly racist / sexist activities such as brutality , harassment , and other discriminatory tactics .
GOAL #8 — CERTIFICATION AND LICENSING OF POLICE OFFICERS
Every state now has procedures for certifying or licensing police officers .
These require all sworn officers to have some minimum level of training .
This was one of the advances of the late 1960s and early 1970s .
An important new development is the advent of procedures for decertifying officers .
Traditionally , a police officer could be fired from one department but then hired by another .
As a result , persons guilty of gross misconduct could continue to work as police officers .
Decertification bars a dismissed officer from further police employment in that state ( though not necessarily in some other state ) .
Between 1976 and 1983 , the Florida Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission decertified 132 police officers .
Standardized procedures for state - level certification / decertification are a worthy goal to pursue .
Be aware , however , that the state commission must have sufficient power and resources to investigate misconduct complaints , and must vigorously exercise its authority .
And even if it has such power , certification / decertification is only one part of the comprehensive approach that 's needed to achieve meaningful police discipline .
GOAL #9 — ACCREDITATION OF YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT
One result of the increasing number of lawsuits brought against police departments by victims of abuse over the past 20 years came from within the police profession .
It was a movement for an accreditation process , similar to that in education and other fields , whereby the police would establish and enforce their own professional standards .
In 1979 , the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies ( COALEA ) was established as a joint undertaking of several major professional associations .
COALEA published its first set of Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies in 1985 and issues new standards periodically .
In deciding whether your community should press for accreditation of its local police department , keep in mind these basic points —
Accreditation is a voluntary process .
A police department suffers no penalty for not being accredited .
( In contrast , lack of accreditation in higher education carries penalties that include an institution 's ineligibility for student financial aid programs and non-recognition of its awarded credits or degrees . )
A police department suffers no penalty for not being accredited .

Current accreditation standards represent minimum , rather than optimum , goals .
They are very good in some respects but do not go far enough in covering the critical uses of law enforcement powers .
They are very good in some respects but do not go far enough in covering the critical uses of law enforcement powers .
Accreditation might make a difference in the case of a truly backward , unprofessional and poorly managed police department in that it could help stimulate much needed and long overdue changes .
On the other hand , a police department can easily comply with all of the current standards and still tolerate rampant brutality , spying and other abuses .
Citizens in your particular community must decide whether , taking all of the above into account , accreditation would serve as an effective mobilization tool .
5. ORGANIZING STRATEGIES
Once your community has identified its police problems and decided what solutions to pursue , an organizing strategy for securing the desired reform must be developed .
In the 1960s and `70s , the most successful method of attacking police abuse was the lawsuit .
During the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren , landmark Supreme Court decisions that imposed nationally uniform limits on police behavior were handed down in the cases of Mapp v. Ohio , Escobedo v. Illinois and Miranda v. Arizona .
Respectively , those decisions extended Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures to the states , established the Sixth Amendment right to a lawyer during police interrogations and required the police to inform persons taken into custody of their Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination .
Today , the Supreme Court under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist demonstrates repeated hostility to individual rights .
Many lower federal courts , the majority of whose presiding judges were appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush , follow this trend .
More and more , therefore , the task of opposing police abuse falls not to lawyers , but to the citizens in the communities .
The following profiles of successful organizing strategies can guide your community 's attempts to effectively challenge police abuse .
STRATEGY #1 — BUILD COALITIONS
PROFILE : The Indianapolis Law Enforcement and Community Relations Coalition
The year is 1984 .
Galvanized by a series of brutal and unjustified police killings that have sparked tensions between the police department and the African American community , 19 civil rights , religious , professional and civic organizations form the Indianapolis Law Enforcement / Community Relations Coalition .
Coalition members include the Urban League , Baptist Ministerial Alliance , Community Centers of Indianapolis , Hispano - American Center , Indiana Council of Churches , Jewish Community Relations Council , Mental Health Association , NAACP and the United Methodist Church .
The coalition , co-chaired by the Executive Director of the Urban League and a designee of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union , was instrumental in the establishment of a civilian review board in 1989 , despite considerable political opposition .
Since that time , it has worked to strengthen the authority of that body , which still lacks jurisdiction over police shooting fatalities .
A recent series of highly publicized episodes of police misconduct , culminating in an incident in August , 1996 , which newspapers dubbed " the police brawl " lent new urgency to the Coalition 's efforts .
Representatives of the Coalition were tapped by the Greater Indianapolis Process Committee to serve on a Working Group of citizens charged with reviewing the Civilian Review Process and recommending changes in jurisdiction and composition .
A co-chair of the Coalition served as co-chair of the Working Group .
The broad - based Coalition is credited by many for drawing attention to management problems within the Indianapolis Police Department in addition to the tensions between officers and minority communities .
The Coalition 's research provided the basis for the deliberations of the Working Group ; even more important , once the Working Group has delivered its recommendations , monitoring the resulting process will be the responsibility of the Coalition .
Key to the Coalition 's success has been its broadbased composition and its commitment to participatory decision - making .
STRATEGY #2 — MONITOR THE POLICE
PROFILE : Copwatch , Berkeley , California
Copwatch is a community organization whose stated purpose is " to reduce police harassment and brutality , " and " to uphold Berkeley 's tradition of tolerance and diversity . "
Its main activities are monitoring police conduct through personal observation , recording and publicizing incidents of abuse and harassment , and working with Berkeley 's civilian review board — the Police Review Commission .
Copwatch sends teams of volunteers into the community on three - hour shifts .
Each team is equipped with a flashlight , tape recorder , camera , " incident " forms ( see sample form ) and Copwatch Handbooks that describe the organization 's non-violent tactics , relevant laws , court decisions , police policies and what citizens should do in an emergency .
At the end of a shift , the volunteers return their completed forms to the COPWATCH office .
If they have witnessed an harassment incident , they call one of the organization 's cooperating lawyers , who follows up on the incident .
Copwatch holds weekly meetings , and its activists attend public meetings of the Police Review Commission .
It publishes a quarterly newsletter , Copwatch Report , which features a " Cop Blotter " column that describes examples of police misconduct " gleaned from Copwatch incident reports . "
Although the group 's impact has not been studied , Copwatch activists are convinced that their monitoring activities deter and , thus , reduce harassment and abuse .
COPWATCH INCIDENT REPORT FORM
Date Time Place Officers ( names & numbers ) Police Car License No. Arrestee / Victim's Name Other information Suspected charge Witnesses ( names & phone numbers ) Injuries ?
If yes , describe Photos or tapes ?
Does arrestee need a lawyer ?
Description of incident Name of Copwatcher
STRATEGY #3 — USE OPEN RECORDS LAWS
PROFILE : The Seattle Coalition on Government Spying
The year is 1976 .
During confirmation hearings for a new Seattle police chief , it comes to light that the city 's police department maintains political intelligence files on citizens who are not suspected of any criminal activity .
Some time later , a local newspaper prints the names of 150 individuals that were found in police files .
A group of citizens , concerned about this clear violation of First Amendment and privacy rights , forms the Coalition on Government Spying .
One of the coalition 's first acts is to file suit under the Washington public disclosure law , seeking access to the police department 's intelligence files .
Under the law , the police can refuse to disclose the files only if " nondisclosure is essential to effective law enforcement . "
Since the files are purely political , the court orders full disclosure .
The coalition 's charges of abuse turn out to be well - founded .
Not only do the files show that the police have engaged in unconstitutional surveillance of political activists , but they are full of inaccurate , misleading and damaging information .
The lawsuit and its revelations receive a lot of media attention , which helps build strong public support for reform .
The result : Seattle enacts the first and only municipal ordinance in the country that restricts police surveillance .
OPEN RECORDS LAWS
Each of the 50 states has a freedom of information act or an open records law .
Virtually all such laws were enacted post - Watergate , in the mid-1970s .
Under these laws , community groups can request and obtain access to police reports , investigations , policies and tape recordings regarding a controversial incident , such as a beating , shooting , or false arrest .
If the police refuse to disclose information to representatives of your community , that refusal in itself should become the focus of organizing and public attention .
Ultimately , your community can sue to compel disclosure , unless the records you seek are specifically exempted .
FLORIDA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
General state policy on public records .
It is the policy of this state that all state , county , and municipal records shall at all times be open for a personal inspection by any person .
Definitions .
" Public records " means all documents , papers , letters , maps , books , tapes , photographs , films , sound recordings or other material , regardless of physical form or characteristics , made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency .
" Agency " shall mean any state , county , district , authority or municipal officer , department , division , board , bureau , commission or other separate unit of government .
Inspection and examination of records ; exemptions .
Every person who has custody of public records shall permit the records to be inspected and examined by any person desiring to do so , at reasonable times , under reasonable conditions .
The custodian shall furnish copies or certified copies of the records upon payment of fees .
All public records which presently are provided by law to be confidential or which are prohibited from being inspected by the public , whether by general or special law , shall be exempt from the provisions of subsection 1 .
STRATEGY # 4 — EDUCATE THE PUBLIC
PROFILE : Police Practices Project , ACLU of Northern California
The Police Practices Project conducts , among other activities , education programs to teach citizens about their constitutional rights .
One aspect of the police abuse problem , the project believes , is that the police tend to abuse certain people partly because they think these individuals do n't know their rights , or do n't know how to assert their rights .
The project also believes that its programs have the added advantage of recruiting groups and individuals to work in police reform campaigns .
The project , working with other groups , has sponsored training programs for homeless people , as well as for advocates and service providers for the homeless .
The training included the distribution of copies of police policies , information on homeless people 's legal rights , suggestions on how to observe and record police misconduct and presentations by members of the local civilian review agency .
A videotape was made of one of the project 's training sessions for use by other groups outside the Bay Area .
The project also publishes wallet - size cards in English , Spanish and Chinese that inform citizens about what to do or say in encounters with the police .
These cards have been widely distributed in the community .
( One card - holder reported that he pulled out his card when confronted by a police officer , only to have the officer reach into his wallet and pull out his own copy of the same card ! )
The ACLU National Office has created a similar card , with a national scope .
( You can download a copy to print out below . )
The project believes that individual citizens and community groups become informed about police policies just by participating in the preparation of educational materials and training sessions .
That participation also fosters awareness about particular areas of police practice that need reform .
Most important , education empowers even the most disenfranchised people and helps deter the police from treating them abusively .

STRATEGY # 5 : — USE THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO WIN REFORMS
PROFILE : The New York Civil Liberties Union 's Campaign for a " Real Civilian Review Board "
The time is August 1988 ; the place , New York City .
Manhattan 's Lower East Side is rocked by one of the most serious outbreaks of police violence in years .
Declaring a curfew , the police begin to eject homeless people and their supporters from Tompkins Square Park .
Fifty - two people , most of them innocent bystanders , sustain serious injuries at the hands of the police in the ensuing violence .
Much of the violence is recorded on video .
Yet the officers who are guilty of misconduct go virtually unpunished ; only one receives more than a 30 - day suspension from the force .
The city 's Civilian Complaint Review Board ( CCRB ) comes under heightened scrutiny .
Although it was established in the early 1950s and gradually strengthened over the years , the CCRB is still criticized for its lack of independence and secretive proceedings .
Half of its 12 members are appointed by the mayor , the other half by the police commissioner .
Most of the CCRB 's investigators are police officers .
In the wake of the Tompkins Square events , the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) spearheads " A Campaign for a Real Civilian Review Board " and organizes a coalition of civil rights organizations to back it up .
The goal of the campaign is the establishment of a new , all - civilian CCRB that will be totally independent of the police department .
During 1991 , the campaign calls on the city 's community boards to pass resolutions in support of " a real CCRB . "
( The community boards are elected bodies that have advisory jurisdiction over a variety of local matters , such as zoning and land use ) .
Campaign spokespeople debate police department representatives before some 30 community boards throughout the city , and 19 boards pass resolutions calling for revisions of the present system ( see box below ) .
Each board that passes a resolution becomes a member of the campaign coalition .
Coalition members set up tables at street fairs and other community events to collect signatures on petitions for " a real CCRB . "
More than 1,000 signatures are collected .
The NYCLU , after garnering this broad support , develops legislation for submission to the City Council .
The bill is endorsed by 14 Council members and is adopted .
RESOLUTION ON THE CIVILIAN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD OF NEW YORK CITY Adopted by Community Board # 9 , Serving Hamilton Heights / Manhattanville & Morningside Heights New York City Whereas , many New Yorkers are concerned about the independence and effectiveness of the present Civilian Complaint Review Board ; and Whereas , with the proposed hiring of 9,600 new police officers , unfortunately , there may be a wider possibility of alleged police abuse ; and Whereas , if alleged police abuse has been charged , New Yorkers should have an effective government review agency that will render fair and full investigation and hearing of their allegations without pressure from the Police Department now , therefore , be it Resolved , that the new board should have investigators and board members that are civilians with no allegiances to the Police Department and should have the power to subpoena witnesses to insure cooperation from the police officers or other concerned individuals .
It should hold regular public hearings and maintain procedural safeguards to protect the rights of civilians and police officers .
It should have expanded jurisdiction that includes all police and peace officers employed by the City and quasi-city agencies ; and in adopting this resolution we are following the lead of Community Boards # 4 , # 11 and # 12 .
STRATEGY #6 — LOBBY FOR STATE LEGISLATION
PROFILE : The ACLU of California 's Legislative Approach to Police Misconduct
The ACLU 's affiliates in Southern California , Northern California and San Diego developed a model state law to address the problem of police abuse .
Their proposed legislation includes the following —
Establishing an Office of the Special Police Prosecutor to prosecute cases of police abuse .
Independent prosecutors are needed because conventional city and county prosecutors are reluctant to bring charges against the same police officers they rely on for evidence in other criminal cases ;
Establishing state - mandated civilian police review boards for local police ;
Breaking the " code of silence " by making it a crime for a police officer to fail to report criminal wrongdoing by another officer .
This provision would also protect a reporting officer from retaliation ;
Requiring statewide data collection on police abuse and misconduct ;
Restricting the use of force and " pain compliance " techniques ;
Breaking down the wall of secrecy that shields complaints of police misconduct and most complaint investigative processes from public scrutiny and oversight .
Although the proposal has not yet been adopted , ACLU lobbyists have waged a largely successful battle against a flood of dangerous bills introduced into the California Legislature by police lobbyists .
In the process , the ACLU has learned that an informed presence in state legislatures is essential to counteracting well - funded and influential police lobbies that sometimes oppose or undercut reform efforts .
TIPS ON DEALING WITH A POLICE MATTER
( provided by the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties )
Thank you for contacting the ACLU .
Your information is very important to us in our effort to monitor police abuse in your community .
If you have been a victim of police misconduct and wish to pursue the matter in any manner , you should first contact an attorney to advise you .
Nothing that is written in these tips is intended to constitute legal advice , which can only come from an attorney experienced in this area of law .
The San Diego County Bar Association 's Lawyer Referral Service maintains a panel for referrals of attorneys in this area of law .
The number of the referral service is 231-8585 .
If you believe you have been the victim of police abuse or misconduct and would like to take action , some of the possible options are — —
Pursue your case formally through the municipal , superior , or federal court systems ( normally an attorney is necessary ) .
—
File a complaint with the law enforcement agency involved ( addresses and phone numbers are in the phone book ) .
Your complaint should be made in writing by sending a letter to the chief of police or the head of the law enforcement agency involved .
Your complaint does not need to be submitted on police department forms — a letter will suffice .
The letter should specify what your complaint involves ( e.g. , false arrest , excessive force , improper procedures , etc. )
A copy should be sent to the Internal Affairs Division of the law enforcement agency .
Make sure to keep a copy for yourself .
—
Report the incident to one of the two law enforcement civilian review boards in the San Diego area — one for the County of San Diego ( typically for matters involving the San Diego Sheriff 's Department or Probation Department — phone number 685-2200 ) and the one for the City of San Diego ( for matters involving the San Diego Police Department — phone number 236-5933 ) . —
Take the law enforcement officer (s ) to small claims court to recover damages you have suffered .
You may want to try one or more of these options to vindicate your rights .
An attorney can help you decide among these options by explaining what is involved with each , and we urge you to consult one before proceeding .
If you decide to pursue your claim you must take action quickly because the law imposes severe time limits for nearly every option listed above .
If you do not comply with those time limits you will lose your right to take any action .
Once again , an attorney experienced in this area of law can advise you regarding the time limits and your rights with respect to them .
A FINAL WORD
Keep your eye on the big picture .
On the one hand , each individual reform is only one step on a long road to correcting the deeply entrenched problem of police misconduct ; on the other hand , important and genuine reforms can be won .
A well - organized , focused campaign against police abuse can draw broad community support .
The key is to transform that support into realistic demands and develop strategies that turn those demands into concrete reforms .
We hope the information and advice contained in this manual inspires and equips your community to effectively tackle the problem of police misconduct from the grass roots up .
Reform of police practices is in the best interests of every American , including the men and women in blue .
You have our best wishes for success .
Keep in touch .

I proceeded to look at some shirts in the womens ' department , when suddenly you two white trash tramps came RIGHT over and stood oh , maybe , 3 feet away from me , glaring .
The porkier one of you two ( the one with the mustache ) then took out your cellphone and obviously dialed the lost one 's number in hopes that suddenly my bag would ring your familiar ringtone - probably Shakira or Lil Kim .
I could n't believe you had the audacity to be such stupid hos .
Not only did you make no attempt to be discreet , but you were blatantly rude and insulting .
Why the fuck would I want your cellphone ?
I 'm all set with 19yr old punks calling me for blowjobs .
I also do n't have any interest in receiving phone calls from probation officers or Planned Parenthood .
If I did find a cheap - ass phone probably in a pink case , covered in stickers - there 's a damn good chance I 'd return it to the " Lost And Found , " assuming I 'd even give a shit enough to do that .
I 'm sure that 's a far - fetched concept to you , considering if it were the other way around , you 'd probably pawn a lost phone as fast as you 'd jerk off a homeless guy that offered you a cigarette .
Next time you immediately jump to conclusions because of your own stupidity , go back and check the aisle with vaginal cream and douches first ; you probably left your phone there .
You must have found it shortly after , because you were no longer up my ass , skanking up my personal space .
Either that , or the dollar store was having one hell of a sale that you could n't pass up .
Screw you both .
One of the pet peeves of being a web designer is that you sometimes end up not feeling very creative and in need of inspiration .
Of course there are thousands of CSS galleries out there , but we thought we could just go ahead and make our own list of great website designs .
Hoping this will help you get your creative juices flowing !
Your Turn To Talk
So , which ones are your faves ?
And why ?
See ya in the comment section !
You may find these days depressing -- watching the value of your portfolio drain away , day after day , in this dismal market .
But that 's really the wrong way to look at things .
You should n't be despondent .
You should be furious .
Bear markets happen , but this bear market could have been easily prevented .
We got here through rash speculation and atrocious judgment on the part of speculators , but guess who suffers ?
You .
Your portfolio will take the hit , your savings will be ravaged by inflation , and your tax dollars will go toward cleaning up the mess .
Fingers are pointing all over the financial sector , but four groups are primarily responsible .
Real estate speculators
Real estate speculators are the most obvious target , and they include everyone from " investors " to subprime borrowers who just wanted a home -- basically , everyone who bought real estate but could n't truly afford it .
And speculation was truly out of control .
In the first quarter of 2006 , 26 % of loans were of the interest - only or negative amortization variety .
For a small group of knowledgeable borrowers , loans such as these made sense .
But for more than a quarter of the market ?
No way .
I 've heard arguments that borrowers who could n't afford their payments should be absolved of blame , since they 're just victims of predatory lending .
Yes , predatory lending definitely exists , but the bottom line is that it 's the borrower 's responsibility to understand the terms of the loan .
When you make the biggest purchase of your life , you should understand the terms of that purchase , even if you have to hire a lawyer to explain it to you .
It really is that simple .
Mortgage originators
Of course , borrowers could n't have assumed ridiculous loans without the help of mortgage originators such as Countrywide Financial ( NYSE : CFC ) , H&R Block ( NYSE : HRB ) , and Merrill Lynch 's ( NYSE : MER ) First Franklin unit .
The statistics are damning .
In 2005 and 2006 , 20 % of all mortgages were subprime , and a further 12 % to 13 % were low - documentation Alt - A loans .
What 's more , according to the National Association of Realtors , in 2005 , the average first - time homebuyer made only a 2 % down payment , a level that left no margin of safety for declining housing prices .
So a huge portion of the market consisted of high - risk loans .
But why would conservative banks suddenly assume risks that they 'd been avoiding up until then ?
Ultimately , their necks were n't on the line , because they would n't keep the mortgages .
Instead , they 'd use investment banks such as Morgan Stanley ( NYSE : MS ) and Lehman Brothers ( NYSE : LEH ) to securitize mortgages .
In other words , they 'd dump these junk loans on pension funds , hedge funds , and anyone else desperate for high yields .
Sure , the buyers would end up owning questionable debt , but by then , the originators were on to the next deal .
No skin off their noses .
Rating agencies
But mortgage securitizations could n't have gotten so out of hand without Moody 's ( NYSE : MCO ) and other rating agencies giving asset - backed securities much higher ratings than they truly deserved and , thus , concealing the true risks .
Since 2006 , hundreds of billions of dollars in securitizations have been downgraded to better describe the risks involved .
For instance , in 2006 , 76 % of the Moody 's - rated dollar volume of securitizations that were backed by subprime closed - end second - lien loans were downgraded after " materially significant underperformance . "
Clearly , the original models the rating agencies used were horribly inaccurate .
Though housing declines have been rare , at minimum the agencies should have considered this possibility before handing out AAA ratings .
After all , when evaluating a company like Exxon Mobil ( NYSE : XOM ) , they would n't assume that oil is certain to remain above $ 50 a barrel -- even if it looks that way now .
The Fed
At the end of the day , Alan Greenspan 's Federal Reserve holds a great deal of responsibility for this bust .
All of the other players in this drama can claim , however feebly , that they were just trying to make money .
The Fed , on the other hand , is responsible for acting in the best interests of this country and guarding against anything that might destabilize the system .
Instead , Greenspan kept interest rates low for way too long .
He did n't recognize that the liquidity he pumped into the system was building a national housing bubble , even with prices up more than 70 % in real terms over eight years .
It 's baffling that the nation 's chief economist could look at facts like this graph , see housing equity at record lows , and not think that something was seriously wrong .
But Greenspan is also the guy who said that you can identify bubbles only after they pop and that there was " no evidence that home prices are going to collapse . "
I expect more than blind optimism from the top economist in the United States , and so should you .
The best revenge
I 'm incensed about what 's happened .
As an investor , though , I 'm also able to see the one silver lining in this storm of incompetence , greed , and willful ignorance : astounding investment opportunities that you can find only during periods of turmoil .
In a calm market , it 's difficult finding stocks trading at discounts of more than 35 % .
But now , though it 's more challenging to separate the winners from the losers , there are substantial opportunities .
Our Motley Fool Inside Value team has found a handful of stocks that we believe to be trading at 60 % discounts to fair value , which implies a 150 % return if these stocks simply appreciate to what we think they 're worth .
Now , those returns wo n't happen overnight , and some of those scenarios rely on having the economy pick up again over the next few years .
But if you can have longer - term time horizon , there are some incredible opportunities out there today .
The best outlet for your fury is to take advantage of current conditions and profit from them down the line .
If you 'd like to do just that , take a look at the stocks we 're recommending at Inside Value free for 30 days .

Instant messaging , blogs , Facebook , MySpace -- there are limitless ways your child communicates online with the offline world .
And the risks and opportunities are only increasing .
A new Tel Aviv University research study has found that , despite what parents might believe , there is an enormous gap between what they think their children are doing online and what is really happening .
In her study , Prof. Dafna Lemish from the Department of Communication at Tel Aviv University surveyed parents and their children about the children 's activities on the Internet .
" The data tell us that parents do n't know what their kids are doing , " says Prof. Lemish .
Her study was unique in that parents and children from the same family were surveyed .
Strange Encounters
In one part of the study , Prof .
Lemish surveyed over 500 Jewish and Arab children from a variety of ages and socio- economic backgrounds , asking them if they gave out personal information online .
Seventy - three percent said that they do .
The parents of the same children believed that only 4 percent of their children did so .
The same children were also asked if they had been exposed to pornography while surfing , or if they had made face - to - face contact with strangers that they had met online .
Thirty - six percent from the high school group admitted to meeting with a stranger they had met online .
Nearly 40 % of these children admitted to speaking with strangers regularly ( within the past week ) .
advertisement
Fewer than 9 percent of the parents knew that their children had been meeting with strangers , engaging in what could be viewed as very risky behavior .
Prof .
Lemish suspects that this gap is wider in the U.S. , where children from middle - class backgrounds have more opportunity to surf online privately .
Erasing their Tracks
In another part of the study , Prof .
Lemish found that 30 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 18 delete the search history from their browsers in an attempt to protect their privacy from their parents .
She suggests that common filtering software may not be effective , since children will access what they are looking for elsewhere -- at a friend 's house , an Internet café , or school .
And if the child accesses dangerous material outside of the home , they will be unprepared and uninformed when it happens , she says .
Prof .
Lemish believes that one problem is that parents are not as media - literate as they could be .
They do n't have a handle on using popular online software and chat programs , and tend to have no clue about what is really happening online .
But she cautions , " This lack of knowledge on the parents ' part may be no different than the situation before the advent of the Web .
Parents do n't know what their children are doing on the Net , in the same manner that they do n't know what goes on at class , parties , or clubs . "
Avoiding Dangers
Prof .
Lemish advises that parents should give their children the tools to be literate Internet users , and to navigate around any potential dangers .
Most importantly , parents need to talk to their children .
" The child needs similar tools that teach them to be weary of dangers in the park , the mall or wherever .
The same rules in the real world apply online as well .
" For example , under no circumstances , should a child ever give strangers their private information over the Internet , or meet unsupervised with strangers .
Children should be encouraged to tell their parents about Internet encounters that make them uncomfortable .
It 's just common sense and parents need to teach them that .
Talking with your children regularly is important . "
At the same time , she stresses , parents should not disregard the advantages of the Internet : " We tend to forget that it offers our children a source of independence , a way to explore the world , and helps them meet friends whom they could not meet in their real world .
As parents , we need to help them explore the positive opportunities the Internet offers them , and to reduce the risks . "

Print This Email This A week after Sen. Barack Obama delivered a hallmark address on race , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down with an interview for the Washington Times .
Race relations in America , she said , stems from a national " birth defect " in the US constitution .
" Black Americans were a founding population , " she told the Times .
" Africans and Europeans came here and founded this country together  Europeans by choice and Africans in chains .
That 's not a very pretty reality of our founding . "
" That particular birth defect makes it hard for us to confront it , hard for us to talk about it , and hard for us to realize that it has continuing relevance for who we are today , " she added .
Her comment is lighter than that recently delivered last week by Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , who dubbed slavery a " sin " and a " stain " on the constitution .
Speaking on the constitutional convention of 1787 , Obama remarked , " The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished .
It was stained by this nation 's original sin of slavery , a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years , and to leave any final resolution to future generations .
Rice has recently been floated as a vice presidential possibility for Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) , although she says she 's not interested in continuing in politics .
Washington insider and blogger Steve Clemons wrote that Rice spoke earlier this week to " Grover Norquist 's weekly powerhouse gathering at Americans for Tax Reform of conservative associations , think tanks , and political operations , " where " Republican political hopefuls migrate to to get the blessing of not only Norquist but the diverse parts of the nation 's conservative money and political machinery . "
In a follow - up post , Clemons wrote , " though saying she is not interested in the Vice Presidential slot on a McCain ticket , Condoleezza Rice might be convinced at some point to give up her near California dreams if " necessity " required it . "
The Secretary of State has also used birth in other language -- applying it in 2006 to the Israeli attack on Lebanon .
" What we 're seeing here , in a sense , is the growing -- the birth pangs of a new Middle East and whatever we do we have to be certain that we 're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one , " Rice said .
Rice declined to comment on the campaign , saying only that Obama 's race speech was " important . "
Miss
Rice declined to comment on the campaign , saying only that it was " important " that Mr. Obama " gave it for a whole host of reasons . "
" America does n't have an easy time dealing with race , " Rice added .
" What I would like understood as a black American is that black Americans loved and had faith in this country even when this country did n't love and have faith in them  and that 's our legacy , " she said .
" Rice also said that what ' attracted ' her to candidate George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign was not foreign policy , but his " no child left behind " initiative , which she said gave equal opportunities to black and white students , " the paper said .

In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN 's Lola Ogunnaike went to Harlem for the U.S. premiere of " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . "
Karen Allen , Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf attend the " Indiana Jones " premiere in Harlem , New York , Tuesday .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Harlem is n't the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of a movie premiere .
The Chinese Theater in Hollywood ?
Definitely .
The Ziegfeld in Manhattan ?
Of course .
The AMC Magic Johnson Theatre complex on 125th Street ?
Not so much .
But there were Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf Tuesday evening , right around the corner from the Apollo , grinning and posing for overzealous photographers and over - caffeinated fans at the U.S. premiere of " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . "
It was a far cry from the South of France , where Indiana Jones was reintroduced to the world last week at the Cannes Film Festival .
No gowns , tuxes or diamonds in Harlem .
No A - list celebrities , other than Ford 's sweetheart Calista Flockhart .
Watch the excitement of the " Indiana Jones " premiere in Cannes »
But what the festivities lacked in glitz they made up for in pure unadulterated fun -- and a key marketing opportunity for Indiana Jones and company .
The popular video show " 106 & Park , " also taping at the Magic Johnson Theatre , invited Ford and LaBeouf to their set .
Most of the people in attendance were n't even born when the first Indiana Jones film was released in 1981 , but that did n't seem to matter .
They cheered when Ford began to bust a move as some music played .
And LaBeouf 's encyclopedic knowledge of rap also impressed the crowd .
It was the exact energy that the studio , Paramount Pictures , was looking for .
" We could 've done it at the Ziegfeld , but the Ziegfeld is boring , " Paramount executive Michael Vollman said .
" The electricity here is incredible .
Look around .
You can't compare . "
Electricity means nothing if it does n't translate into the box office sales , he acknowledged , and " 106 & Park , " BET 's highest - rated show , is a key way to generate energy .
Bringing the film to Harlem ensures that both young moviegoers and black moviegoers are n't forgotten .
" We wanted to make sure every kid in America knew this movie was coming , " he said .
" BET is one of the best ways to reach those kids . "
BET has long been a requisite stop on the promotional tour for any film aimed at black audiences , but in recent years mainstream films have begun to make the trek uptown .
Tom Cruise spent an afternoon at " 106 & Park " when he was promoting " Mission : Impossible 3 . "
" That was a watershed moment for us , " said BET 's president of entertainment , Reginald Hudlin .
Certainly , everybody seemed to be having a good time .
At one point on " 106 & Park , " the rapper Jim Jones took the stage and performed " Ballin , " an infectious ode to living it up that even has its own signature dance .
Jim Jones taught Indiana Jones the dance ( it looks like a fadeaway jump shot ) and the crowd ate it up .
" When did you know you were ballin ' ? "
" 106 & Park " co-host Terrence J asked Ford .
" I be ballin ' now , " Ford answered , to wide approval .
( Warning : Spoilers ahead . )
Early reviews of the latest Indiana installment have been mixed , but the Harlem audience was firmly in Indiana 's corner .
" It gets 10 stars , " said one audience member , Robert Egbert .
" The sound effects were crazy and the action was off the hook .
I loved the space ship ! "
And what of Ford ?
" That 's my dude .
He 's mad old , but he 's still got it . "
Chalk up another victory for the man in the fedora .

Four Unexpected Food Facts
Eat fiber , avoid trans - fat , watch your glycemic load … you ’ve got the basics down cold .
But nutrition science can be wild and woolly , with more surprises than you might expect .
Consider :
1. Mushrooms make vitamin D in sunlight .
Most people are aware that the human body makes vitamin D in response to sunlight .
Less known is the fact that mushrooms , even picked ones , can perform the same feat – which means that eating mushrooms that have been exposed to sunlight can be an excellent way to supplement your “ D ” levels .
Recently , mycologist Paul Stamets discovered that the level of vitamin D in freshly picked , indoor - grown shiitake mushrooms rose from 110 IU ( international units ) to an astonishing 46,000 IU per 100 grams when the mushrooms were placed outdoors in the sun for just six hours with the gills facing up ( when the gills were facing down , the level rose to 10,900 IU ) .
This means that eating just one gram of sun-treated shiitake – about one tenth of one mushroom – would give you 460 IU , close to the FDA ’s recommended daily dose of 400 IU , and about a quarter of Dr. Weil ’s recommended 2,000 IU .
In his book , Mycelium Running : How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World , Stamets concluded , “ ( In ) populations where vitamin D is seriously deficient , sun-exposed dried mushrooms can help address a serious health issue . ”
2. Orange tomatoes may be healthier than red ones .
Usually , deep color in fruits and vegetables indicates abundant antioxidants – compounds that have been linked to heart and brain health – so it makes sense to consume produce with the deepest hues .
But a study by Ohio State University researchers , published in the February 2007 issue of the Journal of Agricultural Food and Chemistry , found that a variety of orange - colored tomatoes called Tangerine provided more readily available lycopene than did red tomatoes .
Lycopene is an antioxidant that has been shown to reduce risks of cancer , cardiovascular disease and macular degeneration .
Tangerine tomatoes are not available in grocery stores , but the researchers suggested that the advantage might extend to other orange - and gold - colored tomatoes .
3. Crush garlic , then wait 10 minutes before cooking , to maximize health benefits .
Argentinian researchers reported ( in the March 7 , 2007 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry ) that crushing garlic releases an enzyme , alliinase , that catalyzes the formation of allicin , which then breaks down to form a variety of heart - healthy organosulfur compounds .
So crushed or chopped garlic , they reported , was potentially better for cardiac health than whole cloves .
Even more surprising , they noted that allowing the crushed garlic to stand for 10 minutes before cooking appeared to further enhance formation of those compounds .
So when making a dish that contains garlic , crush the cloves first , and let them rest on the cutting board for at least 10 minutes while doing other prep work .
4. Consuming eggs regularly does not boost cardiovascular risk .
Americans have been urged to reduce egg consumption in the belief that eggs ’ high cholesterol levels contribute to coronary disease .
We seem to have gotten the message : in 1943 , per capital consumption was 402 eggs annually ; by 2007 , it was down to 253 , a 38 percent decline .
But several large studies indicate that egg anxiety is unfounded .
Most notably , a 1999 report from the Harvard School of Public Health ( published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ) that tracked 110,000 American adults for up to 14 years found no increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke among healthy men and women who ate as much as seven eggs per week vs. those who ate less than one per week .
There did , however , appear to be a correlation between high egg consumption and heart disease among diabetic men and women that “ warrants further research ” the authors concluded .

Origins of the Domestic Dog : the Fossil Record
A Natural History of Domesticated Animals
Dogs : a Startling New Understanding of Canine Origins , Behavior and Evolution
My adult education course on tetrapod evolution started this week .
While I think it went ok , I hope I did n’t overwhelm my students : the idea for the first teaching session was to quickly run through Palaeozoic and Mesozoic tetrapod history , looking at the major clades , so we dashed through tetrapod origins , lepospondyls , temnospondyls , the living amphibian groups , anthracosaurs , amniote origins , Palaeozoic synapsids , the turtle origins controversy , and diapsid diversity .
It will be interesting to see how things progress .
The next session covers Mesozoic marine reptiles ( excluding plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs ) .
Meanwhile , I have yet again been tinkering with that big review article on British dinosaurs ( now at the final stages of the publication process ) , and Mike P. Taylor and I have been putting the finishing touches to a paper describing a new sauropod .
Other areas of recent interest have been the ‘ necks for sex ’ hypothesis , Nick Longrich ’s paper on ‘ leg - wings ’ in , and gigantic feral cats .
More on those subjects in future .
Moving on , here at last is that text on domestic dog origins .
Most zoologists ‘ know ’ that the domestic dog is a domesticated wolf ( or , more likely , a number of independently domesticated wolf populations ) and so well known is this view that some scientists question the recognition ofas a species separate from .
This is the ‘ mainstream ’ view eloquently discussed in several good books on dogs and on domestication , including Olsen ’s ( 1985 ) , Clutton - Brook ’s ( 1999 ) , and Coppinger & Coppinger ’s ( 2001 ) .
But here ’s the news .
The ‘ domestic wolf ’ model is actually not as firmly established as you might think , possibly wrong , and in fact arguably inferior to an alternative model of domestic dog evolution championed by a minority of canid specialists .
Canis lupus
Are domestic dogs really wolves ?
Some very obvious things to consider
et al
Many papers published on the subject of domestic dog origins state flatly that ‘ the derivation of domestic dogs from the wolf is well established on behavioural and morphological grounds ’ , without actually saying in detail what these behavioural and morphological grounds are .
It ’s certainly true that domestic dogs and wolves are morphologically and genetically similar , but they ’re actually also notably different , and while they share behavioural traits , they also differ profoundly in some important respects .
My primary inspiration on all of this has been Janice Koler - Matznick , founder of the New Guinea Singing Dog Conservation Society .
Besides publishing important papers on singers ( and I wo n’t be discussing those here : perhaps another time ) , her experience with them has caused her to re-evaluate theories about domestic dog origins and on domestication .
Arguably her most important publication on this subject is Koler - Matznick ( 2002 : free pdf here ) , which you should see for a good review .
I remain open - minded on the issue of both the phylogenetic affinities of domestic dogs , and on how domestication occurred , and frankly it ’s such a huge area that it ’s easy to become baffled by the literature .
In an effort to keep things as simple as possible I ’ve tried to restrict the discussion here to a consideration of one of the central issues : are domestic dogs really part of the species ?
Let me apologise now if there are areas that I ’ve screwed up or misinterpreted , and apologies also to Jan for ‘ borrowing ’ her ideas so heavily .
As a rough rule of thumb , the domesticated forms of wild mammal species ( 1 ) revert back to wild - type after being feral for a few generations , and ( 2 ) readily interbreed with their wild ancestors .
If domestic dogs are wolves , then the many populations of feral dogs that live world - wide should theoretically have reverted back to being wolf - like in appearance and behaviour .
But they have n’t .
Instead , domestic dogs always end up looking like pariah dogs – the relatively small ( 11 - 16 kg ) , socially flexible semi-domesticated and feral dogs of the Old World tropics .
Dingos and the unusual New Guinea singing dog are part of the pariah dog complex , though the singing dog is so odd in behavioural , molecular and morphological features that it might warrant specific status ( Koler - Matznick .
2001 , 2003 ) .
Archaeological data shows that pariah dogs have a stable history , with dog skulls from 4000 year old deposits in Thailand being essentially identical to the modern dingo - like pariah dogs of the area .
Until relatively recently , domestic dogs must have been free - ranging and hence would have had ample opportunity to interbreed with wolves .
While this has certainly happened on many occasions ( modern wolf / dog hybrids are known from North America , Italy , as well as from archaeological samples * ) , what is surprising is that it has n’t happened more often .
This is n’t the case in other domesticated mammals , where interbreeding with wild ancestors is widespread .
et al
* Some coyote populations have also been shown to include genetic data from domestic dogs ( Adams . 2003 ) .
et al
Canis lupus
C. l. pallipes
Wolves are behaviorally ill - suited for domestication
In Europe , wolves remain only as endangered , fragmented populations vastly outnumbered by domestic dogs , and there has long been concern that wolves will be genetically swamped through interbreeding with dogs .
Actually , there is no good evidence for this , and in a recent study of Italian wolves Verardi . ( 2006 ) found the two to have distinct gene pools , that hybridization had occurred only very rarely , and that introgressive hybridization between the two is so limited that it does n’t pose a threat to the genetic integrity of the wolf .
Wolves and domestic dogs are in fact staying distinct .
This applies globally as well as locally : despite continuous , near - global sympatry between domestic dogs and wolves , hybridization has hardly occurred and only one mtDNA type is shared .
On this basis Koler - Matznick ( 2002 ) argued that domestic dogs and wolves satisfy the biological species concept and should n’t be regarded as conspecific .
While ( to my knowledge ) no - one doubts the idea that domestic dogs and wolves are close relatives , firm evidence showing that domestic dogs are nested within the speciesis lacking .
Attempts to genetically link domestic dogs to living wolf populations failed to find a match , making the hypothetical wolf ancestor of the domestic dog a mystery .
Morell ( 1997 ) wrote of the University of California ’s Robert Wayne , a leading researcher in this area , that ‘ Although he sampled as many wolves as possible , it may be that the ancestral wolf population is now extinct ’ ( p. 1647 ) .
Of interest here is that the wolf most often cited as a potential domestic dog ancestor , the Indian peninsular wolf , has recently been shown to represent a radically unique , divergent lineage that is quite distinct from other wolves , and from domestic dogs ( Jhala & Sharma 2004 ) .
The implication from these lines of evidence is that domestic dogs descend from an ancestral pariah - like form which was quite different from wolves and that , while domestic dogs and wolves are closely related , they are distinct .
Domestic dogs seem to have an independent history of descent and do not simply merge into wolves when the opportunity arises .
According to the conventional theory of dog domestication , wolves were domesticated either to function as big game hunters , or as guards .
But here there are problems .
If wolves really were domesticated prior to about 10,000 years ago ( more on this date below ) , the earliest domestic dogs would have been living alongside people that were using clubs , spears and other such tools to subdue large prey , and therefore hunting via stealth and ambush .
This poses a problem for the idea that people domesticated dogs to assist in large game hunting , as the chasing behaviour instinctive to wolves would presumably hinder human hunting efforts .
Even in dingos we find that they ’ve apparently always been preventing from participating in aboriginal kangaroo hunts because their chasing behaviour made the hunts a failure * .
People would also have to pretty much fight with wolves in order to get any game animals back off them , given that wolves are highly food - possessive . *
I know that some hunting humans are outstanding long - distance runners that pursue wounded prey over km , and might theoretically benefit from canid assistance , but there is no evidence that this hunting strategy was widespread among ancient people .
So far as we know it is limited to southern Africa ( correct me if you know otherwise ) .
The possible use of wolves as guards is also problematical , given that wild canids function poorly in this role .
Rather than defend a location , they will clear off when danger threatens , even if that location is their own den ( including offspring ) .
Sure , wolves might make some useful alerting noise if intruders were to come around , but other canids and other animals do this equally well .
While they can be tamed , wolves are actually very difficult to train .
This probably results from their social system : only the dominant pair in the pack reproduces , and consequently there is an imperative to employ aggression to move up the pack hierarchy .
These points do n’t make wolves seem like ideal animals for domestication .
Indeed , the fact that domestic dogs do n’t form hierarchical packs makes them decidedly unwolf - like and it has been argued that the flexible social structure and high tolerance of domestic dogs to gregariousness suggests derivation from a canid that did n’t have a wolf - like hierarchical pack ( Koler - Matznick 2002 ) [ adjacent image depicts a dingo ] .
It is becoming increasingly recognized that dogs are remarkable among mammals in exhibiting human - like social skills and communicative behaviour ( Hare et al. 2002 ) .
More so even than chimpanzees , dogs can reliably interpret human acoustic and visual cues ( e.g. , pointing or nodding ) , they have an inherent understanding of human perception , and they can even use human - like gestures , such as pointing .
The presence of these social skills in domestic dogs might suggest that humans and wolves developed a communicative bond early on , and that this facilitated or initiated domestication .
However , wolves have been studied in this context and have been found to lack the social skills and communicative behaviour that characterizes domestic dogs , so the social skills of domestic dogs presumably arose during domestication .
This is supported by the fact that the domesticated foxes bred by Dmitry Belyaev and his team match domestic dogs in their ability to recognise human visual cues ( I do n’t want to discuss Belyaev ’s fascinating experiment here as it would involve adding too many words : see Trut 1999 ) .
Might wolves have domesticated themselves ?
In view of these problems and others , those workers supporting the wolf hypothesis have argued that wolves domesticated themselves : by scavenging around camps and villages they became human commensals and eventually evolved into pariah dogs .
As a relatively large ( 20 - 55 kg ) predator it is difficult to imagine that wolves might have integrated into human society in this way .
Notably , those carnivoran species that have become human commensals are all generalized omnivores smaller than most wolves : raccoons Procyon lotor , Red foxes Vulpes vulpes , Golden jackals Canis aureus and coyotes C. latrans .
Furthermore , it has been argued that the human camps hypothesized as the earliest places frequented by hypothetical commensal wolves would not have produced the waste that a large predator would require in order to make that fundamental niche shift .
It is also worth noting that wolves were almost certainly a very real danger to prehistoric people and that they would have been regarded as enemies , not as potential friends .
Given that domestic dogs were apparently domesticated multiple times in various places , it is difficult to accept that so many wolf populations became amenable to domestication when these problems exist .
Morphologically , are domestic dogs really wolf - like ?
It has long been recognised that domestic dogs differ from wolves in a number of detailed skull characters .
Compared to wolves , domestic dogs are smaller and have proportionally smaller teeth , a wider palate , broader braincase and higher frontals , and smaller , less rounded auditory bullae .
Mostly these differences have been explained as the result of either reduced selection under domestication ( Björnerfeldt et al. 2006 ) , or artificial selection for neotenous characters .
There are however a few features present in domestic dogs ( and not in wolves ) that ca n’t be easily explained this way , such as the difference in the shape of the mandibular coronoid process .
While these characters might result from reduced selection under domestication , or artificial selection for neotenous characters , it ’s interesting that many of them recall the conditions seen in non-wolf canids , such as jackals and dholes .
Indeed some authors have concluded that domestic dogs are less like wolves than they are like these other wild canids ( Manwell & Baker 1983 , Wayne 1986 , Koler - Matznick 2002 ) .
In fact we do n’t know that the apparent neotenic features of domestic dogs result from artificial selection , given that neoteny can arise via other means , and it should at least be considered that the unwolf - like characters present in domestic dogs indicate derivation from a non-wolf ancestor .
A fairly logical assumption that one might make , were the ‘ domestic wolf ’ model valid , is that the most primitive domestic dogs ( viz , those that had been exposed to the least amount of artificial selection ) would be the most wolf - like of them all .
This would apply both to fossils , and to the most primitive living breeds .
As hinted at above however , archaeological specimens show that old dogs are pretty much the same as modern pariah dogs - there is n’t a series of specimens morphologically intermediate between wolves and domestic dogs - while the most primitive living domestic dogs , the dingos and New Guinea singing dogs for example , are not wolf - like but quite distinct from them behaviourally , socially and morphologically .
Domestic dogs : ancient and genetically distinct
If domestic dogs are wolves , you would expect the two to be very close genetically , certainly closer than universally recognised non-domesticated carnivoran taxa .
Surprisingly for the dogs - are - wolves model , this is not true .
In fact domestic dogs and wolves are ( based on allozyme electrophoresis ) further apart genetically than are leopards and jaguars , and ( based on DNA hybridization ) further apart than some bear species ( Wayne et al. 1991 ) .
A major analysis of mitochondrial DNA in domestic dogs worldwide ( sampling 67 breeds as well as wolves from 27 localities ) found most domestic dogs to belong to a ‘ divergent monophyletic clade * sharing no sequences with wolves ’ , but with some domestic dog clades including some wolf haplotypes , apparently resulting from recent hybridization ( Vilà et al. 1997 ) .
These authors concluded from mitochondrial and nuclear genes that domestic dogs were ancient , and that they had repeatedly interbred with wolves at various times and places throughout their history .
This could be consistent with a derivation of domestic dogs from wolves , but equally it could merely show that hybridization has occurred at various times and places and it may be uninformative as regards ancestry .
Indeed we know that several wolf - like domestic dog breeds ( e.g. , Saarloos wolfhound , Czech wolfhound , American tundra shepherd , American timber shepherd ) were produced by deliberate crossing with wolves .
* The term ‘ monophyletic clade ’ is redundant given that a clade , by definition , is monophyletic .
Included especially for Mike P. Taylor :)
The hardest bit of this story to accept is just how ancient these authors propose domestic dogs to be : the answer is more than 100,000 years old .
Well , we modern members of Homo sapiens are meant to be about that old ( give or take 50,000 years ) , so if that date is accurate , we must have started domesticating dogs as soon as we got out of Africa .
Archaeological evidence for domestic dogs extends back to 14,000 years ( based on a jaw from Germany ) and other studies have suggested an origin at about 15,000 years ago ( Savolainen et al. 2002 ) .
Less securely identified alleged domestic dogs from Russia are perhaps 17,000 years old , but there are no remains approaching 100,000 years in age .
While there are good reasons for thinking that the domestication of dogs probably extends beyond 15,000 years ago ( perhaps to , say , 40,000 years or so ) , the lack of domestic dog prototypes in the archaeological and fossil record has been a problem .
Some supporters of the ‘ domestic wolf ’ model have argued that we have n’t discovered wolf - dog intermediates because , prior to about 15,000 years ago , domestic dogs were morphologically indistinguishable from wolves .
Unfortunately that is totally incompatible with the idea that wolves became domesticated after adopting a jackal - like commensal niche , as strong reduction in size is a requirement for the latter theory .
What might be a domestic dog prototype is known from strata extending back to 200,000 - 500,000 years however , and this is the extinct Chinese canid named C. l. variabilis Pei , 1934 .
Though classified as a small wolf , this form resembles domestic dogs in small size , detailed mandible shape and other features .
Intriguingly , it appears to have been common and morphologically distinct for tens of thousands of years over a wide geographical area , despite sympatry with ‘ normal ’ C. lupus ( Olsen 1985 , Koler - Matznick 2002 ) .
Olsen has noted ( pers. comm. cited in Koler - Matznick 2002 ) that the referral of C. l. variabilis to C. lupus was never satisfactory , and given the features mentioned here it is conceivable that this dog - like form was not really a wolf , but either a separate species ancestral to the domestic dog , or an early representative of C. familiaris .
If domestic dogs are n’t wolves , what are they ?
All of this begs the question : if domestic dogs are n’t wolves , what are they ?
The answer seems to be that Canis familiaris is a distinct species with its own independent history .
Prior to domestication , it presumably existed as a relatively small , generalized canid that voluntarily adopted the commensal pariah niche still occupied by many dog populations today .
This is supported by the morphological and molecular distinctiveness of domestic dogs , by the anatomy and behaviour of primitive domestic dog breeds , and by the archaeological and fossil record .
If this is true then the truly wild ancestors of modern domestic dogs are extinct .
True , there are wild pariah - type dogs in various places around the world ( there are wild populations of New Guinea singing dogs and dingos , for example ) , but they ’ve been introduced by people .
However , the lack of the original wild form in a species that has become domesticated or at least semi-domesticated is not unprecedented nor unusual : Dromedaries Camelus dromedarius , for example , only exist in the wild today in feral form , and are otherwise entirely domesticated , and the wild ancestors of modern domestic horses and cattle are entirely extinct .
In fact the eradication of the wild ancestors of a domestic form is thought by some to one of the key historical events that occurs during the domestication process ( Dobney & Larson 2006 ) .

Before communists came to power in Russia different kind of dirigibles were very popular .
An entry on a police website in a discussion about officers on patrol in Birmingham , said : " They seem to balance the chin strap on their lower lip .
I think that they do it to make themselves look ' hard ' .
I really do n't know what they would do if someone wants to talk to them .
But they do look a complete mess nonetheless . "
Wow .
There ’s a lot of buzz about a huge rally in Philadelphia for Obama last night .
HUGE :
WITH JUST days to go before the Pennsylvania primary , Sen. Barack Obama last night appeared before thousands of roaring supporters in Independence Mall , and pledged to “ declare independence ” from Washington politics .
“ In four days , you get the chance to help bring about the change that we need right now , Philadelphia , ” Obama said .
“ Here in the city and the state that gave birth to our democracy , we can declare our independence from the politics that has shut us out , let us down , and told us to settle . ”
In his first public Philadelphia appearance , Obama stood on stage before the Independence Visitor Center , addressing a rapturous crowd of roughly 35,000 that stretched all the way to Independence Hall .
His warm up acts included will .i.am , lead singer of the Black Eyed Peas .
That has to be one of the biggest political events ever during a primary .
Imagine what the general election will be like .
Rooting around this morning , there is excellent first - hand coverage at a recommended post on DailyKos by Sphexus , with lots of pictures and video — including video of a spontaneous march by thousands of Obama supporters through downtown Philadelphia after the event .
You can probably add these 35,000 people to the list that Hillary does n’t like and does n’t agree with .

Environmental protesters dressed as orang - utans today staged demonstrations against the consumer goods giant Unilever to highlight the destruction of the Indonesian rainforest .
More than 50 Greenpeace activists staged protests at two Unilever sites – a factory in Port Sunlight , on Merseyside , and at the Anglo - Dutch conglomerate 's headquarters , Unilever House , on Victoria Embankment , in London .
The protests coincided with the publication of a Greenpeace report linking Unilever to the destruction of the endangered orang - utan 's habitat .
The report , called Burning Up Borneo , says companies that supply Unilever with palm oil are destroying the Indonesian rainforest .
Greenpeace links the majority of the largest palm oil producers in Indonesia to Unilever , which it says is probably the largest corporate consumer of the oil in the world .
James Turner , a spokesman for Greenpeace at the Victoria Embankment protest , said eight people dressed as orang - utans had climbed ladders to reach a seven metre - high balcony above the entrance of Unilever House at 7.35 am .
" It is going fairly well , " he added .
" We have got a lot of staff to talk to and a lot did not know about the destruction of the rainforest .
" Companies supplying palm oil are destroying the habitats of orang - utans and massively accelerating climate change . "
Campaigners at the Merseyside protest claimed to have stopped production of some of the company 's products .
" This is the start of a really big campaign , " Sarah Shoraka , an activist , said .
" We want Unilever to stop trading with companies that destroy the rainforest to supply palm oil used to make cleaning products .
" They buy from suppliers who are trashing rainforest areas and habitats for orang - utans .
These areas should really be protected .
" Some of the people here are chained to machinery and we have stopped production for some brands .
We will stay here as long as possible before we are moved . "
A spokeswoman for Merseyside police said officers had been called by the company at 6.45 am .
" We are aware of the protest and we are assessing the circumstances , " she said .
Unilever said it was addressing many of the concerns Greenpeace had voiced about the expansion of palm oil production .
The company heads the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil coalition of organisations , which includes Oxfam , WWF , plantation owners , manufacturers and retailers .
It has produced criteria for sustainable palm oil production .
Schools Shut Down to Save on Gas Rural school districts are switching to a four - day week to cut back on busing .
May 29 , 2008  --
The proverbial " snow day " is getting an update for the modern economic times .
We 've all heard of schools closing because of heavy snowfall , but what about high gas prices ?
That 's just what is happening in some of the nation 's most rural and remote school districts .
As the price of gas continues to climb , they 're shutting their doors one day a week in order to save on heating and busing costs .
The MACCRAY School District in western Minnesota voted earlier this month to switch to a four - day school week beginning in September .
The decision to close the schools on Mondays will mean slightly longer hours on the other four days , but it will also mean a three - day weekend , every week .
Struggling With the Economy ?
What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life ?
" We thought about going to a four - day school week because we needed to save money .
We just do n't have money and we would like to try to save as many positions as we can in district , " said superintendent Greg Schmidt .
The three - town district , about 120 miles west of St. Paul , has 700 students spread out over 354 miles .
Some students come from 20 miles away .
The district pays a bus company $ 650,000 a year to operate 11 rural bus routes and one in town .
Switching to a four - day week , Schmidt said , will cut the cost by $ 65,000 .
Turning Down the Thermostats
Gas expenses are n't the only savings the district expects to realize by switching to a four - day school week .
" We 'll turn our thermostats down for a three - day weekend instead of a two - day weekend , " Schmidt said .
" We 'll go from 68 degrees to 60 degrees . "
That could add up to big savings during those not - so - warm Minnesota winters .
" We also think that there will be more of an opportunity for staff to schedule appointments on Mondays so we wo n't have to find subs for them which we estimate to be a little over a $ 10,000 savings , " Schmidt said , adding that the district 's decision was based purely on budgetary concerns .
And it could be permanent .
" In our situation , with our present budget , assuming things go fairly well , I do n't image we would go back to a five - day school week , " Schmidt said .
" I think there will be more and more schools wanting to do something like this if it works out . "
Other Districts Switch to Four - Day Weeks
A four - day school week is not a new idea , but with rising gas prices it does become more appealing .
One of the first — if not the first — districts in the country to switch to such a schedule was Cimarron , N.M.
The Cimarron district made the move to a four - day week in January 1974 in reaction to the oil embargo by Arab nations .
Three decades later , there are 18 districts statewide , including Cimarron , on such schedules , according to the New Mexico Department of Education .
Four - day schedules have also spread to rural areas in other states , including Utah , Oregon , South Dakota and Wyoming .
Colorado , for instance , now has 67 of its 178 districts on a four - day school week .
The Custer School District in South Dakota is now in its 13th year of four - day weeks .
The school system has 900 students spread out over 1,200 square miles , according to superintendent Tim Creal .
Some kids travel more than 30 miles to get to school .
The district saves $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 a year thanks to its schedule , Creal said , with the bulk of that coming from transportation costs .
Also in southwestern South Dakota is the Wall School District , which switched to a four - day schedule three years ago and does not use buses at all .
But it still has transportation costs .
The district has 257 students spread out over 1,320 square miles — more than half the size of Rhode Island .
Instead of buses , the district now reimburses parents for driving their kids to school , according to superintendent Dennis Rieckman .
" We have some ranches that are 30 to 40 miles out one way , " Rieckman said .
" It is n't feasible really to have bus routes , so we pay the mileage . "
Rieckman said the four - day week also gives parents and families more time do things together and leads to fewer student absences .
The nearest place for health care or big shopping , Rieckman said , is Rapid City , about 50 miles away .
If a student needs to see a doctor , parents can now schedule appointments for Friday instead of having children miss out on a day of school .
" It just takes a while to get anywhere .
You just do n't hop in your pickup and drive into town to do anything .
People have to plan out things first , " he said .
" You do n't just get in your vehicle and run down to the local Wal - Mart . "

If you ’ve never visited the Answers in Genesis website , do n’t worry .
You ’ve missed little .
But this little gem caught my eye .
Apparently , a creation believer wrote in to their feedback asking a rational question : why is it whenever I repeat one of the “ facts ” I learn in creationist literature in internet forums do I get my ass handed to me .
Okay .
I ’m paraphrasing a bit .
But the question is basically saying just that .
The person writing in to AiG was specifically concerned with the creationist claim that mutations are not beneficial and do not add information to an organism .
The person was also upset that his / her son wrote a paper for school , which was criticized by the son ’s geology teacher as “ full of inaccuracies . ”
And the answer provided by this creationist nut site is very telling .
Their response was to say the following :
1 ) people interpret evidence based on presuppositions
2 ) historical sciences cannot be tested or shown to be repeatable
3 ) the sciences that give us MRIs , planes , and vaccines are “ here and now ” sciences
4 ) historical sciences are laden with “ presuppositions ” but not “ here and now ” sciences
5 ) natural selection provides no new information
6 ) thus , evolution , is not supported by science
Here ’s my comments to these points :
1 ) The first point is interesting .
AiG concedes that bias and preconceived conclusions cloud rational thought and the ability to evaluate evidence .
The difference between creationists and those that embrace science over superstition is that they ’re open to being swayed by evidence .
Creationists are concerned only with that evidence that supports their conclusions .
After all , the Bible says its true , and the Bible is right because it ’s God ’s word , which we know because the Bible says it ’s so .
Therefore , any evidence obtained through observation and testable hypotheses must be mis-interpreted by mere mortals who call themselves scientists .
Indeed , the superstitious will simply toss out such evidence , dismissing it out of hand .
And this is n’t a trait found only among creationists .
Superstitious people the world over exhibit the same type of behavior whether they be the Fulani of West Africa or the pitcher of a major league baseball team .
2 ) And this brings us to the second point that evolution cannot be tested or repeatable .
In fact , it ’s no unimportant fact that AiG specifically mentiones “ historical science ” as being without any testable or repeatable properties .
This , by default , would include their own “ creation science , ” which is , by their definition , “ historical . ”
Creationists consistently use this fallacy but I think its due to ignorance more than deceit .
They simply have a low grasp of how science works and have already separated so - called “ historical sciences ” from the rest of science .
Geologists , archaeologists , paleontologists , biologists , chemists , geneticists and so on all work with scientific principles and methods and they are each sciences that explore evolution .
The most obvious historical science among them is , perhaps , archaeology and it is replete with testable and repeatable science .
If not , much of what we know about ancient cultures would be non-existant .
Luckily , there are more questions than answers in every science ( otherwise science would be boring ) , but no scientist is sure he has all the answers .
The superstitious , however , begin their day with a belief that they already have an answer and if science comes along and challenges that belief then it obviously must be wrong .
Testing evolution happens all the time and a simple example is the prediction that reptile arms when seriated in the fossil record shows a steady progression from arm - like to wing - like .
Which is what we see .
Moreover , the prediction can be made that we will not find wings where they should n’t be ( potential falsification ) such as on oysters or horses .
Nor would you see arms where they should n’t be , such as a bird with both wings and arms .
And these predictions ( tests ) are reproducible time and again ( repeatable ) .
3 ) While there are some different methods utilized by different sciences ( archaeology might employ different methods of science than astronomy ) , in general , they are all performing science - that is to say , they all value rational observation of the natural world and do not entertain superstitious and supernatural explanations .
So the MRIs , planes and vaccines that creationists are so fond of were developed by the same sort of science used in biology , geology , chemistry , and astronomy .
Indeed , some of the exact same principles are involved .
4 ) Therefore , “ historical sciences ” are no more subject to “ presuppositions ” than any other science if the scientist is willing to accept evidence , test hypotheses , and accept that falsification is possible .
The “ presuppositions ” ( a.k.a. preconceived conclusions ) exist nearly exclusively with the superstitious who are n’t willing to re-evaluate their beliefs in the face of evidence .
Mountains upon mountains of it .
5 ) This completely unfounded and unscientific claim has been busted time and again .
So much that there simply is n’t reason to do more than provide a few links :
Apolipoprotein AI Mutations and Information
The Nylon Bug
Are Mutations Harmful ?
6 ) Evolution is almost entirely comprised of science .
To say otherwise is to reveal ignorance , a failed education , deceit , or a fear of learning the truth .

Scientists will track the iceberg as it melts over the next decade
An enormous Antarctic iceberg will be known as " Melting Bob " after being named by a Hampshire schoolboy .
Melting Bob is three times the size of Greater London with a surface area of 1,985sq miles ( 5,141sq km ) and had been referred to by a codename - C19A .
But Max Dolan , aged six , from Winchester , won the Scott Polar Research Institute competition .
Organisers said it is the first time an iceberg has been known other than by its numeric codename and co-ordinates .
Scientists will track Melting Bob over the next decade in the Southern Ocean .
Max , who attends St Bede Church of England Primary School , was entered into the competition at the Hay Literary Festival by his mother and beat 500 entrants to the prize .
Bobbing action
" The iceberg bobs in the water and is melting " , Max said about his inspiration .
" It 's huge and cool . "
Entries were judged by Professor Julian Dowdeswell , the director of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University , and author Dame Jacqueline Wilson .
" I like the name because it encompasses the two ways in which icebergs become smaller - by melting , of course , but also by fragmentation which is caused by flexing in ocean waves , " said Prof Dowdeswell .
" This flexing could be regarded as the bobbing of the winning suggestion . "
Melting Bob was created in May 2002 when it cleaved from the Ross ice shelf .
Only one - tenth of an iceberg can be seen above the water .
This conclusion about the cause of the disaster contradicts Robert E. Murray , the chief executive of the Murray Energy Corporation , which owns and operates the mine .
Mr. Murray has adamantly insisted that the initial fatalities were not foreseeable because the collapse was caused by an earthquake rather than by mining operations .
Federal mining officials , who have publicly expressed skepticism that an earthquake caused the collapse , are due to release their own investigation report in June .
The counsel for Murray Energy , Kevin N. Anderson , attacked the report and accused Mr. Miller of disclosing “ unfounded conclusions ” and trying “ to concoct a criminal referral concerning the tragedy . ”
He said in a statement that the company was more interested to see what federal mine safety officials found in their investigation .
He added that the call for a criminal investigation was a “ callous inference ” based on “ a radically incomplete review of the facts . ”
But a lawyer for relatives of the dead miners said the findings in the report were troubling .
“ The nine miners who died would all be alive today if Murray Energy had heeded the clear warning signs that were there to see after the March bounce , ” said Colin King , a lawyer in Salt Lake City .
“ Instead the company continued with its same plan to pull out all the coal because of their greed and that makes their conduct worse than negligent . ”
He said the families filed a lawsuit against the company last month .
At the time of the disaster , the mining company was conducting retreat mining , a risky type of extraction that requires miners to remove coal from the very pillars that hold up the tunnels , allowing controlled roof collapses .
Aside from missing clear warnings , mine operators seemed to have tried to conceal their own culpability , the report said .
Deposed by the committee , one federal mining official , Allyn Davis , who inspected photographs of the mine after the March bump , said that the images differed significantly from the description of the event given to him by the mine manager , Laine Adair .
The first debates after the Iowa caucuses were a crucible for the candidates , but they were also a test of the Gibson Doctrine .
ABC ’s anchor , Charles Gibson , began the evening with a policy statement : “ The less of a moderator , the better . ”
Last night , however , a little more moderator would have been for the best .
Charles Gibson ’s low - key , avuncular style was a counterpoint to the aggressive cross-examinations of Tim Russert , of NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” in the debates he moderated .
But in the end , Mr. Gibson ’s approach came off as passive - aggressive .
At certain moments , he loftily lectured the candidates .
He scolded the Republicans for “ intellectual dishonesty ” about oil prices .
He mocked Democrats who promised to change Washington , saying , “ God love you all . ”
But Mr. Gibson withdrew whenever the discussions grew heated .
And by not intervening more forcefully early on in the Republican debate , he allowed much of their discussion to remain staid and uninformative  Representative Ron Paul , of all candidates , dominated the foreign policy debate .
D for Xcode
Download
D for Xcode , 1.2.2 ( 175 Kb ) Installer package for D for Xcode .
March 28 , 2011 .
March 16 , 2013 : this installer package is no longer capable of downloading DMD .
Source code , 1.2.2 ( 173 Kb ) Source code for building the plugin on your own .
You can track the development of this project using the Git repository mirror accessible from git.michelf.ca .
To Xcode 4 users : D for Xcode is only partially working with Xcode 4 currently ; version 3 of Xcode is fully supported .
Introduction
D for Xcode makes it easy to develop tools , libraries , and applications in the D programming language using Apple ’s Xcode IDE .
The plugin does the following things :
It adds to Xcode support for the DMD and the GDC D compilers so that D source files are recognized and compile in the same way as C , C++ , and Objective - C files .
Once you ’ve added a D source file to a project or target , options specific to the D compiler will appear in the build settings .
It allows Xcode to track dependencies between files ( by looking for import declarations ) and automatically recompile files when a dependency has been modified .
It adds syntax highlighting for D source files .
It populates the outline menu in the editor ’s navigation bar with a list of functions , classes , and other constructs found in your D source file ( only for Xcode 3.x ) .
It provide icons for .d and .di files in the Finder and elsewhere on the system , and it makes D files open with Xcode by default .
Requirements
Xcode 2.5 or later , Xcode 3.x recommended
Note : Support for Xcode 2.5 does not include the outline menu in the editor ’s navigation bar .
Installation
Download and open the provided installer package .
The installer package will automatically download and install the DMD 2.x and 1.x compilers ( only on Intel Macs ) .
Here is a detailed description of what is installed for each subpackage :
D plugin for Xcode
Installs the Xcode plugin at / Library / Application Support / Developer / Shared / Xcode / Plugins /
Xcode File & Project Templates
Installs file and project templates for Xcode at / Library / Application Support / Developer / Shared / Xcode /
DMD 2.x Download ( Note : not working anymore )
Downloads the latest version of DMD 2.x and installs it at / Library / Compilers / dmd2 .
Also installs symbolic links in /usr / local / to make dmd callable from the command line .
DMD 1.x Download ( Note : not working anymore )
Downloads the latest version of DMD 1.x and installs it at / Library / Compilers / dmd .
Also installs symbolic links in /usr / local / to make dmd callable from the command line .
Both DMD 2.x and DMD 1.x contains an executable called dmd .
Symbolic links installed in /usr / local / are named respectively dmd2 and dmd1 so you can easily invoke a specific version of the compiler using one of these commands .
The dmd symbolic link points to dmd2 by default , but you can change this using setdmd like this :
sudo setdmd 1
You can later install a newer version of DMD by running again the installer package .
Alternatively , you can drop a freshly unpacked dmd or dmd2 folder at / Library / Compilers / , but then you should make sure the file permissions are correctly setup ( zip files coming from Digital Mars tend to miss a few executable bits ) .
Screenshots
Known Issues
Debugger support is mostly lacking .
You ’ll be able to see a backtrace of mangled function names , but that ’s all the GNU Debugger is able to see from executables compiled by DMD at this time .
Breakpoints are not supported .
Executables compiled with GDC might actually be usable for debugging , but this has n’t been tested for a while .
Syntax - aware indentation is sometime wrong for constructs which are not present in C++/ Objective - C , like foreach .
It ’s uncertain if this can be fixed .
You can disable syntax - aware indentation from Xcode preferences if this bothers you .
Code completion is n’t done very intelligently at this time .
It ’ll just propose keywords and identifiers found in the same document .
There is no indexing support for D source files .
It is therefore not possible to use jump to definition or similar commands .
Module Dependencies
The compiler and the dependency checker assumes the directory your project file is located in is where you ’re editing modules .
This means that a module named mypackage .
mymodule must be located at PROJECT_DIR / mypackage / mymodule.d .
You can add other module directories ( if you want to include libraries for instance ) , but the dependency graph does n’t take them into account and your files depending on them wo n’t be recompiled automatically if you change them ( you ’ll need to clean the target first ) .
Let me know if this is a problem for you .
Bug Reports
If you find a problem , whether it ’s crashing Xcode or not , I ’d like to know about it .
Please give me any relevant information ( such as Xcode version , and a crash logs if Xcode crashes ) and the appropriate steps , or files , to replicate the problem ( so I can debug it locally ) .
You can send bug reports at this address : michel.fortin@michelf.ca .
License
D for Xcode is available under the GNU General Public License , version 2 or later .
Version History
D for Xcode 1.2.1 ( 16 Jan 2011 )
Fixed a link failure complaining about a missing “ druntime ” library on some systems .
Preliminary but very incomplete support for Xcode 4 beta .
D for Xcode 1.2 ( 21 Mar 2010 )
Added an installer package .
A default install will download and install the latest version of the DMD 2.x and 1.x compiler in / Library / Compilers / .
The installer package will add the proper symbolic links in /usr / local / to make DMD work properly without fussing with your PATH environment variable .
The dmd2 command invokes DMD 2.x while dmd1 invokes DMD 1.x. dmd maps to one of these two ( dmd2 by default but you can change this with setdmd ) .
Updated the keyword list for syntax highlighting , improved code folding , and other enhancements in the source scanner .
Added special scanner code for strings and comments in Xcode 3 .
Nested comment and all D string syntaxes are now correctly highlighted as strings .
D files are now recognized correctly by default in Xcode 3 .
Previously they were assinged the sourcecode .
dtrace type ( which shares the same file extension ) ; now sourcecode.d takes precedence when files are added to a project .
You can manually change the file type from the file info panel in Xcode .
Fixed the dependency tree generation which was broken by Xcode 3.1 .
Got rid of the embedded DMD front end for syntax highlighting , now using a custom lightweight parser for dependency scanning and a custom source scanner for syntax highlighing in Xcode 2.x .
Removed support for the outline menu in Xcode 2.x which was using the DMD front end and was too time - consuming to keep up to date .
The outline is still available in Xcode 3 based on its newer source scanning facilities .
D for Xcode 1.1b2 ( 21 Sep 2008 )
Improved code folding .
Fixed a problem where a wrong linker command was issued under Xcode 3.1 .
D for Xcode 1.1b1 ( 31 May 2008 )
Updated the build process and other parts of the plugin to work with Xcode 3 on Leopard .
The plugin continue to work with all previously supported versions of Xcode ( 2.4 and 2.5 ) .
Created a new set of rules for syntax highlighting suitable for Xcode 3 with support for code folding .
D for Xcode 1.0.1 ( November 23 , 2007 )
The plugin now registers its launcher application when loaded into Xcode .
Previously it was counting on the Finder to register it while copying the plugin , but that is n’t always reliable ; hence the need for a backup plan .
D for Xcode 1.0 ( November 20 , 2007 )
Here 's a list of every function beginning with the letter " A " in the PHP function index :
I remember my first experience with PHP way back in 2001 .
Despite my questionable pedigree in ASP and Visual Basic , browsing an alphabetical PHP function list was enough to scare me away for years .
Somehow , perusing the above list , I do n't think things have improved a whole lot since then .
I 'm no language elitist , but language design is hard .
There 's a reason that some of the most famous computer scientists in the world are also language designers .
And it 's a crying shame none of them ever had the opportunity to work on PHP .
From what I 've seen of it , PHP is n't so much a language as a random collection of arbitrary stuff , a virtual explosion at the keyword and function factory .
Bear in mind this is coming from a guy who was weaned on BASIC , a language that gets about as much respect as Rodney Dangerfield .
So I am not unfamiliar with the genre .
Of course , this is old news .
How old ?
Ancient .
Internet Explorer 4 old .
The internet is overrun with PHP sucks articles – I practically ran out of browser tabs opening them all .
Tim Bray bravely bucked this trend and went with the title
On PHP for his entry in the long - running series :
So here 's my problem , based on my limited experience with PHP ( deploying a couple of free apps to do this and that , and debugging a site for a non-technical friend here and there ) : all the PHP code I 've seen in that experience has been messy , unmaintainable crap .
Spaghetti SQL wrapped in spaghetti PHP wrapped in spaghetti HTML , replicated in slightly - varying form in dozens of places .
Tim 's article is as good a place to start as any ; he captured a flock of related links in the ensuing discussion .
As you read , you 'll find there 's an obvious parallel between the amateurish state of PHP development and Visual Basic 6 , a comparison that many developers have independently arrived at .
Fredrik Holmstrm :
Every solution I 've ever seen or developed in PHP feels clunky and bulky , there is no elegance or grace .
Working with PHP is a bit like throwing a 10 pound concrete cube from a ten story building :
You 'll get where you 're going fast , but it 's not very elegant .
... I love PHP , and it 's the right tool for some jobs .
It 's just an ugly , cumbersome tool that makes me cry and have nightmares .
It 's the new VB6 in a C dress .
Karl Seguin
From my own experience , and the countless of online tutorials and blogs , many PHP developers are guilty of the same crap code VB developers were once renowned for .
OO , N - Tier , exception handling , domain modeling , refactoring and unit testing are all foreign concepts in the PHP world .
Understand that as a long time VB developer , I am completely sympathetic to the derision you 'll suffer when programming in a wildly popular programming language that is n't considered " professional " .
I 've written both VB and PHP code , and in my opinion the comparison is grossly unfair to Visual Basic .
Does PHP suck ?
Of course it sucks .
Did you read any of the links in Tim 's blog entry ?
It 's a galactic supernova of incomprehensibly colossal , mind - bendingly awful suck .
If you sit down to program in PHP and have even an ounce of programming talent in your entire body , there 's no possible way to draw any other conclusion .
It 's inescapable .
But I 'm also here to tell you that does n't matter .
The TIOBE community index I linked above ?
It 's written in PHP .
Wikipedia , which is likely to be on the first page of anything you search for these days ?
Written in PHP .
Digg , the social bookmarking service so wildly popular that a front page link can crush the beefiest of webservers ?
Written in PHP .
WordPress , arguably the most popular blogging solution available at the moment ?
Written in PHP .
YouTube , the most widely known video sharing site on the internet ?
Written in PHP .
Facebook , the current billion - dollar zombie - poking social networking darling of venture capitalists everywhere ?
Written in PHP .
( Update : While YouTube was originally written in PHP , it migrated to Python fairly early on , per Matt Cutts and Guido van Rossum . )
Notice a pattern here ?
Some of the largest sites on the internet – sites you probably interact with on a daily basis – are written in PHP .
If PHP sucks so profoundly , why is it powering so much of the internet ?
The only conclusion I can draw is that building a compelling application is far more important than choice of language .
While PHP would n't be my choice , and if pressed , I might argue that it should never be the choice for any rational human being sitting in front of a computer , I can't argue with the results .
You 've probably heard that sufficiently incompetent coders can write FORTRAN in any language .
It 's true .
But the converse is also true : sufficiently talented coders can write great applications in terrible languages , too .
It 's a painful lesson , but an important one .
