1 Introduction
Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) technology , using the ISO - 14443 standard [ ISO00 ] , is rapidly becoming widely adopted by many governmental , industrial and commercial bodies .
Typical applications include contactless credit- cards , national - ID cards , E - passports , and physical access control ( cf. [ Fin03 ] , [ GSA04 ] ) .
The security of such applications is clearly critical .
A key security feature of RFID - based systems is their very short range : ISO - 14443 systems are designed to operate at a range of 5 - 10 cm .
Thus , the perception is that the RFID tag ( or smartcard ) must almost touch the RFID reader , which should imply that the tag 's owner is physically present and holding the tag .
Unfortunately , this perception is incorrect .
Recently , Kfir and Wool [ KW05 ] described a relay - attack on RFID systems , that violates the implication that the tag being read is in fact near the RFID reader .
Their system architecture involves two devices , a ``leech ' ' and a ``ghost '' , that communicate with each other ( see Figure 1 ) .
Such a system would , for instance , allow an attacker to make purchases using a victim 's RFID - enhanced credit card -- despite any cryptographic protocols that may be used .
As part of their work , [ KW05 ] predicted that the rogue ``leech '' device can communicate with an ISO - 14443 RFID tag from a distance of 40 - 50 cm , based on modeling and simulations .
Moreover , they claimed that such a device can be made portable , with low power requirements , and can be built very cheaply .
However , beyond acting as a component in a relay - attack , a ``leech ' ' can also be used as a stand - alone RFID skimmer , to surreptitiously read the contents of simple RFID tags .
Our goal in this work was to actually build such a skimmer .

1 . 2 Related work
The starting point of our work is [ KW05 ] .
Their analysis predicts that an RFID tag can be read by the ``leech ' ' from a range of tens of centimeters , much further than the nominal ISO - 14443 range of 5 - 10 cm .
They also claimed that the ``ghost '' device can communicate with the reader from distance of tens of meters .
[ KW05 ] presented several variants of possible relay - attack implementations , with different costs and required personnel skills .
In this work we validate their claims about the practically of the leech device .
Another part of the relay attack against ISO 14443A RFID systems was implemented by Hancke [ Han05 ] :
He implemented the fast digital communication between the leech and the ghost ( see Figure 1 ) , while using standard ( nominal range ) devices for the leech and ghost themselves .
His system used cheap radios , and achieved a range of 50 meters between the reader + ghost and the leech +tag .
His work demonstrates that the range between the victim tag and the reader is limited only by the technology used for leech - ghost communication .
To counter the relay attack , [ HK05 ] have designed a distance - bounding protocol , which requires ultra - wide - band communication .
In a widely reported work , Finke and Kelter [ FK05 ] ) managed to eavesdrop on the communication between an ISO - 14443 RFID reader and a tag .
They attached the tag directly to a reader ( at zero distance ) , and showed that the combined communication between the reader and tag can be read from 1 - 2 meters by large loop antenna located on the same plane of the reader and the tag .
Note that this is quite different from the challenges facing a skimmer : ( a) The skimmer must be close enough to the tag , and produce a strong enough magnetic field , to power the tag ( i.e. , the tag must be within ``activation range ' ' ) ; ( b) A skimmer cannot rely on a legitimate reader 's strong signal being modulated by the tag .
Nevertheless , [ FK05 ] shows that the eavesdropping range on RFID communication is a much greater than skimming range -- and we show that skimming range is much greater than the nominal read range .
There are many RFID systems that do not use the ISO - 14443 standard .
Typically , such systems are designed for larger read - ranges , but provide much more limited capabilities than ISO - 14443 : they are unable to power a programmable smartcard processor , and usually only contain fixed logic circuitry or even just a short piece of data , much like a magnetic - stripe card .
Over the last 2 years , several attacks have been reported against some of these systems .
In a very widely reported event [ Kre05 , Sch05 ] , a group from Flexilis claimed to set new world record of passively reading an RFID tag from 69 feet at DefCon'05 .
However , the RFID technology used for this experiment was not ISO - 14443 , but a UHF - based technology in the frequency range of 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz which is designed for a much larger read range .
A German hacker ( [ Hes04 ] ) used a simple PDA , equipped with an RFID read / write device , and changed product prices in a grocery shop using a software he wrote .
He managed to reduce the Shampoo price from $ 7 to $ 3 and go through the cashier without incident .
Supermarket checkout trials held by NCR corporation showed that some clients standing at the cashier paid for groceries held by clients standing behind them in the queue [ Whi05 ] .
A research team in Johns Hopkins University ( [ BGS+05 ] ) managed to build a system that sniffs information from RFID - based car keys and immobilizers , and were able to purchase gasoline without the owners consent .
A research group in MIT ( [ Lin05 ] ) designed and implemented an RFID field probe that can sense RFID magnetic fields from up to 4 meters .
However , it is designed to sense magnetic fields of frequencies between 900 to 950 MHz , which are very different from the 13.56 MHz of the ISO 14443 standard .
A broad overview of RFID technology can be found in T.A.Scharfeld 's thesis [ Sch01 ] .
This thesis analyzes RFID theory , standards , regulations , environment influence , and implementation issues .
Free attack / analysis tools that detect RFID cards and show their meta information are available from the RFDump web site [ GW04 ] .
These tools are able to display and modify the card data , such as the card ID , card type , manufacturer etc .
Juels , Rivest and Szydlo [ JRS03 ] propose a blocking tag approach that prevents the reader from connecting with the RFID tag .
Their method can also be used as malicious tool :
In order to disrupt the Reader - to - Tag communication , their blocker tag actually performs a denial - of - service attack against the RFID reader protocol by using the ``Tree - Walking Singulation Algorithm '' in the anti-collision mechanism .
Juels and Brainard [ JB04 ] propose a variant on the blocker concept which involves software modification to achieve a soft blocking tag .
[ Wei03 ] and [ SWE02 ] offer a ` `Hash - Lock ' ' approach to low cost RFID devices which use a ``lock / unlock ' ' mechanism to protect against retrieving the RFID ID number .
In the simplest scenario , when the tag is locked it is given a value ( or meta - ID ) y , and it is only unlocked by presentation of a key value x such that y = h(x ) for a standard one - way hash function h .
[ RCT05 ] describe a portable device , called an RFID Guardian , that is supposed to cover a whole individual 's surrounding , to communicate with the various tags in the person 's possession , and protect the person from potentially hostile RFID fields .
The RFID Guardian is supposed to be able to cover a range of 1 - 2 meters , however , the authors do not describe the RFID Guardian implementation , and it is unclear how it overcomes the physical limitations of the claimed range .
1 . 3 Contribution
In this study we show that the modeling predictions of [ KW05 ] are quite accurate .
We managed to build a portable , extended - range RFID skimmer , using only electronics hobbyist supplies and tools .
Our skimmer is able to read ISO - 14443 tags from a distance of 25 cm , uses a lightweight 40 cm - diameter copper - tube antenna , is powered by a 12V battery -- and requires a budget of $ 100 .
Beyond validating the theoretical modeling , we believe that our design , implementation and tuning processes are of independent interest :
Most circuit designs and application notes are written for well equipped RF labs , and we needed to modify them or design our own to meet our ridiculously low budget .
In particular , our experience shows that the standard RFID tuning process , described in ISO 10373 - 6 ( [ ISO01 ] , is inappropriate for hobbyist workshops , and may be missing some key details that are necessary to make it work .
Instead , we describe several tuning processes that do work reliably , even in low - budget environments .
We conclude that ( a ) ISO - 14443 RFID tags can be skimmed from a distance that does not require the attacker to touch the victim ; ( b ) Simple RFID tags , that respond to any reader , are immediately vulnerable to skimming ; and ( c ) We are about half - way toward a full - blown implementation of the relay - attack predicted by [ KW05 ] .

Section 3 describes our construction techniques .
Section 4 details the tuning methods we experimented with .
Section 5 describes the skimmer 's actual performance , and we conclude with Section 6 .
Additional details can be found in an appendix .
2 System Design
There are two design paradigms that can be followed ; the ``normal '' paradigm is to design all the system sub-units to have a uniform 50 input and output impedance .
The other paradigm is to design and implement a proprietary RF system , with non-standard characteristics .
The advantages of using standard design include the variety of ready - to - use designs , applications notes , and test equipment .
The resulting system is scalable , versatile , and modular .
However , the need for accurate design , dealing with accurate filters and semiconductor 's min-max parameters and ratings , stretches the design and implementation time , and may cause long and tedious system testing and tuning .
In contrast , designing a proprietary , non-standard interface systems has some practical advantages .
First , accuracy is no longer mandatory .
Second , the system can work in its natural output and input characteristics without the need to adjust its interfaces to standard characteristics , that might need extra matching networks and components .
In particular , some amplifier designs have an output impedance that differs from 50 , and their designated antennas ' impedance is closer to the amplifier 's impedance than to 50 .
In this case , there is no sense to adjust both amplifier output and antenna input to 50 .
Since our goal was to emulate a hacker , we chose to follow the proprietary design paradigm .
We used 50 designs where they suited our needs , but we did not attempt to tune all the sub-units precisely .
As we shall see , the results were quite satisfactory , despite the very basic work environment and tools .
Figure 2 : Extended Range RFID Skimmer .
2 . 2 System Units
Our main objective was to increase the output power and antenna size as these two factors directly influence the reading range .
In addition to the basic S4100 module , we purchased the RX - MFR - RLNK - 00 Texas Instrument Multi-Function Reader evaluation kit .
The evaluation kit costs $ 650 and contains a complete ready - to - use reader , which is built around the S4100 module .
The kit includes a small built - in 8.5 cm loop antenna and is assembled in a plastic box .
It is supplied with basic demo software , various tags for its supported protocols , documentation and references .
The kit has an RS232 serial port for interfacing a host computer .
We measured a reading range of 6.5 cm using its built in antenna .
Although we could have used the ( dismantled ) evaluation kit 's main board for our experimentation , we chose to build our own base board to demonstrate that buying the evaluation kit is not required .
We followed the Interface Circuitry design suggested by TI ( [ TI03 ] ) , but omitted the Low Frequency LED driver .
We could have omitted the RS232 level shifters and use TTL levels for the serial port communication , however , the skimmer is supposed to work near the antenna , and to be exposed to strong and noisy electro - magnetic fields , therefore we included common RS232 level shifters in our base board design .
This design requires a 5 volts power supply .
See Section 2.7 for power supply design and description .

TI 's RFID Web site [ TI04 ] supplies an antenna cookbook for building various kinds of antennas for different reading ranges and purposes .
As a first experiment , we used a printed PCB 10 x 15 cm rectangular antenna design found in the cookbook .
We later used it as a tuning aid for tuning the system , as described in Section 4 .
Figure 3 shows the PCB antenna 's matching circuit .
Figure 3 : The PCB Antenna 50
For our larger , high power antenna , we constructed a 39 cm copper tube loop antenna .
The basic design for the loop antenna 's matching network was taken from the PCB antenna ( Figure 3 ) , subject to minor changes : Specifically , the resonance parallel capacitors C33 and C34 that were merged into one capacitor of 82 pF , since the calculated antenna 's inductance was around 1 H .

2 . 6 The Load Modulation Receive Buffer
This receiver input is unable to handle the voltage levels that are developed on our large loop antenna : During the system development process we measured 184 volts over the antenna with a supply voltage of 17.1 volts .
In order to keep the reader from potential damage , and still deliver the load modulation signals to the reader 's receiver input , we had to attenuate the antenna signals before feeding them back to the TI module .
A simple resistor attenuation network is not suitable since it dramatically influences the antenna 's resonance circuit quality factor , Q . Therefore , we chose to use an attenuating buffer ( See Figure 5 ) .
The buffer was designed using a high impedance RF FET ( T2 in Figure 5 ) , in order to keep the antenna 's quality factor as designed .
The buffer was attached to the antenna and to the TI module via a direct coupling connection , in order to reduce the signal phase shifting to minimum .
The C21 variable capacitor is used to compensate for the parasitic capacitance introduced by the T2 FET .
Figure 5 : The Load Modulation Receive Path buffer .
2 . 7 The Power Supply
For lab work , we used a stabilized external power supply .
Note that the base board that embeds the TI module contains a voltage regulator , therefore the external power supply unit does not have to be regulated .
Nevertheless , we used a regulated power supply to reduce its noise figure .
Figure 6 shows the regulation and filtering circuity which we placed on the base board and on the power amplifier board .
The role of L52 in Figure 6 is to maintain clean and low ripple levels on the DC supply in order to keep a low noise figure of the DC supply voltage .
Since the DC supply voltage reaches all the internal chips circuitry , having clean DC voltage to the internal load modulation signals detection circuitry can improve detection range .
To demonstrate the skimmer 's mobility , we also operated it using a Non-Spillable 7 AH Zinc - Lead rechargeable battery used in home security systems .
It has a 12 volts nominal voltage level , is very common and can be purchased in any home security system store .
An added bonus of using a non-switched DC power supply is that it eliminates any switching noise .

We built the loop antenna from 5/16 inch cooking gas copper tube .
The tube is tied to a solid non flexible wooden tablet , in order to maintain its shape and to avoid inductance changes under mechanical deformation forces .
The loop antenna construction process was basically mechanical handcraft work , requiring no special equipment beyond basic amateur 's electrical tools .
Note that copper tube must be soldered using at least a 100 - watts blow torch .
Figure 7 shows the finished copper tube antenna and the PCB antenna .
Figure 7 : The copper -tube loop antenna and the PCB Antenna .
We manufactured the RFID base board PCB using a different method than we used to make the PCB antenna .
For this board , we used a Decon DALO 33 Blue PC Etch protected ink pen to draw the leads on the Glass - Epoxy tablet .
This technique allowed us to print the PCB during any time of day , without the need to wait for the sun .
See Figure 8 for a picture of the base board .
Figure 8 : The TI S4100 module mounted on our base board on the left , and the power amplifier board on the right .
Beyond the Melexis design , empirical results led us to connect a filter comprised of R2 and C4 at the output ( See Figure 4 ) .
This filter reduces the Q of the output impedance matching filter , enabling fine tuning of the output signal phase .
We discovered that the filter increased the read range significantly .
The output voltage amplitude of the power amplifier varies depending on the power supply voltage .
For instance , with a 17.1 volts power supply we measured over 180 volts on the resonance circuit and the antenna .
Therefore , ideally , high voltage rating capacitors , and high current rating inductors should be used .
We used regular , but easy to obtain , passive components , and managed to burn quite a few during our experimentation .
3 . 5 Building the Load Modulation Receive Path Buffer
One challenge we had to deal with is that the TI S4100 module is designed to work with a low power antenna , and includes an attenuation resistor that is suitable for such an antenna .
In order to provide our ( attenuated ) signals to the S4100 , we had to solder the buffer 's output directly into the S4100 module , bypassing the original attenuation resistor .
Figure 9 shows the bypass .
Figure 9 : The direct connection to the TI module , bypassing the existing attenuation resistor .
4 System Tuning
The first and most straightforward tuning method is to use an RF network analyzer .
Among its various features , a network analyzer can measure the magnitude and phase of a system input , allowing us to know exactly what matching network to connect to this system in order to match it to the desired impedance .
In our case , a network analyzer can measure the antenna input impedance , e.g. , its phase and magnitude , which would enable us to calculate the matching circuitry for 50 input impedance .
In case we already have a matching network , the RF network analyzer can measure the return loss and let us tune the system to minimum returned power .
Unfortunately , an RF network analyzer costs over $ 10,000 , well beyond the budget of an amateur .
Another tuning method is to measure the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio ( VSWR ) , and to adjust the antenna 's impedance to be best matched to the driving amplifier output stage by tuning the returned power to the desired value ( [ Poz05 ] ) .
This method requires a VSWR meter , which costs several hundred US $ : still beyond a typical hobbyist budget .
A cheap way to measure the VSWR ( without a VSWR meter ) is to use directional couplers , that cost between $ 20 - $ 70 , but their input and output impedance is 50 , requiring 50 interface subsystems design .
We have not attempted this method .
Finally , one can tune the system using an RF watt - meter , or an RF power meter .
These instruments sense the RF power and translate the sensor 's measurement to a standard scale .
The sensor can be based on a diode , or on a bolometer : an RF power sensor whose operation is based on sensing purely resistive element radiation .
This method is a second - order - effect tuning since it measures the antenna power reception rather than the actual direct amplifier to antenna matching .
This kind of equipment costs between $ 300 ( used ) to $ 600 for a simple watt - meter , including the sensor , to about $ 3000 for an RF power meter that also features a VSWR meter and various other RF measurement capabilities .
The ISO 10373 - 6 testing configuration is based on monitoring a phase difference between the signal source and the load .
The monitoring device utilizes a standard oscilloscope for displaying Lissajous figures in XY display mode , see Figure 10 .
If the time constant of the reference network equals the time constant of the network formed by the calibration resistor along with the oscilloscope Y probe 's parasitic capacitance , no phase difference should be monitored .
If there is a difference in the two time constants , there will be a phase shift between the two probes of the oscilloscope , and the Lissajous figure should form an ellipse , whose main axis is at a 45 - degree angle .
The ``fatness '' of ellipse is related to the phase difference : when the system is perfectly tuned , there is no phase difference , and the Lissajous figure collapses to a straight line .
Figure 10 : The ISO - 10373 setting -- Matching the antenna input impedance to 50
[ ISO01 ] has two steps .
The first step calibrates the test set to eliminate the oscilloscope input impedance from influencing the tuning step .
In this step , the impedance matching network and the antenna of Figure 10 are replaced with a 50 resistor to simulate 50 load .
The second step is the actual antenna tuning step .
In this step , we replace the calibration resistor with the antenna containing the matching circuit , and trim the capacitors until we monitor that the Lissajous figure is closed , indicating a zero phase shift .
The first thing to note is that this tuning method requires a 13.56 MHz signal source , with a 50 output impedance , that can deliver enough power to drive an antenna such as our copper tube antenna .
We invested a significant effort trying to build a clean and accurate signal source , but this turned out to be difficult to do in reasonable time .
Even obtaining an accurate 13.56 MHz crystal proved to be problematic -- none of the electronics suppliers we contacted carried such a component .
To bypass this obstacle , we decided to use the TI S4100 module itself as a signal source -- since it is matched to 50 and can drive sufficient power to the antenna .
Once we did this , we were able to construct the rest of the circuitry , and we tried to tune the antenna .
Unfortunately , in all possible settings of the antenna 's matching circuitry , we did not manage to get the expected Lissajous figures .
In some settings we got wavy figures implying a non linear circuit working point .
In other settings we did not get the figures centered around the desired 45 degrees slope .
Worst of all , we found no correlation between more closed Lissajous figures and longer read ranges ( which we obtained using the methods of sections 4.2 and 4.3 .
To our frustration , we found that ISO 10373 - 6 does not specify the exact oscilloscope Volt per Division setting .
This level of detail matters since we are dealing with very fine tuning , and human eye , oscilloscope line thickness and human judgment in conjunction with parallax error , can lead to errors .
We speculate that if major RF labs indeed use this standard for tuning , they probably have some additional ``secret sauce '' that fills in the missing details .
One possible reason for our difficulties may be that we used the TI module as a signal source .
This improvisation may have inserted some undesired harmonics due to the sidebands in the downlink signal spectrum , interfering with the tuning process .
Since the methods described in Section 4.3 were effective , we did not pursue this further .
4 . 2 Non-Standard Tuning Methods
One tuning method includes sensing the reception power using a small loop antenna as a sensor , leading its receptive power to a home - made RF power meter .
The RF power meter can be an AM demodulator , whose DC level is proportional to the received RF power , or a home - made bolometer -- we chose to use the latter .
The other non-standard method is a trial - and - error iterative process of reading an RFID tag at increasing distances , while tuning the matching circuitry , until a maximal range is reached .
4 . 3 Tuning Methods that Worked
Then , for tuning the entire system , we used the iterations method described earlier .
For this we used a Philips Mifare Standard IC tag .
Initially , we located the tag at the basic range according to the RFID standard , and tuned the series antenna network capacitor C32 to some initial tag read .
When an initial reading is observed , we know that the final position of C32 is near the position of the initial readout .
We gradually increase the power supply , and each time adjust the various capacitors to get a stable reading range , while increasing the distance between the tag and the antenna .
To hold the tag at a fixed distance we used non-ferromagnetic objects : most of the time we used a stack of disposable plastic cups , and for fine range measurements we used a small supply of 1 - 2 mm thick beer coasters , see Figure 12 .
We stopped at a 19 volts power supply since the maximum semiconductor ratings were reached .
Surprisingly , the variable capacitors survived the high swing voltage , which was more than 180 Volts .
During the iterations , a secondary source of tuning information was the sound level from the computer speakers .
We turned the speakers to their maximum volume while we tuned the antenna matching capacitor :
The tuning process caused the speakers to hum , and their loudness gave an idea how close we are to the final matching .
Figure 11 : Home made bolometer using a resistor and a glued thermistor .
Figure 12 : The antenna tuning process .
Note the tag placed over a stack of plastic cups and beer coasters in the center of the antenna .
The power amplifier is marked as item 1 , the reader base board is marked as item 2 and the battery is marked as item 3 .
One disadvantage of this iterative method is its sensitivity to different tags :
Some tags gave larger read ranges than others .
On the other hand , the process is simple and quick :
It took us approximately 10 minutes to tune the system to maximal performance .
A second tuning method that worked was based on a bolometer .
We placed our smaller PCB antenna in the magnetic field produced by the large loop antenna , and measured changes in the RF power it was exposed to .
Instead of purchasing an expensive industrial RF watt - meter or bolometer , we built our own :
We attached a 100 K thermistor to a 50 resistor using super glue .
To improve the bolometer performance , we increased its thermal conductivity by using a silicon thermal grease around the attaching surface between the resistor and the thermistor , see Figure 11 .
To keep it isolated from ambient temperature , we then covered it with a small piece of isolating PVC sleeve , used for thermal isolation of copper hot water pipes .
Note that our bolometer is not calibrated to any standard units -- but this is unimportant since all we care about is to reach a maximum value ; we do not need to quantify the level of received RF power .
Using a binary search , while examining the amplitude over the antenna and reading the bolometer 's resistance - temperature , we tuned the matching capacitor until we observed the maximum temperature .
The results were accurate , and we reached the same final position of C32 that we marked at the end of iterations tuning process .
This tuning method is independent of a particular tag -- but it is slower , since it takes 15 seconds per setting for the thermistor to adjust to a new temperature and for the bolometer 's reading to stabilize .
4 . 4 Miscellaneous Tuning Tips
Figure 13 : Skimmer read - range results with the reference kit antenna , PCB antenna , and the copper tube loop antenna , with and without the power amplifier .
5 Results
We first connected our 10 x 15 cm PCB antenna to the evaluation kit , without the power amplifier .
This alone gave a range increase of 30 % , to around 8.5 cm .
Attaching the big loop antenna to the evaluation kit gave no results since the kit generates only 200 mW output power that is insufficient to drive the antenna .
Using the power amplifier we reached much larger ranges ( see Figure 13 ) .
With the linear power supply providing 14.58 volts , we were able to read the tag at a range of 17.3 cm using the PCB antenna , and at a range of 25.2 cm using the copper tube antenna .
With a 12 - volt battery we reached a reading range of 23.2 cm using the copper tube antenna and 16.9 cm using the PCB antenna .
Note that this type of battery , upon recharging , can supply more than its nominal voltage : we measured that it supplied 13.8 volts during the above experiments .
We observed that increasing the power supply voltage did not always cause a range increase :
Higher power levels sometimes caused lower reception .
This is in line with the predictions of [ KW05 ] .
The reason is that the distortion inserts harmonics that interfere with the detection of the side bands that are about 60 to 80 dB under the 13.56 MHz carrier power .
We found that the optimal power supply voltage for our antennas was around 14.6 volts .
We measured a 170 mA DC supply current to the power amplifier when using the the copper tube antenna .
The combination of this current value and a read range of 25 cm match the predictions of [ KW05 ] very well :
The graph shown in Figure 14 is from [ KW05 ] , and the star indicates our empirical results on the predicted curve .
Figure 14 : The predicted read - range versus the antenna current from [ KW05 ] .
The star indicates our empirical results .
We believe that using high rating components and more powerful RF test equipment , we can reach the road map along the theoretical curve .
This will be done in later work .
6 Conclusions
In this work we have shown how to build a portable , extended - range RFID skimmer .
Our skimmer is able to read ISO - 14443 tags from a distance of 25 cm , uses a lightweight 40 cm - diameter copper - tube antenna , is powered by a 12V battery -- and requires a budget of $ 100 .
We were able to build and tune the skimmer using only electronics hobbyist supplies and tools .
By doing this we have proved three things :
First , we have validated the basic concept of an RFID ``Leech ' ' and the modeling and simulation work of [ KW05 ] .
Second , we have demonstrated that ISO - 14443 RFID tags can be skimmed from a a range that is 3 - 5 time larger than the nominal range , and more importantly , is a distance that does not require the attacker to touch the victim .
This last observation can make a noticeable difference in the attacker 's mode of operation .
Finally , we are about half - way toward a full - blown implementation of a relay - attack of [ KW05 ] .
Our work implies that simple RFID tags , that respond to any reader , are immediately vulnerable to skimming .
Therefore , at the very least , RFID tags , and in particular E - passports , should incorporate additional controls that prevent the tag from being read surreptitiously : e.g. , physical shielding inside a Faraday cage , and cryptographic application - level access controls that require the reader to authenticate itself to the tag .
However , in isolation , cryptographic controls can only protect against skimming -- they cannot protect against a relay attack .
To protect against a relay attack , the RFID tag must be equipped with additional physical controls such as an actuator , or an optical barcode physically printed on the passport jacket : these help ensure that the reader is in fact reading the tag that is presented to it and not some remote victim tag .

A. Printing the PCB antenna
The PCB antenna was made using PCB printing materials and hobbyist equipment as listed below :
Raw PCB Glass - Epoxy tablet size 20x25 cm - price $ 5
Photo resist , Positive process - $ 27
Ferric Chloride - $ 9
Lye ( NaOH - Soda Caustic ) - $ 9
Piece of glass , size 18x23 cm for standard photo frame - $ 1
1 A4 Parchment paper - 20 cents
Black alcohol based non erasable water proof pen - $ 1.25
Acetone - $ 4
Rubber gloves , can be bought in a Dollar Store - $ 1
The cookbook contains a complete description , including a print layout and electronic circuitry ( See [ TI04 ] pages 21 - 22 ) .
The process of making the PCB antenna is identical to the process of making any PCB .
Note that positive photo - resist PCB printing requires a positive layout film .
Since making a celluloid film requires photographic equipment , we used the more common materials .
We first printed the antenna PCB layout on the pergament paper using an ink injection printer set up as follows :
- Print quality - best paper setting - Transparency film - other transparency film - Color - Print in gray scale - black only - Check the GUI check box for ``Actual size '' - Ink Volume - Heavy
The following instructions guide you through the antenna manufacturing process .
Wear rubber gloves and protect eye glasses since Ferric Chloride acid is a very strong and harmful material , and contact with human eyes causes severe injury .
Cover the large areas of the ink with the water proof pen to avoid any penetrating light through the pergament paper .
Prepare the raw PCB Glass - Epoxy tablet for exposure by thoroughly cleaning it from dust and dirt .
A clean surface is crucial to avoid PCB printing flaws .
Dry the tablet in an oven at a temperature around 70 Celsius degrees .
Thoroughly clean the glass against spots and dust .
In a dark room , spray a thin layer of Positive Photo Resist on the PCB tablet , and dry it in the oven at 70 Celsius degrees for about 20 minutes .
Make a 7 % Soda Caustic solution with water .
Put the pergament printed layout over the PCB tablet in the correct direction ( be aware of the Print Side ( PS ) and Component Side ( CS ) ) .
Put the glass on the pergament paper and hold them together tightly .
Expose the ``sandwich '' to bright sunlight for 4 to 6 minutes .
Remove the glass and pergament paper , and insert the exposed PCB into the Soda Caustic solution for about 20 minutes until all the photo - resist that was exposed to the sun is removed .
Thoroughly wash the PCB with water .
Be extra careful not to scratch the photo - resist printed leads .
Make a 25 Celsius degrees Ferric Chloride solution , and insert the PCB until the exposed copper is fully etched .
The PCB should be rapidly shaken within the acid , otherwise the etching process will take a long time .
Shaking it will shorten the etching process to around 45 minutes .
An aquarium pump is an effective and cheap way to stir the acid .
Wash the PCB thoroughly with water , dry it , and use the Acetone to remove the photo - resist from the antenna 's copper leads .
We still had few small flaws left due to strong etching , therefore we covered the whole antennas copper leads with tin .
The 50 3 , and we used a BNC connectors instead of SMA to reduce cost .
At this point , the antenna is ready for tuning and use .
In countries lacking sunny days for long months , one can consider screen printing technology for printing the PCB antenna .
This technique requires some background knowledge and some practical experience .
The basic materials costs around $ 150 dollars , and after few attempts , an average handyman can handle the task quite easily .
We have not tried the screen printing as the process we described worked successfully for us .

Here 's how it is ...
Earth - that - was got used up .
We moved out -- terraformed and colonized hundreds of new earths ; some , rich and flush with the new technologies ; some , not so much .
The central planets -- them as formed the Alliance -- decided all the planets had to join under their rule .
There was some disagreement on that point .
After the Unification War , many of the Independents who had fought and lost drifted to the edges of civilization , far from Alliance control .
Out here , people struggle to get by with the most basic of technologies .
A ship will bring you work ; a gun will help you keep it .
A captain 's goal is simple : find crew , find a job ... keep flying .
But if you are tired of this journey between the planets you can stop at planet 7 no deposit codes with the resources to play while you take a break .

This new Hubble image -
One among the largest ever produced with the Earth - orbiting observatory - shows gives the most detailed view so far of the entire Crab Nebula ever made .
Click here for a high resolution photograph .
The Crab Nebula is one of the most intricately structured and dynamic objects ever observed .
The new Hubble image of the Crab was assembled from 24 individual exposures taken with the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope 's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 ( WPFC2 ) and is the highest resolution image of the entire Crab Nebula ever made .
The Crab Nebula is a six - light - year - wide expanding remnant of a star 's supernova explosion .
Japanese and Chinese astronomers witnessed this violent event nearly 1,000 years ago in 1054 .

This composite shows : 1 ) The constellation Taurus ( lower left ) photographed by the avid astrophotographer Akira Fujii .
2 ) A two - colour image ( right ) shows the surroundings of the Crab Nebula .
It was composed from Digitized Sky Survey 2 images , and 3 ) The new NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope image ( upper left ) of the entire Crab Nebula in super high resolution .
Click here for a high resolution photograph .
The filaments are the tattered remains of the star and consist mostly of hydrogen .
The rapidly spinning neutron star embedded in the centre of the nebula , only barely visible in this Hubble image , is the dynamo powering the nebula 's eerie interior bluish glow .
The blue light comes from electrons whirling at nearly the speed of light around magnetic field lines from the neutron star .
The neutron star , like a lighthouse , ejects twin beams of radiation that appear to pulse 30 times a second due to the neutron star 's rotation .
A neutron star is the crushed ultra -dense core of the exploded star .
The Crab Nebula derived its name from its appearance in a drawing made by British astronomer Lord Rosse in 1844 , using a 36 - inch telescope .
When viewed by Hubble , as well as large ground - based telescopes such as ESO 's Very Large Telescope , the Crab Nebula takes on a more detailed appearance that yields clues into the spectacular demise of a star , 6,500 light - years away .
The newly composed image was assembled from individual Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 exposures taken in October 1999 , January 2000 , and December 2000 .
The colours in the image indicate the different elements that were expelled during the explosion .
Blue indicates neutral oxygen , green singly ionised sulphur and red doubly - ionised oxygen .
The Hubble data have been superimposed onto images taken with the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory , Chile .
###
You must remember the period where various electronic devices , from phones to radios , were available in transparent cases .
You may have found them utterly cool .
Yet the simple fact that you ca n’t find these things on the shelves anymore ( except for do - it - yourself PC cases ) means the crowd does n’t find them nearly that cool .
While you may not see the link yet , this is exactly why the Linux desktop will never be popular .
But before I elaborate on why Linux is similar to transparent case phones , I would like to state my point of view more clearly .
Linux is an operating system that was designed and implemented from the ground - up by geeks and nerds — let them be “ technology enthusiasts ” if you think it sounds better or less offensive .
My point is that the brain of these people is wired very differently from the brain of the average Joe .
Whether this is good or bad is irrelevant ; what matters is that they are bound to have different perceptions and values , causing a rift between them .
In order to make the Linux desktop appealing to the average Joe , technology enthusiasts would have to betray their core values to such extends that it would be the operating system ’s undoing .
In other words , they would have to make the phone ’s case opaque so that we can no longer see its insides , remove all the extra keys ( yes , all the cool ones ) and strip it of every prominent feature that makes it superior to but more complicated than the average phone .
What geek would want to use — or develop — such a boring phone ?
Linux as a desktop ( purists , allow me to merge the Linux kernel with the plethora of compatible open - source desktop software in one simple concept ) has a transparent casing ; you see all of the insides .
This is one of the things that makes it appealing to technology enthusiasts because their brains recognize the concept of “ technical elegance , ” analogous to “ mathematical elegance , ” a concept beyond the reach of non-mathematicians .
In other words , they see beauty in the insides of hardware and / or software .
But the crowd has a different opinion ; being technophobists , transparency in design and implementation is inelegant , even repelling .
Indeed , when you try to explain your old folks why Linux is technologically superior , you scare them away .
Shocking ?
Confusing ?
Allow me to elaborate .
First and foremost , technological enthusiasts possess a skill that is essential to the practice of their craft but is far beyond the reach of mere mortals : they are visual - spatial learners .
The more you read on the topic , the better grasp you will have of what follows .
One consequence of this is that visual complexity — or even visual clutter — does not scare them away .
It may even be impossible for them to understand why ordinary folks feel overwhelmed by slightly complex user interfaces .
The truth is that most people cannot visually grasp the entire screen at once , let alone an interface of fifty icons or user controls .
In order to be attractive to them , the interface needs to be dumbed down to the average automated bank teller ’s level .
Yes , they find the simplicity attractive , not disconcerting or dull .
Another issue that makes the open - source world irreconcilable with the crowd is the issue of choice .
Technology enthusiasts like the ability to choose between zillions of options , trying and tweaking at their leisure .
In fact , it could be said that many enjoy it .
Average users would disagree ; to them , more choice constitute a source of headache .
Even if the list of options is not overwhelming in the sense described in the previous paragraph , they still hate to have to try and make decisions .
To them , the simplicity of a monolithic , predetermined set of options is best .
It is a known fact that most users will not download an application from the Internet on their own but will use either what is preinstalled on their system or what their close friends send them .
The issue here is clearly choice ; they do not like to choose between options for a plethora of reasons , therefore they appreciate when the choice has been made for them .
This is why they buy from Dell and HP and use Windows .
Their worst nightmare after melting in a lava pit might be to have to compare between distributions , desktops , window managers , file browsers , web browsers , mail clients , instant messaging clients , music players and movie players before they could do anything with their brand new desktop computer — or before they had a mental breakdown .
Then why do n’t they buy from Apple ?
For many technological enthusiasts , this would be an obvious choice .
But again , that implies comparing multiple options .
People will stick to what they know .
And if you try to convince them that your option is best , you run the risk of irritating them .
Here comes another difference between the two groups : the technology enthusiast enjoys an argument , while most people take arguments personally .
They may not understand that the former are trying to help them , but will rather feel attacked and diminished , especially if the gurus insist .
I believe this is something easier for geeks to grasp given the flame wars among them are legion , but the difference is that a geek needs to have a point of view of his own before feeling offended , even if it ’s trivial , whereas John Doe may simply hear “ My OS is better than yours therefore you suck ” without additional thinking .
Not convinced ?
You may have insufficient experience in trying to make people switch .
Or please tell me in which country you live .
There ’s more .
If you ask people why they do n’t swith to Linux — and get an answer — most often the answer will be games .
Another difference between technology enthusiasts and the mob is that the former consider the computer as a tool , while the latter perceive it as an entertainment device .
While it does not mean the former cannot be a gamer , that wo n’t stop him from running his favorite OS , but the latter wo n’t see it as being worth the hassle .
Get real : most people use their desktop computer for chatting , steal ^H^H^H^H^Hlistening to music and watching movies , and playing games .
They could n’t care less about OpenOffice or The GIMP .
This is why there is a race between computer makers to bring the desktop computer to the living room .
Is there anyone left believing buying a computer will help their children get better grades , anyway ?
Last , but not least , technology enthusiasts love to learn .
It could be said that the myriad of books , articles , man pages , HOWTO documents and readme files on Linux and open - source software represents the world ’s biggest user manual .
And nearly everyone agrees it is underdocumented !!!
Geeks spend hundreds of hours tweaking their systems and reading documentation because they love to learn how it works , just like they enjoyed playing with Lego TECHNIC ( they would love the MINDSTORMS now ) or science fair kits when they were kids .
Needless to say the crowd finds these things rather uncool ( yes , even the Lego MINDSTORMS ) .
Most people do n’t like to read the user manual or learn fifty new concepts before getting started .
They like when it just works and it ’s intuitive — at least to them .
So what is the Linux desktop missing ?
Is it easy installation ?
An office suite ?
Interoperability ?
Drivers ?
A cute mascot ?
It ’s none of the above .
Linux will always be unpopular on the desktop because it is in every way comparable to a fully revamped Hot Rod with an engine so large the car needs no hood , so long to assemble it can only be the work of die - hard mechanics and so difficult to drive it takes a pilot , not a driver , and of course some explanations or it wo n’t start , or ram into a wall ( makes you wonder if it ’s even legal to drive it in the streets ) .
People rather buy the average SUV and , if they ’re a bit eccentric , they watch Pimp My Ride .
Get real : the Linux desktop has been designed and implemented by technology enthusiasts , for technology enthusiasts .
If they were to seriously try to make it appealing to the masses , the effort would collapse halfway because they would be dismayed by the result .
My take is that things are just fine the way they are , and the Linux desktop for Dummies an utopia .
Der Gigant aus der Garage
Seit 30 Jahren baut die kalifornische Firma Apple schicke Rechner für kreative Nonkonformisten , die sich nicht wirklich für Computer interessieren .
Mit verkauft wird die Illusion , zu den „ Guten “ zu gehören – und nicht zum Microsoft - Imperium
von PAUL - PHILIPP HANSKE
Fünf Minuten nachdem der neue Apple - Spot zum ersten Mal im deutschen Fernsehen ausgestrahlt wurde , stapelten sich auf www.macuser.de schon die Einträge : „ Hab gerade die Apple - Werbung auf RTL gesehen .
Ich lach mich tot ! “ – „ Uiiii , ist ja lustig ! “ – „ Sehen wollen , sofort ! “ Diskussionen über die literarische Qualität der Übersetzung wurden vom Zaun gebrochen , Links auf den amerikanischen Original - Spot gepostet .
Dabei ging es nur um ein paar Sekunden mittelmäßiger Werbung .
Der Anlass : Apple steigt auf Intel - Prozessoren um .
Man sieht ein paar Techniker , die sich wie auf Valium bewegen und Silikonscheiben durch ein Labor tragen .
Das Ganze ist etwa so unterhaltsam wie ein Schaltplan .
Und trotzdem lässt der Spot die Herzen einer verschworenen Gemeinschaft höher schlagen .
Einfach , weil es um ihre Marke geht – der Traum eines jeden Brand - Managers .
Hart gesottene Apple - Fans lassen sich das Logo , den angebissenen Apfel , schon mal tätowieren .
Jährlich treffen sich tausende „ Mac - Heads “ auf der Messe Macworld , um ihren Guru , den Apple - Chef Steve Jobs , zu feiern .
Weltweit gibt es unzählige Mac - Userforen .
Wirtschaftlich gesehen ist Apple ein Zwerg – etwas über zwei Prozent am Computergeschäft kann Apple halten .
Aber die Marke ist ein Gigant .
Apple verkauft keine schnöden Waren , sondern Kultobjekte .
Das funktioniert , weil Apple an einem wunden Punkt der Gesellschaft ansetzt : am Unbehagen in der Technologie .
Apple steht für den Traum von der „ guten Maschine “ .
Als die beiden kalifornischen Späthippies Steve Jobs und Steve Wozniak , – der eine ein Schulabbrecher und LSD - schluckender Zen-Buddhist , der andere ein grüblerischer Platinenlöter – am 1 .
April 1976 die Firma Apple gründeten , war das Wort „ Computer “ den meisten noch ein Mysterium .
Computer , das waren bis dahin hausgroße Ungetüme , eingesetzt von der CIA oder dem Pentagon .
Vor diesem Hintergrund kam es schon einer kleinen Revolution gleich , als sich die Gegenkultur des Computers bemächtigte .
Zwar konnte man mit dem Apple I noch so gut wie nichts anfangen .
Aber es war ein Zeichen gesetzt : Technik – von jeher politisch höchst verdächtig – war nicht mehr den Mächtigen vorbehalten .
Das blieb die Strategie von Apple .
1984 war Apple bereits ein Millionenunternehmen .
Der Apple II kam einer Lizenz zum Gelddrucken gleich , Schulen kauften den PC für den Programmierunterricht .
Steve Jobs war der jüngste Multimillionär der USA , wenngleich seine Firma immer noch den Branchen - Rebell markierte .
Als 1984 der erste Macintosh auf den Markt kam , schaltete Apple einen Spot , den „ Blade Runner “ - Regisseur Ridley Scott gedreht hatte : Graue Menschenmassen starren gebannt auf einen riesigen Bildschirm .
Dort geifert ein düsterer Technodiktator .
Doch dann kommt eine farbenfrohe Blondine und zerstört den Big Brother .
Dazu verkündet eine Stimme aus dem Off , dank Apple werde das Jahr 1984 nicht sein wie George Orwells Buch „ 1984 “ .
Das funktionierte .
Weil IBM , der gigantische Marktführer , wohl niemandem sympathisch war .
Diese Konstellation ist bis heute gleich geblieben , denn gegen die Großen der Branche kam auch die überlegene Apple - Technologie nicht an – genau daraus schlug man Profit : Marktführerschaft per se ist unheimlich , da kann Bill Gates noch so viele Aids - Fonds gründen .
Im Gegensatz dazu Apple .
Seit Mitte der 80er setzte man hier nicht auf das Pferd des technischen Fortschritts , sondern auf Kreativität – und diesen Gaul reitet jeder Rebell gerne .
Alle Grafik- , Design - und Layout - Programme liefen nur auf Macs , kreative Selbstverwirklicher mussten mit einem Apple arbeiten .
Das machten sie auch gerne , hob es sie doch von den tumben 08/15 - Computernutzern ab .
Dieses Alleinstellungsmerkmal funktioniert bis heute – natürlich hackt Carrie Bradshaw in jeder „ Sex And The City “ - Folge ihre intime Kolumne in ein schickes Powerbook .
Mit zur Strategie der „ guten Maschine “ gehört es auch , dass Apple den Rechner tatsächlich benutzerfreundlicher gemacht hat .
Praktisch alle wichtigen Computer - Vereinfachungen stammen aus dem Think Tank in Cupertino , Kalifornien : die Maus , die grafische Oberfläche , die Bildschirmanordnung in Fenstern , die Drag - and - Drop - Funktion und vieles mehr .
Der Mythos Apple hat seinen Kristallisationspunkt in der Lichtgestalt des Steve Jobs , der Apple gründete , 1985 gefeuert wurde , 1996 zurückkehrte und dem Unternehmen zu neuem Ruhm verhalf .
Er ist der Vater des Macs , von ihm stammt die „ Human Interface Guideline “ – die Vermenschlichungsstrategie für Computer , er engagierte den grandiosen Designer Jonathan Ives für seine Produkte .
Und er gilt als verrückt , gerade so , wie sich seine Kunden gerne sehen möchten .
Die soeben erschienene Jobs - Biografie von Jeffrey Young und William L. Simon liest sich denn auch wie eine Hagiografie allererster Güte .
Dabei ist das Genie Jobs nicht unbedingt sympathisch : ein tyrannischer Machtmensch , geizig , rachsüchtig und verschroben .
Anfang der 80er fragte er bei Einstellungsgesprächen , ob der Bewerber schon LSD genommen habe – schlecht , wenn nicht .
Er verlangte von seinen Mitarbeitern , auch an Weihnachten zu arbeiten .
Und wenn mal etwas nicht nach seinem Kopf ging , bekam er Weinkrämpfe .
Aber auch „ heiße Tränen “ gehören zum Bild des leidenschaftlichen Genies , das bis heute Marktforschung verachtet und lieber auf Meditation setzt , um sich für geschäftli- che Maßnahmen inspirieren zu lassen .
Und weil die zeitgenössische Kunst mit ihren spröden Konzepten und gesichtslosen Akteuren immer weniger von diesen profanisierten Priestern hervorbringt , ist man umso dankbarer für den bärtigen , visionären Computer - Guru – und sei es auch nur deshalb , weil er sich so standhaft weigert , einen Anzug zu tragen .
Mit seinem zur Schau gestellten Nonkonformismus verkörpert Steve Jobs das subkulturelle Image von Apple .
In Wirklichkeit ist davon aber nur noch Marketing - Kalkül geblieben .
Der manichäische Kampf zwischen Gut und Böse , Jobs und Gates , ist lediglich Wunschdenken der Mac - Heads .
In Wirklichkeit investierte Bill Gates 150 Millionen Dollar in Apple .
Und in Wirklichkeit ist Jobs größter Aktionär von Disney – hockt also genauso in einer der Schaltzentralen der „ Bewusstseinsindustrie “ wie der vermeintliche Bösewicht Gates .
Auch dass das neue Apple - Betriebssystem auf frei verfügbarer Open - Source - Software basiere , ist nur ein Werbegag : Der innerste Kern von Mac OS X ist zwar tatsächlich mit dem „ demokratischen “
Unix verwandt , das übrige Betriebssystem ist aber genauso urheberrechtsgeschützt wie jedes Microsoft - Programm .
Es ist also eine riskante Doppelstrategie , die Apple da fährt : Zum einen bedient die Marke nach wie vor das Rebellen - Klischee ; zum anderen ist Apple aber ein ganz normales Unternehmen , das nicht die Welt verbessern , sondern Geld verdienen will – was sich allmählich herumspricht : Der iPod , das erfolgreichste Apple - Produkt aller Zeiten , hält fast 80 Prozent des MP3 - Player - Marktes .
Mit der monopolartigen Verbreitung aber sinkt das Distinktionspotenzial des Produktes .
Spätestens mit dem Outing von George W. Bush als iPod - Jünger hat das kultige Kästchen ein Imageproblem bekommen .
Aber auch das Ur - Produkt , der Mac selbst , könnte demnächst seinen Nimbus verlieren : Ab Anfang Juni nämlich werden die ersten Apple - Computer mit Intel - Prozessoren ausgeliefert – die man vor ein paar Jahren noch als „ Spießer - Chips “ verhöhnte .
Einer der Mac - Heads , die auf www.macuser.de aufgeregt den neuen
Spot diskutierten , ahnte das , als er skeptisch in die Runde fragte : „ Kommt jetzt etwa die Apple - Offensive für den Otto Normalverbraucher ?
Begrüßt ihr das ? “
The Mac OS X Tipping Point
Jason Kottke , on Wednesday , in a brief follow - up piece regarding the Mark Pilgrim / Cory Doctorow switching - to - Ubuntu saga , expanded upon his “ canaries in a coal mine ” comment thusly :
In the late 90s / early 00s , Apple got their act in gear with OS X and their iMacs , Powerbooks , G5s , and iBooks .
People who cared deeply about their computing experience ( you know , computer nerds ) took notice of Apple ’s rededication to producing great products , switched to Macs , and thereafter the Macintosh gradually became a genuinely credible option for programmers , web builders , graphic designers , journalists , students , and grandmothers .
Not cause and effect , but the so - called alpha geeks noticed something happening and reacted before everyone else did .
So when you have two people who care deeply about their computer experience and who were dedicated Apple users for non-superficial reasons switch entirely away from Apple for equally non-superficial reasons , it may be wise for Apple and the rest of us to take notice that they did so and , more importantly , why .
I wholeheartedly agree with the main thrust of this , that it ’s worth taking notice of Pilgrim ’s reasons for switching ( I mean , duh ) , but Kottke ’s historical overview of the tail end of the classic Mac OS era is , to say the least , a tad myopic .
There are some number of current Mac users who have switched to the Mac ( or , like Kottke , switched back after a long absence ) only recently , where by “ recently ” I mean after Mac OS X 10.0 shipped .
This includes many of you who are reading this .
But I think there ’s a widely - held belief , especially amongst recent switchers , that Mac OS X and Apple ’s recent hardware designs have led to a dramatic resurgence in the number of total Mac users .
This belief is wrong .
It ’s true that Apple is currently doing very well financially , and consistently strong Mac sales have been an important part of that .
And it ’s also true that in the ’90s — especially from 1995 - 97 — Apple ’s financials were in terrible state .
They lost about $ 1 billion in 1997 , and at their nadir analysts suspected they were down to less than $ 200 million in cash reserves .
[ Update : That $ 200 million figure cited by BusinessWeek is apparently flat - out wrong .
This chart at Morningstar shows that Apple ’s “ cash and equivalent ” bottomed out at around $ 1.2 billion .
( Thanks to Scott Stevenson for the link . ) ]
But Apple ’s financial struggles were n’t caused by an inability to sell Macs — they were caused by inept management .
Throughout the second half of the ’90s , Apple sold about one million Macs each quarter , and about four million each year .
Sometimes less , sometimes more , but usually about a million per quarter :
Which numbers really are n’t that much different than today’s :
In other words , Apple is n’t selling significantly more computers now than they were 10 years ago .
And according to this report from Computer Industry Almanac2 , Apple actually sold slightly more computers from 1996 - 2000 than they did from 2001 - 2005 .
An awful lot of those million Macs sold per quarter 10 years ago were sold to graphic designers , web developers , programmers , and students .
Take “ programmers ” out of that list and you pretty much have a description of the Mac ’s core market of the era .
A “ credible option ” , indeed .
The Mac had an especially strong share of the late ’90s web authoring market .
When I started working at Bare Bones Software in 2000 , part of the marketing material included a circa 1998 survey of the software tools used by web designers .
3
According to the survey , 50 - some percent of web designers were BBEdit users .
Not 50 percent of Mac-using web designers , but 50 percent of all web designers .

Yes , there are markets where Macs are now popular but were almost non-existent pre-Mac OS X .
But the market of , say , “ people who attend O’Reilly tech conferences and SXSW ” is , in the grand scheme of things , minuscule .
( The market of people who ’ve even heard of SXSW probably qualifies as small in this context . )
The Mac users of today are , by and large , the Mac users of 10 years ago .
If you drew a Venn diagram with a circle representing Mac users circa 1996 and another circle representing Mac users circa 2006 , the two circles would be about the same size and would significantly overlap .
I ’m not trying to rain on any parades .
There is a discernible uptick in the most recent unit sale figures cited above ; the average for the previous six quarters is around 1,150,000 units .
I think those numbers will continue to grow , to 1.5 million units per quarter and beyond , and I ’m not alone .
Switching is afoot — but it has n’t yet reached the tipping point where it goes mainstream .
Regarding long - time Mac users , though , I think Kottke has it backwards : in the dark days of the Spindler and Amelio regimes , Apple ’s problem was n’t that they lost their mojo with the Mac - loving designer and developer market , it was that they lost their mojo with the mainstream not - really - all - that - into - computers market .
Their marketing was lame , their brand image was fading , their product line - up was confusing ( can you say “ Performa ” ? ) , and the consensus among the mainstream media was that Apple was on the verge of either going bankrupt or being sold for a song — more or less like corporate scrap metal — to someone like Sun .
But Apple never lost its stronghold in the “ creative ” markets where the Mac had always been popular .
Using the C - word , however , risks conjuring up bad feelings amongst those people who did n’t prefer the Mac all along .
The point is n’t that all “ creatives ” prefer ( and always did prefer ) the Mac , or that all people who prefer the Mac are creative ; it ’s that creative people have always been much more likely to prefer the Mac .
The difference between the old Mac OS and Mac OS X is n’t that it used to suck but now it ’s great .
The difference is that Mac OS X ’s appeal is broader ; it is good in more ways than the old Mac OS was .
It ’s this increased breadth of appeal that has grown Mac OS X ’s share of the nerd market .
What makes nerds “ nerds ” is that they care to an irrational depth about certain specific things ; Mac OS
X covers more of those things than did Mac OS 9 , and so it appeals to many more nerds .
5
The difference is palpable .
The Mac was a polarizing presence throughout the entire classic era — arguments over its merits would range between two extreme positions : “ Macs are fucking awesome ! ” vs. “ Are you kidding me ?
Macs fucking suck ! ” .
But today , it ’s hard to find someone serious who thinks Macs “ suck ” , or that old chestnut that they ’re “ toy computers ” .
John Siracusa wrote about this eloquently in March in his essay celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Mac OS X era :
Today ’s Mac users span a much wider range than those of the past .
Mac OS X’s Unix - like core reached out to the beard - and - suspenders crowd ( and the newer source - code - and - a - dream crowd ) while the luscious Aqua user interface pulled all the touchy - feely aesthetes from the other direction .
In the middle were the refugees from the Mac - That - Was , but they are n’t the story here .
Mac OS
X is about new blood and new ideas — some good , some bad , but all vibrant .
The Mac is alive again !
After spending half my life watching smart , talented people ignore the Mac for reasons of circumstance or prejudice , it ’s incredibly gratifying to live in a post - Mac OS X world .
When I encounter a tech - world luminary or up - and - coming geek today , I just assume that he or she uses a Mac .
Most of the time , I ’m right .
Even those with a conflicting affiliation ( e.g. , Linux enthusiasts ) often use Apple laptops , if not the OS .
The myopic view of the classic Mac OS held by OS X era switchers , I suspect , stems from a thought process that runs like this : I was n’t using a Mac in the late 90s , and I care about computers , and a bunch of my friends and colleagues feel the same way , so therefore no one who cares about computers was using a Mac in the late ’90s .
But the inverse is wrong , too — which is the tendency for long - time Mac users to think : I appreciate good user - interface design ; the Mac has always had a better - designed user interface than any other platform ; therefore anyone who has n’t been using a Mac all along has no appreciation for good UI design .
( Yours truly has , admittedly , been guilty of this particular false logic . )
You ca n’t appeal to all people all the time , but Mac OS X comes remarkably close .
The old Mac OS , as insanely great as it was , did not .
On December 3 , 2005 , Ruby and Python developers from Chicago and vicinity gathered at DePaul University to hear two of the leaders in rapid Web- application development debate the merits of each other ’s frameworks .
Adrian Holovaty , one of the creators of the Django framework for Python , and David Heinemeier Hansson , the creator of Ruby on Rails framework , answered questions about their work and the future of Web- application development .
The event was recorded , and this page now serves as an archive of the event .
At the time , both Django and Rails were quite new , and it 's interesting to view this from a historical perspective .

In a twist on the old tale of the RIAA suing teenagers for downloading music , Nettwerk Records ( Canada ) has offered to pay the legal bills of one family who has vowed to challenge the RIAA in court .
The Gruebels , a US family , are accused by the RIAA of downloading a whole host of songs , including works by various Nettwerk artists .
The label has agreed to foot the bill for Chicago lawyer Charles Mudd Jr. , who will defend the family in court and has already argued several cases on this issue .
Terry McBride , CEO of Nettwerk , explained in a statement that he does not see how lawsuits help the industry , the artist , or the consumer .
" Litigation is not ' artist development . '
Litigation is a deterrent to creativity and passion and it is hurting the business I love .
The current actions of the RIAA are not in my artists ' best interests . "
The RIAA claims that the family needs to pay US$ 9,000 to make the problem go away , but the bill will be graciously reduced to US $ 4,500 if the Gruebels pony up soon .
Nettwerk will pay the bill if the family loses the case .
McBride has shown himself to be something of a maverick in the music industry .
In addition to arguing against the RIAA 's campaign of lawsuits , McBride has also expressed his displeasure with current DRM solutions — especially on copy - controlled CDs .
" The average consumer who 's not tech - savvy is going to buy the CD , thinking that they can load it onto their iPod , " he said last year .
When consumers find out that wo n't work , " they 're going to be royally pissed off .
Why do you want to piss off the people who buy ? "
How much of a difference can Nettwerk 's stand make in the industry ?
They 're one of Canada 's largest labels , managing artists such as Sarah McLachlan , Avril Lavigne , and Barenaked Ladies ( in addition to Guster and Ron Sexsmith , two criminally underappreciated acts ) , so they can certainly contribute to the debate surrounding these issues and get their voice heard .
That said , though , they just are n't in the same league as the big five labels , who appear to think that their worldwide legal crusade needs to be stepped up a notch or two .
If bad press has n't stopped the RIAA and IFPI ( the worldwide music trade group ) , a bit of displeasure coming from Canada probably wo n't do much either .
While I ’m on the online advertising beat , a post to Site - Point claims that Amazon is planning to get into the contextual advertising game and has a beta program already running .
It makes sense for Amazon , and even more so for eBay , to track down this path .
I think the gap between online advertising and the actual closing of the sale has to shrink as we move forward .
The first step towards this happening is that advertisers need to get a lot more granular with their advertisements because AdSense is not good at generating income for a very substantial proportion of Internet sites ( see my previous post ) .
So to use the example I used previously :
You do a search on President Bush .
Under AdSense you get nothing .
However , if you ’re running an eBay contextual advertising block , suddenly your sites starts feeding up a whole host of ads for related items being sold on its auctions or at any of the thousands of individual eBay stores .
Now , that ’s contextual advertising .
It ’s all very well to microchunk you ’re content , but it does n’t really work across the breadth of the Internet until you microchunk you ’re advertising as well .
Yet neither Yahoo or MSN are coming at their advertising programs at a way which solves this problem and therefore addressing the grievances of all those content providers for whom AdSense is n’t working .
Companies like Amazon and eBay , on the other hand , who actually own catalogues of products can make an immediate impact in this space .
For me , Amazon , as primarily a retailer is n’t nearly as well positioned as eBay , who exists solely as a selling platform .
Both Yahoo and Microsoft are going to struggle to compete with Google because they do n’t have the advertiser critical mass .
And without advertiser critical mass , pushing up rates and therefore increasing content provider ’s income , the game is really difficult to turn around .
However , eBay is potentially , if it is n’t already , the biggest contextual advertiser on the Internet so it will have pretty reasonable critical mass right up front .
If there is n’t an external provider to take inventory , it simply serves up one of its auctions ( for which it does n’t even need to charge for because it ’s taking a cut of the sales revenue anyway )
Certainly , eBay will also realise that Google is edging onto their turf with GoogleBase so a counterattack makes even more sense .
They also own Skype , so they can bring the buyer and seller even closer together via VoIP .
I ’ll be very , very surprised if eBay has n’t launched its own advertising network within the next six months .
( By the way , the GoogleBase reference is worth thinking about .
Google really needs to get sellers to get their product catalogues into GoogleBase and then tie that to AdSense so that they too can begin to sell at a more granular level .
Arguably , this is a better approach in the long run as its a distributed model so you do n’t need to be tied to a particular selling platform like eBay .
However , Google would appear to be a long , long way from making that happen , so eBay would definitely have an advantage in the short term )
Oh and one more thing .
And it ’s kind of a big thing .
Could this issue finally be what brings a couple of the titans together .
Think about a mega - merger between either Yahoo / Microsoft and eBay .
In particular , I ’d be bullish about a Yahoo / eBay combination .
You get supply side and demand side critical mass all in one shot so that you ’ve actually got something comparable to Google ’s network .
You get a far better suite of tools for connecting buyers and sellers – Overture / Yahoo ’s SMB services / website builder / IM + Skype vs GoogleTalk .
And finally you get an ability to profile your community which would leave Google for dead ; ie eBay vs Froogle / Google ’s Pagerank analysis vs Yahoo ’s social networking profiles .
You tell me that does n’t make a whole heap of ( ad ) sense ?
Open Letter to The Guardian
Noam Chomsky
ZNet , November 13 , 2005
This is an open letter to a few of the people with whom I had discussed the Guardian interview of 31 October , on the basis of the electronic version , which is all that I had seen .
Someone has just sent me a copy of the printed version , and I now understand why friends in England who wrote me were so outraged .
It is a nuisance , and a bit of a bore , to dwell on the topic , and I always keep away from personal attacks on me , unless asked , but in this case the matter has some more general interest , so perhaps it ’s worth reviewing what most readers could not know .
The general interest is that the print version reveals a very impressive effort , which obviously took careful planning and work , to construct an exercise in defamation that is a model of the genre .
It ’s of general interest for that reason alone .
A secondary matter is that it may serve as a word of warning to anyone who is asked by the Guardian for an interview , and happens to fall slightly to the critical end of the approved range of opinion of the editors .
The warning is : if you accept the invitation , be cautious , and make sure to have a tape recorder that is very visibly placed in front of you .
That may inhibit the dedication to deceit , and if not , at least you will have a record .
I should add that in probably thousands of interviews from every corner of the world and every part of the spectrum for decades , that thought has never occurred to me before .
It does now .
It was evident from the electronic version that it was a scurrilous piece of journalism .
That ’s clear even from internal evidence .
The reporter obviously had a definite agenda : to focus the defamation exercise on my denial of the Srebrenica massacre .
From the character of what appeared , it is not easy to doubt that she was assigned this task .
When I would n’t go along , she simply invented the denial , repeatedly , along with others .
The centerpiece of the interview was this , describing my alleged views , in particular , that :
….during the Bosnian war the “ massacre ” at Srebrenica was probably overstated .
( Chomsky uses quotations marks to undermine things he disagrees with and , in print at least , it can come across less as academic than as witheringly teenage ; like , Srebrenica was so not a massacre . )
Transparently , neither I nor anyone speaks with quotation marks , so the reference to my claim that “ Srebrenica was so not a massacre , ” shown by my using the term “ massacre ” in quotes , must be in print — hence “ witheringly teenage , ” as well as disgraceful .
That raises the obvious question : where is it in print , or anywhere ?
I know from letters that were sent to me that a great many journalists and others asked the author of the interview and the relevant editors to provide the source , and were met by stony silence — for a simple reason : it does not exist , and they know it .
Furthermore , as Media Lens pointed out , with five minutes research on the internet , any journalist could find many places where I described the massacre as a massacre , never with quotes .
That alone ends the story .
I will skip the rest , which also collapses quickly .
More interesting , however , is the editorial contribution .
One illustration actually is in the e-edition .
I did write a very brief letter in response , which for some reason went to the ombudsman , who informed me that the word “ fabrication ” had to be removed .
My truncated letter stating that I take no responsibility for anything attributed to me in the article did appear , paired with a moving letter from a victim , expressing justified outrage that I or anyone could take the positions invented in the Guardian article .
Pairing aside , the heading given by the editors was : “ Fall out over Srebrenica . ”
The editors are well aware that there was no debate or disagreement about Srebrenica , once the fabrications in their article are removed .
The printed version reveals how careful and well - planned the exercise was , and why it might serve as a model for the genre .
The front - page announcement of the interview reads : “ Noam Chomsky The Greatest Intellectual ? ”
The question is answered by the following highlighted Q&A , above the interview :
Q : Do you regret supporting those who say the Srebrenica massacre was exaggerated ?
A : My only regret is that I did n’t do it strongly enough
It is set apart in large print so that it ca n’t be missed , and will be quoted separately ( as it already has been ) .
It also captures the essence of the agenda .
The only defect is that it did n’t happen .
The truthful part is that I said , and explained at length , that I regret not having strongly enough opposed the Swedish publisher ’s decision to withdraw a book by Diana ( not “ Diane , ” as the Guardian would have it ) Johnstone after it was bitterly attacked in the Swedish press .
As Brockes presumably knew , though I carefully explained anyway , there is one source for my involvement in this affair : an open letter that I wrote to the publisher , after editors there who objected to the decision , and journalist friends , sent me the Swedish press charges that were the basis for the rejection .
In the open letter , readily available on the internet ( and the only source ) , I went through the charges one by one , checked them against the book , and found that they all ranged from serious misrepresentation to outright fabrication .
I then took — and take — the position that it is completely wrong to withdraw a book because the press charges ( falsely ) that it does not conform to approved doctrine .
And I do regret that “ I did n’t do it strongly enough , ” the words Brockes managed to quote correctly .
In the interview , whatever Johnstone may have said about Srebrenica never came up , and is entirely irrelevant in any event , at least to anyone with a minimal appreciation of freedom of speech .
The article is then framed by a series of photographs .
Let ’s put aside childhood photos and an honorary degree — included for no apparent reason other than , perhaps , to reinforce the image the reporter sought to convey of a rich elitist hypocrite who tells people how to live ( citing a comment of her own , presumably supposed to be clever , which will not be found on the tape , I am reasonably confident ) .
Those apart , there are three photos depicting my actual life .
It ’s an interesting choice , and the captions are even more interesting .
One is a picture of me “ talking to journalist John Pilger ” ( who is n’t shown , but let ’s give the journal the benefit of the doubt of assuming he is actually in the original ) .
The second is of me “ meeting Fidel Castro . ”
The third , and most interesting , is a picture of me “ in Laos en route to Hanoi to give a speech to the North Vietnamese . ”
That ’s my life : honoring commie-rats and the renegade who is the source of the word “ pilgerize ” invented by journalists furious about his incisive and courageous reporting , and knowing that the only response they are capable of is ridicule .
Since I ’ll avoid speculation , you can judge for yourselves the role Pilger plays in the fantasy life of the editorial offices of the Guardian .
And the choice is interesting in other ways .
It ’s true that I have met John a few times , much fewer than I would like because we both have busy lives .
And possibly a picture was taken .
It must have taken some effort to locate this particular picture , assuming it to be genuine , among the innumerable pictures of me talking to endless other people .
And the intended message is very clear .
Turn to the Castro picture .
In this case the picture , though clipped , is real .
As the editors surely know , at least if those who located the picture did 2 minutes of research , the others in the picture ( apart from my wife ) were , like me , participants in the annual meeting of an international society of Latin American scholars , with a few others from abroad .
This annual meeting happened to be in Havana .
Like all others , I was in a group that met with Castro .
End of second story .
Turn now to the third picture , from 1970 .
The element of truth is that I was indeed in Laos , and on my way to Hanoi .
The facts about these trips are very easy to discover .
I wrote about both in some detail right away , in two articles in the New York Review , reprinted in my book At War with Asia in 1970 .
It is easily available to Guardian editors , because it was recently reprinted .
If they want to be the first to question the account ( unlike reviewers in such radical rags as the journal of the Royal Institute , International Affairs ) , it would be very easy for a journalist to verify it : contact the two people who accompanied me on the entire trip , one then a professor of economics at Cornell , the other a minister of the United Church of Christ .
Both are readily accessible .
From the sole account that exists , the editor would know that in Laos I was engaged in such subversive activities as spending many hours in refugee camps interviewing miserable people who had just been driven by the CIA “ clandestine army ” from the Plain of Jars , having endured probably the most intense bombing in history for over two years , almost entirely unrelated to the Vietnam war .
And in North Vietnam , I did spend most of my time doing what I had been invited to do : many hours of lectures and discussion , on any topic I knew anything about , in the bombed ruins of the Hanoi Polytechnic , to faculty who were able to return to Hanoi from the countryside during a lull in the bombing , and were very eager to learn about recent work in their own fields , to which they had had no access for years .
The rest of the trip “ to Hanoi to give a speech to the North Vietnamese ” is a Guardian invention .
Those who frequent ultra - right defamation sites can locate the probable source of this ingenious invention , but even that ridiculous tale goes nowhere near as far as what the Guardian editors concocted , which is a new addition to the vast literature of vilification of those who stray beyond the approved bounds .
So that ’s my life : worshipping commie-rats and such terrible figures as John Pilger .
Quite apart from the deceit in the captions , simply note how much effort and care it must have taken to contrive these images to frame the answer to the question on the front page .
It is an impressive piece of work , and , as I said , provides a useful model for studies of defamation exercises , or for those who practice the craft .
And also , perhaps , provides a useful lesson for those who may be approached for interviews by this journal .
This is incidentally only a fragment .
The rest is mostly what one might expect to find in the scandal sheets about movie stars , familiar from such sources , and of no further interest .

要約：うまいマンガの絵とは、表現のために意図的に歪ませた絵のことである。しかし、その表現には二つの種類がある。
最近連続して 「マンガ絵のうまさって何？」というようなことを話したので、それについて考えたことをまとめてみたい。基本は要約に書いたとおり。ではまず「表現のために歪ませる」ってのはどういうことか、私がよく例に出すのはこちら。
黒田硫黄の『大王』収録 『THE WORLD CUP 1962』より。
まさに、これぞマンガ！といった歪ませ方ではありませんか。フキダシとフキダシの間を移動するのと同時に、顔の向き、表情の変化、そして明暗、全てが表現されています。わかりづらいという方のために、あまり良いことではないんですが、コマを分断してみました。
さあ、前のコマと見比べてください。元のコマにある躍動感がわかるでしょう。間に白線を引いただけで、位置は変えていません。ではなぜ元のコマが分断されていないかというと、コマ間の隙間は時間の経過を表すからです。このセリフは間をおかずに喋っている、だから時間の経過を表してはならない、ほぼ同時に起こったことを、ほぼ同時に起こったこととして。あるいは同時に見えたものを、同時に見せるために、この絵は分断されず、同じコマに描かれたのです。
時間と空間を歪ませることのできる表現方法、それがマンガ絵の「歪み」なのです。
そして、こちらは浦沢直樹の『PLUTO』から、ヘラクレスの横顔。
地味なコマですが、ここにもう一つの「表現としての空間の歪み」が描かれているのがわかるでしょう。実際ならば、この角度で耳の後ろが見える場合、顔の前面はこんなにはっきりとは見えないのです。ところがこのコマでは、後頭部、首の後ろ、そして耳の後ろ側まで見えていながら、鼻の頭、そして黒目までもちゃんと見えている。だからヘラクレスの感情がわかる。
そう、この絵は、見えるはずのないものを同時に見せるために、空間が左右に歪んでいるのです。
うまいマンガの絵とは、ヒトコマの中で多くの表現をするために、うまく歪んでいる絵である。と定義できるのではないでしょうか？
けれど、左右に歪んだ絵は多いが、上下に歪んだ絵は少ない。そこが、マンガの絵についてうまいかへたかを話すときに齟齬となるのかもしれませんので、そのあたりについて考えて、この項を終わります。
人間の目というものは、左右の視差で立体を把握します。ですから平面にあるものを立体的に見せるためには、視差を表現しなければならない。逆を言えば、左右の幅が歪んでいる絵には、あまり違和感をおぼえないわけです。ところが、上下に歪んだ絵は、一見ただ曲がっているように見えてしまう。しかし、いったんその絵の読み方がわかると、そこから読み取れる情報は倍増する。なぜか。
上下に歪んだ絵は、 スクリーンに投影される 映像から私たちが見る歪みと似ているのです。 フィルムは上下に移動します。 テレビの走査線も上から順に更新されていきます。私たちは映像というメディアを手に入れてから、平面における表現の多層性に、上下という選択を増やすことができたのです。
なんか最後の画像だけ選択を間違えた気がしないでもないですが、まあそんな感じです。
役立ちますでしょうか。
追記：
マンガ絵とは、同時に起こったことを同時に表現するための方法である。
マンガ絵とは、同時に見えないものを同時に見えるようにするための方法である。
全てのマンガは表現のために、上記二つの方法を利用する。
なぜ 大友克洋 はマンガからアニメへ移行したのか。前述したとおり、マンガというのは、当たり前のように歪んだ身体を描かなければならないふしぎな表現方式なわけです
* 1 たとえば手近なマンガを手にとってください。その中に登場する人物は、斜め前方を向いているなら、おそらく頭蓋骨の向きにくらべて顔面が正面（読者側）を向いているはずです。また、奥側の耳やモミアゲなども、ずいぶん前方へズレているのではありませんか？これは、リアルな絵柄であるか、ディフォルメされた絵柄であるかは、関係ないのです。なぜならこれも前述したとおり、三次元を二次元に変換する場合、視差を表現しなければ物体の一面しか描けないからです。当然、動きや感情を表現するために、同じ画面にひどく変形した身体が描かれる場合もあります。以上のことから、このような推測が成り立ちます。
同時性の必要がなければ、マンガという方法にこだわる必要もありません。大友克洋がアニメへ移行したのは、同時性に対する切迫した感覚（マンガでなければ表現できないもの）を、あまり必要としていなかったからなのでしょう。まあ、妄想ですけれども。
追記２
大暮維人、小畑健などの、いうわゆるうまい絵と言われる作家に関してはhttp://d.hatena.ne.jp/./screammachine/20060729#p1参照。表現のための歪みは存在します。系列で言うと大張正巳、ことぶきつかさ、あたり。で、重要なのはそれが計算ではなく快感に基づいているということ。顔がこっちに伸びている方が気持ちいいからそう描くわけです。腕や足が異様に長いアクションシーンなど。ヘタなマンガ絵というのは、その表現の方向と絵の歪みがチグハグな場合を指すのではないかと思います。ちなみにデッサンのとれているマンガ家といえば、私は丸尾末広が浮かびますが、彼の場合は動きを表現するためにコマ落とし表現を使いますね。同じコマに違うアングルの顔が重なって描かれるわけです。これも「うまいマンガ絵」と言えます。
Most Stolen Identities Never Used
This is something I ’ve been saying for a while , and it ’s nice to see some independent confirmation :
A new study suggests consumers whose credit cards are lost or stolen or whose personal information is accidentally compromised face little risk of becoming victims of identity theft .
The analysis , released on Wednesday , also found that even in the most dangerous data breaches–where thieves access social security numbers and other sensitive information on consumers they have deliberately targeted–only about 1 in 1,000 victims had their identities stolen .
The reason is that thieves are stealing far more identities than they need .
Two years ago , if someone asked me about protecting against identity theft , I would tell them to shred their trash and be careful giving information over the Internet .
Today , that advice is obsolete .
Criminals are not stealing identity information in ones and twos ; they ’re stealing identity information in blocks of hundreds of thousands and even millions .
If a criminal ring wants a dozen identities for some fraud scam , and they steal a database with 500,000 identities , then — as a percentage — almost none of those identities will ever be the victims of fraud .
Some other findings from their press release :
A significant finding from the research is that different breaches pose different degrees of risk .
In the research , ID Analytics distinguishes between “ identity - level ” breaches , where names and Social Security numbers were stolen and “ account - level ” breaches , where only account numbers — sometimes associated with names — were stolen .
ID Analytics also discovered that the degree of risk varies based on the nature of the data breach , for example , whether the breach was the result of a deliberate hacking into a database or a seemingly unintentional loss of data , such as tapes or disks being lost in transit .
And :
ID Analytics ’ fraud experts believe the reason for the minimal use of stolen identities is based on the amount of time it takes to actually perpetrate identity theft against a consumer .
As an example , it takes approximately five minutes to fill out a credit application .
At this rate , it would take a fraudster working full - time ­ averaging 6.5 hours day , five days a week , 50 weeks a year ­ over 50 years to fully utilize a breached file consisting of one million consumer identities .
If the criminal outsourced the work at a rate of $ 10 an hour in an effort to use a breached file of the same size in one year , it would cost that criminal about $ 830,000 .
Another key finding indicates that in certain targeted data breaches , notices may have a deterrent effect .
In one large - scale identity - level breach , thieves slowed their use of the data to commit identity theft after public notification .
The research also showed how the criminals who stole the data in the breaches used identity data manipulation , or “ tumbling ” to avoid detection and to prolong the scam .
That last bit is interesting , and it makes this recommendation even more surprising :
The company suggests , for instance , that companies should n’t always notify consumers of data breaches because they may be unnecessarily alarming people who stand little chance of being victimized .
I agree with them that all this notification is having a “ boy who cried wolf ” effect on people .
I know people living in California who get disclosure notifications in the mail regularly , and who have stopped paying attention to them .
But remember , the main security value of notification requirements is the cost .
By increasing the cost to companies of data thefts , the goal is for them to increase their security .
( The main security value used to be the public shaming , but these breaches are now so common that the press no longer writes about them . )
Direct fines would be a better way of dealing with the economic externality , but the notification law is all we ’ve got right now .
I do n’t support eliminating it until there ’s something else in its place .

The media already are reporting that the SCO Group " reported a net loss of $ 4.58 million or $ 0.23 per share for the first quarter , compared to a net loss of $ 2.96 million or $ 0.17 per share in the year ago quarter . "
Revenues declined as well , to $ 7.34 million from $ 8.86 million in the prior - year quarter .
" Despite our decrease in revenue and our increase in net loss incurred during the first quarter , the UNIX business continued to generate positive cash flow , " said Darl McBride , president and CEO of The SCO Group .
The conference call is still in progress .
Call is over .
Steven J. Vaughn - Nichols has the details , such as they are .
And for the historians , there is a 13G / A filed with the SEC by Canopy Group on February 15 , that I just now noticed , memorializing that Canopy Group owned no SCO stock on December 31 , 2005 .
The filing has zeroes from top to bottom .
It 's signed by Lewena Noorda , Chairman , Canopy Group .
UPDATE : Ashlee Vance in The Register , " SCO spends $ 4 m to make $ 30 k in Q1 " : Say what you will about the SCO Group .
The company is a model of consistency .
During its first quarter , SCO turned in lower Unix revenue , fading SCOsource revenues and a statement reminding everyone that it 's waiting for the IBM lawsuit to pay out .
This ritual of disappointment occurs every three months with little variation on the major themes ....
The SCOsource licensing program has proved as unattractive as ever .
The company sold just $ 30,000 worth of IP insurance - down from $ 70,000 last year .
I have a question : who gave them $ 30,000 for SCOsource ?
Anyone know where that comes from ?
Here 's SCO 's press release with the financial details : **************************************
The SCO Group to Release First Quarter Financial Results and Host Conference Call After Close of Market on March 8 , 2006 The SCO Group , Inc. ( Nasdaq : SCOX ) , a leading provider of UNIX ( R ) software technology for distributed , embedded and network - based systems , today reported results for its fiscal first quarter ended January 31 , 2006 .
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was $ 7,343,000 as compared to $ 8,865,000 for the comparable quarter of the prior year .
The decrease in revenue was primarily due to continued competitive pressures on the Company 's UNIX products and services .
The net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was $ ( 4,581,000 ) , or $ ( 0.23 ) per diluted common share , as compared to a net loss of $ ( 2,961,000 ) , or $ ( 0.17 ) per diluted common share , for the comparable quarter of the prior year .
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was $ 401,000 of stock - based compensation expense , which represented the fair value of equity awards issued by the Company as required upon adopting SFAS No. 123 ( R ) .
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 was $ 15,000 of stock - based compensation expense .
" Despite our decrease in revenue and our increase in net loss incurred during the first quarter , the UNIX business continued to generate positive cash flow , " said Darl McBride , president and CEO of The SCO Group .
" We are pleased with the recently announced general availability of our EdgeClick digital services and believe that with the $ 10 million in gross proceeds raised in our private placement in November , we can pursue our business operations and see our lawsuit with IBM through to its conclusion . "
Cash and cash equivalents and available - for - sale marketable securities were $ 19,214,000 as of January 31 , 2006 .
In addition , $ 1,758,000 of cash is held in an escrow account and is classified as a component of restricted cash as of January 31 , 2006 .
The Company 's Business During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 , the Company completed much of the work leading to the general release of SCO 's EdgeClick digital services , which the Company announced was publicly available last week .
The Company now has several customers that are actively using the digital services technology .
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 , the Company completed work with MySQL AB to allow the popular open source database platform to become certified on SCO OpenServer 6 .
The completion of this certification is an important step in permitting MySQL database customers to select SCO OpenServer as a platform on which to run their MySQL database applications .
This opens up new markets for SCO .
Resellers and customers continue to implement OpenServer and UnixWare solutions , and in some cases , customers are replacing competitive operating systems with SCO OpenServer because of the significant performance and reliability advantages SCO OpenServer offers .

Who 's Dropping Out of Labor Force
In a comment to our prior post , Employment Recovery Continues to be Sub-par , Adam notes :
You wrote : " If there were no slack in the labor market , prospective employees would be entering it in droves , not staying away / dropping out . "
I just can't fathom how people who need jobs would GIVE UP ?
Stay away from the market and / or drop out ?
Just totally illogical and counterintuitive .
Contrary to Maslow .
I can go on and on .
I just do n't buy it .
To help answer that question , here 's a view of who is leaving the labor force :
>

Who 's leaving the Labor Force ?
Students , Child Rearing Women , Over - qualified mid-level employees .
Who 's joining the labor pool ?
Babyboomers and Retirees .
Asha Banglore observes :
" Looking at the change in the participation rate by age , chart 3 shows that two age groups ( 16 - 24 years of age and 25 - 34 years of age ) posted the largest declines during 2000 - 2005 .
The participation rate of the cohort aged 55 and over rose by 4.9 percentage points , which invalidates assumptions about baby boomers retiring in large numbers . "
Also noteworthy :
Students leaving low wage jobs to go to College or Grad School -- and in significant numbers ( ages 16 - 24 ) ;
Women leaving the labor force for child rearing ( 25 - 34 ) ;
Over qualified employees unwilling to accept much lower paying / benefits positions ( 35 - 54 ) ;
Census data for college enrollment during 2000 - 04 shows a 12.5 % increase -- that explains the 16 - 24 .
Expect them to re-enter the work force eventually .
" The decline in the participation rate of women in the 25 - 34 years cohort is attributed to women dropping out of the labor force for child rearing , " notes Banglore .
But since women 25 - 34 have been having babies for as far back as I can remember , I have to wonder why the shift in the participation rate happend suddenly in the 2000 - 05 time frame .
While additional data is needed to confirm if women dropped out temporarily or if it is a permanent event , the key question is why did they leave in the first place ?
My guess is that if pay and benefits were better , their numerical drop rate would be less pronounced .
The next grouping is the 35 - 54 year olds .
These are higher paid , more experienced employees -- the most likely to be cut in mass layoffs ( high $ / headcount ratio ) .
Further , they are the ones with the most industry specific skillsets who will be the most difficult to retrain for other industries .
Think auto line workers , mill laborers , and increasingly outsourced jobs like software , legal and accounting .
Ironically , it is the baby boomers who 's participation rates have risen the most ( 55 + ) .
Some have theorized that their return to work is a function of 201ks -- i.e , their 401k plans that got cut in half in the 2000 meltdown , and they have n't recovered financially yet .
Hence , they go back to work . . .

Am I the only one who thinks that Baby Boomers will have to dragged kicking and screaming out of work ?
I think many find a lot ( too much ? ) fullfillment in work , plus prophlagate spenders that they are , I 'm not sure many can afford to retire to the lifestyle they want , yet .

Poll : Fifth of Americans think calls have been monitored RELATED WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
About a fifth of Americans think federal agents have listened in on their phone calls , a CNN / USA Today / Gallup Poll released Tuesday suggests .
Twenty - one percent of the 1,000 adults who replied to the survey conducted Thursday through Sunday said it was very likely or somewhat likely their conversations had been wiretapped , while 52 percent said it was not at all likely .
Twenty - four percent said it was not too likely .
The sampling error for the question was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Shortly after 9/11 , President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to conduct electronic surveillance of communications -- phone calls , e-mails and text messages -- between people inside the United States , including Americans , and terrorist suspects overseas , bypassing a secret court set up to provide warrants for such surveillance .
The Bush administration has said the program is designed to monitor terrorists , while critics say the spying is illegal and may infringe on the civil liberties of Americans .
According to the poll , Americans appear to be split over the legality of the domestic eavesdropping program .
About 49 percent of respondents said the president had definitely or probably broken the law by authorizing the wiretaps and 47 percent said he probably or definitely had not .
( Poll results )
Those numbers were similar to a question about whether the program is right or wrong -- 47 percent said it was right and 50 percent called it wrong .
The sampling error for those questions was plus or minus 5 percentage points .

For years , ecologists have theorized that establishing landscape corridors to connect otherwise isolated plant and animal habitats would encourage biological diversity .
Now researchers working in South Carolina have demonstrated it , at least with plants .
The researchers , who report their findings in the current issue of the journal Science , surveyed dozens of test plots in forested areas of the Savannah River Site , a 310 - square - mile swath of southeastern South Carolina originally set aside to produce nuclear weapons for the military .
( The plots are now managed by the federal Forest Service for pine production . )
The researchers surveyed their sites regularly starting in 2000 and found that , over time , there was more plant diversity in patches connected by corridors than in other patches , even if they had the same total area or the same amount of “ edge ” space between cleared and wooded areas .
Patches connected by landscape corridors “ had 20 percent more species of plants than unconnected patches , ” said Ellen Damschen , the lead author of the report and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California , Santa Barbara .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Opposition among Americans to the war in Iraq has reached a new high , with only about a third of respondents saying they favor it , according to a poll released Monday .
Just 35 percent of 1,033 adults polled say they favor the war in Iraq ; 61 percent say they oppose it -- the highest opposition noted in any CNN poll since the conflict began more than three years ago .
Despite the rising opposition to the war , President Bush said the U.S. will not withdraw from Iraq while he is president .
" In this case , it would give the terrorists and extremists an additional tool besides safe haven , and that is revenues from oil sales , " the president said .
" Leaving before the job is done would be a disaster , " he said .
( Full story )
A bare majority ( 51 percent ) say they see Bush as a strong leader , but on most other attributes he gets negative marks .
( Interactive : Poll results )
Most Americans ( 54 percent ) do n't consider him honest , most ( 54 percent ) do n't think he shares their values and most ( 58 percent ) say he does not inspire confidence .
( Complete poll results -- PDF )
Bush 's stand on the issues is also problematic , with more than half ( 57 percent ) of Americans saying they disagree with him on the issues they care about .
That 's an indication that issues , not personal characteristics , are keeping his approval rating well below 50 percent .
Majority disapprove of Bush
Bush 's disapproval rating exceeds his approval , 57 percent to 42 percent .
That 's in the same ballpark as was found in an August 2 - 3 poll : Bush garnered a 40 percent approval .
And that was up slightly from a 37 percent approval in a poll carried out June 14 - 15 .
Fewer than half of respondents ( 44 percent ) say they believe Bush is honest and trustworthy ; 54 percent do not .
And just 41 percent say they agree with Bush on issues , versus 57 percent who say they disagree .
Americans are about evenly split on whether their commander - in - chief understands complex issues , with 47 percent saying yes , and 51 percent saying no .
Democrats enjoy lead
Bush 's tepid ratings do not bode well for his party 's odds in the coming congressional elections .
Asked which party 's candidate they would vote for if the elections were held today , 52 percent of respondents cited the Democratic Party 's ; 43 percent the GOP's .
Bush dismissed a question about his popularity during a news conference Monday .
" I do n't think you 've ever heard me say : ' Gosh , I better change positions because the polls say this or that , ' " he told reporters .
" I 've been here long enough to understand , you can not make good decisions if you 're trying to chase a poll . "
He added , " I 'm going to do what I think is right , and if , you know , if people do n't like me for it , that 's just the way it is . "
The poll of 1,033 Americans was carried out for CNN by Opinion Research from Friday through Sunday .
The polls had sampling errors of plus - or - minus 3 points .
For today 's How - To , you 'll probably need :
Screwdriver , pliers , wire cutters
Extra phone wires
Splice connectors ( optional )
VoIP Adapter
unstripped
The idea for this one is pretty easy .
We 'll visit the ugly box that Ma Bell graciously left on the side of every single building , ever .
Inside it , we 'll cut the leash and take control .
Back inside , we 'll hook up our handy VoIP adapter so we can use the existing phone jacks that run all over the house .
Most phones get power from the phone line , so there is a limit to the number of phones you can connect to a VoIP adapter .
Your mileage will vary , but you 'll probably be able to use three phones with the average adapter .
If you 've got lots of voltage sucking phones , then you might want to pick up a ring booster We 'll be semi-violating this warning label .
If you connected it to the wall now , the voltage from the phone line would probably do something bad to it .
Before hooking anything up a trip to the telephone companies box is in order .
Our typical access box .
There 's usually some sort of customer access area .
In this case , we have to loosen a screw and the cover pops open .
[ Update :
If you do n't mind going into the telco side of the box , you can probably disconnect the line without cutting ]
Proper application of a screwdriver ( or a dime ) gains access to this rat 's nest .
The module pops open to reveal some color coded screws .
Since our VoIP line will be the primary phone , we 're disconnecting the red and green leads .
Since some lazy tech did n't connect everything , we had to splice together the two sets of red and green wires .
Normal phone wiring has two pairs .
If you 're keeping your regular line , or have DSL on it , the yellow and black wires are the pair to use for a secondary line throughout the house .
The rebel inside is gonna enjoy this part .
Sure we could have unscrewed the terminals , but snipping those cables was more fun .
If you leave any wire attached , make sure they are n't shorted .
Most phone companies leave out of service phone lines powered .
Inside the box , two of the wires were terminated at the screw terminals .
To complete the internal network , they need to be spliced together .
We used standard weatherproof splice connectors available from any hardware store .
To attach them , just insert thewires and squeeze down the circle with a pair of pliers .
The wiring is completed .
The first line is disconnected , and the remaining leads are now spliced together .
Now , the center pair of wires of all the phone jacks are connected to create in internal phone network .
Our packet8 adapter just has three ports on the back .
The Ethernet goes to our router , and now it 's safe to connect the phone jack to a wall outlet inside the house .
Now our VoIP adapter can live happily on our server rack , where it gets a UPS , and delivers phone service to the rest of our house through a pre-existing phone jack .
Bye , Ma .
Do n't let the door hit you on the way out .
Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to treat Taking vitamin D tablets could substantially reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer , research suggests .
US scientists found taking the tablets cut the risk of a disease , which has a poor prognosis in almost half of cases .
There are more than 3,600 new cases of pancreatic cancer in women and more than 3,500 in men in the UK each year .
Surgery is not often effective .
Vitamin D was examined as it previously showed promise in cutting the risk of prostate , breast and colon cancer .
The results of this study do n't mean that people should take vitamin D supplements to ward off pancreatic cancer
Henry Scowcroft
Except for smoking , no environmental factors or dietary factors have been linked to the pancreatic cancer .
But previous studies have suggested that vitamin D might help to block the proliferation of cancer cells .
And pancreas tissue - both normal and cancerous - has been found to contain high levels of an enzyme that converts vitamin D into its active form .
Big study
For the new study , which was led by Northwestern University in Illinois and features in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention , researchers examined data on more than 120,000 people from two large , long - term health surveys .
Taking the US Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) of vitamin D ( 400 IU / day ) was found to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer by 43 % .
They said further work was necessary to determine if consuming vitamin D in the diet , or through sun exposure might have even more of an effect than taking supplements .
Vitamin D helps the body to form and maintain strong bones by encouraging the body to absorb calcium .
However , the researchers found no evidence of a link between risk of the cancer and calcium , or retinol , a vitamin which affects vitamin D's impact on calcium absorption .
Multi-vitamin supplements , often contain retinol .
Lead researcher Dr Hal Skinner said : " There is a growing body of information indicating that achieving higher levels of vitamin D through supplements , diet or prudent sun exposure may provide a range health benefits by preventing common chronic diseases . "
More work needed
He said certain groups could be defined as being at higher risk for pancreatic cancer - for example cigarette smokers or those with a family history of the disease .
However , he said : " I would make no specific recommendation for vitamin D supplementation to prevent pancreatic cancer until we can carry out a trial to determine definitively who might benefit from such an intervention . "
Henry Scowcroft , science information officer at the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " The results of this study do n't mean that people should take vitamin D supplements to ward off pancreatic cancer , especially as vitamin D can be harmful in large quantities .
" As the authors themselves point out , this is the very first study to find any association between the disease and vitamin D intake .
" So this result needs to be repeated in other large studies , and scientists need to show exactly how vitamin D might prevent pancreatic cancer before we could issue any specific lifestyle advice . "

XSteve 's Emacs Power User Tips I use Emacs as integration environment for most of the tasks I need to do .
The other applications I use are : ion3 : A Unix window manager that can be used very effective via the keyboard
zsh : A very powerful shell
Mozilla Firefox :
You certainly know that one ;-)
Emacs : everything else .
See the rest of the page for a bunch of tips
I am also the author of various emacs lisp addon packages .
Finding Files C-x C-f :
The standard way , I use the ffap bindings ; ; ; find file at point ( require ' ffap ) ;; rebind C-x C-f and others to the ffap bindings ( see variable ffap - bindings ) ( ffap - bindings ) ;; C-u C-x C-f finds the file at point ( setq ffap - require - prefix t ) ;; browse urls at point via w3 m ( setq ffap - url - fetcher ' w3m- browse-url )
C-u C-x C-f :
Find the file at point ( via the ffap package ) , relative filenames work also C-x C-j : dired - jump ;; provide some dired goodies and dired - jump at C-x C-j ( load " dired - x " )
C-x C-j opens a dired buffer with point at the actual file name .
You can navigate in this buffer with the cursor keys and open a file via RET Bind M - F12 to recentf - open - files ;; recentf ( require ' recentf ) ( recentf - mode 1 ) ( setq recentf - max - saved - items 500 ) ( setq recentf - max - menu- items 60 ) ( global - set - key [ ( meta f12 ) ] ' recentf-open- files )
M-F12 opens a buffer that contains the recent opened buffers
Use C-s to search for a filename and hit RET to open the file .
Bind M-F11 to a function that uses ido on the recently opened files ( defun xsteve - ido - choose - from - recentf ( ) " Use ido to select a recently opened file from the `recentf - list ' " ( interactive ) ( let ( ( home ( expand - file - name ( getenv " HOME " ) ) ) ) ( find - file ( ido - completing - read " Recentf open : " ( mapcar ( lambda ( path ) ( replace - regexp - in - string home " ~ " path ) ) recentf - list ) nil t ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key [ ( meta f11 ) ] ' xsteve - ido - choose - from - recentf )
M-F11 uses the ido completion functionality to select a file from the recentf - list .
Note : ido-completing - read needs emacs 22 .
Use M-x desktop - save to keep the opened files persistent between sessions ;; save a list of open files in ~/.emacs.desktop ;; save the desktop file automatically if it already exists ( setq desktop - save ' if - exists ) ( desktop - save - mode 1 ) ;; save a bunch of variables to the desktop file ; ; for lists specify the len of the maximal saved data also ( setq desktop - globals - to - save ( append '(( extended-command - history . 30 ) ( file - name - history .
100 ) ( grep - history . 30 ) ( compile - history . 30 ) ( minibuffer - history .
50 ) ( query - replace - history .
60 ) ( read - expression - history .
60 ) ( regexp - history .
60 ) ( regexp - search - ring . 20 ) ( search - ring . 20 ) ( shell - command - history . 50 ) tags - file - name register - alist ) ) )
Use M-x desktop - save once to save the desktop .
When it exists , Emacs updates it on every exit .
Switching Buffers C-x b :
The standard binding , I use ido for buffer switching ( ido - mode ' buffer ) ( setq ido - enable - flex - matching t )
( ido - mode ' buffer ) enables ido for buffer switching
ido - enable - flex - matching means that if the entered string does not match any buffer name , any buffer name containing the entered characters in the given sequence will match .
I use F12 to invoke ibuffer ( setq ibuffer - shrink - to - minimum - size t ) ( setq ibuffer - always - show - last - buffer nil ) ( setq ibuffer - sorting - mode ' recency ) ( setq ibuffer - use - header - line t ) ( global - set - key [ ( f12 ) ] ' ibuffer )
Ibuffer shows a buffer list that allows to perform almost any imaginable operation on the opened buffers .
I use F11 , Shift - F11 to switch to the last recent used buffer
My package bubble - buffer.el allows to navigate to the last recent used buffer via one keystroke ( F11 ) .
When I press F11 again , the buffer before is selected .
Shift - F11 selects the buffer that was selected before by the bubble - buffer package .
The interesting property of the package is , that it does not destroy the order of the buffer list , when a buffer is selected .
( when ( require ' bubble - buffer nil t ) ( global - set - key [ f11 ] ' bubble - buffer - next ) ( global - set - key [ ( shift f11 ) ] ' bubble -buffer - previous ) ) ( setq bubble - buffer - omit - regexp " \\ ( ^ .+$ \\|\\*Messages\\*\\|*compilation\\*\\|\\*.+output\\*$\\|\\*TeX
Help\\*$\\|\\*vc-diff\\*\\|\\*Occur\\*\\|\\*grep\\*\\|\\*cvs-diff\\*\\ ) " )
Use M -F11 : xsteve - ido - choose - from - recentf ( see above ) xsteve - ido - choose - from - recentf allows me to switch to any recently opened file .
The nice thing , using that function is , that it does not matter , if I have the buffer already opened , or if the file must be opened now .
With that function I have a persistent buffer list available .

If someone is planning to gamble on the game , they might go to Vegas just for that purpose .
Also , the NFL only just approved a move for the Raiders to Vegas .
That alone was a big step , and the NFL is not in a position to them go the next step .
There are a few things that have to happen before the NFL can let the Super Bowl be played in Las Vegas .
1. The Laws
The NFL and other sports leagues have to reconcile the new laws that have been allowed because of the Supreme Court ruling on gambling .
This means that the leagues are going to want a piece of the action , and they have to be happy with that before they can let something even bigger happen in Vegas .
Also , the Raiders have to get through a couple seasons without any trouble .
That would help the NFL buy into the way that sports are played in Vegas .
2. The Game Is Too Big
The NFL is worried about the most important game of their season being played under mysterious circumstances , and that is why they would not want the game to be in Vegas .
They can handle having eight games a year in Vegas because that is easy to control .
However , they do not know what would happen because so much money is bet on the Super Bowl ever year .
3. Working With Gambling Support Groups
The NFL has to establish more relationships around the world of gambling before they can let the Super Bowl be played in Vegas .
They want to have something of a partnership with the casinos , and they want to prove to the public that they will not let people gamble all their money away on one game .
4. How Long Will It Be ?
The NFL could have the Super Bowl in Vegas in five to ten years if they want to get the city on the schedule .
Of course , the city has to build a bigger and better stadium , but that is something that could easily happen because they are already working on something for the Raiders .
This means that it is only a matter of time before the league is planning to have the game in the city .
5 . The Raiders Need To Bring Fans
The Raiders also have to prove that people in Vegas actually want to watch these games .
If the team can do well for itself with its own fans , they will be much happier knowing that they can hos the Super Bowl there and get fans in the stadium along with the people can afford to attend the game .
6. The League Moves Slow
The NFL has moved slower than any other league on the gambling issue , and they will be the last to make good on promises to work with the casinos or simply allow sports betting to take place .
The NFL wants to strongarm many of the cities in America into paying them an integrity fee , but they also want to make certain that they have their hand in it .
If that is something that cannot be done , then the NFL will hold out .
That would make it even harder for the league to approve a Super Bowl date in the city .
7. The Money
The city of Las Vegas brings in a lot of money , but they are not used to being partners with sports teams .
The people who love to gamble will go there anyways , and that is something that a lot of people do not understand .
The NFL thinks that people will want to come out and gamble more , but they also want to be certain that they have the best interests of their own league at heart because they want nothing more than to make more money every year .
8. What Is The Prediction ?
The Super Bowl will go to Las Vegas eventually , and it is very interesting for people o predict when that might happen .
The majority of people who are following football believe that it can be done very soon , and they also believe that a lot of money can be made along the way .
The people who want to have a better time in the city will push for the Vegas franchise to have a Super Bowl , and they will see it happen much faster than most .
9. Conclusion
There are a lot of people who are trying to see if the NFL will let the Super Bowl be hosted in the Vegas area .
They might be surprised if the NFL ever lets it happen because the league is so opposed to gambling .

WHAT does it take to get Americans riled about invasions of privacy ?
Every week seems to bring reports of a new breach of the computer networks that contain our most intimate personal information .
Scores of companies -- including Bank of America , MasterCard , ChoicePoint and Marriott International -- have admitted to security lapses that exposed millions of people 's financial information to potential abuse by identity thieves .
For the most part , however , Americans have reacted with a collective shrug , many privacy experts said .
" They feel they can't do anything about it , anyway , " said Lawrence Ponemon , the founder of a privacy consulting company , the Ponemon Institute .
" They move on with their lives . "
Has something fundamental changed in Americans ' attitude toward privacy ?
Conditioned by the convenience of the Internet and the fear of terrorism , has the public incrementally redefined what belongs exclusively to the individual , and now feels less urgency about privacy ?
Mr. Ponemon says this may be the case with young people , who post the most personal information about their lives and loves on blogs that can be read by millions .
A common , but often undocumented , truism among college students is that they are likely to gain 15 pounds during their freshman year .
But now a new study at Rutgers ’ Cook College has found that the “ Freshman Fifteen ” phenomenon is exaggerated .
The study focused on a sample of 67 students who had volunteered to be weighed during a health assessment in the university dining halls in the fall , and underwent a second set of measurements in the spring .
The average weight gain was seven pounds , the result of eating approximately 112 excess calories per day .
“ We found that the first year of college is a period in which weight and fat gain may occur , ” said Daniel Hoffman , one of the professors from the Department of Nutritional Sciences on the study team .
“ But , in the group we studied , the weight gain is less than 15 pounds and is not universal . ”
However , three - quarters of the students who participated in the study did gain weight .
“ This suggests that the freshman year may be an environment where eating more food than the body needs is the predominant state for a significant number of students , ” said Peggy Policastro , co-author on the paper and a nutritionist in the Department of Nutritional Sciences .
“ This may be associated with a decreased physical activity level , prompted by no longer participating in organized sports , having less leisure time than while in high school , or making less of an effort to stay active .
In addition , significant dietary changes are occurring which may include an increased energy intake due to eating at buffet - style dining halls or increased alcohol intake , although we did not measure these factors in our study . ”
Hoffman added , “ The fact that a relatively small change in the calories consumed compared to energy expended could result in a significant gain of fat underscores the importance for eating a balanced diet and engaging in moderate exercise on a regular basis .
In theory , if this level of positive energy balance is maintained through all 4 years of college , these students have the potential to gain 27 pounds by graduation . ”
This weight gain could increase the risk of students for developing Type II diabetes , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia , commonly known consequences of obesity .
Especially troublesome about obesity among college students is that it often lowers self - esteem and hinders academic performance .
“ Given these observations , it is becoming increasingly important to determine exact social and environmental factors that may increase a person ’s risk for gaining weight , ” said Hoffman .
Policastro has simple recommendations to offer students who want to prevent weight gain .
These include cutting calories by choosing a salad instead of chips or fruit instead of ice cream , combined with increasing exercise by walking between campuses instead of riding a bus , exercising during study breaks , or joining an intramural sports team .
In addition to Hoffman and Policastro , the authors of this study included Soo - Kyung Lee , professor of nutritional sciences and Virginia Quick , then an undergraduate in the department .
All are affiliated with the Department of Nutritional Science .
The results of the study will be published in the Journal of American College Health this spring .
I had an enjoyable lunch with Jeff Jarvis today catching up on a number of things and brainstorming about value in the next generation web .
During the conversation I vented a little frustration at the use of buzz words and bubble - like mentality with terms like Web 2.0 .
I am starting to get extremely tired and frustrated about every pitch that I see now where a company claims they are a Web 2.0 company and lists their principal reasons for being Web 2.0 .
It reminds me of the mid-90s when everyone said they were an Internet company and sprinkled their pitch with wild growth expectations from Jupiter Communications .
Or when everyone said they were a Java company when Java was the cool buzzword .
Frankly I do not care if you are Web 2.0 , Web 1.0 , etc .
All I care about is what your service or product does , why it is valuable to the end user , why it is uniquely different from the competition , what the barriers to entry are , and how you plan on reaching your customers and how you will ultimately make money .
Do n’t start your pitch with Web 2.0 ecochamber talk .
In fact as Jeff and I discussed several companies and ideas , we concluded that most of them were just features and not companies .
And as Jeff states , when small is the new big , then it poses problems for VCs as well .
Then Ed and I were talking about similar challenges for investors and entrepreneurs in the small - is - the - new - big age : Today , it ’s much , much easier to start a new company on far , far less capital than it used to be .
But this also means that it ’s easier for someone else to start a competitor .
So speed is more important than ever :
You have to develop your business as quickly and nimbly as possible to build your product and then perfect it after it ’s out so you quickly establish your value .
This means that the VCs need to be able to act just as nimbly to invest as quickly as possible .
The good news is that the investments are smaller and the risk is thus less .
But the bad news , of course , is that it costs more effort and attention to manage many more smaller investments and it ’s hard to act quickly at scale .
Early bird , worm , and all that .
While getting in early and being nimble is a great way to make money , no matter how early you go , it is hard to build a sustainable VC portfolio investing in features .
As an entrepreneur , if you can get up and running for $ 20 - 30 k , so can 10 other talented people .
Fred Wilson and a new VC blogger , Peter Rip , have written some thoughtful posts about a bubble mentality developing .
I have written about it before as well in an earlier post comparing and contrasting 1999 vs today .
In other words , these business models are quite capital efficient .
It is no wonder why VCs are quite excited about next generation web companies .
All that being said , I , like others , worry about believing all of our own hype , and moving ourselves to another bubble .
As you see from Tim ’s map and my table above , if it costs less to build and launch a company , then the barriers to entry must be lower as well .
So if you are an entrepreneur , stop talking about Web 2.0 and start talking about how you are going to scale your business and make money .
Start talking about how you are going to create a defensible barrier to entry .
Better yet , since it is so cheap and easy to get started show me whay you are not just a feature , show me your user growth , and show me how you will maintain your competitive advantage .
Sure , as a startup , you will not have all of the answers and your business model may change , but show me that you care about these business concepts and that you have thought through these issues .
While I am a big believer in the promise of the web , I see this less as a revolution but more an evolution from where we started in the mid-90s .
We are talking about the same principles as the mid-90s , and we would not be here today were it not for the incredibly painful bursting of the last bubble .
But with every bubble bursting comes a rebirth and from the last bubble what we have is lots of cheap bandwidth , resilient entrepreneurs who scraped for crumbs to survive , and a mentality to do it cheaply ( rise of open source and leveraging commodity inputs ) .
What we also have today versus yesterday are business models that can scale cheaply , be profitable , and throw off lots of cash .
Let ’s focus more on these concepts versus being Web 2.0 , as I do not want to think about what kind of rebirth will come from another bubble .
VP debate should be awesome because Pence can't stand women for daring to have cooties .

Atmospheric beauty is becoming more common - and that is bad news for the environment
This rare " nacreous " cloud formation , appearing 12 miles above in the stratosphere , was recently photographed by a scientist at Australia 's Mawson station in Antarctica .
Nacreous are one of the most beautiful of all cloud formations , but they are also the most destructive to our atmosphere .
Their presence encourages the chemical reactions that break down the ozone layer , which acts as an essential shield protecting us from the most harmful of the sun 's rays .
Also known as " mother - of - pearl clouds " , nacreous clouds exhibit spectacular iridescent pastel colours , caused by the sunlight diffracting as it passes around their tiny ice crystals .
Much less dramatic examples of the same optical effect can sometimes be seen as sunlight passes through patches of lower , common cloud like the delicate wisps of ice - crystal streaks , known as cirrus .
These examples of lower - cloud iridescence are , however , nowhere near as dramatic as the glorious displays of nacreous clouds .
Since they form much higher than common clouds - at altitudes of between 12 and 15 miles - nacreous clouds are most apparent around sunrise and sunset when their colours stand out against the darkened sky .
The stratosphere is extremely dry , compared with the cloud - filled lower atmosphere , so the air needs to be very cold indeed for any ice crystals to be able to form there .
Nacreous clouds only appear when stratospheric temperatures are below - 83C .
This happens more frequently during winter in the Antarctic than the Arctic .
This is why this type of cloud is more commonly observed in the southern hemisphere .
It is also why the ozone layer is so much more depleted over the south pole , compared with the north pole .
Besides causing beautiful opalescent colours , nacreous clouds ' tiny ice crystals also act to encourage chemical reactions between ozone and the chlorine and bromine that we have introduced into the atmosphere by our use of substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in aerosols and fridge mechanisms .
Without the presence of stratospheric clouds , reactions leading to the destruction of the ozone layer are negligible .
The nacreous cloud 's ice particles behave as nuclei on to which the ozone breakdown can take place .
Since the use of CFCs has been phased out over most of the world , you might think that the appearance of nacreous clouds should become less of a concern .
The only problem is that the CFC gases we have introduced are expected to hang around in our atmosphere for another 50 years .
During that time , they will continue to react with the protective ozone whenever these clouds appear .
This is why it is worrying that nacreous clouds are appearing more frequently over larger regions of the world .
The most beautiful clouds of all were once only commonly visible to those at the highest latitudes , such as Mawson station , in Antarctica .
Now , across much of Britain , we too can watch the legacy of our troubled relationship with the atmosphere played out in glorious , mesmerising Technicolor .
Though nacreous clouds are officially known as " polar stratospheric clouds " , they are now common over Scotland , and have been observed as far south as the Midlands .
Just as temperatures down on the ground can vary considerably from one winter to the next , so can those up in the stratosphere .
More nacreous clouds appear during colder winters , which lead to a greater subsequent depletion of ozone .
The general increase in observations of these clouds is considered by some scientists as linked to man 's contribution to global warming .
Everyone is now familiar with the way all the CO2 we have introduced into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution has a tendency to trap the sun 's heat into the lower atmosphere .
Perhaps less commonly understood is that , by keeping more of the heat below , increased levels of greenhouse gases also tend to cool the atmosphere above .
Lower average winter temperatures in the upper atmosphere might explain why nacreous clouds seem to be appearing with increased frequency and distribution .

Ashlee Simpson seems to have two sources of inspiration for her " Invisible " video — " Million Dollar Baby " and Chumbawamba's " Tubthumping " — because when she gets knocked down , she gets up again .
It 's something Simpson can relate to , given all the punches she 's taken thanks to a couple of nationally televised embarrassments ( see " Ashlee Blames Gastric Distress For ' SNL ' Lip - Synch Snafu " and " Ashlee Simpson Shrugs Off Orange Bowl Booing " ) .
" It 's a really cool concept , " Simpson said .
" It 's basically about life , about finding the courage to get back up and keep fighting , which I think everybody deals with every day . "
( Check out photos of Ashlee on the set of her video . )
Taking her punches this time in a boxing ring , Simpson plays a pugilist à la Hilary Swank 's " Million Dollar " character , and to help channel a bit of Maggie Fitzgerald 's fighting spirit , the singer shot the clip at the same facility used in the movie .
She also took a few crash - course boxing lessons , where she found her previous experience as a dancer came in handy .
" I had one day of training , and right now , " on the second day of shooting , " I 'm one sore beyotch , " she joked .
Because the emphasis of the video , directed by Marc Webb ( Simpson 's " Boyfriend , " Hilary Duff 's " Wake Up " ) , is how she takes it on the chin , Simpson could n't use a stunt double and had to take more than a dozen falls on her face .
That was intense , she said , but what was harder was repressing her sense of humor .
" I giggle all the time , and I laugh at everything , " Simpson said , " and Marc told me to be tough and not laugh in the ring .
That was difficult . "
What made things a bit easier , she said , was thinking about how her fans stuck by her when she was down in the dumps , and as a tribute to them , her character is fueled by one fan 's devotion .
" There 's a girl that when I get knocked out , I look at her , " Simpson said of the video .
" She 's my fan and she stands by me , and that really helps me get up and keep going . "
Simpson 's new song , however , is n't a tribute to fans but instead seems to address detractors who think they have her all figured out .
The " Invisible " chorus taunts , " You 're the one who looked right through me / Now you 're saying that you knew me / When I was invisible . "
The song , which Simpson recorded with label executive Ron Fair in the producer 's chair , should be available by late June / early July , according to a label representative ; a snippet is currently streaming on the singer 's Web site .
Simpson kicks off her summer tour Monday in Santa Barbara , California ( see " Ashlee Simpson Ready To Hit Road For U.S. Summer Tour " ) .

Cleaning bathrooms may become a thing of the past with new coatings that will do the job for you .
Researchers at the University of New South Wales are developing new coatings they hope will be used for self - cleaning surfaces in hospitals and the home .
Led by Professor Rose Amal and Professor Michael Brungs of the ARC Centre for Functional Nanomaterials , a research team is studying tiny particles of titanium dioxide currently used on outdoor surfaces such as self - cleaning windows .
The particles work by absorbing ultraviolet light below a certain wavelength , exciting electrons and giving the particles an oxidising quality stronger than any commercial bleach .
These nanoparticles then kill microbes and break down organic compounds .
And because surfaces coated with titanium dioxide have another property called ' superhydrophilicity ' -- meaning droplets do not form -- water runs straight off the surface , washing as it goes .
Presently , titanium dioxide can only be activated by the UVA present in sunlight .
But the UNSW team is working on ways to activate titanium dioxide with indoor light .
The team is modifying titanium dioxide nanoparticles with other elements such as iron and nitrogen so they can absorb light at longer wavelengths .
Lab trials show that glass coated with the new nanoparticles can be activated by visible light from a lamp to kill Escherchia coli .
" If you 've got this on tiles or shower screens you do n't need so many chemical agents , " says Professor Amal .
So far the team has been working at laboratory scale .
" It 's probably a year before we can talk to industry and test outside the lab , " says Professor Amal .

Al - Jazeera 's Sami al - Haj is among those in US detention
The Committee to Protect Journalists listed China as the worst offender , for having jailed 32 journalists last year .
Cuba was ranked second for imprisoning 24 reporters in 2005 , followed by Eritrea , Ethiopia and Uzbekistan .
Acting against state interests was listed as the commonest allegation behind the imprisonment of reporters .
Such accusations , including subversion and revealing state secrets , were linked to the cases of 78 out of the 125 journalists imprisoned around the world , according to the report , which was last updated on 1 December .
" We 're particularly troubled that the list of the worst abusers now includes Ethiopia and the United States , " the Committee to Protect Journalists ' executive director , Ann Cooper , said .
" Journalists covering conflict , unrest , corruption , and human rights abuses face a growing risk of incarceration in many countries , " she said .
China on top
The report lists six journalists currently in US custody - four of them at detention centres in Iraq and one at the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The detainees in Iraq include reporters and cameramen working for Reuters news agency and US broadcaster CBS .
Al - Jazeera reporter Sami al - Haj , a Sudanese national arrested in Afghanistan in 2001 , is the only journalist held by the US in Guantanamo Bay , according to the report .
China appeared at the top of the committee 's list for the seventh year in a row .
Almost half the reporters jailed in China worked on the internet .
China , Cuba , Eritrea and Ethiopia together accounted for two - thirds of the reporters arrested worldwide , the report said .
Hostility to Atheism - The Last Socially Acceptable Prejudice ?
A new study by University of Minnesota sociologists Penny Edgell , Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann confirms the longstanding research finding that public hostility towards atheists is considerably more widespread than that towards any other ethnic or religious minority group .
Edgell , et al. conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups and found that prejudice against atheists topped the scale .
For example , almost 40 % of respondents characterized atheists as a group that " does not at all agree with my vision of American society . "
Note that the question did not ask whether the respondent disagrees with atheists on some issues ( which would be a perfectly understandable and noninvidious view ) , but asks if they are a group that does not at all share his views .
The figures for other groups on this question ( with rounding to whole numbers ) :
Muslims : 26 %
Homosexuals : 23
Conservative Christians : 14
Recent immigrants : 13
Jews : 8
Scholars have long recognized that a key indication of tolerance for a group is willingness to accept intermarriage with its members .
Here too , intolerance for atheists leads the pack .
Below are the percentages of respondents stating , with respect to particular groups , that " I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group " ( rounded to whole numbers ) :
Atheists : 48
Muslims : 34
African - Americans : 27
Asian - Americans : 19
Hispanic - Americans : 19
Jews : 12
Conservative Christians : 7
Obviously , some people simply oppose intermarriage with any religious group other than their own .
However , this cannot explain the high opposition to intermarriage with atheists , as it is clear from the results that numerous non-Jewish and non-Muslim respondents are willing to accept intermarriage with Jews and in some cases with Muslims , but unwilling to do so in the case of atheists .
A particularly interesting point is that hostility towards Muslims on both this question and the previous one lags well behind hostility to atheists - even despite 9/11 .
The Minnesota results are consistent with other survey evidence going back for years .
For example , atheists consistently score at the bottom when respondents are asked whether they would be willing support a " qualified " presidential candidate nominated by their party who was a member of a particular group ( even homosexual candidates , the next most unpopular , are less widely rejected ) .
Other , more qualitative , indicators of prejudice also point to widespread hostility towards atheists , even as compared to other relatively unpopular groups .
For example , despite considerable antagonism towards homosexuals in many quarters , there have been quite a few openly gay members of Congress , including even some conservative Republican ones such as Rep. Jim Kolbe and Rep. Steve Gunderson .
By contrast , there has never been , to my knowledge , even one openly unbelieving congressman or senator , despite the fact that atheists and agnostics are roughly 3 % of the population ( about the same as the percentage of gays , and a bit larger than the percentage of Jews ) .
Nor has there ever been an openly atheist president , vice - president , governor , Supreme Court Justice , or member of the Cabinet .
While I certainly would not argue that justice requires proportional representation of atheists in these bodies , the absence of even one open atheist in high political office is still striking .
Similarly , organizations such as the Boy Scouts have taken considerable flak for their refusal to accept gays .
But the Scouts have gotten far less criticism for their equally categorical rejection of atheists .
As in the case of intermarriage , I have no principled objection to groups limited to people who share their particular religion ( e.g. - an all - Catholic or all - Jewish group ) .
The Scouts however , accept members of any and all religions - no matter how odious their beliefs on various issues may be - but reject all avowed atheists and agnostics .
I am not arguing that the government should force the Boy Scouts and other similar groups to accept atheists .
In my view , it should n't .
However , that should not stop us from criticizing their bigotry .
A common argument for various forms of discrimination against atheists is the claim that atheism is a belief system , not an involuntary identity like race or homosexuality .
It is indeed sometimes appropriate to show hostility towards people because of their reprehensible beliefs ( e.g. - in the case of KKK members ) .
But we generally reject such categorical hostility towards members of most religious groups such as Jews or Catholics .
The same principle should apply to atheists - especially since atheism , unlike some religions , is actually compatible with a very wide range of views on moral and political issues .
For example , there have been prominent socialist atheists ( e.g. - Marx ) , prominent libertarian ones ( e.g. - Ayn Rand ) , and even notable conservative atheists such as Whittaker Chambers .
The only common belief that all atheists share is denial of the existence of God , and that should not be a sufficient reason to hate them or discriminate against them as a group .
To avoid misunderstanding , I am NOT suggesting that the position of atheists in the United States is worse than that of homosexuals or African - Americans .
In fact , I believe the opposite is actually closer to the truth .
However , the data do strongly suggest that hostility towards atheists is more widespread ( even if perhaps less intensely felt ) and considered more socially acceptable than racism and homophobia .
Even if the survey results are biased by the unwillingness of some respondents to admit racist views , it is still noteworthy that fewer people seem to have such inhibitions about admitting hostility towards atheists .
NOTE : the link to the Minnesota data above is to a summary on an atheist website because this is the most thorough description I was able to find on the internet .
However , the study itself was not conducted or funded by any atheist organization .
CORRECTION : After checking , it turns out that I was wrong to say that Whittaker Chambers was an atheist even after becoming a conservative .
However , I stand by the broader point that atheism is compatible with a wide range of moral and political views , including conservatism .
Thus , hostility towards atheism on the grounds of its alleged political and / or moral implications is unjustified .
A US Senate Committee has just released a very interesting report on the pre-war intelligence about Saddam Hussein 's non-existent WMD provided by the Iraqi National Congress .
The report by the committee specifically criticized a decision by the National Security Council in 2002 to maintain a close relationship with the Iraqi National Congress , headed by the exile leader Ahmed Chalabi , even after the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency had warned that “ the I.N.C was penetrated by hostile intelligence services , ” notably Iran .
( New York Times )
The whole episode is a remarkably apt illustration of Machavelli 's warning in the Discourses on Livy , How Dangerous it is to Believe Exiles :
Getting these dispatches right is challenging .
Iraq multiplies the challenge .
The chaos of combat has already claimed two pairs of eye - glasses , a video camera , and two digital still cameras ; the environment is merciless , with 117 degree days beating down over land and people .
I was in the Army some years ago and maintained close contact with many friends who made a career of military service .
Naturally , I had an interest in what was happening in Iraq - - I had friends in harm 's way .
But what spurred me to drop what I was doing , get on a plane and fly halfway around the world , to a war zone , was a growing sense that what I was seeing reported on television , as well as in newspapers and magazines , was inconsistent with the reality my friends were describing .
I wanted to see the truth , first hand , for myself .
And what I saw changed how I thought about this war .
The " truth " of this experience is too complex to capture in a body count or a thirty - second sound byte .
It 's chaotic , dynamic and evolving .
It 's unwieldy , wasteful and we have made mistakes .
It 's a struggle of epic proportions that ultimately relies on the strength of a people about whom most Americans seem to know very little .
The longer I stayed , the better I understood things .
And I began to realize that Americans need to see these things in order to understand what is happening here and come to a more informed judgment of whether this struggle is " worth " the cost , in money and lives .
No one can make that determination without a balanced set of facts .
But I do n't do this work to espouse a point of view , or rally people to the right or left .
Some people might find that statement disingenuous .
I 've been criticized for using terms like terrorist and enemy in my dispatches .
Most critics are a safe distance from the battleground .
Up close , its more than a matter of taking sides .
There 's no value in using imprecise language in a futile attempt to appear objective .
There is a difference between Coalition soldiers and Iraqi police officers and the terrorists and criminals they confront .
Whether you call them insurgents or resistance fighters or terrorists , the people who wake up in the morning plotting how to drive explosives - laden cars into crowds of children have to be confronted .
Combat is just one form of confrontation .
I chose another way .
By getting close enough to the truth , for long enough to recognize when reality reveals it , I confront the distortions in how this struggle is portrayed .
I do it because we need to see this clearly : what happens in and to Iraq is a defining moment for our nation , and the world .
This enemy is smart and they are deadly , but they are also losing .
Iraq can become a strong and free nation .
But it will take the constant application of pressure over time to stem the flow of blood .
If we back off too soon , they will rebound .
If we cut our losses and run , they will follow us home .
Peace can prevail here , if we can use our strength to maintain our progress .
More and more people read my dispatches every day , and thousands are taking the time to contact me .
Some are kind enough to hit the support button which funds my operations .
I am especially humbled by comments from the families and loved ones of the soldiers with whom I live and about whom I write .
While the dollars helped me replace my damaged equipment , comments from readers are really what has kept me going for the past seven months .
Thank you to everyone who has supported my work .
Whether you 've sent a few dollars , or pointed your own readers and members my way , or sent an " atta- boy , " it 's all deeply appreciated .
My Southern roots compel me to respond to every email and acknowledge every donation .

Analysis
The long tail merchandising - selling products with relatively low sales - excites technologists who think they have discovered something revolutionary .
But not only is the concept an old one , it 's likely to burn investors .
Goods and services typically follow predictable demand patterns .
The simplest expression is the 80 - 20 rule : 20 percent of the products in a category account for 80 pe rcent of revenues .
In other words , 80 per cent of products do not sell well , and they represent the long flat part of the sales curve — the long tail — where unit sales are negligible .
Nothing New
The long tail is not a new consumer products phenomenon .
The strategy requires large markets .
Retailers with vast merchandise assortments , for example music retailers such as Tower , Virgin and HMV , have typically decided to locate in the largest metropolitan areas , where large numbers of shoppers with diverse interests create demand for products that sell in small quantities .
Technology can turn small markets into larger ones .
Before readers jump to the Internet era , they should pause to understand the impact of prior advances on retail .
A hundred years ago , reliable mail service gave rise to catalogue retailers , whose books of 1,000 pages or more brought goods to farming communities that the local general store did not carry .
Automobiles and highways permitted malls and mass merchants to sprout up in small towns and rural markets , offering broader selections than were previously available outside of central cities .
Each new technology largely supplants the prior one : malls , mass merchandising and big box retail was the death knell of the large catalogs .
So in this historical context , the long tail is an evolutionary development , not a revolutionary one .
Risky business
Pent - up demand for most long tail products is quickly satisfied , but sometimes demand grows around previously marginalized goods and services .
Netflix , for example , boasts how it turned The Conversation , a relatively forgotten film by Francis Ford Coppola into one of its most frequently rented movies .
But this is not a long tail miracle , but market segmentation : discovering how a niche market has different preferences than the mass market and then addressing it .
Using the long tail as a route to profitability is a risky proposition .
There are low barriers of entry for being a long tail merchant .
Almost anyone can create a site and fulfill orders using distributors .
This inability to differentiate based on assortment means that the merchant will either have to find other ways to distinguish their site from a myriad of competitors or they will have to compete on price , a very dangerous place to be .
Amazon.com , for example , continually engineers its software to improve the shopping experience and invests in a substantial distribution system to maintain a competitive advantage that broad assortments , alone , cannot provide .
Even so , Amazon.com cannot escape the need to offer price inducements , as it is doing with a free shipping option .
Bigger Selections are Not Better for Shoppers
Making a decision can be costly for consumers .
Choosing among alternatives entails < a href= " http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2001/spring/1a/ " for consumers , according to economic theory .
If the search costs are too high , shoppers become overwhelmed and avoid a decision , resulting in lost sales .
Big selections , therefore , are a mixed blessing .
Although breadth attracts destination shoppers looking for a specific hard to find products , too many choices results in lost sales for other products by making routine shopping difficult .
Many long tail advocates do not appreciate that editing assortments is a proven route to retail success , while others continue their search for the long tail holy grail , a better recommendation engine .
Consumers say they prefer a selection , but they often go out of their way to find a limited number of choices , albeit the right one for their individual preference .
When buying a shirt , a consumer goes to the retailer they know will likely have the style and price they want ; he or she does not consider every shirt in every color available somewhere in the world .
This is how smaller specialty catalogs drove the big book catalogues out of the marketplace .
Another example is playing out in music retail .
The two segments that gained market share over the last few years were the online sellers and the mass merchants .
Apple 's iTunes Music
Store for digital downloads , and Amazon.com for compact discs have excellent user interfaces that make searching for a specific title significantly easier than driving to a Tower Records , searching through the bins in the hope that the desired title is in stock .
Online selling attracts destination shoppers .
However , impulse purchases account for most of music sold .
Wal - Mart , the largest music seller in the world , places music in highly visible locations at low prices to tempt its shoppers that visit its largest stores twice a week on average .
Wal - Mart needs a limited selection ( about 3,000 titles in 500 square feet ) to entice shoppers with the hits - it could not succeed with a broad selection - so it makes a choice : it deliberately concedes the destination shopper of niche product and older titles to the online sellers , in order to dominate the mass market .
While " Long Tail " is the newest catchy business phrase , but is just another name for a market segmentation using broad assortments .
It is not the ultimate competitive advantage .
In fact , reliance on broad assortments can confuse and alienate consumers and inadequately differentiate a retailer from its competitors .
The long tail it is neither a marketing revolution , nor a guarantee for success . ®

Here 's the first look , net wide , of the Upstart GPS - startup Dash , and their GPS system .
What 's special : Instead of pulling maps , and points of interests from a drive or flash memory , the Dash can pull down real time updates over WiFi or cellular data .
Advertisement
Let me spell it out for you :
When you search for a gas station , it returns street directions , but also the pump prices .
When you search for a movie theater , it returns movie times .
Your maps never get out of date , and your points of interest database could be pulled from all the Google / Yahoo ! / Yelp types of sites , giving you access to a practically unlimited number of ... roadside Denny's .
And then there 's traffic hive - mind thingy ...( jump )
UPDATE : Whoops !
Photo works now ... thanks B.A. Kotaku .
Instead of merely reporting accidents and moving you away from them , the Dash comes with historical traffic data that goes hour by hour , per section of road .
That means it knows that highway 80's average speed is about , oh , 20 miles per hour at 5 pm going towards the bridge .
And in the middle of the night , it should be 60 .
Advertisement
But that does n't account for one time delays like ballgame traffic and accidents .
Say someone using a Dash is stuck in some traffic like that .
The Dash GPSs uses its cellular data link to report slowdown to the Dash central server , which kicks down the fresh data to other users in the area .
So your Dash is part of a traffic avoiding hive mind .
Think about it &Mdash ; Big cities are full of traffic , and early adopters , so this could really work .
Dash GPS 's connectivity also makes it pretty easy to program .
You can use the touchscreen .
Or you can select an address on your PC , right click , and select " Send to Dash " to move it directly to your device .
In the demo I saw , this took about 1 second .

Another thing that impressed me about Dash was how effectively it searches for stuff you need .
Eric searched for propane , and the GPS hooked into Yahoo ! , where it pulled back results for hardware stores , and other places that did n't actually have the word propane in the store 's title .
The web interface is tweakable , too .
One could setup Dash to update RSS feeds with geographic data , for things like apartments on craigslist , or dog parks .

The screens here are from a prototype device , so the UI has a long way to go before it starts shipping in early 2007 .
The hardware is a little thick around the middle , but that 's ok considering this is n't meant to be a pocketable GPS , considering all that connect - licious wireless gear inside .

But people should be careful what they wish for .
A domestic nationalist backlash against the policies that led to the war is brewing , with implications for how the US will deal with Europe and the rest of the world down the road .
Like it or not , American power and involvement are necessary to the proper functioning of world order , and the kind of role that a post - Iraq United States may play is very much up for grabs .
Two recent events constitute straws in the wind .
After the protests and embassy - burnings over the Danish cartoons , no major US newspaper was willing to publish the cartoons , and most editorialists took a holier - thanthou attitude to those European papers that did .
While one might question the prudence of publishing the cartoons , the violent reaction was a clear case of intimidation , in many cases officially sanctioned , and few Americans criticised the protests or stood up for the right of free speech .
Many seemed to feel a certain satisfaction that this time Europeans rather than Americans were feeling Muslim wrath .
The second , and more egregious , case was the successful blocking by the US Congress of the purchase by Dubai Ports World of a British company that operates six US ports .
Coming at a time of heightened economic nationalism on the part of countries such as France , Spain and Poland , which have recently sought to prevent such takeovers , this shameless pandering to public fears of terrorism undermined every principle of openness and globalisation that the US has been preaching in recent years .
What was most notable , however , was the identity of some of the panderers .
While many rightly blamed George Bush for creating a general fear of Arabs and terrorism , Democrats were among the loudest critics , in particular Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton , the Democrats ' leading candidate for president in 2008 .
Clinton , who has positioned herself to the right on security issues , saw an opening to attack the president and argued that the Dubai takeover would constitute a violation of US sovereignty .
It seems not to have occurred to her that by this logic American multinationals are violating the sovereignty of virtually every country on the planet .
Schumer , Clinton 's fellow New York senator and liberal torchbearer , has been leading the charge against outsourcing and competition from China and India .
He has been pressing relentlessly for sanctions against China for not revaluing the yuan and for a host of what he labels unfair trade practices .
While the world has focused on Iraq , trade and jobs remain the most important international issues to many US voters , and Schumer and other Democrats are ready to respond with a protectionist agenda .
We have , then , the makings of a perfect storm .
Bush 's red -state conservative base tends towards a pugnacious nationalism that opposed humanitarian intervention during the Clinton years .
These voters were mobilised by September 11 to support two wars in short order ; while they remain loyal to the president , perceived failure in Iraq will turn them in a more openly isolationist direction .
Democratic voters , meanwhile , have been moving in an economically nationalist direction and are gearing up for a big fight with America 's leading trading partners in Asia .
Voters in both parties have become more sympathetic to calls for closing America 's borders and reducing immigration .
Many in Europe are eagerly awaiting the end of the Bush years , but it is not clear that a Democratic administration will be more broadmindedly internationalist .
By invading Iraq , the Bush administration allowed what should have been characterised as a fight with a narrow extremist ideology to escalate into something the Islamists could claim was a clash of civilisations .
But that clash will play itself out in large measure in Europe , the breeding ground for Mohammed Atta , Mohammed Bouyeri and the July 7 bombers .
The controversy over the cartoons underlines the fact that the US and Europe have more in common in the struggle with radical Islamism than either side would like to admit .
Cooperation to prevent this escalating into a broader civilisational struggle , and to maintain a generally open , integrated international order , will require solidarity .
Neither European indulgence in feelgood anti-Americanism nor a bipartisan rise in US nationalism and populism brought about by perceived failure in Iraq will help .

We 're Very Concerned About Family Values Except Of Course When It Involves Children
Over at This Modern World , SeÃ ƒ Æ ’Ã‚Â±or MaÃ ƒÆ ’Ã‚Â±ana is rightfully appalled about a new CNN story reporting that the American infant mortality rate is higher than that of all other industrialized countries except Latvia .
And not just a little worse , a lot worse : " American babies are three times more likely to die in their first month as children born in Japan , and newborn mortality is 2.5 times higher in the United States than in Finland , Iceland or Norway . "
SeÃ ƒÆ ’Ã‚Â±or MaÃ ƒÆ ’Ã‚Â±ana writes :
Because of some unholy confluence of conservatism , free - marketism , and general head - up - ass - ism , this country has never made health care for all a national priority .
Things like this are the result , and it infuriates me ...
For a nation as advanced and wealthy as we are alleged to be , [ it 's ] unspeakably obscene .
I agree .
But this actually lets us off easy .
America has favorable conditions matched by no other nation that 's ever existed .
We 've suffered less than almost any country from armed conflict , even given the ferocious devastation that was the War of 1812 .
Meanwhile we have an extremely helpful , temperate climate and natural resources coming out of our noses .
By contrast , Japan has 1/3 the infant mortality rate of ours , with no natural resources and sixty years after it was burned to the ground and then nuked .
Europe is also far better , after it almost obliterated itself twice within the past century .
In other words , not only should we have the highest level of average health in the world , it should n't even be CLOSE .
How far we 've fallen short of this says something extremely unflattering about us .
For instance , here 's how Canadian malcontent John Ralston Saul describes America in The Doubter 's Companion :

A GROUP of scientists has discovered that women are attracted to men who are fond of children .
In years gone by , that announcement might have qualified for one of the late Senator William Proxmire 's Golden Fleece awards for pointless scientific research — except that what this particular group of scientists has shown is that women can tell who is and is not fond of children just by looking at their faces .
The members of the group in question , led by James Roney of the University of California , Santa Barbara , are part of the revival of a science that once dared not speak its name — physiognomy .
In the late 18th century , and during most of the 19th , it was believed that the shape of a person 's head could tell you something about his character .
Such deterministic thoughts fell out of favour during the 20th century .
Most behavioural scientists thought that environment , not biology , shaped behaviour , and even those who did not could not see how the shape of the head or features of the face could possibly be relevant .
What Dr Roney and his colleagues have found is that they are .
Their 39 male subjects , selected from a variety of ethnic backgrounds , were shown 20 pairs of pictures , each depicting an adult and an infant .
They were asked to signify their preference for either the adult or the child .
Some reported no interest in the child at all .
The rest expressed a range of interest , including a few who always preferred the pictures of infants .
The men also provided saliva swabs to assess their testosterone levels .
The researchers then took digital photographs of the men and doctored the images so that their hairstyles were obscured , and could not affect the judgments of the female subjects .
These were a group of 29 women , from equally diverse backgrounds , who were shown the photographs .
They were asked to rate the men according to whether they thought the men liked children , and whether those men appeared masculine and physically attractive .
They were also asked to say which men they preferred for short - term and which for long - term relationships .
The results , which have just been published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , confirm that women are very good at reading faces .
The first part of the study provided confirmation of work done previously by other groups , using different methods .
When asked to rate the men's masculinity , the women agreed on who was top and who was bottom , and their rankings correlated with the testosterone levels from the swabs .
What was novel was that when asked to rate the men's liking of children from the photographs , they ranked them in the same order as the researchers had done from the interest the men themselves had shown in pictures of infants .
In physiognomic terms , the first result is easy to explain .
Testosterone has multiple effects .
When its production rises during puberty , it causes both body and mind to be reshaped , so it is little surprise that the former ( square jaws and so on ) reflect the latter ( lust ) .
But Dr Roney and his colleagues were unable to quantify what it was about the faces of the baby - friendly that signalled this attitude to women .
When asked with whom they would prefer to have a short - term relationship , women tended to pick the high - testosterone males .
This makes sense from an evolutionary point of view , since testosterone suppresses the immune system .
Like the proverbial peacock 's tail , an excess of testosterone suggests that an individual must have particularly disease - resistant genes in order to compensate .
These make desirable partners for a woman 's own genes in her children .
The problem with testosterone - fuelled males is that they are less likely to remain faithful to their partners .
By contrast , men who show an interest in children are also likely to make good partners , because they will care for their offspring .
The study showed that women prefer these men for long - term relationships .
Again , no surprise .
The surprise is this : some men were perceived both as masculine and as interested in children .
From an evolutionary point of view , a trade - off between the two would have been predicted .
That would produce what is known as an evolutionarily stable strategy in which the child - loving men father fewer babies to start with , but see as many live to maturity because they help to raise them rather than deserting the mothers .
From the female point of view , the existence of men who are both hunky and child - friendly might seem too good to be true .
For the men involved , it certainly seems like a lot of hard work .
Creativity , speed and good improvisation skills are an absolute must if you try to build a street barricade during riots .
There is little opportunity to use bring - it - yourself materials , so you have to get on with whatever you find on the scene , and good timing is essential if you want to avoid gas grenades and rubber bullets fired by the police during the construction .
Budapest protesters on Monday excelled at all the three necessary skills , using the most absurd building blocks to deter police .
Here are the contenders for the title " Best Barricade Building Block , Budapest 2006 " :
No .
5 .
Metal trash containers with burning trash
Trivial as it may sound , trash containers play a double role : they effectively block grenades and bullets , and , when set on fire , they create a psychological barrier that is difficult to overcome even for the toughest of riot police .
No .
4 .
Concrete mixer
To build the barricade at the Pest end of Erzsébet bridge , protesters used a wide variety of materials taken from a nearby construction yard .
Among lots of brick and wooden panels , they also used a concrete mixer , thus forcing police to deploy an unusual device , a snow plow to break through .
Among all barricades , the one at the bridge took the longest to build and it was the last one to fall .
No .
3 .
Bus
A bus operated by the Budapest Transportation Company ( BKV ) makes a perfect barricade in itself .
On Monday , protesters occupied a number 15 bus , turned it across Bajcsy Zsilinszky út and took cover behind it until things got worse .
They also tried to persuade a trolley bus driver to give up the vehicle , but the driver said no and fled without consequences .
Here 's an animated how - to about the hijacking part , complete with police intervention .
Clever .
( Note that this one was a failed attempt ; the would - be barricade builders fled after the cops showed up . )
Watch all riot videos
No .
2 .
Mobile toilet
Budapest mass events are notorious of the blue plastic toilet boxes , made by a company called ToiToi , emitting a smell which is a horrible mixture of feces , urine and chlorine .
The Monday riots saw the first use of mobile toilets as barricade building elements in the 16 - year old history of Hungarian democracy .
Rioters deployed the ToiTois on Rákóczi út , using the boxes ’ doors as improvised shields to block incoming bullets .
M A I N N E W S First Indian casualty in Lebanon
Tribune News Service New Delhi , July 21
The ten - day - old Israel - Lebanon conflict has claimed the first Indian casualty .
The Foreign Office today confirmed the death of an Indian glass factory worker in Lebanon , Devendra Kumar Swain , who was one of the three Indians injured in Israeli bombings .
Asked if India would lodge a protest against the death of its national , the spokesman said it was not exactly a diplomatic incident .
In response to a specific question from this correspondent whether India would hold Israel liable for payment of compensation to the next of kin of the victim , the spokesman snapped :  I am reporting to you the fact of an unfortunate death of an Indian citizen in a situation of war .
Let us wait to see what happens in terms of completing the formalities of his death .
What you are talking of is largely a political question .
I do not want to get into this question at the moment .
Meanwhile , the Indian warship INS Mumbai reached Larnaca , Cyprus , this morning with over 600 evacuees , six of them Nepalese , the Foreign Office spokesman said .
He said these people were being brought back through Air India planes back to India .
 These planes are likely to land at Chennai , Mumbai and possibly Delhi depending on how many belong to which city .
Indian Navy spokesman Cdr Vinay Garg had said last evening INS Mumbai had left Beirut for Cyprus with 300 evacuees on board .
Asked for the anomaly in figures and how could a warship accommodate 600 persons when Rear Admiral Pradeep Chauhan had on July 19 said at a press briefing that only 250 to 300 could be accommodated in each of the four warships at hand in Lebanon , Commander Garg admitted there was a mix - up .
He said since it was not certain when the next ship could get the berthing facilities , the authorities decided to take as many evacuees on board as possible .
Commander Garg said the helicopters were removed from the deck and put into hangars to make room for the evacuees .
The officer replied in the negative when asked by this correspondent whether this move compromised the warships fighting capabilities .
The challenge : Build the world 's most fuel - efficient production car - one that gets maybe 250 miles per gallon and causes little or no pollution .
The payoff : prize money from the group that awarded $ 10 million for the world 's first private spaceflight two years ago .
When the X - Prize Foundation unveils its new high - mileage car contest later this year , it will join a small but growing number of competitive prizes for energy development .
Instead of watching President Bush and Congress wrangle for months to just get Detroit to boost fuel efficiency by a few miles per gallon , why not offer fat cash prizes to the private sector for breakthrough technologies ?
Proponents say it's a cheaper and faster way to unhook America from its oil dependency .
" Ford 's Model T got 25 miles per gallon , and today a Ford Explorer gets 18 miles per gallon , " says Peter Diamandis , X - Prize Foundation chairman .
" We believe the time is ripe for a fundamental change in what we drive - and we believe an X - Prize in this area can drive a substantial change . "
Several of the prize ideas are coming from the federal government .
For example :
• The Department of Energy ( DOE ) is authorized to award up to $ 10 million in incentives for next - generation technology that could turn wood and other fiber into ethanol .
• The DOE was also authorized by last fall 's energy legislation to offer a $ 5 million " Freedom Prize " for tangible methods to cut US dependence on imported oil .
One drawback is that no money has yet been appropriated for either prize .
But interest appears to be catching on .
In hearings April 27 , Congress weighed a proposal for a new " H - Prize , " which would dangle $ 100 million in awards to speed up development of hydrogen - powered cars .
" There 's been a rediscovery of prize competitions in the private sector , and now it looks like government is starting to follow , " says Thomas Kalil , senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank .
Such contests are n't new .
In 1795 , Nicholas Appert won 12,000 francs and Napoleon 's gratitude for a canning system that fed his army unspoiled food .
Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic solo to win a $ 25,000 prize in 1927 .
And the results have sometimes been impressive .
Within a year after Lindbergh 's feat , the number of aircraft in the US had quadrupled and the number of pilots tripled , says Mr. Diamandis .
Modest government interest has been growing of late .
US agencies procure new technology mostly through contracts with universities and companies .
Taxpayers typically pay , whether or not companies or researchers actually succeed .
But government interest in prizes began to grow after 1996 , when the $ 10 million Ansari X - Prize was announced for a privately financed craft to fly into space .
Interest in the space prize spurred Mr. Kalil , then deputy assistant to President Clinton for technology and economic policy , to organize a National Academy of Engineering investigation into inducement prizes .
The study found key advantages , including contests ' ability to attract a broader spectrum of ideas and participants , cut costs and bureaucratic barriers , shift risk for achieving results to contestants , leverage financial resources , and inspire the public .
In its final report , the academy recommended that " Congress encourage federal agencies to experiment more extensively with inducement prize contests . "
On Friday , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced a new $ 2.5 million contest - to be administered by the X - Prize Foundation - called the " Lunar Lander Challenge . "
Winners of the contest must develop a lander that can take off , hover , travel 100 meters , land - and then take off again and return to the starting point .
Back on Earth , former Rep. Robert Shamansky wants to propose a national contest for a high - mileage car .
During his first tour in the US Congress in 1982 , when the nation was still reeling from the second oil shock , the Ohio Democrat sponsored a bill to award $ 150 million to the developer of a car that got at least 80 miles per gallon .
His bill foundered after he lost his reelection bid .
Now , running in Ohio's 12th District , he hopes to revive the plan .
The idea may have been ahead of its time , Mr. Shamansky says in a phone interview .
But " we have to be less dependent on oil - period .
The contest idea was good then - and it's good now . "
Pulling off such contests also requires a bit of P.T. Barnum showmanship to motivate the right people .
" There are countless failures you do n't hear about , " says Diamandis of the X - Prize Foundation .
" It 's all about creating the dynamic to attract the maverick thinker ....
It 's not about the gizmo - it 's about the human being . "
That means inspiring the likes of Felix Kramer , a California Internet entrepreneur who hopes to partner with a big auto company to create a high - mileage car .
That 's what his CalCars team did in September 2004 , when it developed the prototype of a Toyota Prius with an electric cord , which users could plug in to charge a beefed - up battery .
The extra reliance on electric power gives the " Prius - plus " better than 80 miles per gallon .
" Whatever this competition does , it has to somehow get Detroit involved , " Mr. Kramer says .
" A big golden carrot should help do that . "
How can the human race survive the next hundred years ?
I do n't know the answer .
That is why I asked the question , to get people to think about it , and to be aware of the dangers we now face .
Before the 1940s , the main threat to our survival came from collisions with asteroids .
Such collisions have caused mass extinctions in the past , but the last one was 70 m years ago , so the likelihood that we will need the services of Bruce Willis in the next hundred years is very small .
A much more immediate danger , is nuclear war .
America and Russia , each have more than enough warheads to kill everyone on Earth , several times over , and the same may now be true of China .
The world came perilously close to nuclear annihilation on more than one occasion in the last 50 years .
With the ending of the cold war , the threat has become less acute , but it has not gone away .
There are still enough nuclear weapons stockpiled to kill us all , and their use might be triggered by an accident that convinced a country that it was under attack .
There is now a new danger from small and potentially unstable countries acquiring nuclear weapons .
Such minor nuclear powers might cause millions of deaths , but they would not threaten the survival of the entire human race , unless they sparked a conflict between the major powers .
These dangers of asteroid collision and nuclear war , have now been joined by a host of other threats to our survival .
Climate change is happening at an ever increasing rate .
While we are hoping to stabilise it , and maybe even reverse it , by reducing our CO2 emissions , the danger is that the climate change may pass a tipping point at which the temperature rise becomes self sustaining .
The melting of the Arctic and Antarctic ice reduces the amount of solar energy that is reflected back into space and so increases the temperature further .
The rise in sea temperature may trigger the release of large quantities of CO2 , trapped at the bottom of the ocean , which will further increase the greenhouse effect .
Let 's hope we do n't end up like our sister planet Venus with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid .
There are other dangers , such as the accidental or intentional release of a genetically engineered virus .
Each time we increase our technological powers , we add new possible ways in which things could go disastrously wrong .
The human race faces an increasingly dangerous future .
There 's a sick joke that the reason we have n't been visited by aliens is that when a civilisation reaches our stage of development , it becomes unstable and destroys itself .
In fact , I think there are other reasons why we have n't seen any aliens , but the story shows how perilous the situation is .
The long - term survival of the human race will be safe only if we spread out into space , and then to other stars .
This wo n't happen for at least 100 years so we have to be very careful .
Perhaps , we must hope that genetic engineering will make us wise and less aggressive .
Untitled Document AT&T technician Mark Klein learned of a secret room installed in the company 's San Francisco internet switching center ... what he saw and learnt prompted him to call at the Electronic Frontier Foundation unannounced in late January 2005 with documents in hand .
The EFF was already preparing a class - action lawsuit against AT&T for allegedly turning over customer phone - record data to the NSA -- relying on reporting from the Los Angeles Times about AT&T giving the NSA access to a phone - record database with 1.88 trillion entries .
More here at Wired .
Now a heavily redacted 40 page document document by internet expert J. Scott Marcus has been supplied and is available here .
PDF Alert !! 40 pages .
Briefly Marcus says , based on the Klein documents , his experience , knowledge of AT&T and understanding of what equipment is available that ..
The AT&T documents that Klein supplied are genuine .
There could be 35 - 40 such rooms throughout the US .
The internet surveillance program covers domestic traffic not only just international traffic .
Most International traffic enters the US through only 3 points Florida New York and San Francisco .
Marcus notes that the AT&T spy rooms are " in far more locations than would be required to catch the majority of international traffic "
The system is capable of looking at content , not just addresses .
The configuration described in the Klein documents -- presumably the Narus software in particular -- " exists primarily to conduct sophisticated rule - based analysis of content " , Marcus concludes .
The system looks at all traffic not just AT&T but those transiting AT&T networks .

A little history .
Way back when Bill Gates was designing a BASIC instruction set he ( along with everybody else until Microsoft introduced Compiled or CBasic ) which was interpretive .
That means it took each line of code and processed it .
Troubleshooting was non - existent and de-bugging tools primitive .
A utility resulted called TRON / TROFF was used , slow , cumbersome , but it worked and is best explained by the Commodore Basic handbook ;
The TRON statement activates trace mode .
When active , as each statement is executed , the line number of that statement is printed .
The TROFF statement turns off trace mode .
Of course most people will remember TRON as the 1982 (!)
Disney movie , with Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner who played the young programmwer TRON - this was the very first movie to use computer generated graphics - which appear today to be unbeleivably primitive .
As systems , grew in complexity and multi-user tasking came along , and TCP / IP emerged , it became necessary to test what was happening as a packet was sent .
A guy called Van Jacobson in 1987 from a suggestion by Steve Deering came up with a Unix utility called TRACE ROUTE or tracert .
This is how Microsoft explain its function and method .
How the TRACERT Command Works ( Microsoft on line help )
The TRACERT diagnostic utility determines the route taken to a destination by sending Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) echo packets with varying IP Time - To - Live ( TTL ) values to the destination .
Each router along the path is required to decrement the TTL on a packet by at least 1 before forwarding it , so the TTL is effectively a hop count .
When the TTL on a packet reaches 0 , the router should send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source computer .
TRACERT determines the route by sending the first echo packet with a TTL of 1 and incrementing the TTL by 1 on each subsequent transmission until the target responds or the maximum TTL is reached .
The route is determined by examining the ICMP Time Exceeded messages sent back by intermediate routers .
Note that some routers silently drop packets with expired TTLs and are invisible to TRACERT .
TRACERT prints out an ordered list of the routers in the path that returned the ICMP Time Exceeded message .
If the -d switch is used ( telling TRACERT not to perform a DNS lookup on each IP address ) , the IP address of the near - side interface of the routers is reported .
In a sense it works in a set wise mode just the way TRON / TROFF did decades ago .
Now you are ready to test if your packets are finding their way through AT&T , there 's the easy way ; Go to www.dnsstuff.com you will find a range of tests you can perform , quickly and easily , on the right of the second row you will find a red box labeled Traceroute .
Let us enter then , say the text ... nsa.gov ... or even their IP address ...
12.110.110.204 and press the button .
A list will be returned showing the times and route of the packet - you will in the column labelled HOSTNAME that the signal will travel through a switch labelled like this tbr1-p013901.wswdc.ip.att.net .
or maybe
ar2-a3120s6.wswdc.ip.att.net .
or even unknown.att. net
Now the att identifies the switch as AT&T , you can identify the town ( the system uses geolocation which is not very precise ) by using the box in the centre of the fourth row " Find the city " by entering the IP address in the IP column immediately left of the HOSTNAME column tbr2012701.phmaz.ip.att.net [ 12.123.206.30 ]
City : Morristown , New Jersey tbr2-cl1592.dlstx.ip.att.net [ 12.122.10.81 ]
City : Morristown , New Jersey tbr1-cl6.sl9mo.ip.att.net [ 12.122.10.89 ]
City : Fargo , North Dakota tbr1-cl4.wswdc.ip.att.net [ 12.122.10.29 ]
City : Fargo , North Dakota ar2 - a3120s6.wswdc.ip.att.net [ 12.123.8.65 ]
City : Adrian , Michigan Interestingly if you do a " Whois " query using the IP address you will find all these IP addresses were Registered on the 26th November 2003 , at AT&T Worldnet Services , 200 South Laurel Ave.
Middletown NJ
Zip 07748 there are also other curious similarities for you to ponder .
You can try the hard way and get the same results by calling up the MSDOS prompt and entering at the C : \Windows \ pompt tracert nsa.gov
This will return the same list as the DNS utility but without the helpful notes etc. , Now try this out with other IP addresses other than nsa.gov - as Marcus calculates 10 % of all calls are passing through these rooms , do n't expect every IP adress to be picked up every time .
It would be neat if someone could co-ordinate the location of all the locations - which would give a precise number and location of the rooms .
The list above is a start .

What is Voice over IP really ?
What do you need for Voice over IP ?
What do you mean , I can't call my girlfriend ?
What 's all that buzz about open and proprietary protocols ?
Can I start my own telecom service ?
This article addresses these questions and compares the most popular Linux applications for calling and conferencing .
What Is Voice over IP about ?
Internet or digital telephony , or Voice over IP , often abbreviated as VoIP , allows parties to exchange voice data streams over the network .
The big difference is that with VoIP the data flows over a general - purpose network , the Internet , whereas conventional telephony uses a dedicated network of voice transmission lines .
Under special circumstances , a VoIP network can be connected with the conventional telephone network .
However , at the time of this writing , that is certainly not the standard .
In other words , it is likely you will not be able to call people who are using a conventional telephone .
Although currently various applications are available , both free and proprietary , telephony over the Internet has some major drawbacks .
Most noticeably , the system is unreliable , it can be slow , or there can be a lot of noise on the connection .
Therefore , it can not be used to replace conventional telephony .
Think about emergency calls , for instance .
Although some providers take some precautions , there is no guarantee you will be able to reach the party you want to call .
This is worsened , because in VoIP , there is no agreement yet on a standard for assigning numbers , like the E.164 standard we have for assigning and identifying traditional land lines and mobile phone numbers .
Even if there is some form of integration between VoIP and conventional telephony networks , this is still different for mobile networks .
The major problem is that wireless network coverage is not as well developed as cellular network coverage .
Additionally , there is the issue of costs when accessing the Internet from your mobile phone .
For me , it would amount to 0.50 EUR (+/- $.60 US ) per 100 K of traffic .
It is possible that integration of VoIP in the third - generation telephony network will ease these troubles .
You also should be aware that there is no encryption in VoIP .
So , it is fairly easy for anyone to eavesdrop on conversations .
The bottom line is although VoIP is useful , it is not a replacement for land - line telephony ( yet ) .
Let 's look at what you 'll need to get VoIP up and running .
On the Server Side First of all , you need a provider offering the service .
Some popular providers offer the service for free , and some require a subscription fee .
Among the free ones are the following : SIPphone , Skype , SIP Broker and Google .
Most free services , however , do not allow you to connect with the conventional telephone network .
This so - called full phone service is usually not free .
Among the most popular full phone service providers are the following : Vonage , Lingo , AOL TotalTalk and SIPphone .
These lists are certainly not exhaustive , as new local and global providers join the pool on a near - daily basis .
Also , many SMEs are currently setting up a VoIP network for internal use within companies .
If you want to set up your own VoIP network , you might want to look into Asterisk server software or sipX , which are open - source PBX implementations .
Alternatively , if you want to use only the soft phone , meaning the audio system of your computer ( audio boxes and microphone or headset ) and accompanying software , check out Ekiga , formerly GnomeMeeting , as announced January 8 , 2006 , in the GnomeMeeting blog .
Although Ekiga supports a range of hardware , it is usually set up to support ( video ) conferencing features implemented on the software level .
Like sipX and Asterisk , it is open - source software .
Note : PBX stands for Private Branch eXchange , the system that centralizes all of a business ' telephone sets .
Figure 1 . A Typical VoIP Solution ( image courtesy of BroadVoice )
On the Client Side Depending on your network architecture , some applications might work better than others , due to the protocols they use .
Most standards - based solutions use either the H.323 or Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) .
Apart from these two standards , there are a lot of proprietary protocols , such as Skype ( from the company with the same name ) and SCCP from Cisco .
The main difference between them is that SIP stores the client IP address in its packages , resulting in difficulties when you are behind a firewall .
Microsoft NetMeeting and GnomeMeeting use H.323 ; Microsoft's Messenger and Apple 's iChat and SIPphone uses SIP .
Server software usually implements several different protocols .
Apart from your network architecture , available bandwidth also might be a limiting factor , as some applications are optimized for low bandwidth , and others expect to be on a broadband connection .
This depends on the codecs the VoIP systems use for handling sound .
As far as client hardware is concerned , use a headset .
Although your PC , especially if it is a laptop , might have a microphone and speakers built in , you will be far more comfortable using a headset , as it will suppress echo and noise from your environment .
If you have the choice , opt for a USB headset .
A USB headset is a separate audio device to your system .
It functions independently from existing audio hardware , so it avoids any conflicts that might occur between VoIP and normal sound processing .
If the applications you use provide the features , you can redirect audio streams as desired .
For instance , you can make the ring tone for alerting you that you have a call come through the normal speakers .
When you pick up the call , the voice of the calling party is redirected to your headset .
Your Sound System Prior to experimenting with VoIP applications , you probably will have to use a bit of trial and error to find settings that are comfortable for you .
Make sure that you can record and play a sample of your own voice before you start , as the VoIP programs also will use the recording function of your hardware .
Activate it in the volume control application that comes with your distribution .
Linux generally has two types of sound architecture : the older Open Sound System or OSS , which works with every UNIX - like system , and the newer Advanced Linux Sound Architecture or ALSA , which has better support for Linux , as the name indicates .
One application may support OSS and another , ALSA .
When you have a choice , we advise you to select the use ALSA option in VoIP programs .
Select ALSA or OSS settings for sound and recording levels accordingly in your distribution 's volume control panel .
We tested four applications , based on popularity .
We tested all of them on Fedora Linux .
Ekiga , aka GnomeMeeting Installation : use the package manager from Fedora .
Alternatively , download Debian , Mandrake or Red Hat packages .
Ekiga requires the pwlib , OpenH323 and libavc1394 packages .
Getting started — registration : the application shows up in the menus as Video Conferencing .
We experienced GConf errors the first time we used it .
The solution to that problem is described in the GnomeMeeting FAQ .
Once we solved that problem , we could get started with the First Time Configuration Druid .
You can register in the general GnomeMeeting users directory ( a telephone book on a central server ) or skip this step .
My audio devices were recognized automatically , and it was easy to select the headset .
You do n't need to know the device names of your hardware .
For beginning users , it is a great relief not having to worry about / dev/dsp1 and those sorts of names .
As shown in Figure 2 , all applicable devices can be neatly selected from a list .
Figure 2 . GnomeMeeting — Configuration Presumably , your machine needs to be configured as an LDAP client ( Lightweight Directory Access Protocol , or Active Directory on MS Windows ) in order to be able to contact the central GnomeMeeting directory .
Lacking that , you need to know the hostname or host IP address and user names of the people you want to call .
If you do n't use LDAP , you will receive error messages when you try to call someone , even if you can make a successful call .
Figure 3 . GnomeMeeting — Interface Impressions : at first there was quite some noise on the connection , even when calling another host in the same subnet , but we could minimize the noise by adjusting the audio volume .
There is a mute button for suspending and resuming audio transmission .
Luckily , the system with URLs to contact people is well documented in the help files .
The application itself does n't make it easy to use .
KPhone Download using your favorite system tool , such as Synaptics on Ubuntu .
Installation : the package manager does the installation for you .
You also can download RPM packages and install them using your distribution 's tools .
After the installation is finished , the KPhone selection turns up in the application menus .
Figure 4 . KPhone — Minimalistic Interface Getting started : your own address is displayed in the little KPhone window , which makes it easy to exchange with other users .
It also serves as an example for connecting with other users .
The phone book in this application is easy to use .
In the most basic case , simply let others call you , and received and missed caller IDs will show up in the phone book automatically .
Figure 5 . KPhone — Accepting a Call Impressions : KPhone has a very sober interface , which makes it easy to use and configure the program .
At one time , I obviously must have configured the wrong audio device while trying to configure KPhone to use my USB headset instead of the built - in speakers and microphone on my laptop .
There is no list from which to choose audio devices ; this was rather frustrating .
KPhone also segfaulted on me a couple of times , even after it had worked fine earlier .
I could not get my USB headset to work .
Admittedly , I did not use the latest version .
Newer versions , which need to be compiled from source on many systems , at the time of this writing , are reported to work better and have much improved sound quality .
KPhone has matured a lot in the newest releases and probably will become even more popular than it is already as binary packages are made available .
Skype Download from the Skype site ( see the on- line Resources ) ; packages are available for SUSE , Fedora , Mandriva and Debian .
Installation : I opened the downloaded file directly in the system installer .
It shows up in the Internet menu in GNOME after the installation is finished .
Figure 6 . Skype — Connection Established Getting started — registration : register from inside the client .
Choose a user name and password .
Enter your e-mail address if you want to be reminded of your password later on .
In the contact list , select or search for the person whom you want to call .
You can ask permission to be notified when that person is on - line .
Figure 7 . Skype — Contact List Impressions :
Skype is easy to search by name , city and country .
When you start it up , you will see a list of missed calls and contacts that are currently on - line , which is quite handy .
Skype can be configured to use PC speakers for incoming call alerts and a headset for actual communication .
Figure 8 . Skype — Call List
In the call list , contacts can be displayed by name , or you can sort by incoming , outgoing and failed calls .
On the downside , the application does not seem to be very clean .
After a while , I could not log in anymore , and it turned out that five instances of Skype had been running simultaneously on my computer , even though I used the buttons and menus to quit Skype .
Also , it does not seem to be very stable on Linux .
I had what appeared to be remote sound problems , but the problem was local and could be solved by stopping and starting Skype .
X - Lite Download from the CounterPath Web site ( see Resources ) .
Installation : extract the archive to a folder in your home directory ; the default name is xten - lite .
In this folder , you will find the executable file , xtensoftphone .
Getting started — registration : right - click on the soft - phone image that appears at startup .
This starts the Audio Tuning Wizard , which allows you to select audio devices .
Select / dev/dsp1 when using a headset .
Adjust the speaker volume and voice recording volume according to your needs .
You can register at support.xten.net to join the CounterPath community , or your system administrator might have set up a private service .
I used the X - Lite interface for testing with the Asterisk service at work .
In both cases , you need to provide a login name and password , which you get either from the CounterPath registration on the Web site or from your administrator .
Figure 9 . X - Lite Controls Impressions : X - Lite is the only application on this list that actually tries to look like a cell phone .
You can select a codec according to your needs .
For instance , choose the GSM codec for low - bandwidth usage or when you are in a conference call .
Select the g711a or g711u codec when you are in a one - on - one call , and bandwidth is not really an issue .
Figure 10 .

“ It ’s a pity it ’s so commercial now , ” Mr. Pellat - Finet said .
For more than five years , he has splashed oversize skull graphics — sporting , say , Mickey Mouse ears — on his sweaters .
“ Maybe Wal - Mart will replace their smiley - face with a tête de mort , ” he added , using the French term for skull .
“ It ’s lost its meaning . ”
Well , it still has one meaning for Mr. Pellat - Finet , whose latest skull sweaters are embellished with Afros and top hats , among other images .
Asked if he will stop using the motif , he responded with a chuckle : “ No , no , no .
It ’s my best seller ! ”
Image Alexander McQueens silk scarf is a best seller .

Other designers appear to have similarly mixed feelings : on one hand , they are confronted with skull saturation ; on the other , skulls are ringing the dinner bell louder than ever .
Alexander McQueen ’s fall men’s wear show did not play up skull imagery on the runway — surely the critics would be bored — but there are plenty back in the showroom , on sports coats , polo shirts and trousers .
His $ 210 skull - print silk scarf is one of the best - selling items on the men ’s designer floor at Barneys New York .
“ We ’ve sold 400 since May , ” said Timothy Elliott , a Barneys spokesman .
“ We sell them as fast as they come in . ”
Many people point to the “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” franchise as fuel for skullmania .
But the skull ’s ascent to the logo throne has more to it and behind it than a Disney marketing campaign .
Reminiscent of the vogue for angels a decade or more ago — remember how the little winged creatures were everywhere ?
— the skull neatly encapsulates a cultural moment in terms both precise and vague .
Video : 50 year study says conservatives ' followers ' RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday July 11 , 2006 Print This | Email This
In an interview with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann , former Nixon counsel John Dean explained a largely unknown 50 year academic study .
The data shows that conservatives are much more likely to follow authoritarian leaders .
Dean discovered the ongoing study while researching his new book , " Conservative Without Conscience . "
Dean believes that the study helps to explain why the Republican party has been driven further right .
A rush transcript follows the video .
Rush Transcript DEAN : Goldwater Republicanism is really R.I.P .
It 's been put to rest by most of the people who are now active in moving the movement further to the right than it 's ever been .
I think that Senator [ Goldwater ] , before he departed , was very distressed with Conservatism .
In fact , it was our conversations back in 1994 that started this book .
That 's really where I began .
We wanted to find answers to the question , " Why were Republicans acting as they were ? " --
Why Conservatives had taken over the party and were being followed as easily as they were in taking the party where [ Goldwater ] did n't want it to go .
OLBERMANN : What did you find ? --
In less than the 200 pages that the book goes into .
DEAN : I ran into a massive study that has really been going on 50 years now by academics .
They 've never really shared this with the general public .
It 's a remarkable analysis of the authoritarian personality .
Both those who are inclined to follow leaders and those who jump in front and want to be the leaders .
It was not the opinion of social scientists .
It was information they drew by questioning large numbers of people -- hundreds of thousands of people -- in anonymous testing where [ the subjects ] conceded their innermost feelings and reactions to things .
And it came out that most of these people were pre-qualified to be conservatives and this , did indeed , fit with the authoritarian personality .
OLBERMANN : Did the studies indicate that this really has anything to do with the political point of view ?
Would it be easier to impose authoritarianism over the right than it would the left ?
Is it theoretically possible that it could have gone in either direction and it's just a question of people who like to follow other people ?
DEAN : They have found , really , maybe a small , 1 % , of the left who will follow authoritarianism .
Probably the far left .
As far as widespread testing , it 's just overwhelmingly conservative orientation .
OLBERMANN : There is an extraordinary amount of academic work that you quote in the book .
A lot of it is very unsettling .
It deals with psychological principles that are frightening and may have faced other nations at other times .
In German and Italy in the 30's , come into mind in particular .
But , how does it apply now ?
To what degree should it scare us and to what degree is it something that might be forestalled ?
DEAN : To me , it was something of an epiphany to run into this information .
First , I 'd never read about it before .
I sort of worked my way into it until I found it .
It 's not generally known out there , what 's going on .
I think , from the best we can tell , these people -- the followers -- a few of them will change their ways when the realize that they are doing -- not even aware of what they are doing .
The leaders , those inclined to dominate , they 're not going to change for a second .
They 're going to be what they are .
So , by and large , the reason I write about this is , I think we need to understand it .
We need to realize that when you take a certain step of vote a certain way , heading in a certain direction , where this can end up .
So , it 's sort of a cautionary note .
It 's a warning as to where this can go .
Other countries have gone there .
OLBERMANN : And the idea of leaders and followers going down this path or perhaps taking a country down this path requires -- this whole edifice requires and enemy .
Communism , al Qaeda , Democrats , me ... whoever for the two - minutes hate .
I overuse the Orwellian analogies to nauseating proportions .
But it really was , in reading what you wrote about , especially what the academics talked about .
There was that two - minutes hate .
There has to be an opponent , an enemy , to coalesce around or the whole thing falls apart .
Is that the gist of it ?
DEAN : It is one of the things , believe it or not , that still holds conservatism together .
There is many factions in conservatism and their dislike or hatred of those they betray as liberal , who will basically be anybody who disagrees with them , is one of the cohesive factors .
There are a few others but that 's certainly one of the basics .
There 's no question that , particularly the followers , they 're very aggressive in their effort to pursue and help their authority figure out or authority beliefs out .
They will do what ever needs to be done in many regards .
They will blindly follow .
They stay loyal too long and this is the frightening part of it .
OLBERMANN : Let me read something from the book .
Let me read this one quote then I have a question about it .
" Many people believe that neoconservatives and many Republicans appreciate that they are more likely to maintain influence and control of the presidency if the nation remains under ever - increasing threats of terrorism , so they have no hesitation in pursuing policies that can provoke the potential terrorists throughout the world . "
That 's ominous , not just in the sense that authoritarians involved in conservatism and now Republicanism would politicize counter - terror here which we 've already argued that point on many occasions .
Are you actually saying that they would set up -- encourage terrorism from other countries to set them up as a boogey man to have , again , that group to hate here -- more importantly , afraid of ?
DEAN : What I 'm saying is that there has been fear mongering , the likes of which we have not seen in a long time in this country .
It happened early in the cold war .
We got accustomed to it .
We learned to live with it .
We learned to understand what it was about and get it in proportion .
We have n't done that yet with terrorism .
And this administration is really capitalizing on it and using it for its ' political advantage .
No question , the academic testing show -- the empirical evidence shows -- when people are frightened , they tend to go to these authority figures .
They tend to become more conservative .
So , it 's paid off for them politically to do this .
OLBERMANN : This all seems to require , not merely , venality or immorality but a kind of amorality where morals do n't enter into it at all .
" We 're right .
So anything we do to preserve our process , our power -- even if it by itself is wrong -- it 's right in the greater sense . "
It 's that wonderful rationalization that everybody uses in small doses throughout their lives .
But , is this idea , this sort of psychological sort of review of the whole thing , does it apply to Dick Cheney ?
Does it apply to George Bush ?
Does it apply to Bill Frist ?
Who are the names on these authoritarian figures ?
DEAN : You just named three that I discuss at some length in the book .
I focused in the book , not on the Bush Administration and Cheney and The President because they had really been there done that , but what I wanted to understand is what they have done is made it legitimate to have authoritarianism .
It was already operating on Capitol Hill after the ' 94 control by the Republicans in Congress .
It recreated the mood .
It restructured Congress itself in a very authoritarian style , in the House in particular .
The Senate has n't gone there yet but it 's going there because more House members are moving over .
This atmosphere is what Bush and Cheney walked into .
They are authoritarian personalities .
Cheney much more so than Bush .
They have made it legitimate and they have taken way past where anybody 's ever taken it in the United States .
OLBERMANN : Our society 's best defense against that is what ?
Do we have to hope , as you suggested , the people that follow , wise up and break away from this sort of lockstep salute to , " of course , they 're right , of course there are WMDs , of course there are terrorists , of course there is al Qaeda , of course everything is the way the president says it . "
Or do we rely on the hope that these are fanatics and fanatics always screw up because they would rather believe in their own cause than double - check their own math .
DEAN : The lead researcher in this field told me , he said , " I look at the numbers of the United States and I see about 23 % of the population who are pure right - wing authoritarian followers . "
They 're not going to change .
They 're going to march over the cliff .
The best thing to deal with them -- and they 're growing , and they have a tremendous influence on Republican politics --
The best defense is understanding them , to realize what they are doing , how they 're doing it and how they operate .
Then it can be kept in perspective and they can be seen for what they are .
Because of not fully correct testing methodology , benchmark results are not fully correct .
So , I decided to redo all tests .
New benchmark results you can get in “ Looking For Optimal Solution ” series Summary post .
This week we have started one new project with Ruby on Rails as primary framework .
My first task was to prepare runtime environment for it on one of our development servers .
When I have tried to research how people doing it , I noted that there is no information about how to deploy rails application with nginx as frontend and what is performance of such solution .
Before blindly make any decisions about future platform I ’ve decided to make some performance tests of the some most popular rails web servers / frontends .
Results of these tests you can find here with configuration samples for all software that I have used .
First of all I will describe hardware / software plaftorm of our development server .
Our development server has following configuration :
CPU : 4 x XEON CPUs
Memory : 4 Gb of RAM
OS : Debian GNU / Linux Testing with recent 2.6 kernel
Later I will describe every used configuration and apache benchmarking tool results .
At the end of article you will be see aggregated results and performance comparison diagram for all solutions .
All tests was performed with following command :
$ ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://127.0.0.1:PORT/
where PORT is specific port number that has was chosen for every test .
So , first described solution will be simple WEBrick server ( web server written entirely on ruby and included in rails framework ) .
To start it I have used following command :
$ ./script/ server -- port 8080 -d
Results of this test was really impressive for me .
I thought , that Webrick should be really slow , but it shown non-zero results ;-) .
So , here are results :
Web Server : WEBrick /1.3.1
Time taken for tests : 51.490
Time per request ( mean ) : 514.896
Time per request ( mean , across all concurrent requests ) : 5.149
Requests per second ( mean ) : 194,21
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 1478,88
As you can see , this results may be acceptable for some small projects or for development , but for big frequently visited site we need something faster . 🙂
Second test was performed for Mongrel :
Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for hosting Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than FastCGI or SCGI .
It is framework agnostic and already supports Ruby On Rails , Og + Nitro , and Camping frameworks .
The easiest way to get started with Mongrel is to install it via RubyGems and then run a Ruby on Rails application .
You can do this easily :
$ sudo gem install mongrel $ cd your_rails_app $ mongrel_rails start -d
Which runs Mongrel in the background .
You can stop it with :
$ mongrel_rails stop
And you ’re all set .
There ’s quite a few options you can set for the start command .
Use the mongrel_rails start -h to see them all .
My Mongrel test was performed for single mongrel process started with simple :
$ mongrel_rails start -d -- port 8081
Results are following :
Web Server : Mongrel 0.3.13.3 ( single process )
Time taken for tests : 17.212
Time per request ( mean ) : 172.117
Time per request ( mean , across all concurrent requests ) : 1.721
Requests per second ( mean ) : 581,00
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 4398,28
As you can see here , Mongrel is really faster comparing to simple WEBrick server , but let ’s see what other servers can show .
Third test was done with simple tcp balancer ( pen ) and 5 processes of Mongrel .
Pen has been installed from debian testing repository , so installation was simple ( apt - get install pen ) .
Testing was performed on pen process started with following command line :
$ pen 8082 127.0.0.1:3000 \\ 127.0.0.1:3001 \\ 127.0.0.1:3002 \\ 127.0.0.1:3003 \\ 127.0.0.1:3004
In my test mongrel servers has been spawned by simple shell script written by me , but later I found mongrel - cluster – GemPlugin that wrappers the mongrel HTTP server and simplifies the deployment of webapps using a cluster of mongrel servers .
So you can simply use it to make your setup process easier .
Results of this tests are better then in first test , but not as good as with single process :
Web Server : Mongrel 0.3.13.3 ( 5 processes through Pen balancer )
Time taken for tests : 19.864
Time per request ( mean ) : 198.642
Time per request ( mean , across all concurrent requests ) : 1.986
Requests per second ( mean ) : 503,42
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 3810,98
Next two test was performed in with two popular reverse - proxy servers : Nginx and Lighttpd and the same 5 Mongrel processes .
First tested server was Lighttpd , built with following commands :
# ./configure -- prefix= / opt / lighttpd # make # make install
Folloiwing config file was used to start lighttpd :
server.modules = ( " mod_access " , " mod_proxy " , " mod_accesslog " ) server.document-root = " /opt/lighttpd/www / " server.errorlog = " /opt/lighttpd/logs/lighttpd.error.log " index-file.names = ( " index.htm " ) server.tag = " lighttpd " accesslog.filename = " /opt/lighttpd/logs/access.log " static- file.exclude-extensions = ( " .php " , " .pl " , " .fcgi " ) server.port = 8083 server.pid-file = " /var/run/lighttpd.pid " proxy .
balance = " fair " proxy. server = ( " / " => ( ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3000 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3001 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3002 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3003 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3004 ) ) )
Results was really better , than in previous tests :
Web Server : Lighttpd 1.4.11 ( proxy for 5 Mongrel processes )
Time taken for tests : 14.256
Time per request ( mean ) : 142.570
Time per request ( mean , across all concurrent requests ) : 1.426
Requests per second ( mean ) : 701,41
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 5321,53
Because of some strange problems authors of mongrel server do not suggest using lighttpd for proxying , but as for my it works well .
And last test was performed with nginx reverse - proxy and web server .
I decided to test it after all other solutions because there are no documents about its performance and I want to show , how to setup it and check its performance with Ruby on Rails when I know all other results …
So , I have built it with standard commands :
# ./configure -- prefix= / opt/nginx # make # make install
and tested with following config file :
worker_processes 2 ; error_log logs / error.log notice ; pid logs / nginx.pid ; events { worker_connections 16384 ; } http { include conf / mime.types ; default_type application / octet - stream ; sendfile on ; tcp_nopush on ; keepalive_timeout 65 ; tcp_nodelay on ; upstream mongrel { server 127.0.0.1:3000 ; server 127.0.0.1:3001 ; server 127.0.0.1:3002 ; server 127.0.0.1:3003 ; server 127.0.0.1:3004 ; } server { listen 8084 ; server_name localhost ; access_log off ; location / { proxy_pass http://mongrel ; } } }
Results of this test are really impressive , so I want to say “ Thanks ” to Igor Syosev for such great product !
Web Server : nginx / 0.3.60 ( proxy for 5 Mongrel processes )
Time taken for tests : 10.449
Time per request ( mean ) : 104.495
Time per request ( mean , across all concurrent requests ) : 1.045
Requests per second ( mean ) : 956.99
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 7267.27
Aggregated tests results you can see at following diagram :
So , I made my choice – I will use nginx to proxy requests to Mongrel cluster , because it is really flexible solution with great performance . 🙂
If you have some suggestions about additional tests or about results I described above , you can post your comments here and I will answer to all of you .
Thanks and see you next time !

Does the federal government need to know whether you aced Aristotelian ethics but had to repeat introductory biology ?
Does it need to know your family 's financial profile , how much aid you received and whether you took off a semester to help out at home ?
The Secretary of Education 's Commission on the Future of Higher Education thinks so .
In its first draft report , released in late June , the commission called for creation of a tracking system to collect sensitive information about our nation 's college students .
Its second draft , made public last week , softens the name of the plan , but the essence of the proposal remains unchanged .
Whether you call it a " national unit records database " ( the first name ) or a " consumer - friendly information database " ( the second ) , it is in fact a mandatory federal registry of all American students throughout their collegiate careers -- every course , every step , every misstep .
Once established , it could easily be linked to existing K - 12 and workforce databases to create unprecedented cradle - to - grave tracking of American citizens .
All under the watchful eye of the federal government .
The commission calls our nation 's colleges and universities unaccountable , inefficient and inaccessible .
In response it seeks to institute collection of personal information designed to quantify our students ' performance in college and in the workforce .
But many of us are concerned about invading our students ' privacy by feeding confidential educational and personal data , linked to Social Security numbers , into a mandatory national database .
Such a database would wrest control over educational records from students and hand it to the government .
I 'd like the commission to tell me how our students would benefit from our reporting confidential family financial information .
Those of us in higher education are n't the only ones with concerns about this .
Earlier this month the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities released results of a survey that showed the majority of Americans oppose creation of a national system to track students ' academic , enrollment and financial aid information .
More than 60 percent of those polled opposed the creation of such a system , and 45 percent of those surveyed were " strongly opposed " to the proposal .
Privacy groups from both ends of the political spectrum -- including the Eagle Forum and the American Civil Liberties Union -- criticized an early form of the proposal that Education Department officials were exploring in 2004 .
We already have efficient systems in place to collect educational statistics .
I question why the commission , which shares our concerns about the increased cost of education , would want to create a database that not only violates privacy but also would be very expensive .
Our existing systems meet the government 's need to inform public policy without intruding on student privacy because they report the data in aggregate form .
Colleges and universities report on virtually every aspect of our students ' experience -- retention and graduation rates , financial aid rates and degrees conferred by major institutions -- to the federal and state governments as well as to organizations such as the NCAA and to many publications , including U.S. News & World Report and the Princeton Review .
The commission seems bent on its Orwellian scheme of collecting extensively detailed , very personal student data .
Supporters say it would make higher education more accountable and more affordable for students .
Admirable goals , but a strange and forbidding solution .
This proposal is a violation of the right to privacy that Americans hold dear .
It is against the law .
Moreover , there is a mountain of data already out there that can help us understand higher education and its efficacy .
And , finally , implementation of such a database , which at its inception would hold " unit " record data on 17 million students , would be an unfunded mandate on institutions and add greatly to the expense of education .
At a time when the world acknowledges the strength of the American system of higher education -- that it is decentralized , diverse , competitive and independent -- why would a commission on the future of higher education want to impose federal regulations and federal bureaucratic monitoring of individual students in the name of " improving " higher education ?

Update 2007 - 11 - 06 : see also my more recent post on this topic , Firefox memory usage and memory leak news , from September 2007 .
One of the more common complaints about Firefox 1.5 was that it leaked a lot of memory .
I do n't know how often these leaks were severe enough to cause noticeable slowdowns or thrashing , but enough Firefox users seem to care about memory leaks that I thought I 'd post something about what we 've done and what we 're doing .
Two memory leak bugs were fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.1 , released earlier this week :
316775 - Leak when selecting .
317478 - Leaks due to global scope polluter being removed from not enough ( ? ) prototype chains .
In addition , the following memory leaks have been fixed on the trunk since the branch point for Firefox 1.5 :
241518 - Calling addEventListener with a closure holding a content node leaks the document .
( Many Greasemonkey scripts use addEventListener , and they each live within implied closures .
Otherwise , this leak pattern is n't too common , mostly because Internet Explorer 6 leaks under the same circumstances . )
321283 - Using Find causes documents to leak .
315708 - Should release found link and current window object from nsTypeAheadFind.cpp .
315951 - Unknown content type dialog leaks domwindow .
319123 - Leak with contentsink - parser - dtd cycle involving document . write ( ) .
323441 - Memory leak if a site sets location and then document .
writes ( e.g. when visiting www.economist.com).
323377 - Lots of leaks in nsInternetSearchService .
323532 - Leak when using history autocomplete .
315427 - Bad nullcheck in nsXULPrototypeElement :: ReleaseSubtree , causing the Options window to leak if the remembered panel is the cache panel .
323534 - CreateTreeWalker can cause leaks due to cycles created by closures .
The trunk seems close to not leaking huge object graphs during my typical browsing sessions ( YMMV ) .
The only big leak I still see all the time is a leak at Gmail .
The leak might be related to the " unused XMLHttpRequest " leak that David Baron is working on , or it might not -- when I asked whether Gmail is considering working around the " unused XMLHttpRequest " leak bug , a Gmail coder said he did n't think Gmail created any XMLHttpRequest objects it did n't use .
David Baron 's leak - gauge has been allowing more people to test for large memory leaks with their own browsing habits , extensions , and favorite sites .
At least 19 people filed 30 memory leak bug reports found using leak - gauge , accounting for more than half of the memory leak bug reports ( and most of the memory leak bug reporters ) since its introduction .
The bug reports look pretty useful , and are definitely more useful than general complaints about high memory usage after using Firefox for a few hours .
If you 're still suffering a lot from memory leaks in Firefox 1.5.0.1 and / or want to help find memory leak bugs , head over to The Burning Edge and try out a trunk build .
If you prefer to stick with stable versions of Firefox , do n't worry -- many of the fixes that are currently only on the trunk will be included in the next scheduled update ( currently planned to be called Firefox 1.5.0.2 and released in March ) , most of them will be included in Firefox 2 , and all of them will be included in Firefox 3 .
Leaks in extensions
Recognizing that memory leaks are n't always due to bugs in Firefox itself , Steve England and others have tested popular Firefox extensions for memory leaks .
They found that Session saver , NoScript , IE Tab , and the combination of FlashGot and Filterset .
G
Updater cause leaks .
Giorgio Maone , the author of NoScript and FlashGot , has already fixed the biggest leak in NoScript thanks to Steve 's bug report .
He is now working on threading issues in FlashGot that prevent debugging and might be responsible for the leaks .
Authors of the other extensions have n't been as fast to fix their leaks .
I also fixed several minor memory leaks in my own extensions recently , some found through code inspection and some found using leak - gauge .
Search Keys 0.7.2 and below kept parts of search result pages alive for the lifetime of the window due to an unintentionally global variable ( a missing " var " ) .
Thumbs 0.6.1 and below kept the DOMWindow for the page Thumbs was last used on alive until shutdown .
Other causes of high memory usage
Memory leaks are n't the only thing that can cause Firefox to ( appear to ) use a lot of memory .
See MozillaZine Fourms : Memory usage FQA and MozillaZine KB : Reducing memory usage .
The CIA says the review of complex books take more time
In a federal lawsuit , TJ Waters said the CIA ordered dozens of deletions in his book on spy training after initially approving the text .
Current and former agents are allowed to publish books .
But texts should first be cleared by a special review board to ensure they do not contain classified information .
Mr Waters , 40 , belonged to the CIA 's first post - 9/11 class , and worked for the agency between 2002 and 2004 .
His 300 - page book chronicles his year at a training centre where recruits learn how to use disguises and survive interrogation .
' Classified details '
Mr Waters said he submitted his book " Class 11 : Inside the CIA 's First Post - 9/11 Spy Class " to the agency in May 2004 , and that four months later only a few words were blocked from publication .
But he alleged that , last month , the CIA informed him that further deletions would be needed , many of them involving previously cleared material .
Mr Waters believes the CIA director , Porter Goss , opposes agents writing books , and has put the publications review staff under pressure to slow the process .
But the CIA spokeswoman , Jennifer Dyck , denied Mr Goss was seeking delays in the reviews .
" The goal is to clear manuscripts as quickly as possible , but more complex books that get into classified details do take longer , " she said .
Correspondents say Mr Goss has recently been highly critical of the damage done by leaks of classified information .
Last month , US media reported that US intelligence agencies have been removing from public access thousands of historical documents they saw as a " hasty release " of sensitive information .
Five Things Every Micro-ISV
Should Know About Intellectual Property
Running a Micro-ISV is different from running a more traditional small business .
We do n't sell tangible property like hammers or cheeseburgers .
Our products are intangible .
Our business model exists only because governments have intellectual property laws which allow us to exclusively own certain rights and to control the terms under which we trade some of those rights for money .
It seems rather important that we have a basic understanding of these laws .
I am not a lawyer .
Nothing I say in this article should be construed as providing legal advice .
I 'm just providing some very basic information .
1. Copyrights , trademarks , and patents are all different .
In the United States , the law defines three main forms of intellectual property :
Copyrights are used to protect a specific expression of something .
Trademarks are used to protect a distinctive symbol or name which is used to identify a business or product .
Patents are used to trademark an invention such as a method or process .
Unfortunately , many people tend to confuse these terms .
For example :
It makes no sense to ask if the word " podcast " is copyrighted .
You can't copyright a word .
That 's what trademarks are for . .
If I develop a new database and call it Oracle , I am violating a trademark , not a copyright .
Similarly , do n't ask if HTML is patented .
You can't patent a markup language .
Rather , ask if there are any patented methods which are related to HTML .
These three concepts are distinct .
Every Micro-ISV will use copyrights .
Many will use trademarks .
A few will use patents .
2. Copyrights are simple .
The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to control the reproduction of something .
Copyrights protect a specific expression of something .
A song can be copyrighted , thus making it illegal to make copies of that song without permission .
A piece of software can be copyrighted , thus making it illegal to make copies of that software without permission .
Copyrights are the most important form of intellectual property protection for a Micro - ISV .
When I create a piece of software and start selling other people the right to use a copy of it , it is important to me that anyone who makes illegal copies of my software is violating the law .
Luckily , copyrights are also the most simple form of intellectual property protection .
There are no special steps to become the owner of a copyright .
When I create a piece of software , I implicitly and automatically own a copyright on my work .
The government allows me to register that copyright if I want , and doing so may strengthen my position in a court battle , but registration is not essential .
I simply label my work " Copyright 2006 Eric Sink " , and that 's enough .
3. Trademarks are freaky .
A trademark protects the logo or name that you use to identify your business or product .
It would unfair for me to start selling a database product called Oracle .
Customers would get confused .
The law protects Oracle Corporation by granting them the exclusive right to use that word in the sale of database products .
However , trademarks are kind of freaky , for three reasons :
A registered trademark is very different from an unregistered trademark .
Just as with copyrights , you do n't have to register anything with the government to get trademark protection .
However , unlike the situation with copyrights , a registered trademark is very different from an unregistered one .
Registering a trademark is expensive and very time - consuming .
You should get a lawyer to help you .
Plan to spend $ 1,000 or more .
It will probably take more than a year to complete the process .
Your application might get denied .
However , if you successfully get your trademark registered , you end up with very strong protection .
With a registered trademark , you can put the circle - R symbol next to your mark whenever you use it .
If someone violates your mark , you are very likely to win a resulting lawsuit .
Proceeding with an unregistered trademark is simpler .
Just put ( tm ) next to your logo or name .
That 's it .
By doing so , you are simply informing the world of your claim to the exclusive use of the mark .
If you find yourself in conflict with some other party , you might win , or you might not .
A trademark is limited in scope .
You can't globally trademark something for all kinds of situations .
Your trademark protection is valid only for the industry or market segment in which you are doing business .
I can't start selling a database product called Oracle , but I am perfectly free to start selling a toothpaste called Oracle .
If you do n't defend your trademark , you lose it .
Trademark law says that your mark is protected by law only if you are actively protecting it .
If someone violates your mark , you must object .
If you do n't , you have weakened your position for any situation that comes up later .
4. Patents are absurd .
A patent is the strongest form of intellectual property protection .
Patents are used to protect a method or technique , regardless of its expression .
With copyrights , accidental infringement is more or less impossible .
If I start selling a spreadsheet product which is byte - for - byte identical to Microsoft Excel , nobody is going to believe me when I claim that I just happened to come up with the same string of bits that Microsoft did .
In contrast , accidental infringement of a patent is quite possible .
Microsoft Excel is probably covered by a whole bunch of patents .
If I create a spreadsheet product , the likelihood that I may use a patented technique is rather high .
Software patents today are primarily used in one of two ways :
Companies like Microsoft are building up large collections of patents .
In general , their patent arsenal is a defensive weapon .
They have patents so that they can counter - sue whenever somebody sues them for patent infringement .
Microsoft gets sued regularly over patent issues .
I cannot think of a single case where Microsoft sued a small company over a patent issue .
Patent Trolls are companies which do nothing but purchase patents and use them to threaten and sue other companies .
I am not opposed to software patents in principle , but I do believe patent law needs to be reformed .
Patents carry a 17 year term , which is far too long for software .
Patents are being granted for " inventions " which are obvious .
Patent trolls should be banned and violators should be sentenced to a lifetime of driving around Boston .
The current situation is absurd .
Obtaining a patent is even more costly and time - consuming than a registered trademark .
Plan to spend $ 25,000 or more .
Patents can be valuable , but a Micro - ISV can have a long and healthy life without ever obtaining one .
5. Licenses are virtual .
From a practical standpoint , buying software is often very simple .
I run to Best Buy and grab a copy of Doom 3 .
I give the cashier 50 bucks .
Simple .
From a legal perspective , the transaction was a lot more complicated .
First of all , it is important to note that I have not purchased any copyrights , trademarks or patents .
All that stuff is still owned by the publisher and developer of the game .
Because they own the intellectual property , the law gives them certain exclusive rights .
Rather , I have purchased a box , a CD - ROM , and a license .
This license is not a physical thing , but a legal concept .
The license grants me certain rights , subject to certain restrictions .
Do n't confuse the notion of a license with any of the things that are often associated with it :
When I buy software , I may get something called a serial number , CD key , activation code , or license key .
This is not a license .
It is merely something which is designed to encourage or require me to comply with the restrictions of the license .
When I buy software , I may get a printed license agreement booklet .
This is not a license .
It is a document which describes the license .
Photocopying that document does not increase the number of licenses I have .
When I buy a computer with Windows XP , I may find a holographic sticker on the back .
This sticker is not a license .
It is a physical item which represents the license and which may be used to prove that I have a license .
Think of as two things : Rights and restrictions .
The recipient of the license gets certain rights , subject to certain restrictions .
Further Information
Remember , I am not a lawyer .
Furthermore , this little article merely scratches the surface of a rather large subject .
So , you have just read an article which is terribly incomplete and which was written by someone with no credibility at all .
You are worse off than you were when you started .
To fix this problem , you should probably do two things :
Final Thoughts
Yes , I know , there are actually four main areas of intellectual property law , not three .
I omitted trade secret law here for simplicity .
The comments on this post would be an excellent place to post your favorite lawyer jokes .
I 'll start :
Q : Why do n't sharks attack lawyers ?
A : Professional courtesy .

Emotions are running high over the post - Katrina clean - up
The claim has been made by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood who has launched legal proceedings .
He said representatives for the firms had been asking people to sign forms saying they sustained flood damage , which is not covered by their policies .
All five companies have strongly denied the accusations .
" I want the insurance companies to pay what they actually owe the people of Mississippi , " he said , adding that he thought their representatives were " unconscionable " .
Strong denials
The five companies being sued by Mr Hood are Nationwide Mutual Insurance , Mississippi Farm Bureau Insurance , State Farm Fire and Casualty , Allstate Property and Casualty , and United Services Automobile Association .
Jim Hood has called the insurance firms ' unconscionable '
Mr Hood said that the firms are demanding policyholders sign the forms in order to gain an immediate cheque to cover living expenses .
" The allegations made by the Mississippi Attorney General are unfounded , " said Nationwide Mutual Insurance .
" Our company is absolutely not asking policyholders to acknowledge damage is flood related in order to receive a cheque for living expenses . "
A ball - lightning - like plasma cloud is produced in an underwater discharge .
( Photo : D. Lange , IPP )
Scientists in the joint study group of Max - Planck - Institut für Plasmaphysik and Berlin ’s Humboldt University have generated ball - lightning in the laboratory - or , to be more precise , ball - lightning - like plasma clouds .
The physicists produce luminous plasma balls above a water surface which have lifetimes of almost half a second and diameters of 10 to 20 centimetres .
Ball - lightning is described as a luminous phenomenon occurring during thunderstorms .
It is a mystery , however , that they should be visible not as a brief flash , i.e. just for microseconds , but exist for several seconds , i.e. a hundred thousand times as long as a flash of lightning .
Besides such famous figures as the Roman philosopher Seneca , Pliny the Elder , Charlemagne and Henry II of England , in modern times the Nobel Prize winners in physics , Niels Bohr and Pjotr Kapitza , claim to have observed this phenomenon .
Less renowned observers also report unexpected encounters with ball - lightning ; the internet features more than a million entries on the subject .
On the other hand , the phenomenon is so rare that there are still no reliable data available .
Accordingly , doubtful attempts at interpretation are rampant , ranging from black holes to mini nuclear explosions and esoteric explanations .
" In view of this incertitude it has been variously attempted to induce the phenomenon under controlled conditions in the laboratory " , states Prof.
Gerd Fussmann , head of the plasma physics study group of IPP and HUB in Berlin .
One research group already succeeded in producing plasmoids fed with microwaves - luminous plasma balls consisting of an ionised gas - which it would be fair to class as ball - lightning .
A similar effect is caused by electric sparks conducted over organic materials .
About four years ago a study group in St. Petersburg successfully used electric discharges above water surfaces to produce spherical luminous formations that come appreciably closer to the natural phenomenon .
For it is probable that flashes of lightning and water must be interacting when ball - lightning occurs .
Stimulated by the Russian experiments , the plasma physics study group in Berlin is conducting investigations in which plasmoids are produced above a water surface that have lifetimes of about 0.3 second and diameters of 10 to 20 centimetres .
This involves igniting a short high - voltage discharge in a water tank ; when it decays a plasma ball then emerges from the surface .
Apart from the powerful capacitor bank needed to supply energy , the experimental setup is rather simple : A glass beaker filled with salt water contains two protruding electrodes , one of which being insulated from the surrounding water by a clay tube .
When a high voltage is applied , a current of up to 60 amperes flows through the water for 0.15 second .
Flashover from the water enables the current to enter the clay tube , where it causes the water contained there to evaporate .
After the current pulse a luminous plasmoid consisting of ionised water molecules appears .
The facility can generate impressive " ball - lightning " in every possible manifestation and colour about every five minutes .
Professor Fussmann : " Why luminous phenomena occur at all is anything but clear :
They continue to be visible about 300 milliseconds after the current has decayed and the energy input is thus cut off ; however , they should really be quenched after a few milliseconds at most .
Furthermore , the plasma glows very brightly , although the plasmoids appear to be rather cold .
A sheet of paper placed above them does get lifted , but it does not catch fire . "
These puzzling physical phenomena are now to be clarified in several diploma theses .
This calls for systematic analysis of the processes involved - for example , by spectroscopic methods - and comparison with the existing theoretical formulations .
" Although " ball - lightning " does not directly fit into the research field of IPP , viz .
investigation of extremely hot plasmas such as are needed for a fusion power plant " , states Prof .
Fussmann , " it is also an attractive plasma physics topic with which students can acquire knowledge of sophisticated measuring technique and theory from an interesting natural phenomenon . "

The Iraqi Special Tribunal set up to try Saddam Hussein said in a statement today that Mr. Hussein and three others will be referred to criminal court on charges related to the killings of about 150 Shiites in the Iraqi town of Dujail in 1982 .
The tribunal said that investigations into millions of documents and the questioning of thousands of witnesses have been completed , and that the trial related to the Dujail killings was one of several Mr. Hussein and his top aides are expected to face .
Officials at the tribunal have said that they expect to put Mr. Hussein on trial by the end of the year .
The tribunal 's chief investigating judge , Raed Jouhi , said at a news conference in Baghdad that a date for the trial would be set " within days , " the Reuters news agency reported .
Today 's statement represents the announcement of the first formal charges against Mr. Hussein .
Other crimes for which Mr. Hussein is likely to face eventual prosecution in separate trials include the Anfal campaign of the late 1980's , in which as many as 150,000 Kurds were killed ; the chemical weapons attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in March 1988 that killed about 5,000 ; and the repression of a Shiite rebellion in southern Iraq in 1991 , in which 150,000 people are believed to have been killed .
Also under investigation by the tribunal are the executions of more than 200 Baath Party leaders after Mr. Hussein seized power in 1979 .
Mr. Hussein 's lawyers claim among other things that it is illegal to try Mr. Hussein in his own country because he is immune from prosecution as a head of state .
7.1 . Making a high quality MPEG - 4 ( " DivX " ) rip of a DVD movie
One frequently asked question is " How do I make the highest quality rip for a given size ? " .
Another question is " How do I make the highest quality DVD rip possible ?
I do not care about file size , I just want the best quality . "
The latter question is perhaps at least somewhat wrongly posed .
After all , if you do not care about file size , why not simply copy the entire MPEG - 2 video stream from the the DVD ?
Sure , your AVI will end up being 5GB , give or take , but if you want the best quality and do not care about size , this is certainly your best option .
In fact , the reason you want to transcode a DVD into MPEG - 4 is specifically because you do care about file size .
It is difficult to offer a cookbook recipe on how to create a very high quality DVD rip .
There are several factors to consider , and you should understand these details or else you are likely to end up disappointed with your results .
Below we will investigate some of these issues , and then have a look at an example .
We assume you are using libavcodec to encode the video , although the theory applies to other codecs as well .
If this seems to be too much for you , you should probably use one of the many fine frontends that are listed in the MEncoder section of our related projects page .
That way , you should be able to achieve high quality rips without too much thinking , because most of those tools are designed to take clever decisions for you .
7.1.1 . Preparing to encode : Identifying source material and framerate Before you even think about encoding a movie , you need to take several preliminary steps .
The first and most important step before you encode should be determining what type of content you are dealing with .
If your source material comes from DVD or broadcast / cable / satellite TV , it will be stored in one of two formats : NTSC for North America and Japan , PAL for Europe , etc .
It is important to realize , however , that this is just the formatting for presentation on a television , and often does not correspond to the original format of the movie .
Experience shows that NTSC material is a lot more difficult to encode , because there more elements to identify in the source .
In order to produce a suitable encode , you need to know the original format .
Failure to take this into account will result in various flaws in your encode , including ugly combing ( interlacing ) artifacts and duplicated or even lost frames .
Besides being ugly , the artifacts also harm coding efficiency :
You will get worse quality per unit bitrate .
7.1.1.1 . Identifying source framerate
Here is a list of common types of source material , where you are likely to find them , and their properties : Standard Film : Produced for theatrical display at 24 fps .
PAL video : Recorded with a PAL video camera at 50 fields per second .
A field consists of just the odd - or even - numbered lines of a frame .
Television was designed to refresh these in alternation as a cheap form of analog compression .
The human eye supposedly compensates for this , but once you understand interlacing you will learn to see it on TV too and never enjoy TV again .
Two fields do not make a complete frame , because they are captured 1/50 of a second apart in time , and thus they do not line up unless there is no motion .
NTSC Video : Recorded with an NTSC video camera at 60000/1001 fields per second , or 60 fields per second in the pre-color era .
Otherwise similar to PAL .
Animation : Usually drawn at 24 fps , but also comes in mixed - framerate varieties .
Computer Graphics ( CG ) :
Can be any framerate , but some are more common than others ; 24 and 30 frames per second are typical for NTSC , and 25 fps is typical for PAL .
Old Film : Various lower framerates .
7.1.1.2 . Identifying source material Movies consisting of frames are referred to as progressive , while those consisting of independent fields are called either interlaced or video - though this latter term is ambiguous .
To further complicate matters , some movies will be a mix of several of the above .
The most important distinction to make between all of these formats is that some are frame - based , while others are field - based .
Whenever a movie is prepared for display on television ( including DVD ) , it is converted to a field - based format .
The various methods by which this can be done are collectively referred to as " telecine " , of which the infamous NTSC " 3:2 pulldown " is one variety .
Unless the original material was also field - based ( and the same fieldrate ) , you are getting the movie in a format other than the original .
There are several common types of pulldown : PAL 2:2 pulldown :
The nicest of them all .
Each frame is shown for the duration of two fields , by extracting the even and odd lines and showing them in alternation .
If the original material is 24 fps , this process speeds up the movie by 4 % .
PAL 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown : Every 12th frame is shown for the duration of three fields , instead of just two .
This avoids the 4 % speedup issue , but makes the process much more difficult to reverse .
It is usually seen in musical productions where adjusting the speed by 4 % would seriously damage the musical score .
NTSC 3:2 telecine : Frames are shown alternately for the duration of 3 fields or 2 fields .
This gives a fieldrate 2.5 times the original framerate .
The result is also slowed down very slightly from 60 fields per second to 60000/ 1001 fields per second to maintain NTSC fieldrate .
NTSC 2:2 pulldown : Used for showing 30 fps material on NTSC .
Nice , just like 2:2 PAL pulldown .
There are also methods for converting between NTSC and PAL video , but such topics are beyond the scope of this guide .
If you encounter such a movie and want to encode it , your best bet is to find a copy in the original format .
Conversion between these two formats is highly destructive and cannot be reversed cleanly , so your encode will greatly suffer if it is made from a converted source .
When video is stored on DVD , consecutive pairs of fields are grouped as a frame , even though they are not intended to be shown at the same moment in time .
The MPEG - 2 standard used on DVD and digital TV provides a way both to encode the original progressive frames and to store the number of fields for which a frame should be shown in the header of that frame .
If this method has been used , the movie will often be described as " soft - telecined " , since the process only directs the DVD player to apply pulldown to the movie rather than altering the movie itself .
This case is highly preferable since it can easily be reversed ( actually ignored ) by the encoder , and since it preserves maximal quality .
However , many DVD and broadcast production studios do not use proper encoding techniques but instead produce movies with " hard telecine " , where fields are actually duplicated in the encoded MPEG - 2 .
The procedures for dealing with these cases will be covered later in this guide .
For now , we leave you with some guides to identifying which type of material you are dealing with : NTSC regions :
If MPlayer prints that the framerate has changed to 24000/1001 when watching your movie , and never changes back , it is almost certainly progressive content that has been " soft telecined " .
If MPlayer shows the framerate switching back and forth between 24000/1001 and 30000/1001 , and you see " combing " at times , then there are several possibilities .
The 24000/1001 fps segments are almost certainly progressive content , " soft telecined " , but the 30000/1001 fps parts could be either hard - telecined 24000/ 1001 fps content or 60000/1001 fields per second NTSC video .
Use the same guidelines as the following two cases to determine which .
If MPlayer never shows the framerate changing , and every single frame with motion appears combed , your movie is NTSC video at 60000/1001 fields per second .
If MPlayer never shows the framerate changing , and two frames out of every five appear combed , your movie is " hard telecined " 24000/1001 fps content .
PAL regions :
If you never see any combing , your movie is 2:2 pulldown .
If you see combing alternating in and out every half second , then your movie is 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown .
If you always see combing during motion , then your movie is PAL video at 50 fields per second .
Hint : MPlayer can slow down movie playback with the - speed option or play it frame - by - frame .
Try using - speed 0.2 to watch the movie very slowly or press the " . " key repeatedly to play one frame at a time and identify the pattern , if you can not see it at full speed .
7.1.2 . Constant quantizer vs. multipass
It is possible to encode your movie at a wide range of qualities .
With modern video encoders and a bit of pre-codec compression ( downscaling and denoising ) , it is possible to achieve very good quality at 700 MB , for a 90 - 110 minute widescreen movie .
Furthermore , all but the longest movies can be encoded with near - perfect quality at 1400 MB .
There are three approaches to encoding the video : constant bitrate ( CBR ) , constant quantizer , and multipass ( ABR , or average bitrate ) .
The complexity of the frames of a movie , and thus the number of bits required to compress them , can vary greatly from one scene to another .
Modern video encoders can adjust to these needs as they go and vary the bitrate .
In simple modes such as CBR , however , the encoders do not know the bitrate needs of future scenes and so cannot exceed the requested average bitrate for long stretches of time .
More advanced modes , such as multipass encode , can take into account the statistics from previous passes ; this fixes the problem mentioned above .
Note :
Most codecs which support ABR encode only support two pass encode while some others such as x264 , Xvid and libavcodec support multipass , which slightly improves quality at each pass , yet this improvement is no longer measurable nor noticeable after the 4th or so pass .
Therefore , in this section , two pass and multipass will be used interchangeably .
In each of these modes , the video codec ( such as libavcodec ) breaks the video frame into 16x16 pixel macroblocks and then applies a quantizer to each macroblock .
The lower the quantizer , the better the quality and higher the bitrate .
The method the movie encoder uses to determine which quantizer to use for a given macroblock varies and is highly tunable .
( This is an extreme over - simplification of the actual process , but the basic concept is useful to understand . )
When you specify a constant bitrate , the video codec will encode the video , discarding detail as much as necessary and as little as possible in order to remain lower than the given bitrate .
If you truly do not care about file size , you could as well use CBR and specify a bitrate of infinity .
( In practice , this means a value high enough so that it poses no limit , like 10000 Kbit . )
With no real restriction on bitrate , the result is that the codec will use the lowest possible quantizer for each macroblock ( as specified by vqmin for libavcodec , which is 2 by default ) .
As soon as you specify a low enough bitrate that the codec is forced to use a higher quantizer , then you are almost certainly ruining the quality of your video .
In order to avoid that , you should probably downscale your video , according to the method described later on in this guide .
In general , you should avoid CBR altogether if you care about quality .
With constant quantizer , the codec uses the same quantizer , as specified by the vqscale option ( for libavcodec ) , on every macroblock .
If you want the highest quality rip possible , again ignoring bitrate , you can use vqscale =2 .
This will yield the same bitrate and PSNR ( peak signal - to - noise ratio ) as CBR with vbitrate =infinity and the default vqmin of 2 .
The problem with constant quantizing is that it uses the given quantizer whether the macroblock needs it or not .
That is , it might be possible to use a higher quantizer on a macroblock without sacrificing visual quality .
Why waste the bits on an unnecessarily low quantizer ?
Your CPU has as many cycles as there is time , but there is only so many bits on your hard disk .
With a two pass encode , the first pass will rip the movie as though it were CBR , but it will keep a log of properties for each frame .
This data is then used during the second pass in order to make intelligent decisions about which quantizers to use .
During fast action or high detail scenes , higher quantizers will likely be used , and during slow moving or low detail scenes , lower quantizers will be used .
Normally , the amount of motion is much more important than the amount of detail .
If you use vqscale =2 , then you are wasting bits .
If you use vqscale=3 , then you are not getting the highest quality rip .
Suppose you rip a DVD at vqscale=3 , and the result is 1800 Kbit .
If you do a two pass encode with vbitrate=1800 , the resulting video will have higher quality for the same bitrate .
Since you are now convinced that two pass is the way to go , the real question now is what bitrate to use ?
The answer is that there is no single answer .
Ideally you want to choose a bitrate that yields the best balance between quality and file size .
This is going to vary depending on the source video .
If size does not matter , a good starting point for a very high quality rip is about 2000 Kbit plus or minus 200 K bit .
For fast action or high detail source video , or if you just have a very critical eye , you might decide on 2400 or 2600 .
For some DVDs , you might not notice a difference at 1400 Kbit .
It is a good idea to experiment with scenes at different bitrates to get a feel .
If you aim at a certain size , you will have to somehow calculate the bitrate .
But before that , you need to know how much space you should reserve for the audio track (s ) , so you should rip those first .
You can compute the bitrate with the following equation : bitrate = ( target_size_in_Mbytes - sound_size_in_Mbytes ) * 1024 * 1024 / length_in_secs * 8 / 1000 For instance , to squeeze a two - hour movie onto a 702MB CD , with 60 MB of audio track , the video bitrate will have to be : ( 702 - 60 ) * 1024 * 1024 / ( 120*60 ) * 8 / 1000 = 740 kbps
7.1.3 . Constraints for efficient encoding
Due to the nature of MPEG - type compression , there are various constraints you should follow for maximal quality .
MPEG splits the video up into 16x16 squares called macroblocks , each composed of 4 8x8 blocks of luma ( intensity ) information and two half - resolution 8x8 chroma ( color ) blocks ( one for red - cyan axis and the other for the blue - yellow axis ) .
Even if your movie width and height are not multiples of 16 , the encoder will use enough 16x16 macroblocks to cover the whole picture area , and the extra space will go to waste .
So in the interests of maximizing quality at a fixed file size , it is a bad idea to use dimensions that are not multiples of 16 .
Most DVDs also have some degree of black borders at the edges .
Leaving these in place will hurt quality a lot in several ways .
MPEG - type compression is highly dependent on frequency domain transformations , in particular the Discrete Cosine Transform ( DCT ) , which is similar to the Fourier transform .
This sort of encoding is efficient for representing patterns and smooth transitions , but it has a hard time with sharp edges .
In order to encode them it must use many more bits , or else an artifact known as ringing will appear .
The frequency transform ( DCT ) takes place separately on each macroblock ( actually each block ) , so this problem only applies when the sharp edge is inside a block .
If your black borders begin exactly at multiple - of - 16 pixel boundaries , this is not a problem .
However , the black borders on DVDs rarely come nicely aligned , so in practice you will always need to crop to avoid this penalty .
In addition to frequency domain transforms , MPEG - type compression uses motion vectors to represent the change from one frame to the next .
Motion vectors naturally work much less efficiently for new content coming in from the edges of the picture , because it is not present in the previous frame .
As long as the picture extends all the way to the edge of the encoded region , motion vectors have no problem with content moving out the edges of the picture .
However , in the presence of black borders , there can be trouble :
For each macroblock , MPEG - type compression stores a vector identifying which part of the previous frame should be copied into this macroblock as a base for predicting the next frame .
Only the remaining differences need to be encoded .
If a macroblock spans the edge of the picture and contains part of the black border , then motion vectors from other parts of the picture will overwrite the black border .
This means that lots of bits must be spent either re-blackening the border that was overwritten , or ( more likely ) a motion vector will not be used at all and all the changes in this macroblock will have to be coded explicitly .
Either way , encoding efficiency is greatly reduced .
Again , this problem only applies if black borders do not line up on multiple - of - 16 boundaries .
Finally , suppose we have a macroblock in the interior of the picture , and an object is moving into this block from near the edge of the image .
MPEG - type coding cannot say " copy the part that is inside the picture but not the black border . "
So the black border will get copied inside too , and lots of bits will have to be spent encoding the part of the picture that is supposed to be there .
If the picture runs all the way to the edge of the encoded area , MPEG has special optimizations to repeatedly copy the pixels at the edge of the picture when a motion vector comes from outside the encoded area .
This feature becomes useless when the movie has black borders .
Unlike problems 1 and 2 , aligning the borders at multiples of 16 does not help here .
Despite the borders being entirely black and never changing , there is at least a minimal amount of overhead involved in having more macroblocks .
For all of these reasons , it is recommended to fully crop black borders .
Further , if there is an area of noise / distortion at the edge of the picture , cropping this will improve encoding efficiency as well .
Videophile purists who want to preserve the original as close as possible may object to this cropping , but unless you plan to encode at constant quantizer , the quality you gain from cropping will considerably exceed the amount of information lost at the edges .
7.1.4 . Cropping and Scaling Recall from the previous section that the final picture size you encode should be a multiple of 16 ( in both width and height ) .
This can be achieved by cropping , scaling , or a combination of both .
When cropping , there are a few guidelines that must be followed to avoid damaging your movie .
The normal YUV format , 4:2:0 , stores chroma ( color ) information subsampled , i.e. chroma is only sampled half as often in each direction as luma ( intensity ) information .
Observe this diagram , where L indicates luma sampling points and C chroma .
L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L As you can see , rows and columns of the image naturally come in pairs .
Thus your crop offsets and dimensions must be even numbers .
If they are not , the chroma will no longer line up correctly with the luma .
In theory , it is possible to crop with odd offsets , but it requires resampling the chroma which is potentially a lossy operation and not supported by the crop filter .
Further , interlaced video is sampled as follows : Top field Bottom field L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L C C C C L L L L L L L L As you can see , the pattern does not repeat until after 4 lines .
So for interlaced video , your y- offset and height for cropping must be multiples of 4 .
Native DVD resolution is 720x480 for NTSC , and 720x576 for PAL , but there is an aspect flag that specifies whether it is full - screen ( 4:3 ) or wide - screen ( 16:9 ) .
Many ( if not most ) widescreen DVDs are not strictly 16:9 , and will be either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 ( cinescope ) .
This means that there will be black bands in the video that will need to be cropped out .
MPlayer provides a crop detection filter that will determine the crop rectangle ( - vf cropdetect ) .
Run MPlayer with - vf cropdetect and it will print out the crop settings to remove the borders .
You should let the movie run long enough that the whole picture area is used , in order to get accurate crop values .
Then , test the values you get with MPlayer , using the command line which was printed by cropdetect , and adjust the rectangle as needed .
The rectangle filter can help by allowing you to interactively position the crop rectangle over your movie .
Remember to follow the above divisibility guidelines so that you do not misalign the chroma planes .
In certain cases , scaling may be undesirable .
Scaling in the vertical direction is difficult with interlaced video , and if you wish to preserve the interlacing , you should usually refrain from scaling .
If you will not be scaling but you still want to use multiple - of - 16 dimensions , you will have to overcrop .
Do not undercrop , since black borders are very bad for encoding !
Because MPEG - 4 uses 16x16 macroblocks , you will want to make sure that each dimension of the video you are encoding is a multiple of 16 or else you will be degrading quality , especially at lower bitrates .
You can do this by rounding the width and height of the crop rectangle down to the nearest multiple of 16 .
As stated earlier , when cropping , you will want to increase the Y offset by half the difference of the old and the new height so that the resulting video is taken from the center of the frame .
And because of the way DVD video is sampled , make sure the offset is an even number .
( In fact , as a rule , never use odd values for any parameter when you are cropping and scaling video . )
If you are not comfortable throwing a few extra pixels away , you might prefer to scale the video instead .
We will look at this in our example below .
You can actually let the cropdetect filter do all of the above for you , as it has an optional round parameter that is equal to 16 by default .
Also , be careful about " half black " pixels at the edges .
Make sure you crop these out too , or else you will be wasting bits there that are better spent elsewhere .
After all is said and done , you will probably end up with video whose pixels are not quite 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 , but rather something close to that .
You could calculate the new aspect ratio manually , but MEncoder offers an option for libavcodec called autoaspect that will do this for you .
Absolutely do not scale this video up in order to square the pixels unless you like to waste your hard disk space .
Scaling should be done on playback , and the player will use the aspect stored in the AVI to determine the correct resolution .
Unfortunately , not all players enforce this auto - scaling information , therefore you may still want to rescale .
7.1.5 . Choosing resolution and bitrate
If you will not be encoding in constant quantizer mode , you need to select a bitrate .
The concept of bitrate is quite simple .
It is the ( average ) number of bits that will be consumed to store your movie , per second .
Normally bitrate is measured in kilobits ( 1000 bits ) per second .
The size of your movie on disk is the bitrate times the length of the movie in time , plus a small amount of " overhead " ( see the section on the AVI container for instance ) .
Other parameters such as scaling , cropping , etc. will not alter the file size unless you change the bitrate as well !
Bitrate does not scale proportionally to resolution .
That is to say , a 320x240 file at 200 kbit / sec will not be the same quality as the same movie at 640x480 and 800 kbit / sec !
There are two reasons for this : Perceptual :
You notice MPEG artifacts more if they are scaled up bigger !
Artifacts appear on the scale of blocks ( 8x8 ) .
Your eye will not see errors in 4800 small blocks as easily as it sees errors in 1200 large blocks ( assuming you will be scaling both to fullscreen ) .
Theoretical :
When you scale down an image but still use the same size ( 8x8 ) blocks for the frequency space transform , you move more data to the high frequency bands .
Roughly speaking , each pixel contains more of the detail than it did before .
So even though your scaled - down picture contains 1 / 4 the information in the spacial directions , it could still contain a large portion of the information in the frequency domain ( assuming that the high frequencies were underutilized in the original 640x480 image ) .
Past guides have recommended choosing a bitrate and resolution based on a " bits per pixel " approach , but this is usually not valid due to the above reasons .
A better estimate seems to be that bitrates scale proportional to the square root of resolution , so that 320x240 and 400 kbit / sec would be comparable to 640x480 at 800 kbit / sec .
However this has not been verified with theoretical or empirical rigor .
Further , given that movies vary greatly with regard to noise , detail , degree of motion , etc. , it is futile to make general recommendations for bits per length - of - diagonal ( the analog of bits per pixel , using the square root ) .
So far we have discussed the difficulty of choosing a bitrate and resolution .
7.1.5.1 . Computing the resolution
The following steps will guide you in computing the resolution of your encode without distorting the video too much , by taking into account several types of information about the source video .
First , you should compute the encoded aspect ratio : ARc = ( Wc x ( ARa / PRdvd ) ) /
Hc where : Wc and Hc are the width and height of the cropped video ,
ARa is the displayed aspect ratio , which usually is 4/3 or 16/9 ,
PRdvd is the pixel ratio of the DVD which is equal to 1.25 =( 720/576 ) for PAL DVDs and 1.5=( 720/480 ) for NTSC DVDs .
Then , you can compute the X and Y resolution , according to a certain Compression Quality ( CQ ) factor : ResY = INT ( SQRT ( 1000 * Bitrate/25/ARc/CQ )/16 ) * 16 and ResX = INT ( ResY * ARc / 16 ) * 16 Okay , but what is the CQ ?
The CQ represents the number of bits per pixel and per frame of the encode .
Roughly speaking , the greater the CQ , the less the likelihood to see encoding artifacts .
However , if you have a target size for your movie ( 1 or 2 CDs for instance ) , there is a limited total number of bits that you can spend ; therefore it is necessary to find a good tradeoff between compressibility and quality .
The CQ depends on the bitrate , the video codec efficiency and the movie resolution .
In order to raise the CQ , typically you would downscale the movie given that the bitrate is computed in function of the target size and the length of the movie , which are constant .
With MPEG - 4 ASP codecs such as Xvid and libavcodec , a CQ below 0.18 usually results in a pretty blocky picture , because there are not enough bits to code the information of each macroblock .
( MPEG4 , like many other codecs , groups pixels by blocks of several pixels to compress the image ; if there are not enough bits , the edges of those blocks are visible . )
It is therefore wise to take a CQ ranging from 0.20 to 0.22 for a 1 CD rip , and 0.26-0.28 for 2 CDs rip with standard encoding options .
More advanced encoding options such as those listed here for libavcodec and Xvid should make it possible to get the same quality with CQ ranging from 0.18 to 0.20 for a 1 CD rip , and 0.24 to 0.26 for a 2 CD rip .
With MPEG - 4 AVC codecs such as x264 , you can use a CQ ranging from 0.14 to 0.16 with standard encoding options , and should be able to go as low as 0.10 to 0.12 with x264 's advanced encoding settings .
Please take note that the CQ is just an indicative figure , as depending on the encoded content , a CQ of 0.18 may look just fine for a Bergman , contrary to a movie such as The Matrix , which contains many high - motion scenes .
On the other hand , it is worthless to raise CQ higher than 0.30 as you would be wasting bits without any noticeable quality gain .
Also note that as mentioned earlier in this guide , low resolution videos need a bigger CQ ( compared to , for instance , DVD resolution ) to look good .
7.1.6 . Filtering Learning how to use MEncoder 's video filters is essential to producing good encodes .
All video processing is performed through the filters -- cropping , scaling , color adjustment , noise removal , sharpening , deinterlacing , telecine , inverse telecine , and deblocking , just to name a few .
Along with the vast number of supported input formats , the variety of filters available in MEncoder is one of its main advantages over other similar programs .
Filters are loaded in a chain using the - vf option : - vf filter1=options , filter2=options , ...
Most filters take several numeric options separated by colons , but the syntax for options varies from filter to filter , so read the man page for details on the filters you wish to use .
Filters operate on the video in the order they are loaded .
For example , the following chain : - vf crop=688:464:12:4 , scale=640:464 will first crop the 688x464 region of the picture with upper - left corner at ( 12,4 ) , and then scale the result down to 640x464 .
Certain filters need to be loaded at or near the beginning of the filter chain , in order to take advantage of information from the video decoder that will be lost or invalidated by other filters .
The principal examples are pp ( postprocessing , only when it is performing deblock or dering operations ) , spp ( another postprocessor to remove MPEG artifacts ) , pullup ( inverse telecine ) , and softpulldown ( for converting soft telecine to hard telecine ) .
In general , you want to do as little filtering as possible to the movie in order to remain close to the original DVD source .
Cropping is often necessary ( as described above ) , but avoid to scale the video .
Although scaling down is sometimes preferred to using higher quantizers , we want to avoid both these things : remember that we decided from the start to trade bits for quality .
Also , do not adjust gamma , contrast , brightness , etc .
What looks good on your display may not look good on others .
These adjustments should be done on playback only .
One thing you might want to do , however , is pass the video through a very light denoise filter , such as - vf hqdn3d =2:1:2 .
Again , it is a matter of putting those bits to better use : why waste them encoding noise when you can just add that noise back in during playback ?
Increasing the parameters for hqdn3d will further improve compressibility , but if you increase the values too much , you risk degrading the image visibly .
The suggested values above ( 2:1:2 ) are quite conservative ; you should feel free to experiment with higher values and observe the results for yourself .
7.1.7 . Interlacing and Telecine Almost all movies are shot at 24 fps .
Because NTSC is 30000/1001 fps , some processing must be done to this 24 fps video to make it run at the correct NTSC framerate .
The process is called 3:2 pulldown , commonly referred to as telecine ( because pulldown is often applied during the telecine process ) , and , naively described , it works by slowing the film down to 24000 / 1001 fps , and repeating every fourth frame .
No special processing , however , is done to the video for PAL DVDs , which run at 25 fps .
( Technically , PAL can be telecined , called 2:2 pulldown , but this does not become an issue in practice . )
The 24 fps film is simply played back at 25 fps .
The result is that the movie runs slightly faster , but unless you are an alien , you probably will not notice the difference .
Most PAL DVDs have pitch - corrected audio , so when they are played back at 25 fps things will sound right , even though the audio track ( and hence the whole movie ) has a running time that is 4 % less than NTSC DVDs .
Because the video in a PAL DVD has not been altered , you need not worry much about framerate .
The source is 25 fps , and your rip will be 25 fps .
However , if you are ripping an NTSC DVD movie , you may need to apply inverse telecine .
For movies shot at 24 fps , the video on the NTSC DVD is either telecined 30000/1001 , or else it is progressive 24000/ 1001 fps and intended to be telecined on - the - fly by a DVD player .
On the other hand , TV series are usually only interlaced , not telecined .
This is not a hard rule : some TV series are interlaced ( such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) whereas some are a mixture of progressive and interlaced ( such as Angel , or 24 ) .
It is highly recommended that you read the section on How to deal with telecine and interlacing in NTSC DVDs to learn how to handle the different possibilities .
However , if you are mostly just ripping movies , likely you are either dealing with 24 fps progressive or telecined video , in which case you can use the pullup filter - vf pullup , softskip .
7.1.8 . Encoding interlaced video
If the movie you want to encode is interlaced ( NTSC video or PAL video ) , you will need to choose whether you want to deinterlace or not .
While deinterlacing will make your movie usable on progressive scan displays such a computer monitors and projectors , it comes at a cost :
The fieldrate of 50 or 60000/ 1001 fields per second is halved to 25 or 30000/1001 frames per second , and roughly half of the information in your movie will be lost during scenes with significant motion .
Therefore , if you are encoding for high quality archival purposes , it is recommended not to deinterlace .
You can always deinterlace the movie at playback time when displaying it on progressive scan devices .
The power of currently available computers forces players to use a deinterlacing filter , which results in a slight degradation in image quality .
But future players will be able to mimic the interlaced display of a TV , deinterlacing to full fieldrate and interpolating 50 or 60000/ 1001 entire frames per second from the interlaced video .
Special care must be taken when working with interlaced video : Crop height and y - offset must be multiples of 4 .
Any vertical scaling must be performed in interlaced mode .
Postprocessing and denoising filters may not work as expected unless you take special care to operate them a field at a time , and they may damage the video if used incorrectly .
With these things in mind , here is our first example : mencoder capture.avi - mc 0 -oac lavc - ovc lavc - lavcopts \ vcodec=mpeg2video:vbitrate=6000:ilme:ildct:acodec=mp2:abitrate=224
Note the ilme and ildct options .
7.1.9 . Notes on Audio / Video synchronization MEncoder 's audio / video synchronization algorithms were designed with the intention of recovering files with broken sync .
However , in some cases they can cause unnecessary skipping and duplication of frames , and possibly slight A/V desync , when used with proper input ( of course , A/ V sync issues apply only if you process or copy the audio track while transcoding the video , which is strongly encouraged ) .
Therefore , you may have to switch to basic A/ V sync with the - mc 0 option , or put this in your ~/. mplayer / mencoder config file , as long as you are only working with good sources ( DVD , TV capture , high quality MPEG - 4 rips , etc ) and not broken ASF / RM / MOV files .
If you want to further guard against strange frame skips and duplication , you can use both - mc 0 and - noskip .
This will prevent all A/V sync , and copy frames one - to - one , so you cannot use it if you will be using any filters that unpredictably add or drop frames , or if your input file has variable framerate !
Therefore , using - noskip is not in general recommended .
The so - called " three - pass " audio encoding which MEncoder supports has been reported to cause A/V desync .
This will definitely happen if it is used in conjunction with certain filters , therefore , it is now recommended not to use three - pass audio mode .
This feature is only left for compatibility purposes and for expert users who understand when it is safe to use and when it is not .
If you have never heard of three - pass mode before , forget that we even mentioned it !
There have also been reports of A/V desync when encoding from stdin with MEncoder .
Do not do this !
Always use a file or CD / DVD / etc device as input .
7.1.10 .
Choosing the video codec
Which video codec is best to choose depends on several factors , like size , quality , streamability , usability and popularity , some of which widely depend on personal taste and technical constraints .
Compression efficiency :
It is quite easy to understand that most newer - generation codecs are made to increase quality and compression .
Therefore , the authors of this guide and many other people suggest that you cannot go wrong when choosing MPEG - 4 AVC codecs like x264 instead of MPEG - 4 ASP codecs such as libavcodec MPEG - 4 or Xvid .
( Advanced codec developers may be interested in reading Michael Niedermayer 's opinion on " why MPEG4 - ASP sucks " . )
Likewise , you should get better quality using MPEG - 4 ASP than you would with MPEG - 2 codecs .
However , newer codecs which are in heavy development can suffer from bugs which have not yet been noticed and which can ruin an encode .
This is simply the tradeoff for using bleeding - edge technology .
What is more , beginning to use a new codec requires that you spend some time becoming familiar with its options , so that you know what to adjust to achieve a desired picture quality .
Hardware compatibility :
It usually takes a long time for standalone video players to begin to include support for the latest video codecs .
As a result , most only support MPEG - 1 ( like VCD , XVCD and KVCD ) , MPEG - 2 ( like DVD , SVCD and KVCD ) and MPEG - 4 ASP ( like DivX , libavcodec 's LMP4 and Xvid ) ( Beware : Usually , not all MPEG - 4 ASP features are supported ) .
Please refer to the technical specs of your player ( if they are available ) , or google around for more information .
Best quality per encoding time : Codecs that have been around for some time ( such as libavcodec MPEG - 4 and Xvid ) are usually heavily optimized with all kinds of smart algorithms and SIMD assembly code .
That is why they tend to yield the best quality per encoding time ratio .
However , they may have some very advanced options that , if enabled , will make the encode really slow for marginal gains .
If you are after blazing speed you should stick around the default settings of the video codec ( although you should still try the other options which are mentioned in other sections of this guide ) .
You may also consider choosing a codec which can do multi- threaded processing , though this is only useful for users of machines with several CPUs .
libavcodec MPEG - 4 does allow that , but speed gains are limited , and there is a slight negative effect on picture quality .
Xvid 's multi - threaded encoding , activated by the threads option , can be used to boost encoding speed — by about 40 - 60 % in typical cases — with little if any picture degradation .
x264 also allows multi- threaded encoding , which currently speeds up encoding by 94 % per CPU core while lowering PSNR between 0.005dB and 0.01 dB on a typical setup .
Personal taste :
This is where it gets almost irrational :
For the same reason that some hung on to DivX 3 for years when newer codecs were already doing wonders , some folks will prefer Xvid or libavcodec MPEG - 4 over x264 .
You should make your own judgement ; do not take advice from people who swear by one codec .
Take a few sample clips from raw sources and compare different encoding options and codecs to find one that suits you best .
The best codec is the one you master , and the one that looks best to your eyes on your display !
Please refer to the section selecting codecs and container formats to get a list of supported codecs .
7.1.11 .
Audio Audio is a much simpler problem to solve : if you care about quality , just leave it as is .
Even AC - 3 5.1 streams are at most 448 K bit/s , and they are worth every bit .
You might be tempted to transcode the audio to high quality Vorbis , but just because you do not have an A/V receiver for AC - 3 pass - through today does not mean you will not have one tomorrow .
Future - proof your DVD rips by preserving the AC - 3 stream .
You can keep the AC - 3 stream either by copying it directly into the video stream during the encoding .
You can also extract the AC - 3 stream in order to mux it into containers such as NUT or Matroska .
mplayer source_file.vob - aid 129 - dumpaudio - dumpfile sound.ac3 will dump into the file sound .
ac3 the audio track number 129 from the file source_file.vob ( NB : DVD VOB files usually use a different audio numbering , which means that the VOB audio track 129 is the 2nd audio track of the file ) .
But sometimes you truly have no choice but to further compress the sound so that more bits can be spent on the video .
Most people choose to compress audio with either MP3 or Vorbis audio codecs .
While the latter is a very space - efficient codec , MP3 is better supported by hardware players , although this trend is changing .
Do not use - nosound when encoding a file with audio , even if you will be encoding and muxing audio separately later .
Though it may work in ideal cases , using - nosound is likely to hide some problems in your encoding command line setting .
In other words , having a soundtrack during your encode assures you that , provided you do not see messages such as “ Too many audio packets in the buffer ” , you will be able to get proper sync .
You need to have MEncoder process the sound .
You can for example copy the original soundtrack during the encode with - oac copy or convert it to a " light " 4 kHz mono WAV PCM with - oac pcm - channels 1 - srate 4000 .
Otherwise , in some cases , it will generate a video file that will not sync with the audio .
Such cases are when the number of video frames in the source file does not match up to the total length of audio frames or whenever there are discontinuities / splices where there are missing or extra audio frames .
The correct way to handle this kind of problem is to insert silence or cut audio at these points .
However MPlayer cannot do that , so if you demux the AC - 3 audio and encode it with a separate app ( or dump it to PCM with MPlayer ) , the splices will be left incorrect and the only way to correct them is to drop / duplicate video frames at the splice .
As long as MEncoder sees the audio when it is encoding the video , it can do this dropping / duping ( which is usually OK since it takes place at full black / scene change ) , but if MEncoder cannot see the audio , it will just process all frames as - is and they will not fit the final audio stream when you for example merge your audio and video track into a Matroska file .
First of all , you will have to convert the DVD sound into a WAV file that the audio codec can use as input .
For example : mplayer source_file.vob - ao pcm:file= destination_sound.wav \ -vc dummy - aid 1 - vo null will dump the second audio track from the file source_file.vob into the file destination_sound.wav .
You may want to normalize the sound before encoding , as DVD audio tracks are commonly recorded at low volumes .
You can use the tool normalize for instance , which is available in most distributions .
If you are using Windows , a tool such as BeSweet can do the same job .
You will compress in either Vorbis or MP3 .
For example : oggenc -q1 destination_sound.wav will encode destination_sound.wav with the encoding quality 1 , which is roughly equivalent to 80 Kb/s , and is the minimum quality at which you should encode if you care about quality .
Please note that MEncoder currently cannot mux Vorbis audio tracks into the output file because it only supports AVI and MPEG containers as an output , each of which may lead to audio / video playback synchronization problems with some players when the AVI file contain VBR audio streams such as Vorbis .
Do not worry , this document will show you how you can do that with third party programs .

There have been three moments over the past few days when I have felt ashamed to be part of the fashion industry .
The first came on Sunday evening , when Topshop kicked off London Fashion Week with a catwalk show in the idyllic setting of a marquee in Holland Park .

Blunt 's model girlfriend admits she took laxatives to stay thin
The clothes were lovely , fresh , young , affordable , infinitely wearable .
But what made me feel uncomfortable was the fact that , right bang in the front row , next to Arcadia boss Philip Green and his 15 - year - old daughter , and looking like the cat who got the cream , was Kate Moss .
Rumour had it that she was about to sign a deal to design her own collection for the High Street store , and although Mr Green would n’t confirm or deny the rumour on Sunday , he phoned me yesterday to explain his decision to indeed sign a contract to work with Kate , despite her history of drug and alcohol abuse .
When I asked him if he really thought she was a good role model for Topshop ’s mainly teenage customers , he said : -
" It is not a question of her being a good role model .
" Of course there are pluses and minuses to hiring Kate , and you have got to be concerned , and yes there is always a risk .
" But I am comfortable that it wo n’t happen again , and she knows what could happen if it does . "
He said that part of the reason for Kate making an appearance in the front row on Sunday was to take the temperature of the fashion press , to see how well regarded she still is , and that the rapturous reception she received only confirmed he had ‘ made the right choice ’ .
But my experience over the past few days , as I have been talking to editors and models , designers and agents , has been that these are the last people in the universe you would want as the arbiters of what is and is n’t acceptable to put in front of impressionable young women .
The two other seminal moments that prompted me to write this piece were at the Gharani Strok show on Monday , when a clearly dazed model fell onto the front row .
Then at the Jonathan Saunders show on Tuesday afternoon , a girl bringing up the rear on the catwalk ( the slot to model the last garment in a show is always the most prestigious , by the way ) caused the audience to gasp in shock .
Her back was so cadaverous , her arms and shoulders so eaten away ( did you know that if you drop below a BMI of 12 you start to consume your own organs and muscle tissue ? ) , that I decided to find out her name ( Alyona ) .
Then I phoned her agency , Storm ( who also represent Ms Moss ) , to find out if she was okay , and whether or not they were monitoring her closely enough , but , surprise surprise , nobody would take my call .
But what I found most infuriating of all , and which made me want to run onto the catwalk last night at Biba with a ‘ Thin scum ! ’ banner , was how the fashion industry has closed ranks .
Virtually everyone I spoke to thought the whole issue of zero - size models on the catwalk was a great big yawn .
The consensus was that Madrid only introduced a ban on models with a Body Mass Index of less than 18 to put themselves on the fashion map .
And that nothing , nothing will change , not this season , not next , and certainly not in Milan next week .
Shall I give you some examples of what people said to me this week , both on and off the record ?
When I raised this horny subject in a car between shows with a male fashion stylist who works for a newspaper supplement , he said : " Who wants to shoot clothes on someone who is fat and ugly ? "
I could have pointed out that we are not talking about putting someone fat and ugly on the catwalk , but dare I say it , just occasionally someone who is a size 12 ( Beyonce Knowles is a beauty , but even she would not pass fashion muster ) .
And I could have pointed out that , yes , I know some models are naturally thin , but what about the rest of us who are n’t , but I did n’t bother .
You would think fashion stylists would be more circumspect on this subject around me , since I raised the whole body image issue back in 2000 , when I was editor of Marie Claire , and have written about women ’s relationship with their body image on these pages ever since , but I can only assume they ca n’t read .
Ah well .
Almost every single person I spoke to in the business did n’t think there was a problem .
Take Bella Freud , who designed the Biba show .
When I spoke to her backstage she said : " You need to back off .
It is wrong to criticise models for their weight .
It is rude and ungracious . "
While I would n’t worry too much about Ms Freud ’s influence over teenage girls while designing for Biba , a label which is prohibitively expensive , I would worry that she also designs for the cheap , cheerful and very young Miss Selfridge .
Talking to the models themselves also got me precisely nowhere .
When I challenged statuesque model Erin O’Connor , the star of the new M&S campaigns , on the subject , she would only raise her eyebrows , as if this was the most tedious thing in the world .
" I think any type of eating disorder is unhealthy , " she said , a statement which made me wonder if she passed any GCSEs at all .
" I do n’t know my BMI , and I have no idea what I weigh , " she told me as we walked into the Gareth Pugh show at British Fashion Week HQ .
" I am just made like this . "
She found it hard to think of a model with an eating disorder , and when I helpfully mentioned British redhead Karen Elson , who has talked about her struggle with anorexia , she merely thought that was a one off .
I know for a fact that Karen still struggles to keep her weight down , and yet this is an industry which I was repeatedly told does not have a problem .
I got the same ‘ line ’ time and again .
This is Catherine Bailey , wife of David , outside the Jasper Conran show .
" I am sick and tired of this subject , " she barked at me , eating a strawberry .
" It is no worse now than when I was modelling .
The reason the girls are thin is because they have n’t had a chance to develop yet . "
This is Lily Cole , also backstage .
She is the biggest model in the world at the moment , and I do n’t mean this literally .
" Look , " she said , backing away from me .
" I do n’t want to talk about this , I am afraid of saying the wrong thing .
I feel persecuted , to be honest , and I will be quite glad to start at university and have some peace and quiet . "
Lizzie Jagger , too , told me she had never dieted in her life .
The fashion industry , you see , is desperately trying to shift the blame for the cult of the size
00 - a British size minus two , if you can imagine such a thing .
I have lived on fewer than 800 calories a day for the past 20 years , and even I can only get a size 0 as far as my knees .
A week or so ago , I interviewed Paige Adams - Geller , a former model who now designs her own range of jeans , and who happens to have a shop in Beverly Hills .
" If someone comes into my store and asks for a UK size 10 , I flip cartwheels , " she said .
" But most women in the business in LA are a zero , or if they are size 2 they are deeply ashamed .
" These women aspire to the models on the catwalk , they too want to wear those designer clothes on the red carpet . "
I told her that I once tried to put Liv Tyler , who is curvy , yes , but gorgeous , on a magazine cover , but no fashion designer had clothes big enough to fit her .
Paige shook her head .
" There is barely a celebrity who does n’t buy into what the fashion world dictates .
And they will do anything to become thin .
" I kept wondering why I would see an actress one week and she would look normal , and the next she would look gaunt , and I found out it is all down to crystal meth [ which suppresses the appetite ] the latest must - have accessory here in LA . "
She also told me the name of the ‘ celebrity stylist ’ who is now suddenly so in demand , simply because she also acts as the stars ’ drug dealer .
When I asked Paige whether in fact what everyone is telling me is true , that all the models are just naturally skinny , she gave a wry laugh .
" When I became a model at the age of 15 I was slim , I had won Miss California , for goodness ’ sake , but the moment I signed with an agent I was told to lose the weight .
" There is no way that a girl over seven and a half stone will get cast on the catwalk .
I used to eat one rice cake a day to stay that way .
And this meant I never menstruated . "
She told me she could guarantee that very few of the girls on the catwalk in London this week will have regular periods , which means they are storing up problems , such as osteoporosis , for later in life .
" I have seen first hand how these girls are treated , " she said .
" I would turn up on a shoot and be offered a line of coke ; I have even been on shoots where there have been syringes of heroin laid out ready for the models .
I always said , no thanks , I prefer to starve myself . "
No editor of any British glossy this week would go on the record and criticise the fashion industry , not even Alexandra Shulman , the editor of British Vogue , who when I challenged her on the issue last year had admitted that skinny models and celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker were not good role models for teenagers .
Having been a chubby teenager herself , she said she knew the damage these images can have ( she always wanted to be thinner and blonder ) , but I understand she also had to be pragmatic .
If she were to put a scientist on the cover of her magazine , she told me , readers would abandon her in droves .
The only editor I could get to say anything remotely critical was Louise Chunn , the former editor of Instyle , and who now edits Good Housekeeping , which is thankfully not reliant on high fashion advertising .
Although she does n’t think designers should adhere to some sort of code of good practice , she does think it ridiculous that women in their thirties and forties are only being shown clothes on 16 - year - olds .
" I find it hard to find models for my magazine who are over 30 and still working , " she says .
" It is almost impossible to find a model who is a size 12 .
" Let ’s face it , being thin when you are over 40 is a lot of hard work , and it is a shame there is nothing on the catwalk or in magazines to reflect that . "
Any designer who does want to cast a more ‘ normal ’ type of girl is going to find his or herself out in the cold in the current climate of the cult of the double zero .
This is one fashion editor ’s take on the Basso & Brooke catwalk show on Tuesday night .
" They used older girls , bigger girls , and it just looked all wrong , somehow .
We have now become so brainwashed into thinking that girls like the Australian 16 - year - old Gemma Ward are the norm , that those girls on Tuesday night just looked frumpy and ancient . "
How old were the poor old dears at this particular show ?
" Oooh , mid-20s ? "
The only two fashion designers who would admit the industry has a problem were Paul Smith and Jasper Conran .
Paul Smith said : " What I think might happen after what Madrid has started , is that the ( casting agencies ) , if they are clever , might start considering the idea of searching for girls that are a little bit bigger , maybe even just one size bigger .
That would change things in the future .
" I would like the girls to be bigger .
I would have used bigger girls for this show but you have to go with what the model agencies send you . "
Yesterday , Jasper Conran , cast the decidedly thirtysomething and bootylicious Jasmine Guinness in his show , and when I congratulated him on taking such a bold step he said : " Listen , I love women .
I design clothes for women , not stick insects .
" I was bullied at school for being fat and became anorexic myself as a result , and so I know what a terrible problem it is .
" And although I do n’t think you can catch this disease from the pages of a glossy or by looking at catwalk pictures , I do think our industry has a problem , and I think it is largely down to the agencies [ he says this last bit sotto voce ] .
" The model agencies need to take more care of the girls , think about their long - term futures , their well being . ’
Earlier that day I had interviewed one of the hottest new young faces , Ani , a 15 - year - old from Poland , and when I tried to ask her what she had had for breakfast , her agent from Premier told me my line of questioning was inappropriate , and told me to ‘ step away ’ .
I spotted her in the Jasper Conran show , and so I asked him , was he aware that a 15 - year - old was taking part in his show ?
" Really , " he said , surprised .
" No , I did n’t know that . "
Back in 2000 , at the government ’s body summit , which called on everyone in fashion to address the prevalence of very thin and very young models , the then minister for women , Tessa Jowell , who was sitting next to me , passed me a carefully folded note , suggesting I take the floor and suggest setting up some sort of committee to monitor the industry , which I did .
The next day , every glossy editor , many of the leading model agencies and the head of the Association of British Model Agents faxed a letter to every national newspaper refusing to have anything to do with me or my committee .
After my experiences of the past few days , I am beginning to wonder whether the only thing that will make them sit and take notice is when a model actually drops down dead at their Jimmy Choo ’d feet .
But by then , it will be far too late .
March 09 , 2006 18:32 IST
W e were speeding on a broad California highway and it was pitch dark early in the morning .
Our destination Sacramento , the capital of the state of California was still a few hours away and Paul my American friend in the car suggested a coffee break .
Actually more than that since like many Americans he was already hungry even before dawn and was ready to eat .
We came off the highway and soon found a donut shop , or doughnut shop to spell it correctly , ubiquitous in USA and the standard place for a quick breakfast and coffee .
I do n't know if you like the creamy sweetness of donuts or pastries so early after waking up .
Having been brought up on a healthy diet of idlis or upma , I do n't , but most Americans seem to like it .
Inside the shop , there were no customers , but two sales personnel , as they are referred to , representing both genders .
Both Asians .
Living in these parts , one begins to recognise different types of Asians , to discern by look some differences between Chinese , Japanese , Korean , Vietnamese , though one can never be sure .
But these did not look like Chinese .
They seemed shorter , shyer and less assured .
As the supply van which had unloaded a fresh batch of hot donuts drove away , they were heard talking in an unfamiliar tongue with the driver of the van and with each other .
" Which language are you speaking ? " I asked with a smile .
I am curious and inquisitive in situations like this .
" How many ? " one of them replied pointing at the donuts .
" No . No. Is it Cantonese ? " I repeated and saw bafflement and irritation on his face .
We had a few more rounds of utterly unsuccessful exchanges like this with the result that I was only learning that these donuts cost 60 cents , while the ones glazed and glistening in the back tray were at $ 1.29 .
Meanwhile Paul who had gone around the corner came in , took in the scene , and told me not to trouble them with my enquiries any more .
" Do n't harass these guys with your questions .
Do n't you know that they are Cambodians with very limited English ? " he said .
" How would I know ? " I replied .
" It is common knowledge .
Donut shops in California are owned and manned by Cambodians .
You should know that .
It is like the Laundromats being run by the Koreans , " he said .
I was struck by this sweeping generalisation about vocation and ethnic origin , though somewhat sceptical .
More enquiries and research showed however that there is often a fascinating correlation between who you are as an immigrant American and what you do .
Why are donuts shops run largely by Cambodians ?
These are simple shops with limited fare , not really like restaurants , but running them is really hard work .
Typically the donuts are baked / fried at midnight and brought into the shop by 3 am .
A small family can manage the whole operation -- cook , deliver , sell , clean -- and can even buy a franchise for a modest investment .
But the most important factor in our story is that this operation hardly requires any English .
Unlike any other customer oriented business based on labour -- laundry or drycleaning , hair - saloons or facials , or as you go up the value chain , groceries or pharmacies -- in the donut shop , you go in , point to what you need and say : ' I want six or a dozen ' .
Conversely , the salesperson merely has to point to the trays and ask : ' Which one -- this or that ' and that is it .
This then is the entry level in America for hard working families , working together with no English , who are mainly the Asian immigrants .
This is the mystery behind the Cambodian monopoly over the donut chains in California .
They make some money , but not huge amounts and once they acquire more English , aspire to move up the chain .
There are many Asian - American communities and each has its characteristics .
However , there are some common traits : hard work , family - orientation , propensity to save , a vision of a better tomorrow .
Some other communities do not share these traits , but I will not get into that .
There are today around 14 million Asian immigrants constituting almost 4.5 per cent of the US population .
The Chinese are the largest , the Philippine community perhaps the second largest and the Indians come third with a total of about two million now .
As I learnt all this I recalled from my university days something about Marx having said : ' From each according to his ability and to each according to his need . '
America is not the land to recall Marx but I could see that in the Diaspora ' To each according to his English ' had some relevance .
Naturally this enables Indians to be at the top of the ladder among the Asian - Americans , at least for now .
Studies of occupational patterns among Asian - Americans clearly show Indians leading in engineering , sciences and computers ; Chinese in sales and support and Philippinos in medical and health care .
" What about the Indian tribes ? "
Paul asked jocularly , as we discussed all this in the car , albeit in not so analytical a manner .
" What business do they excel in , apart from computers and call centres ? " he asked .
" There are many Indian tribes and with different traits .
I do n't really know too many with family businesses , " I began saying pedantically as we passed the sign of a Holiday - inn .
Then it struck me .
So obvious .
The Patels and the Motels .
It was my turn to tell Paul the phenomenal Patels - Motels - Hotels with which I had some familiarity from my own days in Uganda , years ago .
There is no integral link between Patels and Motels ; nor between expulsion of Indians from Uganda under Idi Amin in the early 1970s and their migration and subsequent success in UK , Canada and the USA .
Or is there ?
I have sometimes wondered .
The fact is that today people of Indian origin own over 60 per cent of the motel business in America and it is believed that the Patel community owns a major chunk of this .
What accounts for it ?
When the substantial Indian business community , predominantly Gujarati , got thrown out of Uganda in 1972 -- and that is another story -- many found their way to Western countries and had to start their lives anew .
What they had was some capital , propensity for the family to work together and for long hours , an innate capacity to save , and inborn business acumen .
And reasonable command over English .
The motel business requires long hours -- someone reliable at the desk for 24 hours , someone else to clean and get the rooms ready and some mastery over inventories and accounts .
All this came naturally to the community .
There was also the pull factor -- once someone has started a business others gravitate towards it .
In short a combination of unique circumstances and aptitudes enabled them to triumph over all tribulations , if you pardon the alliteration .
Today the community is acquiring and consolidating the mid-size to higher end of the hotel chain and the congregations of AAHOA -- Asian American Hotel Owners Association -- are glittering events in shiny palaces in Las Vegas .
A long road from the rural roads of Uganda .
" Ca n't other Indian communities replicate this model of motel ownership ? "
Paul was asking .
" I do n't know , I guess , they can " , I said .
I remembered , however , once asking a really wealthy Sikh farmer as to why none of his sons thought of this profitable venture .
" Punjabis can not sit still , " he said simply , " None of my sons will sit behind a register ; they would rather ride a tractor or a truck " .
Different tribes - different traits .
I ended my exposition with my favourite story from Uganda .
There is this super - rich Mr Patel in Vancouver in Canada .
Visitors to his huge mansion are shocked to see a large photograph of Idi Amin adorning the walls , next to the pictures of his parents and Gurus .
Every day , Amin 's photo is also duly garlanded and incense sticks offered .
' What is this ?
After all this man threw you out of the country and you worship him ? ' curious visitors ask Mr Patel .
" Sometimes Bhagwan gives you a kick to elevate you .

There has been a great deal of discussion about the Military Commissions Act of 2006 [ . pdf ] , recently passed by both houses of Congress , and most of it has to do with the provisions allowing torture of alien detainees , that is , of non-citizens apprehended in , say , Afghanistan or Iraq , and their treatment at the hands of their American captors .
Senators John McCain , Lindsey Graham , and John Warner , all Republicans , grandstanded for weeks over the torture provisions , then capitulated .
Another “ Republican maverick , ” Arlen Specter , zeroed in on the real issue , however , when he said the bill would set us back 800 years by repealing the habeas corpus protections against arbitrary arrest and jailings  and then went ahead and voted for it , anyway .
Liberal opposition mainly centered around the morality  or , rather , immorality  of torture , but the debate largely ignored the ticking time - bomb at the heart of this legislation , scheduled to go off , perhaps , in tandem with some future crisis , e.g. , another terrorist attack on American soil : the redefinition of the “ unlawful combatant ” concept that lays the foundations for this administration ’s reconstruction of the gulag .
Here is the new , broadened definition , as enunciated in the legislation recently passed by the House :
“ The term ‘ unlawful enemy combatant ’ means  ( i ) a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant ( including a person who is part of the Taliban , al - Qaeda , or associated forces ) ; or ( ii ) a person who , before , on , or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the president or the secretary of defense . ”
It does n’t say “ alien ” or “ terrorist , ” although it specifically includes members of the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
It says “ person ”  any person , including American citizens .
As Bruce Ackerman , professor of law at Yale and author of Before the Next Attack : Preserving Civil Liberties in an Age of Terrorism , puts it :
“ Buried in the complex Senate compromise on detainee treatment is a real shocker , reaching far beyond the legal struggles about foreign terrorist suspects in the Guantanamo Bay fortress .
The compromise legislation , which is racing toward the White House , authorizes the president to seize American citizens as enemy combatants , even if they have never left the United States .
And once thrown into military prison , they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the Bill of Rights . ”
Congress has now granted the president the powers of a dictator .
The rest of the story of our slide into absolutism is merely a matter of filling in the details .
Our rulers will naturally continue to pretend that we live in a normal democratic country , that the Constitution still means something , and that nothing essential has really changed  but , of course , everything has changed , as the post - 9/11 War Party has relentlessly argued , and we had better get used to it .
Because if you very vocally and aggressively refuse to get used to it , they can and perhaps one day will come for you .
As an Arab friend of mine puts it when describing the routine operations of Middle Eastern police states , “ You will never see the light . ”
My Arab friend , a recent immigrant , lives in fear of arbitrary arrest , having been constantly exposed to the danger and possibility of it in his native land and during his travels through the Middle East , and it has n’t faded with his arrival in this country .
He flinches every time he sees someone in uniform , glancing up fearfully as I open the door to a FedEx delivery guy , and tracks police cars out of the corner of his eye as they cruise down the street .
He is forever posing hypothetical situations in which he becomes the victim of a policeman who confronts him  perhaps on grounds of looking “ suspicious ”  and the story invariably ends with his deportation .
Or perhaps , he says , they will simply “ take me ”  and with this he simulates a cop grasping him by the neck  “ and send me to Guantanamo .
I will never see the light . ”
This kind of fear is understandable to Americans only on a very abstract level .
We , after all , have no experience with a police state  not in the sense of a systematic totalitarian approach to repression  of which the European and Third World nations have plenty .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt , for all his elaborate and extensive wartime apparatus of political repression and propaganda , never even came close to the police - state methods of his European cousins–once - removed in Moscow , Berlin , and Rome .
And the comic - opera machinations of J. Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon , while reprehensible , never approached the savage efficiency of the KGB  about the only efficient institution in Soviet society .
The closest we came was in 1798 , with the imposition of the Alien and Sedition Acts , which legalized the deportation of alien residents and criminalized criticism of the government , particularly the president .
The Acts were , in effect , a Federalist coup d’etat , in which the neo-royalists grouped around the Federalist Party sought to ditch the Constitution and repeal the American revolution .
The Federalist counter - revolution was carried out under the colors of “ national security , ” of course , and in the shadow of war : as in the Bushian version , a fifth column of enemy aliens was a major target of the 1798 legislation .
The Naturalization
Act sought to limit support for the Jeffersonians by lengthening the residency requirements for immigrants : most new citizens of the youthful republic were instinctual Jeffersonians , drawn to the New World by the bright promise of liberty .
The Alien Friends Act and the Alien Enemies Act , taken together , comprise a near - exact replica of the Military Commissions Act , mandating the seizure , detention , and deportation of male foreign nationals and resident aliens deemed hostile to the United States in wartime .
The target : tens of thousands of French citizens residing in the U.S. , who were unsympathetic to the Federalist cause .
The real target of the coup leaders , however , was n’t a foreign - born fifth column , but a domestic one .
The Sedition Act made it illegal for anyone to write , print , publish , or speak against the government in a manner deemed “ false , scandalous , and malicious ” and designed to hold the authorities in “ contempt or disrepute . ”
In wartime , argued the Federalists , presaging our own red - state fascists , it was necessary to suppress criticism of the government , and several prominent journalists critical of the Federalists were tried , and some convicted .
Opposition to the Sedition Act did much to fuel the subsequent Republican victory in the congressional elections of 1800 .
I wonder if history will repeat itself , this time  or will we enter a timeline where the neo-Federalists finally succeed in their scheme to impose a dictatorship on American shores ?
There is , of course , no equivalent of the Sedition Act of 1798 in the Military Commissions Act : only the seed of one , cited above .
It establishes the principle that an American citizen may be seized and locked up in a military prison , stripped of the protections traditionally afforded him by the Bill of Rights .
On the other hand , there is the question of how it will be enforced , and certainly there are numerous political factors to consider : repression without some degree of popular support is a risky business , as the Soviets came to understand only after it was too late .
The administration must take all this into account before acting .
In the present legal and political atmosphere , however , it wo n’t be long before this malignant seed sends its tendrils aboveground and blossoms into a full - grown and fearsome flower of evil .
One has only to listen to the latest pronouncement from our Beloved Leader , out on the campaign trail , implying that the Democrats are dancing on the borderline between criticism and treason when they bring up the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq .
Speaking to the Reserve Officers Association , he averred :
“ Some have selectively quoted from this document to make the case that by fighting the terrorists  by fighting them in Iraq  we are making our people less secure here at home .
This argument buys into the enemy ’s propaganda that the terrorists attack us because we ’re provoking them . ”
Translation : A vote for the Democrats  or , rather , as the Great Decider would say , the “ cut - and - run ” Democrats  is a vote for al - Qaeda .
Crude , and it remains to be seen how effective , yet this is not mere campaign rhetoric :
Bush ’s equation of antiwar criticism with “ the enemy ’s propaganda ” is precisely the argument made by the radical ideologues who inhabit the fever swamps of organized neoconservatism .
At their most feverish , the more excitable among them have theorized that the First Amendment is expendable when it comes to the “ war on terrorism , ” and that speech that tends to “ incite ” violence in the form of terrorism can be legitimately curtailed .
Certainly the Europeans  with recent legislation limiting speech in Britain , and “ hate speech ” laws endemic throughout the European Union  have made great strides along this road .
In America , however , the new authoritarians have , until now , had a tougher row to hoe .
During the 1940s , the Justice Department  obeying the president ’s command to go after antiwar dissenters  launched a sedition trial that initially sought to indict prominent politicians and activists associated with the America First movement , but the radicals in the administration were reined in after the legal difficulties became all too apparent .
The Justice Department wound up going after a group of 30 or so mostly harmless cranks , charging them with initiating a Nazi “ conspiracy of ideas . ”
Among the indicted was Lawrence Dennis , the noted writer and intellectual .
The trial was a farce from beginning to end .
Under the Justice Department ’s legal theory , anyone who held views that in any way echoed or agreed with any aspect of Nazi ideology or pronouncements could be said to be engaged in “ objectively ” aiding the enemy .
In this way , all the indicted individuals  many of whom had never laid eyes on their fellow “ conspirators ”  could be tied together , and then linked to an international network headquartered , naturally enough , in Berlin .
These people had bought into “ the enemy ’s propaganda ”  and the Roosevelt administration was determined to jail them .
In the end , however , the drama of the trial petered out and descended into parody .
Dragging on for months on end , with testimony mainly consisting of government attorneys reading the defendant ’s propagandistic efforts aloud , the Great Sedition Trial of 1940 , which started with plenty of fanfare from the administration ’s amen corner , soon became a laughingstock , and then  fatally  a bore .
When the judge died of a heart attack several months into the trial , the administration thought better of it and pulled in its horns .
One suspects , however , that this administration will not be so easily deterred .
To begin with , they wo n’t have to deal with a judge or bad publicity , because the “ trial ” will be conducted by a military tribunal , operating in secret .
Secondly , the defendants will stand trial without benefit of constitutional protections normally afforded to all American citizens .
I say “ normally ” because I am still living in the world before the passage of our modern - day Alien and Sedition Act , at least mentally .
But it ’s a new world , now .
The exact contours of this strange new world are vague , but they are fast coming into painfully clear focus .
As the president equates criticism of the Iraq war with “ enemy propaganda , ” and the neocon media blares away at the theme of “ dissent = treason ”  or , as Glenn Reynolds puts it , “ they ’re not antiwar , they ’re on the other side ”  it is n’t hard to imagine that we have a few sedition trials in our future .
My expectations are dire , although this could simply be my own subjective impression , a mood that will pass .
I ca n’t help feeling , however , a sense of gathering dread , attached not just to the Military Commissions
Act but arising out of the political atmosphere surrounding its passage .
I never could understand  in the sense of share  the fear of authority that emanates from my Arab friend every time he sees someone in uniform .
Now , however , I am beginning to feel it myself  as we all will .
For an elite unit with roughly 1,000 people at any given time , Task Force 6 - 26 seems to have had a large number of troops punished for detainee abuse .
Since 2003 , 34 task force members have been disciplined in some form for mistreating prisoners , and at least 11 members have been removed from the unit , according to new figures the Special Operations Command provided in response to questions from The New York Times .
Five Army Rangers in the unit were convicted three months ago for kicking and punching three detainees in September 2005 .
Some of the serious accusations against Task Force 6 - 26 have been reported over the past 16 months by news organizations including NBC , The Washington Post and The Times .
Many details emerged in hundreds of pages of documents released under a Freedom of Information Act request by the American Civil Liberties Union .
But taken together for the first time , the declassified documents and interviews with more than a dozen military and civilian Defense Department and other federal personnel provide the most detailed portrait yet of the secret camp and the inner workings of the clandestine unit .
The documents and interviews also reflect a culture clash between the free - wheeling military commandos and the more cautious Pentagon civilians working with them that escalated to a tense confrontation .
At one point , one of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld 's top aides , Stephen A. Cambone , ordered a subordinate to " get to the bottom " of any misconduct .
Most of the people interviewed for this article were midlevel civilian and military Defense Department personnel who worked with Task Force 6 - 26 and said they witnessed abuses , or who were briefed on its operations over the past three years .
Many were initially reluctant to discuss Task Force 6 - 26 because its missions are classified .
But when pressed repeatedly by reporters who contacted them , they agreed to speak about their experiences and observations out of what they said was anger and disgust over the unit 's treatment of detainees and the failure of task force commanders to punish misconduct more aggressively .
The critics said the harsh interrogations yielded little information to help capture insurgents or save American lives .
Virtually all of those who agreed to speak are career government employees , many with previous military service , and they were granted anonymity to encourage them to speak candidly without fear of retribution from the Pentagon .
Many of their complaints are supported by declassified military documents and e-mail messages from F.B.I. agents who worked regularly with the task force in Iraq .
A Demand for Intelligence
Military officials say there may have been extenuating circumstances for some of the harsh treatment at Camp Nama and its field stations in other parts of Iraq .
By the spring of 2004 , the demand on interrogators for intelligence was growing to help combat the increasingly numerous and deadly insurgent attacks .
I constantly get e-mail asking :
1 . Why do you steal music ?
2 . What ’s your problem with CDs ?
3 . Why do you think music should be free ?
The following is where I ’m coming from :
P2P
It ’s social protest .
If you believe change is gonna come by abiding by the rules of those in power then you just have n’t been paying attention .
For every teenager using Limewire , BitTorrent and IM ’ing files there ’s a baby boomer / exec who just can’t figure out why you ’d need anything better than a CD .
As if the CD were in the league of vinyl to begin with .
They call it convenience .
Which is the same reason you like your TiVo .
Your VCR recorded too , but you just could n’t figure out how to use it .
If we do n’t steal , then record companies will have us paying exorbitant prices for music and the public will be left without .
The promise of online delivery is more music for more people at a lower per song price .
I ask you , do you have a problem with more people owning more of your music ?
Would you rather ignore the stealing or try to monetize new delivery platforms ?
In other words , which side are you on ?
If you think the labels and the artists are on the same side , you ’re a rube .
A label wants to make the most money possible .
An artist wants to have the most people possible exposed to his music , whilst getting paid for said delivery / acquisition .
Their interests intersect , but they ’re not identical .
If more people acquired music , albeit at a lower per track price , more people would make more money .
Would it be the SAME people ?
That ’s the question .
That ’s why the labels are fighting so hard .
Their monopoly is in distribution , the Net eviscerates that .
CDs
As referenced above , CDs sound shitty .
The sampling rate is too low .
True , if mastering engineers did n’t compress the signal they ’d sound better , but they ’re at the mercy of the labels who want tracks to pop out of the radio .
In other words , we ’ve got a circle jerk that leaves the public out .
People DO like sweet sounding music of varieties not aired on Top Forty radio , which many are n’t listening to anyway .
The CD is not the end all and be all .
It ’s a MEDIUM , a CARRIER , that can be superseded as easily as one can switch to satellite radio from terrestrial radio , as easily as people switched from cassette to CD .
To be married to the CD is to be married to every antiquated delivery system in history .
From the horse and buggy milkman to the newspaper boy , OOPS , he ’s not gone yet .
Kind of proves the point actually .
You ’ve got to leave the house to get the CD , when with files you can acquire them right in your house .
Files do n’t sound as good as CDs unless you rip in lossless format which eats up a lot of disc space , but it ’s not a factor of the people not having large enough hard drives , they just do n’t CARE !
Prior to the iPod the sound standard for the average person was the boombox .
Is an iPod really such a step down ?
Furthermore , are n’t these defenders of the CD the same ones who killed the vinyl record , first for the vastly inferior sounding cassette ?
It ’s about convenience .
Not only in acquisition , but usage .
With files you can take your entire collection with you .
And if you lose it , you ’ve still got it on your home PC .
Trying to convince the public that this is a bad thing is equivalent to trying to convince you the aforementioned TiVo is superfluous , GET IT ?
It does n’t matter what the labels and old farts say or do .
The disc is going to die as sure as film was replaced by the JPEG .
Film might be better than the resolution most people shoot at digitally , but now they have INSTANT results and can shoot a ton of pictures for a pittance .
Sales of CDs are off fifteen percent this year for a good reason .
Because Steve Jobs delivered a better solution , and made you feel good about buying it .
FURTHERMORE , there ’s not a single soul who owns an iPod who does n’t swear by it / testify about it .
Imagine if they only felt the same way about the acts being rammed down their throats .
There ’s a tipping point .
We ’re rapidly approaching it .
That fifteen percent decline is far more dramatic than the loss of CD sales previously in this decade .
When the cookie crumbles , when most people want files , which side do you want to be on ?
Those purveying discs , telling customers to come back to the way things used to be , or those figuring out how to prosper in the new world of files ?
Monetization
Music SHOULD NOT be free .
Unless the rights holder wants to give it away .
I AM not advocating that artists work without pay .
I ’m just saying that new methods of delivery beg for new methods of payment .
What do we know so far ?
The iTunes Store accounts for a de minimis number of tracks on an iPod .
Despite the legal efforts of the RIAA , one can steal with impunity .
It ’s going to be hard to eliminate disc and hard drive swapping .
The only choice is to make it inconvenient / not worth one ’s while .
If everything is available at a cheap price to most people then asking your friend for an album will be equivalent to asking them to burn a DVD of last night ’s " Sopranos " episode .
Hell , HBO is n’t that expensive , get YOUR OWN damn subscription .
Standing in the way of new money arrangements are the old wave players worried about getting screwed again .
Mostly publishers .
Publishers need to go to a percentage rate .
And record labels must give more of the revenue to artists .
But neither of these two seem to be happening , so stealing continues unabated .
And it ’s this lack of movement that ’s creating huge holes in the marketplace for entrepreneurs .
Who might not need to profit off sales of tracks to make their nut .
There ’s a Microsoft looming to eclipse the IBM of the present world , those in power now just do n’t know it yet .
There ’s got to be some kind of ISP fee , a payment for acquisition , spread over many accounts , i.e. everybody , with a low fee attached .
If you do n’t think this is true , then you just do n’t get it .
We ’re going to subscription , but said subscription is not rental , not in the foreseeable future .
It ’s time to charge in the interim , in the same way that Bronfman and Morris authorized YouTube , they must authorize a P2P site .
Seven years have gone by without payment .
Monies from acquisition of files on the Net this century via P2P methods is lost forever .
Let ’s START charging .
Because just like the CD and the cassette before it , this era is n’t going to last FOREVER !
Another one ’s coming down the pike .
The key is to make money NOW !

Finding original source documents on the Web , otherwise known as firsthand accounts , primary sources , etc. , has thankfully become a pretty easy task .
There are plenty of great sites out there that have made it easy for the average searcher to locate pretty much anything from the Bill of Rights to Civil War journals to the Islamic History Sourcebook to the archived Godey s Lady Books seriously , there is NO end to the fun stuff you can find ( and do n't we all need a bit of break from reading about Google 's latest exploits ? ) .
Most of these I found using the tips and tricks I outlined in another Lifehacker article , How to Search the Invisible Web , along with a bit of special Web searchin ' sauce ( I 'm lying about the special sauce - although Thousand Island does seem to perk things up a bit ) .

Here are just a few of the sites on the Web that you can use to locate primary documents ; of course there s many , many more , but these are my favorites that I find myself coming back to again and again , just to browse ( I 'm such a dork , but that 's okay ) .
Remember , if you 're searching for original documents in order to cite them in an academic paper , you need to make sure you evaluate them first , and use proper citation procedures .

This is by no means an exhaustive list .
There 's the Australian National Archives Database , the Ad Access Project that " presents images and database information for over 7,000 advertisements printed in U.S. and Canadian newspapers and magazines between 1911 and 1955 " , the Internet Library of 18th and 19th century Journals , Making of America , a database of American social history primary sources , Chinese cultural texts , Asian history sources ... it goes on and on .
Again , even though you might not need to check out any of these primary sources , it 's nice to know that after you 've downloaded the latest iTunes episode of " The Office " that you DO have the option of browsing through the original Louisiana Purchase documents .
I mean , come on - can you imagine what kind of mad office credibility that would give you ?

In regards to Ruby and Python Compared :
Larry Wall , the designer of Perl , has the slogan " There 's more than one way to do it " .
In contrast , Bertrand Meyer , the designer of Eiffel , says " A programming language should provide one good way of performing any operation of interest ; it should avoid providing two . "
Ruby follows the anarchist approach of Larry Wall , while Python follows the bondage - and - discipline approach of Eiffel .
Python is not in any way a B &D language .
At all .
Even slightly .
No resemblence .
It takes nothing from Eiffel .
It probably could take some good ideas , but right now it does n't even take any of its good ideas .
Python attempts to build consistency with a carrot approach , not a stick .
I say " attempts " because there are many places where the Python community does n't agree on a solution , does n't agree on the phrasing of the problem , or simply does n't know the best way to do things .
There will always be such places , until such time as all programming problems are solved .
Despite the futility of this effort , we still pursue compelling , complete , and consistent solutions .
An important rule in the Python community is : we are all consenting adults .
That is , it is not the responsibility of the language designer or library author to keep people from doing bad things .
It is their responsibility to prevent people doing bad things accidentally .
But if you really want to do something bad , who are we to say you are wrong ?
It 's your program .
Maybe you even have a good reason .
That said , it 's unlikely you 'll see language designers or library authors going out of their way to enable you to do bad things where it was previously impossible .
So some feature suggestions that are likely to cause errors are unlikely to get much consideration .
Python usually seems to have one best way to perform a given task , and even prescribes how the code is to be laid out , since indentation is syntactically significant .
Of course you 'd have to be nutty not to indent your code the way Python wants you to .
Python is DRY ( Do n't Repeat Yourself ) here .
Ruby 's treatment of Booleans is much cleaner .
In ruby , false and nil are considered false in boolean contexts , and everything else is considered true .
Python follows the antimathematical convention of C and Perl where 0 is considered false .
This nonsense really has no place in such a high - level language .
But Python makes things worse : empty lists , empty dictionaries , and empty tuples are false .
What about empty sets ?
Well , sets are not a built - in type , so it depends on how they are implemented .
Python lacks true booleans : true and false .
I do n't think this is a very meaningful comparison .
If you want to test for nil / None , test for nil / None .
I guess you could say that Ruby is like Scheme or Smalltalk , and Python more like Lisp .
There 's points for and against each technique , but smart people have and continue to go both ways ; just get used to it .
That False == 0 and True == 1 is an artifact of a time when Python lacked true booleans ( though now True and False are " true " booleans , even if they are also integers : False is not 0 ) .
While the underlying integer nature of True and False lacks elegance , I have n't had any problems with it in practice .
As for other things being false ( I use a lower - case " false " to refer to all falsish items in Python ) , this is just how Python is .
Falseness is a property of an object .
Empty sets are false , because thats how they are implemented .
Convention , not the language , enforces the greater concept of what is " false " .
In C , 7/3 is 2 .
I 'm really a mathematician rather than a programmer , so I feel that 7/3 should be the rational number 7/3 .
The earlier versions of Python followed the C convention .
Happily , Python has finally switched .
Ruby defaults to the C convention but also gives the ordinary convention for rationals when you require the mathn standard library .
I always require the mathn standard library !
In Python 7/3 is still 2 .
It probably will be until Python 3.0 ; Guido regrets the original decision , but changing it before 3.0 is way too big a problem .
This is n't a reflection of some deep design principle in the language .
Python does not allow a library to change what 7/3 evaluates to .
Here Python the language is taking over , where in Ruby a library can effect this .
I assume in Ruby that means -- when the mathn library is loaded -- that division of all integers produces rationals ...?
But that seems so incredibly broken that I must assume it is not so .
Python 's OO has become more extensive in recent versions , but it is still an OO bolt - on to a procedural language .
Ruby is thoroughly OO .
In Python , it is rather arbitrary whether some functionality is implemented by a function or a method ( which have different syntaxes ) , and the programmer just has to remember how Python does it .
Python has types and classes ; in Ruby types are classes .
It 's not " arbitrary , " it 's an aspect of whatever thing you are using .
Not all libraries are designed the same , not all libraries are well designed , so sometimes a method is chosen when a function would do , or vice versa .
You can make the same choices in Ruby .
As a convention people in Ruby use methods far more often .
Over time I personally have come to use functions more often than methods , only using methods if I see that a compelling object has emerged in my code .
This is a difference of opinion .
But Python is n't the only place where people are starting to feel more disaffected with class - based OO , though really it's an aside to the particulars of the language .
The distinction between classes ( read : old - style classes ) and types ( read : built - in types , types written in C , new - style classes ) is subtle and related to legacy .
The distinction should disappear in 3.0 , and you can mostly ignore it in current versions as well .
Until recently , Python 's multiple inheritance had a critical design flaw which made it useless except as a way of implementing mixins .
Whether the improved multiple inheritance will buy Python anything besides confusion has yet to be seen .
If it does n't work for you , do n't use it .
In practice very few people use multiple inheritance anyway .
Whatever .
But Ruby 's thorough , dynamic OO gives the programmer incredible power .
Methods can be easily added or removed from classes at run-time .
They can easily added or removed from individual objects !
This can be done in Python as well , though it does not have the syntactic support that Ruby has .
Some Python classes , including many built - in classes , are not possible to extend .
Extending core classes is a highly questionable practice in my mind -- useful for clever hacks , but not for serious programming .
There is direct support for popular design patterns such as " Observer " , " Delegator " , " Singleton " , " Visitor " .
This is true ;
Python does not have any specific culture around these patterns .
Though some patterns like " Singleton " are total nonsense anyway .
But then , I do n't really know what the support in Ruby looks like , so I do n't know how I 'd recognize it in Python .
A Ruby program has great capacity for " reflection " , the ability to observe itself .
Want a list of all living objects belonging to a particular class ?
No problem !
Should you enjoy life in the fast lane , a ruby program can effectively rewrite itself at run-time .
Python 's reflection is quite good .
The list of all living objects , however , does not exist .
Python 's garbage collection is based on reference - counting .
Ruby 's is mark - and - sweep ( scheduled to be replaced by a generation - based system ) .
Python 's system allows the programmer more direct control over garbage collection : the del operator tells Python to garbage - collect a specific object right now .
But Python 's reference - counting system can easily lead to memory leaks , especially when trying to interface with C - code .
Little rings of co-referential dead objects can accumulate with a long - running Python program .
This is not true .
Ruby is capable of Perl - like one - liners that can be used on the command line for system administration .
Python is unsuitable for this .
Hey , one liners work in Python too .
Generally speaking , Python is a very popular system administration language ; certainly Perl is still king , but at least in the Linux world Python is the clear up - and - coming system administration language .
How big is this page ?
Longest website and Longest page Press F11 to optomize your view .
Q : How BIG and LONG is this page ?
A : This page is 9 quadrillion pixels wide by 9 quadrillion pixels tall .
Thus it contains a large number of pixels : 8,100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 otherwise known as 8.1 nonillion .
In scientific notation , that 's 8.1x10^30 , hereafter shown in the form 8.1e30 .
This means that the repeating background image has 5.4e28 stars on it -- about as many as there would be if our universe was multiplied to a million times it 's current observable size .
Futhermore , at 77 pixels to the inch , this page takes up 3.4e18 square miles and is 1.844 billion miles on a side -- an area roughly equivalent to a section of the plane of our Solar System with the sun at the center and the orbit of Saturn on the outside edge ( a square 22 AU on a side ) .
That 's about 17 billion times the surface area of the Earth .

Here 's another way to imagine the size of this webpage .
Let us exaggerate outrageously and say that a trillion books might have been written during the history of the world ( a figure more in line with all reading that has ever been done ) , and that each of those trillion books has an extremely generous allotment of 10,000 pages .
Let us then say that each of those pages has an average size of about one square foot .
That would mean that this webpage would have ten trillion times the space necessary to fit it all in .
If you were to do a random search of this webpage at a rate of ten pageviews per second , it would take you about 31,000 years -- on average -- before you would find even a single page of even one of those books .
And here 's another way to look at it .
The World Wide Web is currently the biggest part of the internet -- and it is huge .
Google currently knows of over 8 billion webpages -- and there are certainly a great many pages that Google does not know about .
There are an unknowable number that have come and gone and will never be seen again .
Let us imagine that there have been a total of a twenty billion webpages each year since 1990 -- a gross overestimation ( at least in regard to the early days ) .
Let us then imagine that each of those webpages was at least 25,000 pixels long and 1,000 pixels wide -- equivalent to about twenty - five pages of writing .
Given these figures , this one page would have enough raw area to house a quadrillion years worth of the World Wide Web .
If you were to search randomly at a rate of ten pageviews per second , it would take you 3 million years -- on average -- to find even just one of those twenty billion pages .

In Jon Udell ’s End HTTP
Abuse piece he observes , as have many recently , that many of the popular web services do n’t do the right thing with GET and POST .
In my paper for XTech this was one of the criteria I used to compare a number of different web services .
The complete list of reviewed services comprises : del.icio.us , flickr , bloglines , upcoming , 43 things , musicbrainz , audioscrobbler / last .
FM , and WebJay .
The list originally included AllConsuming but the site has / is going through a complete rewrite and had to be dropped for now .
One of my aims for the paper was to help foster a community of practice among developers by comparing and contrasting the designs of each service along several different axes .
I ’ve attempted to highlight areas , like GET / POST handling , where the services fall short of meeting the REST architecture or just simply following the letter of the HTTP specification .
The complete list of review criteria includes : URI design ; use of HTTP methods ; correct use of status codes ( another patchy area ) ; authentication , and API tokens ; use of hypermedia ; data formats ; exposure of personal data ; and licensing of both the service and it ’s data .
I think all of these criteria are important considerations when designing not only REST interfaces .
My conclusions about proper handling of GET / POST differ from Udell’s .
In the above piece he writes :
Why did n’t Bloglines , Flickr , or del.icio.us enforce the POST restriction ?
I suspect it ’s because they wanted their APIs to have the broadest possible reach .
And from a programmer ’s perspective , the simplest and easiest HTTP clients are those that use GET .
He then continues by exploring the ease of using GET versus POST on the client - side .
I think the fault actually lies on the server - side .
Specifically , with existing web applications frameworks .
In the Java world we ’ve got Java Servlets .
And what ’s the most commonly implemented method ?
It ’s not doGet its the generic service method .
Thats the point at which the majority of frameworks hook into a Controller servlet to dispatch to server - side request handlers .
And yet , how many frameworks encourage or even allow the binding of handlers based on a combination of URL + method ?
In my experience the protocol independence anti-pattern kicks in at that point , and the request method is the last thing that a developer is encouraged to take into account .
The end result are URLs that react identically to any request method .
It might be an interesting experiment if Udell tried sending PUT , DELETE , HEAD requests to the same API calls .
This situation is often compounded by URL designs that are more RPC than REST in nature .
E.g. / getPerson , /updatePerson rather than just / person .
In the latter case you have to use the right request method to differentiate requests and respond appropriately .
I think a lot more attention needs to be paid to web application frameworks to address some of these issues .
In the Java world even recent specifications like JavaServer Faces fall short in some fairly fundamental areas .
As Udell notes , after more than a decade we ’re still working out how best to use HTTP .
And that has to translate into closer attention to our toolkits and , where necessary , ripping them out and replacing them with something better .
On Prescriptivism
Although we linguists often lament our inability to influence what most people think about language , there is one area in which I fear that we may have been too successful .
In the past few years I have encountered a surprising number of examples of people mistakenly condemning an observation or complaint about language use as prescriptivism .
In some circles those alleged to be guilty of this sin are known as " grammar nazis " .
I think that it is therefore worth spending some time clarifying what prescriptivism is and why and when it is bad .
So , what is prescriptivism ?
The term can actually be used in two senses , only one of which carries any value judgment .
At one level , we can distinguish between descriptive linguistics , whose goal is to describe as accurately as possible what people actually do , and prescriptive linguistics , whose goal is to tell people what do .
As I point out below , there are circumstances in which linguistic prescription is perfectly appropriate , but most of the time the term prescriptivism is used in a second sense , one that carries with it a negative value judgment .
In this second sense , prescriptivism is criticism of deviation from an arbitrary standard merely because it is deviation .
Why is it it bad ?
In part , it is bad because it falsely assumes the existence of a uniform and unchanging standard and thereby fails to recognize the naturalness of linguistic variation and change .
Another reason it is bad is because it is frequently , though not always , based on bad descriptive linguistics .
That is , the standard to which it appeals is frequently unreal .
The putative standard may be an incorrect description of some previous stage of the language or even a mere figment of the imagination of the pundit , who has evidently not given much thought to the matter .
Frequently , but again not always , prescriptive claims are based on unfounded claims for the superiority of the standard usage , e.g. that only the standard usage is " logical " .
Perhaps the worst thing about prescriptivism is that it is frequently a device for demonstrating the superiority of the pundit and his or her favorite class of people over everyone else .
It feeds discrimination , particularly classism .
The standards to which pundits appeal are invariably those of a socioeconomic elite .
The standard tends to combine their natural speech with details that one can only acquire by means of extensive education .
There are some things that look superficially like prescriptivism but are n't .
One of these is lamenting the loss of a useful distinction .
For example , a pet peeve of mine is the incorrect use of abbreviations in footnotes in scholarly writing .
All too often nowadays I see v. , cf. , and viz used as if they all meant " see " .
Traditionally , these have three distinct meanings .
The only one that means " see " is v. , an abbreviation for vide .
cf. stands for confer " compare " .
It is appropriately used when you want to point the reader to a contrasting view or approach .
viz is properly used to indicate that the following items constitute an exhaustive list .
People seem either to think that it is an alternative way of saying " see " or that it is an alternative to e.g..
( Note , by the way , that there is no period after viz .
That is because it stands for videlicet and the z itself is taken to show that it is an abbreviation . )
Now , why is my dislike for the conflation of these three abbreviations not prescriptivism ?
It is because what I decry is not deviation from a standard merely because it is deviation but because it results in the loss of a useful distinction .
When I encounter cf. in a recent paper , I can no longer assume that the author is pointing me at a view differing from his own or a study using another methodology .
If that is what I am looking for , I may waste a trip to the library .
Furthermore , the loss of this distinction is not really a natural linguistic change .
After all , the whole system of scholarly apparatus is specialized and artificial .
The reason that this distinction is being lost is that those responsible for training scholars have largely ceased to teach it .
Students are expected to pick it up , and all too often they fail to pick up on some of the details .
That my distaste for the incorrect usage of cf. is not mere conservatism can be seen in its contrast with my attitude toward another traditional aspect of scholarly appartus , namely the use of citation elements like op .
cit. and ibid. , which I am glad to see the back of .
In the system of which these are a part , which younger readers may not be familiar with , a full reference to a cited work is given in the first note that refers to it .
The first footnote might contain a full reference like this :
Chao , Yuen - Ren ( 1934 ) " The Non-Uniqueness of Phonemic Solutions of Phonetic Systems " Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology , Academia Sinica 4.4.363-97 .
The next footnote to refer to this paper might read :
Chao , op .
cit. , p. 393 .
In order to interpret this reference , we have to know that op .
cit. means " the work ( already ) cited " and scan back through the footnotes until we find the first mention of this work of Chao's .
If the previous note was also a reference to the same work of Chao's , we would write :
Ibid. , p. 393 .
where ibid . " the same " tells us to look at the previous note containing a citation .
In a sparsely footnoted paper , the previous note may be pages back and in any case notes not containing citations may intervene .
In a densely footnoted paper , the first reference to a particular work may be pages back .
This system therefore imposes on the reader a lot of flipping back and forth looking for the note that actually contains the information desired .
It 's a real pain in the neck .
It probably made some sense when books were written by hand so that cross -referencing was difficult , but there is no excuse for it now .
It is much easier to collect all of the references at the end and refer to them in notes as " Chao ( 1934 ) " or " [ 12 ] " .
Then the reader knows exactly where to go to get the information .
Of these two aspects of the traditional system of scholarly apparatus , there is one that I would like to preserve and another that I would like to get rid of , because the one is useful and the other is time - consuming and irritating .
Another case that looks like prescriptivism but is n't is lamenting deviation from common usage because it is misleading , as in my tweak of Microsoft over its " Microsoft Genuine Software Initiative " .
Here the deviation from common usage is not the result of natural variation and change but a conscious decision on the part of marketers to reframe an argument .
A similar case would be the critique of anti-abortion activists ' self - description as " pro-life " when many , perhaps most of them also hold views that may be regarded as anti-life , such as favoring the death penalty , opposing gun control , favoring the invasion of Iraq and other wars that are not unequivocally self - defensive in nature , or opposing contraception in the face of evidence that contraception is a major tool in reducing the incidence of AIDS .
On the other side of the political spectrum a similar case is the critique of the pretense that the goal of university admissions programs is " diversity " , the argument being that such programs are not constructed in such a way as to produce true diversity .
In both cases , the point of the critique is not to condemn deviation from standard usage merely because it is deviation but to condemn what is arguably misleading propaganda based on linguistic slight of hand .
Finally , let me point out that there are situations in which prescription of language use is entirely appropriate .
One is where it is very important that the intended audience fully understand the material and there is significant risk of misunderstanding .
An example arises in the airline industry .
Large commercial aircraft are complex machines with thousands of parts that are in constant use .
They require regular and careful maintenance .
The consequences of doing something wrong can be devastating .
As a result , manufacturers such as Boeing , McDonnell - Douglas , Airbus and Embraer produce voluminous , detailed service manuals .
The problem is , these manuals must be comprehensible to mechanics who are not native speakers of English .
Such aircraft are serviced in too many countries for it to be economical to translate the manuals into all of the languages that the mechanics may speak .
Furthermore , even a mechanic reading a manual in his or her own first language may be confused if the language is excessively complex or uses unfamiliar vocabulary .
Boeing addresses this problem by requiring all of its manuals to be written in a precisely specified subset of English , one that allows only certain words and certain constructions to be used .
( Other manufacturers may well do this too .
I happen to know about Boeing because I once visited their natural language processing group . )
This ensures that mechanics with a certain level of proficiency in reading English will be able to understand the manuals without confusion .
It also makes it easier to automate the translation of manuals into other languages if so desired .

" Always low prices " is the endlessly repeated corporate slogan of Wal - Mart , the world 's biggest retailer .
But now , if the price of an item is low enough - under $ 25 ( £ 13.50 ) - you might get away without paying at all .
The chain has decided to stop seeking prosecution of shoplifters stealing goods worth less than $ 25 , ending a long - standing " zero tolerance " policy inaugurated by the firm 's strictly moral founder , Sam Walton .
Shoplifters under 18 or over 64 will also escape prosecution , according to an internal memo leaked to the New York Times by an anti-Wal - Mart pressure group .
The store will continue to seek prosecution of all suspected thieves who threaten violence or refuse to show identification .
The previous policy of prosecuting any thefts over $ 3 had overstretched local police departments , some of which were forced to hire extra officers to attend to Wal - Mart 's calls .
It also brings the company into line with most of its rivals , and frees up resources for fighting the bigger problems of organised shoplifting and theft by members of Wal - Mart 's own 1.3 million workforce .
" If I have somebody being paid $ 12 an hour processing a $ 5 theft , I have just lost money , " JP Suarez , the company 's head of asset protection , told the New York Times .
" I have also lost the time to catch somebody stealing $ 100 or an organised group stealing $ 3,000 . "
Ubuntu and Your iPod With all the talk in the previous chapter about ripping , encoding , and playing back audio files , you may be wondering whether or not you 'll be able to transfer any of those files to your iPod using Linux .
Well , you will be happy to know that Ubuntu does iPods , even Nanos .
You will also be happy to know that using your iPod on your Ubuntu system is quite easy .
All you have to do is plug your iPod into one of your computer 's USB ports , after which Ubuntu will automatically mount it and place an iPod icon on your desktop ( Figure 16 - 1 ) .
Yes , no longer do you have to mess around with mount and unmount commands or editing system tables .
Just plug in your pod , and Ubuntu will do the rest .
Figure 16 - 1 : A desktop icon for a mounted iPod
Knowing Your Limits
Although you can use your iPod in Ubuntu , you should remember that support for such devices is still rather new .
Because of that , there is likely to be the occasional odd moment while working with your iPod .
I have been using mine without problems , but a friend did lose all his data when he managed to freeze his system doing something bizarre .
The same thing happened to me on a Mac , so I guess that 's just the life of the pod .
Anyway , if you do happen to lose all the data on your iPod or somehow corrupt its system , you can just use Apple 's iPod Updater while in Windows to bring it back to normal and repopulate its song library from your hard disk .
If your iPod already has songs on it that you ripped using iTunes , you will be happy to know that such MP3s pose no problem .
They are MP3s , after all .
If , however , you have files encoded in iTunes ' default AAC format , you should be aware that Linux does not have much in the way of playback support .
Only XMMS , installed along with the XMMS - MP4 plugin , seems to provide an easy way for you to play such files .
As for the protected AAC files you might have bought from the iTunes store — well , forget about playing those back on Linux .
Nevertheless , these playback support limits should n't prove to be a problem — you can still add regular or protected AAC files to playlists , copy them to your hard disk , and delete them from your iPod in Linux .
For a Linux diehard , however , there is one big problem with regard to encoded audio formats ( and it is n't a limitation only in Linux ) : iPods do not support Ogg Vorbis files .
There is talk that Apple might include support in future iPods , but I would n't hold my breath .
In the meantime , you can quite simply convert your Ogg Vorbis files to MP3 format for use on your iPod , though there will be a bit of a loss in quality .
( This is understandable , considering both formats have their own , incompatible methods of compression which require the throwing out of actual music data . )
Of course , if you originally encoded your audio files in FLAC format , this quality issue will be moot .
You 'll learn more about this in Converting Audio File Formats .
i Pod Filesystem Formats Regardless of which iPod you 're talking about , all iPods have a formatted filesystem , just like your hard disk .
In fact , with the exception of the Shuffle and the Nano , they actually have hard disks inside them .
The filesystem format that is in place on your iPod depends on which system you originally used it on .
If you first used it on a Mac , it will be in Apple 's HFS + file format .
If you first used it on your Windows machine , it will be in Microsoft 's FAT32 format .
Actually , in the short term , it does n't matter which filesystem your iPod was formatted by ; Ubuntu will usually mount either one , allowing you to browse through all the files on your little white beastie .
If your iPod is HFS + formatted , however , browsing and exporting tracks is just about all you will be able to dependably do , assuming your system does mount it .
It is important that your iPod be FAT32 formatted if you want to really use it as you would in Windows or , ironically , Mac OS .
Determining Your iPod 's Format
How do you know whether your iPod is HFS + or FAT32 formatted ?
Well , as I said , it is basically a matter of knowing which system you 've been using your iPod with up until now .
When you first plugged your fresh , out - of - the - box iPod into your computer , it really could n't do anything yet .
At that time , your Windows or Mac system popped up some wizard asking you to run the iPod Updater tool .
That tool is primarily a formatter , which formats your device in FAT32 if you 're running it in Windows and HFS + if you 're running it on a Mac .
If you 've been a two - OS sort of person up until now and have been happily using your iPod on both a Mac and a Winbox , then you can be sure that your iPod was formatted using FAT32 , because Windows spews out chalk spittle when it tries to deal with anything that Microsoft itself did n't create .
In other words , Windows can't read drives formatted by HFS+ , while Mac OS can read both HFS + and FAT32 drives .
If you are using an iPod Shuffle , you can also be sure that it is FAT32 formatted , because all iPod Shuffles are — period .
Of course , if you 're a prove - it - to - me kind of person , you can seek truth from facts by going to the Applications menu , selecting Accessories » Text Editor , and then opening the file / etc / mtab in the text editor to reveal the format of your iPod .
Just look for a line that says something like / dev/ sda2 / media / ipod or / dev/ sdb2 / media / ipod and see what is listed to the right of that .
If it says vfat , then you know your device is FAT32 formatted .
If not , well .
. . you 're just going to have to change it .
Reformatting Your iPod
And how do you change your iPod from HFS + to FAT32 format ?
First you 're going to have to find a machine running Windows XP ( preferably Service Pack 2 for more recent iPods ) and a recent edition of iTunes .
Once you 've found your machine , you need to go to www.apple.com/ipod/download and download the most recent Windows version of the iPod Updater you can find there .
Once you 've downloaded and installed the updater , you will be asked if you would like to restart your machine ( because the updater requires you to do so ) .
Just say no for the time being , and plug your powered - up iPod into one of the machine 's USB ports .
Windows will go through one of its found - new - hardware scenarios and then ask you to restart the machine .
This time you can agree to it , so go ahead .
When the machine starts up again , the iPod Updater will automatically detect that you have an iPod in a non-Microsoft format connected to the machine and ask you if want to update it .
You do , so click Yes , after which the iPod Updater will appear ( Figure 16 - 2 ) .
Before you go any further , make sure that you have everything on that iPod backed up somewhere , because the updater is going to reformat your iPod , and that means that it is going to wipe it clean .
Of course , if the iPod is sort of a backup of what you 've got on your computer already , this should n't really be an issue .
Once you are ready to roll , just click the Restore button in the Updater window , and then click Restore again in the confirmation window that appears .
Figure 16 - 2 : The iPod Updater in Windows
When the process is complete , run iTunes to perform the final setup steps .
If your iPod does not soon appear in the left pane of the iTunes window , close all your applications , restart the system , and run iTunes again .
Your iPod should appear in iTunes this time around .
When it does , iTunes will present you with a brief wizard that you can pretty much handle on your own .
The only direction I will give here is that when you come to the wizard page that asks you if you want iTunes to automatically update your iPod with your photo and music collections , deselect the two checkboxes ; doing otherwise could lead to unwanted weirdness down the line .
Once the process is done , you will have a properly configured , FAT32 - formatted , and all but empty iPod that is ready for use in Linux , Windows , and Mac OS .
You can even use your iPod now on all three systems interchangeably , though I would only do so if the auto - update function is disabled .
Auto - Updating Your iPod
When you enable auto - update on your iPod via iTunes , the function is set up within your iPod itself .
With a FAT32 - formatted iPod , you can use your iPod on a Winbox , Mac , or Linuxbox — or all of them interchangeably .
If you set up your iPod to auto - update songs and playlists , however , you are leaving yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection on your Linux , Mac , and Windows machines .
The reason for this is simple .
While iTunes allows you to add files to your iPod , it does not allow you to copy files from it .
The auto - update feature is thus strictly a one - way street .
This means that when you hook up your auto - update–enabled iPod to an iTunes - enabled computer , iTunes will automatically add the tracks in its library to your iPod , and , more frighteningly , it will remove any tracks from your iPod that are not present in its library .
I learned this the hard way when I took my wife 's loaded iPod to work and plugged it into my office Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library .
When I brought the little podster back home to her with nothing at all on it , what ensued was n't pretty .
If you have an iPod that is already in FAT32 format , it is best for you to disable the auto - update function on your iPod while it is connected to your Winbox , before bringing your iPod into the Linux world .
To do this in Windows , just go to the iTunes Preferences ( while your iPod is connected ) , click the iPod tab , and then select Manually manage songs and playlists ( Figure 16 - 3 ) .
Figure 16 - 3 : Disabling the auto - update function on your iPod via iTunes in Windows
Managing Your iPod in Ubuntu Normally in Windows and Mac OS , you load files to your iPod via iTunes , but , of course , since Apple has not created a Linux version of that popular application ( and I doubt it ever will ) , you will have to find some other way to go about things .
Fortunately , there are a few Linux applications that can work to various degrees with your iPod , including two you learned about in Chapter 15 : amaroK and Rhythmbox .
In fact , Rhythmbox is set as the default application for iPods in Ubuntu , and as such it will automatically appear once your iPod is connected to your machine and mounted by your system .
All you have to do then is click the IPOD icon in the left pane of the Rhythmbox window , and you can see the contents of your iPod .
Click the small arrow to the right of the IPOD icon in the left pane , and you can also see your collection of playlists .
But other than all that seeing , there is n't much more you can do with your iPod via Rhythmbox .
However , there are a few other applications , specifically designed for use with your iPod , that are arguably a bit more useful .
These are the de facto Linux standards ( in the GNOME world , anyway ) : gtkpod and YamiPod , a freeware entry , available in Linux , Windows , and Mac versions .
Managing Your iPod 's Audio Files in gtkpod
The most commonly used Linux application for iPod file handling is gtkpod , which is shown in Figure 16 - 4 .
It is a pretty straightforward application with a fairly large user base , which means you should be able to get a lot of questions answered in Ubuntu and other Linux online forums should you have any .
It also handles most of the functions that one uses when dealing with an iPod , including album cover art ( but it does not handle photos other than that ) .
Figure 16 - 4 : Managing your iPod with gtkpod Downloading , Installing , and Running gtkpod
Of course , in order to use gtkpod , you first have to download and install it .
You can do this via Synaptic by doing a search for gtkpod and then installing gtkpod- aac following the installation steps in Chapter 5 .
If you did n't install the list of files mentioned in Project 15A on page 240 , now would be a good time to do so .
After that , plug your iPod into one of your computer 's USB ports , if you have n't already .
Once your iPod is mounted ( once the desktop icon appears and Rhythmbox opens ) go to the Applications menu , and select Sound & Video » gtkpod .
You can close Rhythmbox if you like .
Using gtkpod
When the gtkpod window opens , you should see two entries in the left pane : one called Local and another with the name of your iPod .
Sometimes there will be some other name there instead .
Mine read amaroK , for some unknown reason .
If you find yourself facing a similar naming mismatch , just change the name for the top entry so that it matches that of your iPod .
Once you 've come to grips with the name thing , display the contents of your iPod by clicking the entry for your iPod in the left pane and then clicking the Read button .
The contents of your iPod will appear in the right pane .
If you have any playlists on your iPod , you can also click the small arrow to the left of your iPod 's name in the left pane of the window , which will reveal the lists you have created .
You can add new songs or folders full of songs by clicking the +
File or + Dirs buttons below the menu bar and then navigating to the items you want to add .
You can also create playlists either by clicking + Playlists to create a playlist of the contents of a particular folder , or by clicking the New PL button to build your own playlist .
In the case of the latter method , a new list will appear in the Playlists pane at the left side of the window , after which you just drag the songs you want from the right pane in order to build your list .
Just be sure to drag the files directly onto the playlist icon , as gtkpod can be a bit finicky in this department .
You can also add songs to existing lists in the same way .
While on the topic of dragging and dropping , it is worth noting that you can add songs to your iPod library by simply dragging them from your Music folder ( or any other folder ) and then dropping them in the right pane of the gtkpod window .
If you want to add a song to both your iPod 's library and a specific playlist , drag a file or directory from your Music folder to the icon of the playlist in question .
Pretty cool .
Album Art and Tag Handling
Tag editing , including album cover images , is another area in which gtkpod can prove quite useful .
Click any track in the playlist , select Edit Details , and the Details window for that track will appear ( Figure 16 - 5 ) .
In that window you can edit all of the tag entries ( artist , album , track title , genre , and so on ) , and , very importantly , you can set the album cover art for the track .
Once you have finished making your changes , click the Apply button , and then click OK .
Figure 16 - 5 : Editing tags in gtkpod Copying Files from Your iPod to Your Hard Disk A handy feature of gtkpod that is n't available in iTunes ( at least not without a special freeware plugin ) is the ability to copy songs from your iPod to your hard disk .
To do this , select the tracks or playlists you want to export ( hold the ctrl key to make multiple selections or use the tabs to select whole artists or genres if you like ) , click the File menu , and select Export Tracks from Database .
A submenu will then appear , showing three choices : Selected Playlist , Selected Tab Entry , or Selected Tracks .
Choose the entry that matches your selections .
This approach works well enough , but it does n't seem to work for AAC files .
In that case , just drag the file in question from the gtkpod window to your desktop , and the file will automatically be copied there .
That file , however , will not have its original filename .
It will have an odd name , such as INEI .m4a or OSPO .m4a .
The files exported in this manner are themselves fine ; all you need to do is rename them as you would rename any other file ( right - click the file , and then select Rename — in case you forgot ) .
Playing Tracks on Your iPod with gtkpod
It is possible to use gtkpod in order to play the tracks on your iPod , though gtkpod must use a helper application to do this , as it has no playback capabilities of its own .
The default helper app for this purpose is XMMS , which is n't a bad choice — especially if you want to have headache - free AAC file support .
Of course , if you have n't installed XMMS , the default setup wo n't do you any good .
You must , therefore , either choose a different helper app , such as Rhythmbox or amaroK , or run Synaptic , doing a search for xmms and installing xmms and xmms - mp4 ( if you want AAC playback support ) .
If you decide to change the audio helper application for gtkpod , open the gtkpod Preferences window by going to the Edit menu and selecting Edit Preferences .
Once in the Preferences window , click the Tools tab , and then click the uppermost Browse button .
In the window that appears , scroll up and select rhythmbox or amarok ( depending on which you prefer ) .
Once your choice is made , click the OK button , and then once back to the Preferences window , repeat the process , this time clicking the second Browse button .
Click Apply and then OK to record your changes and close the Preferences window .
Finishing Up the Job with gtkpod
Once you 've done all you want to do with gtkpod , click the Sync button to record the changes to your iPod .
You can then quit gtkpod .
After that , right - click the desktop icon for your iPod , and select Unmount Volume .
When the desktop icon disappears , you can disconnect your iPod from your computer .
Using YamiPod for Your iPod File Management Needs
A relative newcomer to the iPod file management arena is YamiPod .
YamiPod , which also comes in Mac and Windows versions , looks like a cleaned - up version of gtkpod ; YamiPod 's layout is more straightforward , making it easier to use in many ways .
It also allows audio - direct , helper - less playback ( which gtkpod does n't ) , and it is easier to deal with in terms of playlist creation and handling .
Downloading , Installing , and Running YamiPod To get YamiPod , you 'll need to download it yourself from the project 's website at www.yamipod.com.
Just go the site 's Downloads page , and then download YamiPod to your hard disk .
The file will appear on your disk as a tarball , so first extract the tarball , and then move the yam - linux folder , which is the product of that extraction , to your home folder .
Once you 've done that , there is one small chore you need to perform before you can run the application : copying the libfmodex file within the yam - linux folder to the /usr / lib folder .
Since /usr / lib is in protected territory , you will have to use the sudo command to perform the copy procedure .
Here are the steps : Open a Terminal window , type cd yam - linux , and press enter .
In the same Terminal window , type the following command , and press enter ( and make sure to leave a space on either side of cp and between so .* and /usr ) : sudo cp libfmodex.so.*
/usr /lib
When prompted for your password , type it , and press enter .
When your user prompt reappears , you can close the Terminal window .
As YamiPod itself is an executable binary file , you do n't have to install it to put it to work , and you are now ready to step into action .
To get things under way , plug your iPod into one of your USB ports , and then double - click the YamiPod file within the yam - linux folder .
YamiPod will appear as a small window until it reads the contents of your iPod , after which the window should expand into something like the window in Figure 16 - 6 .
Figure 16 - 6 : Managing your iPod with YamiPod Using YamiPod Working with YamiPod is very simple .
To add songs to your iPod , just drag tracks or folders from your Music folder to the bottom pane of the YamiPod interface or to any open playlist in the playlist pane .
An Add To Ipod window ( Figure 16 - 7 ) will appear , showing the tag information for each of the songs you 've just dragged over .
In that window you can edit the tags for each of the songs , if you 'd like to , before adding them to the library .
When you 've finished making your changes , just click the Add All button , and the songs will be immediately added to your iPod 's library .
Figure 16 - 7 : Adding songs to your iPod with YamiPod
To create a playlist , click the + button near the top - right corner of the window , and name your list in the New Playlist window that appears .
Once you 've made your choice , click OK .
You can then drag the tracks you want to add to the list from the main library pane in the bottom half of the window .
You can also drag files directly from your Music folder to the Playlist pane , thereby adding those tracks to the playlist and your iPod 's library at the same time .
If you would like to remove a track from the library , just right - click the track in question , and then select Delete song in the popup menu .
To remove a playlist , just select the targeted list from the drop - down menu button at the right - top corner of the window , and then click the – button to the right of that .
Finishing Up Your YamiPod Session Since YamiPod performs changes to your iPod in real time as you perform those changes within the YamiPod window , wrapping things up is quite simple .
Just click the small , circular eject button at the very bottom - right corner of the YamiPod window .
YamiPod will then close , and your iPod will be automatically unmounted .
Exporting Files from Your iPod with YamiPod Like gtkpod , YamiPod allows you to export files from your iPod to your hard disk .
To copy songs from the library in YamiPod , select the tracks you want to copy in the main library pane ( and hold down the ctrl key while doing so if you are making multiple selections ) , right - click any one of the selected files , and then select Copy song to in the popup menu .
Podcasts Although both YamiPod and gtkpod allow you to copy podcasts to your iPod , neither application provides you with a list of available podcast feeds .
YamiPod does have a feature by which it can download the feeds you want if you provide the URL , but I do n't recommend doing that , as it seems to crash the program .
The result of these facts is that if you want to look for podcasts and add them to your iPod 's library , you will have to do a little more work than you 're used to .
One application that can help is iPodder ( Figure 16 - 8 ) , which you can download and install via Synaptic by doing a search for ipodder , and then . . . well , you know the steps by now .
Figure 16 - 8 : iPodder podcast browser and receiver
Once you select and download your podcasts , iPodder will place them in the downloads subfolder of the iPodderData folder that it creates for you in your home folder .
To add these podcasts to your iPod in gtkpod , create a playlist called Podcasts ( if there is n't one there already ) , and then add the podcast file to the playlist , as you would any audio file , by simply dragging it onto that playlist .
You can add podcasts to your iPod via YamiPod in almost the same way .
Just select the Podcasts playlist from the drop - down menu button at the top - right corner of the YamiPod window , and then drag the file to the top - right pane of the window .
Setting Up Your System to Automatically Launch YamiPod or gtkpod
If you like , you can set up your system so that YamiPod or gtkpod automatically launches when you plug your iPod into one of your USB ports .
To do this , go to the System menu , and select Preferences » Removable Drives and Media .
When the Preferences window appears , click the Multimedia tab , and then check the box next to the words Play music files when connected in the iPod section of that tab .
In the Command box , type gtkpod if you want to use that application , or if you prefer YamiPod , click the Browse button and navigate your way to the YamiPod binary file within your home folder .
Once you 're done , the Preferences window should look something like Figure 16 - 9 .
If so , click Close .
Figure 16 - 9 : Setting up your system to run YamiPod when you plug in your iPod
Photo Transfer with GPixPod Ever since the iPod Photo appeared in 2004 , iPods have been able to display photos .
Unfortunately , until recently there was no simple way to transfer photos from your computer to your iPod in Linux .
Things have , quite fortunately , changed since the appearance of a handy application called GPixPod.
GPixPod ( Figure 16 - 10 ) is , admittedly , an application still in development .
Nevertheless , it should work on all color iPods , though it is not yet fully compatible with the original iPod Photo .
Since version 0.4.1 , it also seems to work with the Nano .
You can get GPixPod from its project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpixpod.
Click the Download GPixPod button , and then on the next page that appears , click the Download button .
On the next page , click the gpixpod - 0.4.4_all.deb ( or newer ) link , which will bring you to a list of mirrors .
Select the one closest to you , and then wait for the GPixPod download to complete .
Figure 16 - 10 : Adding photos to your iPod with GPixPod Once the gpixpod - 0.4.4_all.deb package is on your hard disk , you have to install it .
Rather than resort to the command line , as you did when installing DEB packages back in Chapter 9 , let 's go the easy route by just double - clicking the package itself .
This will bring up the package installer , gdebi ( Figure 16 - 11 ) .
Note :
Make sure that neither Synaptic nor the Add / Remove Applications utility are open when running gdebi , as only one package management tool can run at a time .
Figure 16 - 11 : Installing GPixPod via gdebi
As you can see , the gdebi package installer looks like a piece cut out of the Synaptic window .
It provides a description of the application , details about the file you are attempting to install , and a list of what 's included in the package .
To get down to the actual installation , just click the Install Package button .
A small window will appear , telling you that you need administrative rights in order to proceed .
Click Grant in that window ( the equivalent of typing your password when using Synaptic ) , after which the installation will begin .
Once GPixPod is installed , you can run it by going to the Applications menu and selecting Graphics » GPixPod .
Note :
You cannot add photos to the GPixPod interface without first connecting your iPod to your system .
You should also note that you can not view images added to GPixPod 's database in the right pane of the application window until you save your changes by clicking the Save button .
Converting Audio File Formats
If you would like to convert MP3 to Ogg Vorbis format or vice versa , SoundConverter ( shown in Figure 16 - 12 ) is an application that makes it all quite simple .
Because SoundConverter does not come bundled with Ubuntu , you will have to install it yourself ( if you did n't install it in Chapter 5 ) .
To do so , just run Synaptic , search for soundconverter , and install it .
All you have to do to use SoundConverter after that is add the songs you want to convert to the main pane by clicking either the Add File or Add Folder buttons .
If you prefer , you can also drag files from your Music folder ( or wherever else you store your audio files ) .
Figure 16 - 12 : Converting audio file formats with SoundConverter
Once you 've chosen the files to convert , you need to choose which format to convert them to .
You can do this by clicking the Preferences button and then making your choice in the Preferences window ( Figure 16 - 13 ) .
While you 're there , it is also a good idea to tell SoundConverter to place your converted files in a location other than the folder where the original files are stored .
Doing this prevents having to deal with duplicates in Linux audio playback applications that automatically scan your Music folder , such as amaroK .
This is not an issue in either gtkpod or YamiPod , as they will not allow you to add Ogg Vorbis files to their library lists .
You might also want to check the box next to the words Create subfolders in order to keep things organized .
Once you have set things up and are ready to convert , click Close in the Preferences window , and then click Convert in the main window .
SoundConverter will then begin doing its stuff .

E-mail : Select one : HTML Text Woman bounced from Southwest flight for T - shirt By Susan Voyles , Reno Gazette - Journal RENO  A Washington state woman intends to press a civil - rights case against Southwest Airlines for booting her off a flight in Reno after fellow passengers complained about a message on her T - shirt .
Lorrie Heasley , of Woodland , Wash. , was halfway home on a flight Tuesday that began in Los Angeles , wearing a T - shirt with the pictures of President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a phrase similar to the popular film , Meet the Fockers .
Heasley said she wore the T - shirt as a gag .
She wanted her parents , who are Democrats , to see it when they picked her up at the airport in Portland , Ore .
" I just thought it was hilarious , " said Heasley , 32 , a lumber saleswoman .
And she felt she had the right to wear it .
" I have cousins in Iraq and other relatives going to war , " she said .
" Here we are trying to free another country and I have to get off an airplane in midflight over a T - shirt .
That 's not freedom . "
Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the T - shirt became an issue after several passengers complained .
She said the airline 's contract filed with the Federal Aviation Administration contains rules on passenger conduct .
Heasley said no one from Southwest said anything about the shirt when she waited two hours near the gate at Los Angeles International Airport .
And neither the pilot , nor other crewmembers , said anything when she boarded the aircraft , Heasley added .
After the plane stopped in Reno at noon Tuesday , she and her husband , Ron , moved to the front of the plane .
Passengers began complaining about the T - shirt as they boarded .
After several conversations with flight attendants , Heasley agreed to cover the words by cuddling up with a sweatshirt .
When the sweatshirt slipped while she was trying to sleep , she was ordered to wear her T - shirt inside - out or leave .
The couple chose to leave .
McInnis said the rules filed with the FAA say the airline will deny boarding to any customer whose conduct is offensive , abusive , disorderly or violent or for clothing that is " lewd , obscene , or patently offensive . "
Allen Lichtenstein , lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada , said Heasley 's T - shirt is " protected " political speech under the Constitution .
The real issue , he said , is that the airline allowed her to wear the shirt onboard and then objected only when people complained .
" That they changed rules in the middle of a flight simply because someone did n't like it and it might be problematic , " he said .
FAA spokesman Donn Walker said no federal rules exist on the subject .
" It 's up to the airlines who they want to take and by what rules , " he said .
" The government just does n't get into the business of what people wear on an aircraft . "
" At any point when a passenger has a complaint against another and it becomes an issue that could disrupt the flight , our attendants have the discretion to take the appropriate action , " said Phil Gee , spokesman for US Airways .
Heasley said she is in touch with ACLU lawyers in Seattle .
She wants Southwest to reimburse the couple for the last leg of their trip and pay for her gasoline , a $ 68 rental car from Avis and a $ 70 hotel bill .
Before leaving the plane , she said she was told the airline would reimburse her for the tickets for the last leg of the flight .
After they got off the plane , they were told they'd be reimbursed only for the taxes on the tickets .
McInnis said customer services officials are looking into the matter .
After fighting over the ticket prices , the couple got a hotel room in Reno , rented a car and got home Wednesday afternoon — about 24 hours after they left the plane .
" I have always flown Southwest everywhere I go , " Heasley said .
" I will never fly with them again .
They can disrespect somebody else . "

ああ…、こんなおあつらえ向きの質問が、しかも
はてなにあったのに、気がつかなかった…。orz
もはや回答は締め切られているので、ここにメモ。
ひと言でいうと、たしかに「オブジェクト指向」を考え出したのはアラン・ケイ。でも、そう言い切っておしまいにするには、ちょっと（いや、かなり…）問題があります。
というのも、 「 オブジェクト指向 」 は「オブジェクト指向プログラミング」の意味に限っても、現在まで、少なめに見積もった場合でも３つ（ここでは取り上げていない比較的新しめの「プロトタイプベースのオブジェクト指向」を含めて。単にオブジェクトとクラスを使ったプログラミング…という論外なのを含めれば４つ以上）の違った切り口を持つようになってきているからです。
ここでは説明者が意識しながらも、ほとんど区別されることがなく、混乱の元にになっている２つの「オブジェクト指向」の紹介します。
なお、このケイのメッセージングの オブジェクト指向 を学ぶのに Smalltalk が役に立つことはありますが、だからといって
Smalltalk がその考え方をまるごと体現できているわけではないので、けっして「 ケイの」を「
Smalltalk の」と言い換えてはいけません。念のため。
端的にはコンピューティングに関わるすべてを 「 “ オブジェク ト ” と、それに対する “ メッセージ送信 ” で表現すべし」というドグマにより成り立たせようとする世界観で、そこで目指すべきイメージとしては、高速のネットワークで接続された小さな（しかし万能の）計算機の挙動にたとえられます。また、
生命科学 における細胞の営み、哲学でいえば ライプニッツ の モナド 論に通じるところもあります。ちなみに、ケイのこの考え方にインスパイアされて提案されたのがカール・ヒューイットの「 アクターモデル 」 。（逆なのでは？と思う人は こちらを ）
アラン・ケイ が 1970 年代初頭までに考え出し、暫定 ダイナブック 環境であ る Smalltalk システムで実践、そこで用いることができる Smalltalk 言語にサポートさせようとしたの は “ 1 ” の「 オブジェクト指 向
」です。（この考え方はプログラミングのみならず、今でいうところの設計、分析のようなものも含みます）
「 メッセージ指向」というのは、ケイ自身は覚えていないようですが、彼の共著の論文で使われている表現です（もしかしたら、共著者のアデル・ゴールドバーグが用いたのかも…）。
しかし、現 在 「オブジェクト指向」を説明する人が（たいていは意識せずに）前提としているのは、C++ の設計者として知られるビアルネ・ストラウストラップが、C++ の設計を通じて 1980 年代半ばまでに体系付け た “ 2 ” の「オブジェクト指向」です。カプセル化/情報隠蔽、継承、多態性…とかのいわゆる「三点セット」は、おそらくここで言われる「抽象データ型
＋ 継承と仮想関数による動的性（つまるところ「クラス」の機能）」が変形させられたものだと思って間違いないでしょう。（これ以前に発表された論文で、三点を網羅したものは見あたらないので…）
端的には 、 「抽象データ型（ユーザー定義のデータ型）」を実現するのに「
（SIMULA
の）クラス」を用いる…という考え方なので、クラスは必須です。また、主だっては「データ型」を定義する作業をするわけですから、プログラミング言語におけるデータ型の役割、それをユーザーが定義できることのメリットを把握していないと、会得したぞ！感やシアワセ感がいまひとつ薄くなると思います。逆に、データ型を定義するだけなら
C 言語でもできる（工夫や解釈次第で継承や動的性実現も…）わけなので、そんなことにわざわざ言語機能のサポートなんぞ期待しない…と言い切れるスキルを有する人にとって、この「オブジェクト指向」の存在価値は皆無と言えましょう。
なお、この文脈の 「オブジェクト指向」において、メッセージングはぜんぜん関係ない無用のもの and / or 動的性実現のための（仮想関数より効率の悪い）実装のひとつに過ぎない…ということを強く意識する必要があります。ケイの影響で「オブジェクト指向＝メッセージ」と脳に染みついている人には酷かもしれませんが、いっそ排除して考えたほうがすっきりしますし、可能な限りそうすべきです。しがらみのない初学者へのレクチャーに際しては、ぜひとも「オブジェクトにメッセージを送って…」とか「世の中のあらゆるものを(ry」なんて説明は後々無用な混乱を招くだけなので、やめて欲しいと思います。まずは“データ型”とは何か？という議論からはじめるべきでしょう。（そのデータ型で、あえて、犬、猫、牛、鳥…をどーしても表現したいのであれば、止める理由はありませんが…( ^_^ ; ) ）
あと、 「 ケイの 」 を「 Smalltalk の」と言い換えてはいけないのと同様に、「 ストラウストラップの 」
を「 C++ の」とは置き換えない方がいいと思います。後にも述べましたが、C++ がマルチパラダイムを目指した言語ということもありますし。
まあとにかく、あるアイデアの発案者が直接開発にかかわった言語だからといって、その言語の仕様のみから元となるアイデアや考え方を学べる and / or 他の人にそのアイデアがどんなものだったのかを伝えられるとは思わないほうがよいと思います。やはりその人自身がそのアイデアについて言及した文書を読むのが一番でしょう。言語学習のみでは、概念や背景を学ぶことはできません。きっぱり。
以上、それぞれに付したリンク先の論文や書簡文で、その概要を知ることができるでしょう（くどいようですが、これらの文書を読まずに、ただ、ここで名前の挙がった言語の仕様や利用のされ方から、おのおのの主張の子細を類推するのだけはやめてください）。
一般に語られ る 「 オブジェクト指向」はたいてい、この出自も文脈も目的も本質も異なる２つが、ただオブジェクト（あるいはクラス）という言語機能を共通に活用するというだけの理由でごっちゃにされて非常に合点のゆきにくいものになっています。教科書レベルの記述すら例外ではありません。個人的には、「メッセージ 」 and / or “ 三点セッ ト ” だのを持ち出しておきながら、ケイ and / or ストラウストラップの主張への言及無しに「オブジェクト指向」を語ろうとする文章は、どんな偉い人、どんなに有名な人が書いていても（ノウハウとして役立つ内容であるかどうかはともかく、こと「オブジェクト指向」の紹介としては…）“ 眉唾もの”だと思って差し支えないと思っています。
また調べているうちに、過去に幾度となく繰り返されてきた言語間の“宗教戦争”のほとんどが、このどれに軸足を置くかの違いでしかない、という単純な話に帰着できそうなことにも気がつきました。この点、非常に興味深いところです。たとえば、どれを選ぶかで、オブジェクト指向言語における “ 元祖 ” や
“ 純粋 ” の意味するところもガラリと変わってしまうことは、そのよい例でしょう。
“ 1” ならもちろ ん Smalltalk 、 “ 2 ” なら SIMULA ( SIMULA 67）または最初から意識して作られたものとしては
Eiffel（元祖ではありませんが Java は比較的純粋なものの代表格…）といった具合です。ここで重要なのは、たとえ“ 1” で至れり尽くせりの Smalltalk であっても 、 “ 2” の切り口ではお世辞にも優秀な言語…というわけにはいかないということです。たとえば
Java について、逆もまたしかり。ただ限定的になら
Smalltalk で “ 2 ” の実践も可能です し 、Java で “ 1 ” も同様に問題ありません 。EJB のように Smalltalk のなんちゃってメッセージングよりさらに踏み込んだフレームワークもあるくらいです。
C++ についても気をつけないといけません。C++ はよくオブジェクト指向言語として紹介されたり、批判に晒されることが多いのですが、上述のことに絡めてこうした姿勢にはちょっと問題アリと言えそうです。というのも、あくまで同言語は「手続き型」、「抽象データ型」に加えて（もちろん上の“ 2” の）「オブジェクト指向」*も*可能なマルチパラダイム言語として作られたものにすぎないからです。全然関係ない“ 1” の切り 口の 「オブジェクト指向」に照らして、C++ を揶揄するのはお門違いもいいところ。まして、例の三点セットを（その出典も知らずに）持ち出してきて
C++ を云々するのは天にツバするようなもの…と言えなくもありません。くわばら、くわばら。
（このエントリーは、折を見て、ちょこちょこ加筆しています。どうぞあしからず。）
It was certainly bold .
An hour and a half 's drive from where Bush stood , the US military ran the notorious School of the Americas from 1946 to 1984 , a sinister educational institution that , if it had a motto , might have been " We do torture " .
It is here in Panama , and later at the school 's new location in Fort Benning , Georgia , where the roots of the current torture scandals can be found .
According to declassified training manuals , SOA students - military and police officers from across the hemisphere - were instructed in many of the same " coercive interrogation " techniques that have since gone to Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib : early morning capture to maximise shock , immediate hooding and blindfolding , forced nudity , sensory deprivation , sensory overload , sleep and food " manipulation " , humiliation , extreme temperatures , isolation , stress positions - and worse .
In 1996 President Clinton 's Intelligence Oversight Board admitted that US - produced training materials condoned " execution of guerrillas , extortion , physical abuse , coercion and false imprisonment " .
Some Panama school graduates went on to commit the continent 's greatest war crimes of the past half - century : the murders of Archbishop Oscar Romero and six Jesuit priests in El Salvador ; the systematic theft of babies from Argentina 's " disappeared " prisoners ; the massacre of 900 civilians in El Mozote in El Salvador ; and military coups too numerous to list here .
Yet when covering the Bush announcement , not a single mainstream news outlet mentioned the location 's sordid history .
How could they ?
That would require something totally absent from the debate : an admission that the embrace of torture by US officials has been integral to US foreign policy since the Vietnam war .
It 's a history exhaustively documented in an avalanche of books , declassified documents , CIA training manuals , court records and truth commissions .
In his forthcoming book , A Question of Torture , Alfred McCoy synthesises this evidence , producing a riveting account of how monstrous CIA - funded experiments on psychiatric patients and prisoners in the 1950s turned into a template for what he calls " no - touch torture " , based on sensory deprivation and self - inflicted pain .
McCoy traces how these methods were field - tested by CIA agents in Vietnam as part of the Phoenix programme and then imported to Latin America and Asia under the guise of police training .
It is not only apologists for torture who ignore this history when they blame abuses on " a few bad apples " .
A startling number of torture 's most prominent opponents keep telling us that the idea of torturing prisoners first occurred to US officials on September 11 2001 , at which point the methods used in Guantánamo apparently emerged , fully formed , from the sadistic recesses of Dick Cheney 's and Donald Rumsfeld 's brains .
Up until that moment , we are told , America fought its enemies while keeping its humanity intact .
The principal propagator of this narrative ( what Garry Wills termed " original sinlessness " ) is Senator John McCain .
Writing in Newsweek on the need to ban torture , McCain says that when he was a prisoner of war in Hanoi , he held fast to the knowledge " that we were different from our enemies ... that we , if the roles were reversed , would not disgrace ourselves by committing or approving such mistreatment of them " .
It is a stunning historical distortion .
By the time McCain was taken captive , the CIA had launched the Phoenix programme and , as McCoy writes , " its agents were operating 40 interrogation centres in South Vietnam that killed more than 20,000 suspects and tortured thousands more . "
Does it somehow lessen today 's horrors to admit that this is not the first time the US government has used torture , that it has operated secret prisons before , that it has actively supported regimes that tried to erase the left by dropping students out of airplanes ?
That , closer to home , photographs of lynchings were traded and sold as trophies and warnings ?
Many seem to think so .
On November 8 , Democratic Congressman Jim McDermott made the astonishing claim to the House of Representatives that " America has never had a question about its moral integrity , until now " .
Other cultures deal with a legacy of torture by declaring " Never again ! "
Why do so many Americans insist on dealing with the current torture crisis by crying " Never before " ?
I suspect it stems from a sincere desire to convey the seriousness of this administration 's crimes .
And its open embrace of torture is indeed unprecedented .
But let 's be clear about what is unprecedented : not the torture , but the openness .
Past administrations kept their " black ops " secret ; the crimes were sanctioned but they were committed in the shadows , officially denied and condemned .
The Bush administration has broken this deal : post - 9/11 , it demanded the right to torture without shame , legitimised by new definitions and new laws .
Despite all the talk of outsourced torture , the real innovation has been in - sourcing , with prisoners being abused by US citizens in US - run prisons and transported to third countries in US planes .
It is this departure from clandestine etiquette that has so much of the military and intelligence community up in arms : Bush has robbed everyone of plausible deniability .
This shift is of huge significance .
When torture is covertly practised but officially and legally repudiated , there is still hope that if atrocities are exposed , justice could prevail .
When torture is pseudo - legal and those responsible deny that it is torture , what dies is what Hannah Arendt called " the juridical person in man " .
Soon victims no longer bother to search for justice , so sure are they of the futility , and danger , of that quest .
This is a larger mirror of what happens inside the torture chamber , when prisoners are told they can scream all they want because no one can hear them and no one is going to save them .
The terrible irony of the anti-historicism of the torture debate is that in the name of eradicating future abuses , past crimes are being erased from the record .
Since the US has never had truth commissions , the memory of its complicity in far - away crimes has always been fragile .
Now these memories are fading further , and the disappeared are disappearing again .
This casual amnesia does a disservice not only to the victims , but also to the cause of trying to remove torture from the US policy arsenal once and for all .
Already there are signs that the administration will deal with the uproar by returning to plausible deniability .
The McCain amendment protects every " individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States government " ; it says nothing about torture training or buying information from the exploding industry of for - profit interrogators .
And in Iraq the dirty work is already being handed over to Iraqi death squads , trained by the US and supervised by commanders like Jim Steele , who prepared for the job by setting up similar units in El Salvador .
The US role in training and supervising Iraq 's interior ministry was forgotten , moreover , when 173 prisoners were recently discovered in a ministry dungeon , some tortured so badly that their skin was falling off .
" Look , it 's a sovereign country .
The Iraqi government exists , " Rumsfeld said .
He sounded just like the CIA 's William Colby who , asked in a 1971 Congressional probe about the thousands killed under Phoenix , a programme he helped launch , replied that it was now " entirely a South Vietnamese programme " .
As McCoy says , " if you do n't understand the history and the depths of the institutional and public complicity , then you can't begin to undertake meaningful reforms . "
Lawmakers will respond to pressure by eliminating one small piece of the torture apparatus : closing a prison , shutting down a programme , even demanding the resignation of a really bad apple like Rumsfeld .
But he warns , " they will preserve the prerogative to torture . "

Before we get into the reviews of these titanium cookware sets , the following introductory article is a fairly quick and simple rundown on how ceramic and titanium are used in pots and pans and how it stacks up against other ordinary cookware that you might have in your kitchen right now .
Titanium Cookware Sets Reviews
If you feel you are already well educated on this topic , then please feel free to scroll down to the reviews portion below .
Titanium is a fairly amazing material .
It is incredibly powerful and mild , nontoxic , and amazingly cheap to implement into cookware .
But how can this compare to stainless steel , aluminum , or ceramic cookware
** Updated : 01/09/2020 **
Titanium in Cookware – Implementation and Use
Obviously , pots and pans supply a means for you to move heat from the stove into a secure , readily washed cooking surface .
That cookware has to be hardy and sufficient enough to survive constant use and variable heat .
It must also be non-invasive so as to be washed easily , and be completely “ food safe ” .
Additionally , it should regulate heat reasonably well by heating up evenly and quickly .
This helps make sure that material in various areas on your pan ’s or pot ’s surface area cook at precisely the same pace and temperature .
Titanium does not meet every one of these standards by itself .
However , it is powerful and mild , meaning that your Titanium infused pans will last through a very long period of use , and also be simple to take care of .
It is an excellent conductor of heat , but it does not make an especially superior cooking surface alone .
Because of this , you are not likely to find many pans and pots which are created from Titanium exclusively .
Ceramic vs. Titanium : Strength vs. Price ?
Truthfully , the differences of titanium vs. ceramic in cookware is not that large .
Ceramic coating might create a better non-stick , scratch resistant surface , however there are loads of contemporary scratch resistant non-metallic coatings which do n’t utilize ceramic .
Even better , titanium cookware sets do not cost more than equal priced sets with no titanium in them at all , like ceramic cookware .
So why by a ceramic only cook - set when you can get one infused with Titanium for almost the same price ?
Is Titanium Cookware Safe To Use ?
Yes , Titanium cookware is safe to use .
The metal , is just as secure as cookware sets with no titanium contained in their surface material .
After all , a “ Food Safe ” cooking substance like Titanium is scientifically designed to be sterile and non-reactive .
There is a great deal of opinion online concerning the comparative safety of different cooking - material substances .
Both professional chefs and “ home ” chefs , assert that Teflon ( for example ) is dangerous , but some assert you could literally consume chips of Teflon without any ill consequences .
In regards to Titanium , the debate starts to become very , very important , because unlike a substance like Teflon , there is no debate about the safety of Titanium pans .
It is unilaterally believed to be safe .
This metal can be used in pans to reinforce either the outside or the inside surface :
When it is used on the outside : it is hard to argue that it is unsafe on the outside , as it does n’t actually come into contact with your food and it is nontoxic anyhow .
When it is employed as the non-stick coating : a few people may still argue that it is a dangerous cooking surface , but this is not due to the titanium .
On the contrary , it ’s because people are not convinced by producers and government agencies asserting that contemporary non-stick coatings in general are “ food - safe ” .
As for me , I believe newer PFOA complimentary non-sticks are most likely just as secure as the producers state they are .
I am far more worried about how many non-titanium , non -stick coatings , interact with large temperatures , but that is something I can observe myself in my cooking .
Best Titanium Cookware Set Reviews Of 2019 :
Below , we will review the following Titanium Cookware Sets that include Titanium pans and pots .
This review list was updated in 2019 .
Heston Nanobond Titanium Cookware T - fall Titanium Collection Black and Decker ( Titanium Collection ) Scanpan CTQ Nonstick Titanium Skillet
1. Heston Nanobond – Editor ’s # 1 Top Pick
Nanobond ’s molecular titanium cooking surface delivers both exceptional resilience and gleaming brilliance .
Not only is NanoBond 400 % harder than stainless , it ’s 100 % toxin free .
NanoBond also achieves 35 % greater heat conductivity than other aluminum - clad cookware .
NanoBond utilizes remarkable culinary innovation instead of chemicals or coatings .
Thousands of titanium - based Nano layers are bonded directly to stainless steel .
The resulting super dense cooking surface is stain - resistant ; thus ensuring the brilliant titanium luster lasts for generations .
Designed and engineered to provide superior cooking performance and lasting beauty – this exclusive NanoBond is far superior to any stainless steel cookware available today .
How is NanoBond Titanium Cookware Created ?
NanoBond is created inside a high - heat vacuum chamber using a blend of Titanium and chromium - based alloys .
The metal alloys are vaporized , then bonded to the stainless steel .
This patented process is chemical - free , environmentally - friendly and truly revolutionary in the cookware market .
Cooking with Nanobond Titanium Technology :
America ’s most acclaimed chefs rely on the exceptional performance and resilience of NanoBond in their restaurants .
Now you can , too .
To achieve chef - level results , always start by pre-heating the pan and adding a little butter or oil .
This not only prevents sticking , it ’s crucial for proper browning , crisping , searing and enhancing flavors .
Chef Matt Bolus demonstrates how to cook perfectly crispy skin fish using NanoBond Titanium Cookware .
Easy Cleanup :
It ’s easy to keep your NanoBond shining as if it were new for years to come .
NanoBond is dishwasher safe , but we recommend hand - washing with warm soapy water and the use of a Scotch - Brite pad .
Thanks to NanoBond ’s flush rivets and sealed rims , there are no crevices to trap food .
Feel free to use steel wool on extra stubborn food residue .
Although steel wool will ruin typical stainless cookware , NanoBond ’s molecular titanium surface is incredibly scratch resistant !
After cooking certain foods , you may notice a slight bluing of the pan .
This is a food film that the molecular titanium prevented from penetrating the pan .
It is easily removed with Hestan cleaning solution or any soft cleanser .
2. T - Fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Titanium Nonstick Set ( Titanium Interior )
This T - Fal collection is also popular , and it ’s simple to see why .
It has got plenty of helpful features that allow it to contend with the best non-invasive cookware , however the Heston set is still far superior .
To be clear however the T - Fal cookware collection is not primarily made from titanium .
Each pan & pot within this T - fal collection is constructed from hard anodized aluminum .
The titanium comes into play at the innovative non-stick coating which outlines the cooking surface of every piece .
Titanium helps create a remarkably hard , slippery surface which allows your meals slide around easily within these pans .
The distinct titanium - infused non-invasive process used within this collection will have a longer working life compared to a few other non-invasive coats , which means that you can take advantage of this set for a long time before you must replace it .
It is metal utensil and dishwasher safe , and that means you ’re able to use a metal spatula and wash this collection with unbelievable ease .
In regards to cooking functionality , this set is really wonderful .
It is not likely to warm up or cool off as quickly as a copper cookware set , needless to say , however , the tough anodized aluminum remains excellent when it has to do with heat supply .
The pots and pans are pretty mild , along with its silicone grips can be used with no warmth protection .
More on the Thenon - Stick Surface : Titanium Cookware Revamped ?
Thenon - stick coat on those pots and pans plays wonderfully .
Additionally , it appears to be lasting , even though the true lifespan on your kitchen will be dependent on how you utilize it .
There are two valid drawbacks related to this collection .
If you intend to use a fancy induction stove , you ’ll absolutely need to acquire a different cookware collection .
It is also only dishwasher safe to 400 degrees .
This is probably a result of the silicone grips .
You most likely do n’t wish to throw away your pots and pans from the oven frequently , but that does restrict your capacity to sear meat then throw it under the broiler .
I realized that steamer inserts are a remarkably helpful tool to get for cooking many different dishes that are common .
It may be a bit of a pain to locate one which is suitable for your requirements , so the addition of the tool for this cookware collection is a welcome bit .
It is not a massive deal , clearly , but it may help you opt for this cookware collection above a comparably priced option .
This T - Fal Titanium collection set comes in many different sizes
The 17 - piece collection includes the following pieces :
8 ″ skillet
10.25 ″ skillet
11.5 ″ skillet with fitting lid
10.25 ″ square griddle
1 - quart tsp with fitting lid
2 - quart tsp with fitting lid
3 - quart tsp with fitting lid
3.5 - quart deep skillet
5 - quart dutch oven with fitting lid
3 - quart steamer add
A Single Egg Magic
3. Black & Decker 83355 Titanium Nonstick Interior Cookware :
In general , this ceramic cookware collection offers a great deal , particularly given the fair price .
It has got an excellent heat resistance , the non-invasive coating is superbly well designed , and the pieces have been covered by a lifetime guarantee .
I believe that it ’s most likely the ideal ceramic cookware collection available at the moment other than the Heston Set .
This collection is really similar to this T - Fal set above in many ways .
It is made from similar stuff ( aluminum center using a contemporary ceramic non-stick ) , it has got glass gloves and rubberized grips though , but it provides pretty amazing heat consistency for its ’ price point .
This Black and Decker collection is n’t dishwasher safe which sucks , but this unique collection can be found in three distinct colors which is great .
They are all fairly muted color schemes ( you still have a choice between aluminum , granite , and slate ) , however it ’s wonderful to have a choice in regards to your own cookware color .
Nevertheless , it is not without drawbacks :
To begin with , ( and most problematically ) , Black +
Decker does not supply an oven safe version of this set .
It is very likely this cookware set is dishwasher safe though for about the exact same 400 F in comparison to the T - Fal collection , but that I can not tell for certain .
This usually means that you should be particularly attentive once you cook to observe over - heating .
You need to avoid using this collection in the oven when at all possible .
Secondly , this collection includes two silicone utensils in the box .
This could be favorable if those were “ additional ” pieces .
Rather , they are a part of that “ 14 pieces ” when Black Decker states ” 14 - piece set ” .
To put it differently , you are getting 7 pans and pots , 5 lids / covers , and 2 utensils within this particular collection .
Make sure you keep the quality and consistency in mind instead of only the amount of “ included pieces ” when you compare these collections .
Black & Decker asserts that this collection includes special ergonomic grips .
In training , I think that it ’s fairly unlikely you ’ll observe a difference between those and some “ average ” rubber grips .
This is not a terrible thing , particularly since the grips on those ceramic pans remain safe to touch even after “ high heat ” cooking for extended periods of time .
Your purchase of this collection is shielded with a limited lifetime guarantee , the same as the T - Fal set .
It is unclear how long the working lifetime of the cookware set will likely be in your own kitchen , but it is certainly assuring to understand Black +
Decker stands behind their workmanship and will replace a faulty piece , a few weeks or even months later on .
The 14 - piece group comprises :
In general , this collection makes a superb choice overall .
It is a fantastic alternative if it is available .
If you favor the Black +
Decker to the T - Fal , or you just like the aesthetics of the set the collection can be found in three colors , which makes it a lot simpler to fit a new piece into your current cookware collection , or match the decoration of your kitchen .
4. Scanpan CTQ Nonstick Skillet
Despite being a fairly considerable skillet for its price , this non-traditional aluminum pan handles extremely well in any kitchen .
It ’s induction compatible , oven safe to 500 F , and totally dishwasher and metal utensil safe .
On top of that , the non -stick coating is a distinctive ceramic / titanium mix that boasts exceptional cooking attributes and also a surprising level of scratch resistance .
This particular pan permits you to create yummy pan-made sauces once you are finished cooking your meats .
All you have to do is put in a little bit of wine ( or a different liquid if you prefer ) and include any extra flavorings you would like your sauce to get , and since it is no -stick , you do n’t have to worry about it burning on !
All in all , the way that this pan manages while you cook is fairly impressive .
It has got outstanding heat compatibility , the non-stick internal surface is more than powerful enough , and it has got just the ideal amount of weight to make it seem strong to the grip .
The grip around the pan is constructed from metal unfortunately , therefore it will get a little hot after the pan continues to be around the warmth of the stovetop , but that can be fixed pretty easily using a potholder .
If you are a more experienced or professional cook and you desire a titanium skillet , this saucepan is certainly an amazing choice .
The simple fact that it is oven and dishwasher safe makes it a very excellent selection for practically any kitchen .
Closing Thoughts On Our Titanium Cookware Reviews :
No matter your choice you will be extremely happy that you switched over to Titanium cookware .
It will make cooking more enjoyable , and cleanup an absolute breeze !
I would say however , that hands down my top pick would be the Heston Nano Bond set .
I hope you have enjoyed this article and please like or share it on social media !
It would help me out , and would be so appreciated !
Thanks !
Introducing Django 0.95
We 're pleased to introduce Django release 0.95 , a formal packaging of all of the significant advances in Django development since the 0.91 release in January 2006 .
This is the sexiest version of Django ever .
It would take another six months to list all of the improvements , feature additions and bug fixes we 've put into this release , but the release notes document attempts to list the big changes .
The overall theme is : Slicker , faster , easier , better .
Notably , this release includes the " magic - removal " changes that were made to Django 's development ( " trunk " ) version a few months ago .
If you 're upgrading from Django 0.91 to 0.95 , you 'll need to make some changes to your code , because several APIs have changed .
See the RemovingTheMagic wiki page for full instructions , and feel free to ask questions on the django - users mailing list ; if you have a problem , chances are somebody else has had it and solved it .
With those API changes in mind , we 've written a new document , API stability , that explains which APIs should be considered stable and which ones will likely change before 1.0 .
The good news is that most ( 80 percent ? ) of Django 's APIs are set in stone at this point .
Once we get to version 1.0 , of course , all APIs will be stable .
Also forthcoming is a roadmap to Django 's next version , 0.96 , which we 're hoping to churn out sooner rather than later .
It 'll incorporate some improvements to model subclassing and validation - aware models , along with other features .
Look for that roadmap in the next few days .
Thanks , as always , to the dozens of Django contributors around the world .
We try ( but inevitably fail ) to list everybody in the AUTHORS file .
So , what are you waiting for ?
Download it , and let us know what you think !

You can out - spend or out - teach
Imagine you 're trying to launch a new software product , book , web service , church , small business , social cause , consulting practice , school , podcast channel , rock band , whatever .
The most important skill you need today is not fund - raising , financial management , or marketing .
It 's not knowledge management , IT , or human resources .
It 's not product design , usability , or just - in - time inventory .
The most important skill today is ... teaching .
Whatever it is you 're launching is probably not in short supply , and there 's always someone who 's doing it better , faster , and cheaper ( or will be within weeks ) .
Most of us authors , non-profit evangelists , indie software developers , small start - ups ( the soon - to - be Fortune 5,000,000 ) can barely afford broadband let alone a " marketing / ad campaign " .
We can't hire a publicist .
We are n't going to be on Oprah .
But you 're not interested in using deception and bulls *** to manipulate someone into buying a product , membership , or idea that you do n't believe in yourself .
And that 's your big advantage over even the biggest and best - funded competitors : your belief .
Because what you believe in , you can teach .
And teaching is the " killer app " for a newer , more ethical approach to marketing .
While in the past , those who out - spent ( on ads , and big promotions ) would often win , that 's becoming less and less true today for a lot of things -- especially the things designed for a younger , more - likely - to - be - online user community .
Kind of a markets - are - classrooms notion .
Those who teach stand the best chance of getting people to become passionate .
And those with the most passionate users do n't need an ad campaign when they 've got user evangelists doing what evangelists do ... talking about their passion .
But passion requires real learning .
Nobody is passionate about skiing on their first day .
Nobody is passionate about programming in Java on their first day .
Or week .
It 's virtually impossible to become passionate about something until you 're somewhere up the skill / knowledge curve , where there are challenges that you believe are worth it , and that you perceive you can do .
Nobody becomes passionate until they 've reached the stage where they want to grow in a way they deem meaningful .
Whether it 's getting better at a game or helping to save the world , there must be a goal ( ideally , a continuously progressive goal ) and a clear path to getting there .
It 's our job , if we 're trying to encourage others to become passionate , to enable it .
And the only way to do that is by teaching .
I 've talked about all this before , but I wanted to consolidate the links and the " story " in one place :
1 ) The importance of learning / teaching your users :
Upgrade your users , not just your product
Kicking ass is more fun
( The better your users are at something , the more likely they are to become passionate . )
What software can learn from kung fu
( the Next Level is extremely motivating )
2 ) Teaching techniques :
Crafting a User Experience
( It 's all about flow ... balancing challenge and skill )
Keeping users engaged
Learning does n't happen in the middle
( Have lots of beginnings and endings )
Just - in - time vs. just - in - case learning
( If you do n't provide the " why " , they may not listen to the " what " and " how " )
Is your message memorable ? "
( You have to get past the brain 's crap filter )
Getting what you expect is boring .
( The " oh shit / oh cool " technique )
The users 's journey
( take your user on a modified hero 's journey )
The case for easter eggs ( and other clever user treats )
( let the user discover " surprises " )
Many of us would be better off if we ditched our marketing budget ( hah ! like we have one ... ) and put it all toward something that helps the user kick ass , have more fun , and want to learn more .
And to be honest with myself here , part of the point is that people who want to learn more are more likely to want more of your tools , services , community , and " tribe / pride items " around whatever it is they 're learning .
( So make sure you and your wake can support that . )
There 's no way I can ski as well on my $ 100 skis as I can on my $ 600 skis .
That 's a fact , not a marketing manipulation or my imagination .
That I would n't have known the difference ( or needed the difference ) had I not learned to ski better is an important point , but even if the ski maker had been responsible for teaching me to improve to the point where I needed their more expensive skis , it makes me happy to ski better .
I 'm grateful that I 've improved enough to benefit from better skis ( and thankful I was able to get them ) .
To use the lamest cliche -- it really is a win / win .
I can process graphics and video much more quickly on my iMac G5 than I could on my old iBook G4 .
Thanks to Nikon 's free online training , I now can take much more interesting photgraphs with my Nikon 5700 than I could with my old point - and - shoot digital Nikon .
Nikon taught me to appreciate aperture control , something the clueless recreational snapshot taker I was before would n't have wanted and would n't have paid for until Nikon gave me a reason .
It 's not a b.s. reason .
It 's not a fluffy " coolness " reason .
It 's about me taking better pictures -- something I do n't need , but really really enjoy .
( And no , it certainly did n't hurt Nikon either ; )
I 'll say it again -- if you 're marketing - through - teaching , and helping your users kick ass , and in the process teaching them to appreciate your higher - end products or services , this is not a bad thing .
I do respect that old - school marketing has done plenty of evil and horrifically damaging things to people and communities ( even whole countries ) .
But we are not those who pushed products without a conscience .
We will be mindful , and we will not promote that which we do n't believe in .
This is about creating passionate users , and that can happen only if we help our users learn and grow and spend more time in flow .
These moments of flow you can help enable are some of the happiest moments in a person 's life .
And yes , this applies not just to hobbies and games and sports but even to work .
After all , a big part of the success and passion around Getting Things Done , 43 folders , and 37 Signals software is about people being in flow ... just getting their daily work done .
So , who can you help find flow today ?
[ Footnote : I 'm leaving for the Parelli conference tomorrow morning , and internet access will be very limited ( it 's basically a cowboy ranch ) .
I wo n't be back until Tuesday night , so if there are n't any more posts until next week , that 's why .
Matt Galloway and Shaded , you 're in charge of comments while I 'm gone ( I 'll make it up to you , I promise ; )
No food fights . ]
[ Update : gulliver left a wonderful , important comment for this post , and as a result I added a few more links into this post .

With the wealth of really good stuff hidden ( ? ) in the links of your entry , it 's perhaps better suited to a minibook than a blog post .
I 'm saving it all for a re-read offline .
Only slightly churlishly ( and entirely constructively ) I have - well , I do n't really ... just could n't resist the opportunity - to take slight issue with the line about ' teaching ' - even when more softly expressed as ' creating passionate users ... can happen only if we help our users learn ' .
At risk of over - simplifying things - we simply need to engage them .
To get their genuine attention .
Quoting the eminently sensible John Peterman - ' People want things that are hard to find .
Things that have romance , but a factual romance , about them ' .
My chosen method is more gonzo - ' let 's make it a [ expletive deleted ] adventure ' .
Is language like ' a voyage of exploration and discovery ' suited to commercial relationships ?
Dunno .
Your call .
My ship left harbor eons ago .
The better vendor / client relationships are * exactly * that - a relationship .
Most instances of the sale process are n't - they 're just ' hits ' ... brief encounters of no greater durability than the morning mist .
Rather than a pleasurable collaboration , they 're often an arduous - and sometimes tortuous - process .
To me , and I suspect others ( certainly Tom Peters who wrote the book from whence I swiped this bit ) , ' good collaboration is like romance - it can't be routine and predictable ' .
Any hint of ' process ' and ' procedure ' is the kiss - of - death .
It has to be openly authentic - entirely genuine ...
' I 'm me , you 're you - let 's dance ' .
Perhaps paraphrasing unfairly , I suggest Godin - et - al get it wrong when talking of ' telling a story ' .
Sure , amid the permadross which is much of marketing , that 'll gain immediate ground - but the foreign land which is ' enhanced sustainability ' demands an entirely different currency ... truth .
Open . Honest .
Authenticity .
' Turn up .
Tell the truth .
Smile .'
I 'm suggesting relationships be founded upon a genuine personal connection - at least as best as can be achieved in the confines of one person trying to sell something to another .
This is not a ' doorstep deal with the Avon lady ' scenario .
Why not fewer and deeper commercial associations than the usual weak , mediocre , superficial and compromised dross that so many accept ?
If that seems unfairly harsh , I urge you to think again ... and consider just how many associations end in grief - perhaps not having been that good to begin with .
This implication here is ' special ' .
And I want ' special ' .
How 's about you ?
The prize for those whose language is ' teach and learn ' is the buyer 's mind .
My quest is more complex - and extends beyond the old ' heartstrings pull pursestrings ' adage ... simply , I want your soul .
' Often have I wondered how deep the visitor has looked ; how carefully have they listened ?
Did anyone catch that ?
Do I but amuse myself ?'... is , in an age in which ' we 're all too busy ' , something which probably applies to us all ... how best to present ourselves in an honest accurate manner and foster mutally beneficial collaboratation with those who ' are n't too busy ' ?
Sadly , the one - line statement - of - benefit which opens nigh every damn commercial site seems to be held in great esteem .
Sadly ?
Sure - and wrongly .
Whilst an absolute boon to snaring those ' super busy perpetua - motion got - a - meeting - at - eleven ' types , it misses many - notably those who ' demand ' a more spohisticated process in which they 're allowed / encouraged / enabled / assisted to discover at their own pace .
Harking back to the days before we all ventured online , the real - world parallel is the salesperson who immediately leaps upon those venturing into their auto lot / clothes store .
Please , lay out your offer and allow me to wander .
To roam .
Trust me to choose wisely .
And not .
Please be aware that , if I ' do n't bother ' to take time and make effort to ' receive the message ' , then we were n't really suited anyway .
Sure , we may have shared a toothbrush in the morn - but we'd never have stuck it out to the point of choosing bedlinen and gifts for the children .
In trying to circumvent the ' exploration process '- that path upon which ' know more ' often ( naturally and ultimately beneficially ) becomes ' no more ' - we use a plethora of gambits / tactics ... ' tricks ' to nudge the prospect our way and succumb to the cold kiss of commerce ' you 've got product ' message and ' buy ! ' impulse as our skeletal hand reaches round and removes the visa card from their back pocket .
Pity .
We could have had a great time together .
Instead , you tried to sell me something .
Personally entirely disinterested in deals where someone has to be persuaded , convinced and sold ... why can't we ' the menu here is wholly different ' allow things to be less contrived and more natural .
This , I posit , is entirely in accord with ' you 're not interested in using deception and bulls *** to manipulate someone into buying a product , membership , or idea that you do n't believe in yourself ' .
So ... ' teach '... ' learn ' ...? maybe .
How 's about ' discover ' ?
Posted by : gulliver | Sep 8 , 2005 3:01:18 AM
Gulliver : wow , what a fabulous comment and a ton to think about it and do .
I 'm running out the door for my trip , but you did motivate me to at least stick a few more links in the post to things that address " surprise " , " discovery " and " the user 's journey " .
I hope to talk about this more with you when I return .
Thanks so much !
FYI : elearnspace makes a key point in their trackback that it should be " learning " , not " teaching " , and I think that 's right .
I was ( mistakenly ) associating teaching with learning , and that 's not always the case .
So you 'll have to do a mental search and replace that when I say " we must out - teach " , the long version of that is really " we must do whatever it takes to help our users ' learn ' " .
I hope I 've made the exact point over and over in other posts on this blog , but sometimes I use a shorthand to make something concise .
When I say teach , I mean teach in a way that causes learning .
You have to read the whole entry to make sense of it , and I 'm hoping " elearnspace " wo n't take the headline completely out of context ... and appreciate that I mean exactly what they 're saying -- it 's about learning .
But " enabling learning " is more , well , unwieldy .
So I 'm not sure that substituting the word " teaching " is such a bad thing if we take the time to back it up .

I do n't know if this theory really clicks for me .
Is Apple successful because they taught ??
Maybe they could point to their theater workshops .
What about Mark Ecko and his successful products - where 's the teaching there ?
Or a craze like Designer Toys .
I hear what you 're saying but I don;t think it 's ONLY the most important thing .

Posted by : RMT | Sep 8 , 2005 1:17:19 PM
Hi Kathy ,
I 'm a passionate and regular reader of your blog .
With your last update , I 've come to the conclusion that it 's really time that you bring all this intelligent stuff in a book that I will be so happy to read .
I 'm living in France near Geneva , Switzerland .
If you have the opportunity to give a conference here please let us know .
Best regards , Lionel
Posted by : Lionel | Sep 8 , 2005 1:30:44 PM
Wow , what a great post and an equally interesting response from gulliver .
I do n't recall one more sesquipedalian .
First off , some house keeping – gulliver & lionel , you both mentioned a book and it's my understanding that this blog has been Kathy 's Creating Passionate Users book prototype so we 're all anxiously awaiting this in book form .
But no word yet on when we can expect it as far as I know .
Although , I do n't recall a post where Kathy has organized previous posts to support a larger concept on this scale .
I can just see the mind map developing on the white board .
I 'm taking this as a sign - we might be getting close .
I 've read and reread gulliver 's comments .
I even went to his web site – which is equally opaque .
To be honest , I 'm not sure I get him but at the same time I really , really want to .
To me this is almost as interesting as his comments or Kathy 's original post .
I keep thinking about Kathy 's " next level " and the idea of helping users get to where they want to be .
In this regard , gulliver 's language suggests that he does n't want people to get to the next ( his ? ) level - instead he seems to wants to elevate himself above the crowd by using language that is difficult for average folks to digest .
Well , at least difficult for me to digest .
Do n't get me wrong – I was rivoted by his commentary , enchanted with his vocabulary , it was almost like reading Shakespeare – which , in my opinion , is really , really hard .
Okay gulliver , I get it , you are really , really smart – now what are you trying to say ?
( I too could n't resist and mean this entirely constructively . )
( As best I can tell )
One of gulliver 's main themes is that the notion that interactions designed to stimulate real learning are capable of catalyzing passion is valid , however , it is but a small subset of the general goal which is engagement – to get genuine attention .
Furthermore , ( and more generally ) any specific strategies , tactics , gambits designed to inspire passion are by their very nature insincere as they are transparently fueled by the ultimate goal of closing deals – and , by extension , are implicitly not fueled by the desire to help customers kick ass .
Back to square one , you 're still a marketing jackass .
gulliver 's alternative ( if I read correctly ) is to build a genuine , deep , personal , less contrived and more natural individual connection with each and every customer sans strategy or gambit , pretense or forethought ... presumably to close the deal .
Am I the only one that does n't see a difference here ?
As I see it , we have a Catch - 22 here beyond the Rubicon .
" What Rubicon ? " you ask .
The one we crossed when we decided we wanted to provide a product , idea , service , whatever to someone else .
Transactions do n't exist in a vacuum .
We typically think of the vendor - client relationship as a downward flow , but it ain't – it's bidirectional and ( should be ) symbiotic .
The client / customer / user has an agenda too – they want , need or desire something .
Take our relationship with Kathy for example – she wants to spread ( and validate ? ) her brilliant ideas about passion , we want to drink them up – to learn , to be part of the community , to validate our own ideas .
But in addition to that Kathy wants to sell books ( to pay for skateboards , iPods , Vokyll skis , Icelandic horses , and her daughter 's non-college vegetarian education ) , we want to figure out how to inspire passion ... presumably to close more deals ... so we can each meet our personal and professional goals .
True altruism is a myth .
This is the Catch - 22 - in order to help others we must ensure our own needs are met .
Ah there 's the rub – whether ' tis nobler in the heart to suffer the slings and arrows of miserable product failure or to take arms against a sea of gulliver 's rhetoric and by opposing , successfully market a product , service , idea that we believe will truly help people kick ass .
Not quite perfect iamb , but poetic nonetheless .
Hmmmm .
Enough with the contrarian folderol – gulliver makes some cogent points .
Namely , the bit about " enhanced sustainability " demanding truth - Open. Honest .
Authenticity .
This bit , of course , is dead on .
My take is that there is a growing wave of authenticity in the world and it is changing everything .
There is lots to explore here , but the part that is relevant to this conversation is that authenticity is the difference between legitimately inspiring passion and evil subversive marketing .
As Kathy wrote a while back – everyone is a marketer .
The question is motive – is it selfish or symbiotic .
If the answer is symbiotic , passion will ensue .
No matter the method – learning , teaching , engaging , discovering – whatever .
Even the dreaded storytelling of Godin lore can be used for the forces of good .
If you want to talk authenticity , let 's focus on motive - not methodology .
Mr. gulliver , I really enjoyed your thoughts and ideas .
I hope you take my entirely constructive comments in the spirit in which they are intended .
Both you and Kathy challenged me today and you helped me kick ass .
Well done .
Oh , BTW Mr. gulliver – your domain name is set to expire in 9 days .
This has been really fun – although I 'm fairly certain Kathy will never invite me back .

Piers ,
I talk with lots of folks about the whole Passionate User thing and somebody always throws out negative examples – how do you create passionate toothpaste users ?
While I 'm sure everybody that reads Kathy could think of some ways to try to create passionate toothpaste users , the reality is that nobody 's ever really going to try .
I think that companies have a choice – do I want to go for the whole passionate user thing or just do I want do something else .
There 's lots of something elses .
Some will even work – with some metrics better than the passion route .
That said , I 'm not sure the designer toy industry is after Passion in the Kathy Sierra sense .
I think Apple ' teaches ' in the sense that they lower the barriers to getting to the next level .
They are particularly good at doing this from ground zero .
The iPod was actually kind of late to the portable MP3 player game – now they have 75 % of the market .
Why ?
Partially because they taught us ( the general public ) how to download and manage music easily .
Through their silhouette ad campaign they taught us that digital music is easy , fun and relevant .
By working really hard on the human - machine interface they make the experience intuitive – this too is teaching .
This is the thing with Apple – they are so good at this we take it for granted .
If Rio , iRiver , Creative Labs or Sony did more teaching and less featuritis marketing , I suspect things would be different .
BTW , I love PSFK – you kids rock .

This brings to mind one of my own personal hot , hot , hot button issues .
The corollary of " what you believe in , you can teach " is that our teachers should believe in their subjects .
By this I 'm talking about our school teachers .
The ones we send our kids off to everyday .
Passionate belief in your subject is the MOST IMPORTANT quality for a teacher .
Think of all the great teachers you ever had in school .
Each one had their own style , unique to them .
Some may have been disciplined and formal , some wildly creative and unpredictable .
But they really cared about science , latin , english , whatever is what they were teaching you .
This is why the last decade or so of educational reform politics is so utterly frustrating to me .
The straight jacket of high - stakes standardized testing that is being imposed across the country .
It is insanity .
It threatens Americas greatest cultural advantage -- our creativity , our passion .
By the way , when is " Head First 9th Grade Biology " coming out ?
My daughter needs it ...

Lovely thoughts .
Yes , products can be replicated , ideas can be stolen ( or bought ! ! ) , speed - to - market can take the thunder out of marketing campaigns but the most rare commodity is passionate users .
Software companies have learnt this art quite well !
1. Microsoft has Microsoft Certified Professionals !
A course taught and evangelized by Microsoft .
2. Novell has certified Network engineers !
3. Oracle has certified DBAs
No wonder , there are monopolies and open software networks .
Linux is again a great example of how passionate users continually upgrade the product !
Finally , employees also have to be taught .
Selling a product passionately is one thing but executing it with same vigor is difficult .
Only passion can drive consistent behaviour across any organization .
Posted by : Sivaraman Swaminathan | Sep 11 , 2005 10:44:43 AM
Charlie - interesting point .
I do n't think passion is absolutely neccessary for a teacher to be competent , but I do think it helps .
Furthermore , I do think passion is required for teachers to be truely remarkable , inspirational and life changing .
An intersting aside kind of along these lines - I 'm currently in the market for a new car .
I 'm looking at lots of options ( I tend to get obsessive about purchases like this ) .
I looked at lots of websites .
Volkswagon has a particularly good website that has some great examples of passion building - community stuff , VW clothing , informal writing style - and learning .
They have some cool animated videos that show the difference between gas and disel engines .
I spent about 2 hours on the site and was excited about test driving a particular car - a Jetta Wagon disel .
After all - Drivers Wanted !
After wallowing in this post , I have been on the lookout for examples of teaching as marketing and the VW site is really excellent .
Then , I went to the only VW dealership in my area .
The salesperson I spoke with was rude , uninspiring , disinterested and summarily dismished what I told him I had seen on the VW website 20 minutes earlier as being wrong .
Because of that experience , I am no longer considering VW .
( I 'm getting a Scion xB - and I 'm well on my way to being passionate about them , but that 's a different post . )
The point is , VW did everything right to inspire passion for 99.9 % of the process - but the sales guy - the last .1 % - was an ass , the polar opposite of passionate and not surprisingly , I 'm buying a competitor 's product .
If you are looking for a low cost , reliable , fuel efficient and uber - cool ride - check out the Scion line .

At risk of being seen to hog the posting space , in the ' serial killers often revisit the scene of the crime ' tradition I want to clear a couple potential misunderstandings with Matt .
And , if the initial post seemed overlong and confused , this 'll likely be moreso .
If someone 'll sit down and help write ' zen and the art of marketing ' perhaps we can cover this in a manner which does good and pays the rent .
' til then though , more unpaid blog input ...
> gulliver 's language suggests that he does n't want people to get to the next ( his ? ) level - instead he seems to wants to elevate himself above the crowd by using language that is difficult for average folks to digest .
' More Hank Miller than WSJ ' , my ' too much Kerouac and not enough Drucker ' is something which I hope makes things easier to grasp .
A simple guy ' yearning for the good old days ' , I do n't understand much of the marketingese that 's thrown around so casually .
Sometimes , as Dylan might have said , ' You just have to sing the song rather than analyze the lyrics ' .
The point here is simply :
I do n't actually think there is a next level - just a single plane we all share and upon which EVERYTHING is played out .
I 'll borrow from Carl Sagan - speaking on the view of earth from 3.7 billion miles away as a pale blue dot :
-----------
Look again at that dot .
That 's here .
That 's home , That 's us .
On it everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you ever heard of , every human being who ever was , lived out their lives .
The aggregate of our joy and suffering , thousands of confident religions , ideologies , and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every ' superstar , ' every ' supreme leader , ' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam .
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another , and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we 've ever known .
-----------
On a much much much less grandiose scale ... we have ' marketing ' - and its parent , ' commerce ' .
( The founding father ' enterprise ' has long since left the building in disgust at the untoward antics of its offspring . )
It 's in ' differentiating ourselves ' that the problems arise .
So , an enthusisatic ' yay ' to those who rightly see it as ' we 're all in this together ' and a resounding ' nay ' to the others who see it as a ' them and us ' game of gambit and manoeuver toward ' competitive advantage ' .
Simply , we 're all ' the crowd ' - so let 's please switch the pseudo perspective of the eagle for the viewpoint of the frog and ' get in there together ' .
Or , put another way - ' I have stuff you may wanna buy - please take a look and let me know ; either way it 's ok ' .
Movin ' on ...
> gulliver 's alternative ( if I read correctly ) is to build a genuine , deep , personal , less contrived and more natural individual connection with each and every customer sans strategy or gambit , pretense or forethought ... presumably to close the deal .
Phew !
My cigar collection remains intact ... M , you 're right - up to the word ' customer ' .
Simply , I just want to build a genuine , deep , personal , less contrived and more natural individual connection with each and everyONE - unless they 're total frickin ' idiots in which case let 's nuke the f****** now .
To me , and I suspect at least a few others , marketing / commerce should be natural parts of our lives .
Not ' extensions of ' and certainly not ' just something we do monday through friday , 9 - 5 ' .
If this is a little - or a lot - too much ' grow an organic beard and recycle your own sandals ' oregon - commune philosophy then ... well , life 's like this sometimes .
The prevalent ' Dude , where 's my deal ? ' mentality will be the undoing of us all .
As long as someone 's trying to sell something to the other one there 'll always be unease and impediments to the natural flow ( rather than forced encounter ) which should be commerce .
' Folk 'll ultimately do what they want anyway ...' why should we even try to influence their decision making ?
Lay out your stall , grab their attention and then stand back .
If your stuff 's good , enough will buy and you 'll get to pass ' go ' and collect the $ 200 enough times to cover rent and put the kids through college .
And , if it 's not , then ' play your funky music elsewhere ' get out of the market .
Seriously , the parallel here is the archer - who can do little about the arrow after it 's left the bow .
' Go to archery class , buy good equipment , be aware of the wind , select target '... our focus should be on getting the presentation correct - and not the aforementioned ' gambit and manoeuver toward competitive advantage ' tango in which we all indulge .
Bluntly : ' Do your stuff - well .
Forget the deal .
if you ' win ' so be it .
Should you ' lose ' so be it . '
M , you 're absolutely right on ' vendor - client relationship ...( should be ) symbiotic ' .
And entirely wrong on ' True altruism is a myth - in order to help others we must ensure our own needs are met . '
We could simply help others regardless of the cost / benefit to ourselves .
Symbiosis should occur naturally - and if it does n't it can not be co-erced or forced . '
Entirely practically ... we can focus on meeting our own needs - that 's commerce .
And concentrate on ' help others ' - that 's charity / whatever .
Or , big ' or ' ... we can detach from the outcome in a genuine ' I 've done my stuff well so if they buy then fine and if they do n't that 's fine too ' and in so doing we aid ( read : not impede ) the process .
The move toward ' authenticity ' is excellent .
Long overdue .
That said , too much of it is in the vein of ' meet the new boss , same as the old boss ' ... a thinly - veiled and lacking - heart and substance ploy .
And that , is the root of my ' work ' .
The target .
Simply , let 's be real - and natural .
Whatever that is and wherever they may lead .
So then , see ya on the other side ...
Oh yeah - almost forgot ...
> Mr. gulliver , I really enjoyed your thoughts and ideas .

Thanks , M. They 're received well .
And , ' semantics again ' ... I struggle with ' kick ass ' .
Seems an unnecessarily ' imply superiority ' belligerent term - smacks of ballgame coaches and drill sergeants .
But perhaps that 's just me in my ' favor hoedown to showdown - rather shake you by the hand than throat ' approach in which we all genuinely ' live together as brothers or perish together as fools ' .
Y'see , in the end , it was n't ' them or us ' - it is ' you and I ' .

Thanks gulliver .
Sorry about the gender thing - I had assumed that you were male - simply because it 's statistically more likely .
Incidentally , I had originally thought you were arrogant , now I find you interesting .
Funny how perceptions change .
All of your points are well made and , for the record , I truly enjoy reading you .
I stand by my ' altruism is a myth ' assertion though .
We do nothing in a vacuum and all actions are necessarily motivated by self interest - even if that interest is martyrdom .
In the end the sacrifice is for something in which the martyr believes .
We are charitable because it makes us feel good to reduce the suffering of others , to believe that our effort can make a difference or to relieve guilt .
There 's nothing wrong with this , it 's just the way it is .
I think the difference is the societal perception of the value of the transaction .
Money , happiness , attention , self - worth , and chickens are all currency .
In this regard , ' altruism ' happens when half of the transaction is paid with currency which may not be perceptible to anyone but the recipient .
This does n't , however , make it any less noble .
Gulliver thanks again for a very enjoyable and thought provoking exchange .
Kathy , sorry for running amok .
If you squint hard enough , I 'm sure this somehow relates to learning or whatever we were talking about .

“ What we ’ve got is a failure in society , whether it ’s in Mount Pleasant with yuppie parents or whether it ’s on the East Side with poor crackhead parents , ” Shirley said Friday .
“ We pick up stray animals and spay them .
These mothers need to be spayed if they ca n’t take care of theirs . …
Once they have a child and it ’s running the streets , to let them continue to have children is totally unacceptable . ”

Blue Security was an Israeli company that fought spam with spam :
Eran Reshef had an idea in the battle against spam e-mail that seemed to be working : he fought spam with spam .
Today , he ’ll give up the fight .
Reshef ’s Silicon Valley company , Blue Security Inc. , simply asked the spammers to stop sending junk e-mail to his clients .
But because those sort of requests tend to be ignored , Blue Security took them to a new level : it bombarded the spammers with requests from all 522,000 of its customers at the same time .
That led to a flood of Internet traffic so heavy that it disrupted the spammers ’ ability to send e-mails to other victims — a crippling effect that caused a handful of known spammers to comply with the requests .
Then , earlier this month , a Russia - based spammer counterattacked , Reshef said .
Using tens of thousands of hijacked computers , the spammer flooded Blue Security with so much Internet traffic that it blocked legitimate visitors from going to Bluesecurity.com , as well as to other Web sites .
The spammer also sent another message : Cease operations or Blue Security customers will soon find themselves targeted with virus - filled attacks .

It 's about the size of Australia and has been studied from afar for years .
Nowscientists are getting a better look with NASA 's Cassini spacecraft .
Radar is bouncedoff the surface to generate an image that cannot be made using visible - lightobservations because the orbiting spacecraft can't see through the moon 's thickatmosphere .
The observations reveal mountains about as highas the Appalachians .
" Surprisingly , this cold , faraway regionhas geological features remarkably like Earth , " said Jonathan Lunine , aCassini researcher at the University of Arizona .
The river channels are likely carved by liquidmethane or ethane , as the moon is too cold for water to be liquid .
" Although Titan gets far less sunlight and ismuch smaller and colder than Earth , Xanadu is no longer just a mere brightspot , but a land where rivers flow down to a sunless sea , " Lunine said .
Liquid methane might fall as rain or tricklefrom springs to create the rivers , Lunine and his colleagues figure .
Perhapsthe rivers carry grains of material that accumulate as dunes elsewhere .
" This land is heavily tortured , convolutedand filled with hills and mountains , " said Steve Wall , the Cassini radarteam 's deputy leader at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" Xanadu has beenwashed clean .
What is left underneath looks like very porous water ice , maybefilled with caverns . "

The new NCS director will report to CIA chief Porter Goss
The National Clandestine Service ( NCS ) will oversee all human espionage operations - meaning spying by people rather than by technical means .
The move is the latest in the post - 9/11 reforms of US intelligence agencies .
Analysts say the NCS restores some authority to the CIA after it lost overall control of US intelligence .
' Expression of confidence '
The chief of the new service will supervise the CIA 's espionage operations and co-ordinate all overseas spying , including those of the FBI and the Pentagon .
The director of the new agency , whose identity will remain secret and is simply known as " Jose " , will report directly to the head of the CIA , Porter Goss .
" This is another positive step in building an intelligence community that is more unified , co-ordinated and effective , " National Intelligence Director John Negroponte said .
Setting up the NCS was one of more than 70 recommendations made by a commission on weapons of mass destruction in March , which was highly critical of the US ' intelligence capabilities .
As part of reforms following the 11 September 2001 attacks , the CIA lost overall control of US intelligence to the newly created National Director of Intelligence .
Mr Goss said the new service represents " an expression of confidence in the CIA " from President George Bush and Mr Negroponte .
" No agency has greater skill and experience in this difficult , complex , and utterly vital discipline of intelligence , " Mr Goss said .

I ’ve been working this week to make our applications compatible with Internet Explorer 7 .
Some background :
As a Mac shop , most of our exposure to the pain of the Windows world has been through support emails we receive .
But recently we installed Windows Vista in a Parallels virtual machine for IE 7 testing .
Parallels is an indispensable tool that lets us test our applications in all the browsers we support on a single computer .
We can even test IE 6 and 7 side - by - side by running Windows XP in one VM and Vista in another .
As a web developer , Parallels is easily the single best reason to own an Intel Mac .
But starting with Vista ’s release , Microsoft wants us to pay for the privilege : you ’ll legally only be able to install the most expensive versions ( Ultimate and Business ) in a VM , even if all you ’re doing is clicking on things in IE .
And even testing things in IE is n’t easy .
For example , here ’s what you see when you click View Source in Vista :
This is just one of the endless confirmation dialogs Microsoft has added in the name of security .
Here , the language does n’t even make sense :
No , a “ website ” does n’t “ want ” to “ open web content , ” I clicked View Source !
And the dialog box defaults to not letting me do what I want .
So you ca n’t even trust Vista to do what you tell it to do .
But the most painful experience yet has been installing Microsoft Script Debugger , an ancient artifact used to debug JavaScript in IE .
After finding the link on Microsoft ’s web site , it takes a stunning 35 clicks through nearly as many dialog boxes just to get the thing installed .

The government is secretly trying to stifle attempts by MPs to find out what it knows about CIA " torture flights " and privately admits that people captured by British forces could have been sent illegally to interrogation centres .
A hidden strategy aimed at suppressing a debate about rendition - the US practice of transporting detainees to secret centres where they are at risk of being tortured - is revealed in a briefing paper sent by the Foreign Office to No 10 .
The document shows that the government has been aware of secret interrogation centres , despite ministers ' denials .
It admits that the government has no idea whether individuals seized by British troops in Iraq or Afghanistan have been sent to the secret centres .
Dated December 7 last year , the document is a note from Irfan Siddiq , of the foreign secretary 's private office , to Grace Cassy in Tony Blair 's office .
It was obtained by the New Statesman magazine , whose latest issue is published today .
It was drawn up in response to a Downing Street request for advice " on substance and handling " of the controversy over CIA rendition flights and allegations of Britain 's connivance in the practice .
" We should try to avoid getting drawn on detail " , Mr Siddiq writes , " and to try to move the debate on , in as front foot a way we can , underlining all the time the strong anti-terrorist rationale for close cooperation with the US , within our legal obligations . "
The document advises the government to rely on a statement by Condoleezza Rice last month when the US secretary of state said America did not transport anyone to a country where it believed they would be tortured and that , " where appropriate " , Washington would seek assurances .
The document notes : " We would not want to cast doubt on the principle of such government - to - government assurances , not least given our own attempts to secure these from countries to which we wish to deport their nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism : Algeria etc . "
The document says that in the most common use of the term - namely , involving real risk of torture - rendition could never be legal .
It also says that the US emphasised torture but not " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " , which binds Britain under the European convention on human rights .
British courts have adopted a lower threshold of what constitutes torture than the US has .
The note includes questions and answers on a number of issues .
" Would cooperating with a US rendition operation be illegal ? " , it asks , and gives the response : " Where we have no knowledge of illegality , but allegations are brought to our attention , we ought to make reasonable enquiries " .
It asks : " How do we know whether those our armed forces have helped to capture in Iraq or Afghanistan have subsequently been sent to interrogation centres ? "
The reply given is : " Cabinet Office is researching this with MoD [ Ministry of Defence ] .
But we understand the basic answer is that we have no mechanism for establishing this , though we would not ourselves question such detainees while they were in such facilities " .
Ministers have persistently taken the line , in answers to MPs ' questions , that they were unaware of CIA rendition flights passing through Britain or of secret interrogation centres .
On December 7 - the date of the leaked document - Charles Kennedy , then Liberal Democrat leader , asked Mr Blair when he was first made aware of the American rendition flights , and when he approved them .
Mr Blair replied : " In respect of airports , I do not know what the right hon gentleman is referring to . "
On December 22 , asked at his monthly press conference about the US practice of rendition , the prime minister told journalists : " It is not something that I have ever actually come across until this whole thing has blown up , and I do n't know anything about it . "
He said he had never heard of secret interrogation camps in Europe .
But Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , recently disclosed that Whitehall inquiries had shown Britain had received rendition requests from the Clinton administration .
In 1998 , Mr Straw , then home secretary , agreed to one request , but turned down another because the individual concerned was to be transported to Egypt .
He agreed that Mohammed Rashed Daoud al - Owhali , suspected of involvement in the bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi , could be transported to the US for trial via Stansted , according to the briefing paper .
Owhali was subsequently given a life sentence .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the human rights group Liberty , which has demanded an inquiry into allegations of British collusion in rendition flights , said she was " deeply disappointed " by the memo .
" The government seems more concerned about spinning than investigating our concerns , " she said .
She has written to Mr Straw saying the government must now give its full support to the inquiry conducted , at Liberty 's behest , by the chief constable of Greater Manchester , Michael Todd .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman , said Mr Blair had fully endorsed Ms Rice 's statement , yet the prime minister had clear advice that it might have been deliberately worded to allow for cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
" I am submitting an urgent question to the speaker and expect the foreign secretary to come to parliament to explain the government 's position , " he said .
" Evasion can no longer be sustained : there is now overwhelming evidence to support a full public inquiry into rendition . "
Andrew Tyrie , Conservative MP for Chichester and chairman of the parliamentary group on rendition , said last night : " All the experts who have looked at Rice 's assurances have concluded that they are so carefully worded as to be virtually worthless .
Relying on them , as the government appears to be doing , speaks volumes " .
He said his committee would pursue the issue .
The German - US automaker said Wednesday it will launch the car through a partner -- a company headed by racing legend Roger Penske -- in early 2008 .
High fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision .
At 2.5 meters long ( 8.2 feet ) and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos ( 2,180 pounds ) , the two - seat Smart car is about half the size of a Hummer , Ford Expedition or other large SUV .
But DaimlerChrysler chairman Dieter Zetsche said the Smart -- which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market -- can hold its own against US muscle cars .
" Times have changed , and urban US streets are becoming increasingly congested , " Zetsche told reporters during the announcement .
" Gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added .
Some Smart cars are already sold in the US through unofficial resellers , but Wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer Penske 's UnitedAuto Group as the official distributor for the Smart in the United States and Puerto Rico .
Smart cars have been on European roads since 1998
Some have likened the Smart 's appearance to a baby shoe
DaimlerChrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " The Da Vinci Code , " where it was used in a chase scene in Paris , and the remake of " The Pink Panther " starring Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau .
" The time has never been better for this -- and I am convinced that the Smart Fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of New York , Miami or Seattle as it is today in Rome , Berlin or Paris , " Zetsche said .
The Smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated .
The additional sales volume could help Smart meet its target of achieving profitability .
Zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether Smart would enter the US market , pointing out that the next - generation Fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the United States .
The issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by UnitedAuto , part of a company headed by Penske with dealers in 20 states .
The distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban US markets , along with a few select leisure markets .
Success in Canada
While expecting to sell the Fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , Penske would not comment on volume targets but noted Smart 's recent success in Canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales .
The Smart car would be among the least fuel - hungry cars on the road .
The company says it goes about 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) per gallon ( 3.8 liters ) .
That translates to consumption of 4.2 liters per 100 kilometers .

All of which sent a cold shiver down the spine .
We have image files stored on 22 CDs and one DVD and this led us to wonder just how long they will be accessible .
How long will a homemade CD or DVD last ?
Not long , according to Herr Kurt Gerecke , IBM expert on data storage .
Mr Gerecke told the magazine PC
World that two years is about the average life expectancy of a burned disc , and if you keep it in a dark , cool place it might last for five .
Not very reassuring .
Gerecke says the burned disc has a short lifespan compared with a commercially pressed disc , which fits with our observation .
We have compact discs bought on CD Day One in 1983 that are still perfect .
On the other hand , we have had DVDs give up the ghost in less than a year .
Discs seem to be another of those consumables that obey the inexorable law of capitalism :
You get what you pay for .
The el- cheapo discs look attractive but they wo n't last .
The pricier brand - name discs do better but only by five years .
The next big thing in optical writeable discs is Blu-ray , which is not yet available , but even that must be seen as an interim medium between non-volatile memory on revolving discs and memory on solid - state devices similar to camera memory cards or memory sticks .
Samsung has announced a notebook with 32 GB of flash memory and no rotating hard drive .
That 's the future .
So perhaps all we need is five years of optical storage to tide us over .
If you 're worried , it might be worth looking into the Delkin eFilm Gold CD and DVD blanks .
These promise a life of 100 years for the DVDs and 300 for the CDs .
Their longevity is attributed to the use of gold in the reflective layer of the disc , according to the Australian distributors , Baltronics .
Gold is supposed to be impervious to temperature and humidity and therefore resistant to oxidation .
Given the claims made for the Delkin discs they 're not that expensive - $ 1.72 for a CD and $ 3.50 for a DVD .
They are cheaper in bulk and can be ordered from http://www.photo-accessories.com.au
Prints on paper are still the medium most likely to survive in the shoe box .
But before investing in a photo ink - jet printer it pays to check the Wilhelm Research webpage ( http://www.wilhelm-research.com) for the most recent longevity test results .
The superb Epson 2400 printer - or any of the Epson range that uses pigment rather than dye inks - rates highly for life expectancy .
Keep your Epson prints in an album or a box and , depending on the paper used , the pictures will still be there in 200 years ' time .
Preliminary tests on the forthcoming Canon pigment ink printer show that colour prints will be in good order in 100 years ' time and monochrome prints even longer .
Pigment inks do not produce prints with the same resolution , colour range and snap as dye inks but the dye - based medium fades faster .
The moral of the story is that digital images might not be as ephemeral as once we feared .
Jonathan Ive has guided Apple product design since 1992
He is widely seen as one of the key figures in Apple 's resurrection .
Mr Ive started working for Apple in 1992 but exerted a big influence on its products only in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to the company he co-founded .
Mr Ive 's first design for Apple , the iMac , was hugely influential and has been followed by a series of other widely admired gadgets .
Apple said in a statement : " We are as proud as could be that Jony is receiving such a prestigous commendation . "
The Queen 's New Year Honours list is dominated by people who helped in the aftermath of the July 7 London bombings .
The list is also peppered with the usual crop of celebrities and sporting figures .
Gadget guru
A Londoner by birth , Mr Ive studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic .
After graduating , he set up his own design studio called Tangerine .
Ive was behind the distinctive look of the iMac
Since the launch of the iMac in 1998 , Mr Ive has driven the design of almost every piece of Apple hardware .
Landmarks include the original iMac , iBook , Power Mac , PowerBook , Mac Mini and iPod .
Although many drool over the sleek look of Apple products , Mr Ive has always emphasised the need for a close union of form and function .
Famously private and rarely giving interviews , Mr Ive always seeks to stress the teamwork that goes into creating Apple 's products .
The portable iPod music player has done the most to boost Apple 's fortunes and in September 2005 it reported its best financial quarter for nine years .
Sales of iPods were up 500 % on the year before .
The first image from HiRISE reveals a small portion of the floor of Ius Chasma , one branch of the giant Valles Marineris system of canyons on Mars .
The MRO spacecraft was about 174 miles ( 280 km ) above the Martian surface when this picture was taken .
Updated 8:40 p.m. ET
New images from a low - altitude Mars satellite are giving scientists some of their most detailed glimpses yet of the surface of the Red planet .
The High - Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera flying aboard NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) has beamed to Earth its first image of the Martian surface , revealing in never - seen - before clarity Ius Chasma , a complex floor that is part of the giant canyon system Valles Marineris .
Within moments of the image being beamed back , researchers said they had identified many boulders , craters and channels .
" We are elated at the sharpness of the image , revealing such fine detail in the landscape , " said Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory .
Zooming in
The HiRISE team , led by McEwen , has been working at top speed to prepare for the low - orbit images they 'll get between today and Oct.
6 .
Last March , the telescopic camera snapped test images of the Martian surface from a distance of 1,600 miles above the planet as the orbiter settled into a circular orbit around the planet .
The newest images will have 10 times the resolution of the ones taken last March .
One of the objectives of the MRO mission is to search for evidence of long - standing bodies of water on the Martian surface , so having detailed images of the planet will be important .
Other Mars missions have found signs that water once flowed across the Martian surface , suggesting the possibility of subsurface water and perhaps even surface lakes and oceans .
But whether water stuck around long enough to provide habitat for life has remained a mystery .
The bus -sized MRO launched on Aug. 12 , 2005 and settled into its final orbit on Sept. 11 , 2006 .
It now circles near Mars ' north and south poles and at times gets as close as 155 miles of the planet 's surface .
With the craft 's six instruments , including HiRISE , team members hope to study the Martian surface , atmosphere and signs of underground water and ice deposits .
Future targets
The first image of Ius Chasma was taken at a local Mars time of 3:30 p.m. and illustrated Mars - shaping processes , including bedrock exposures of layered materials , which could be sedimentary rocks deposited in water or from the air .
Many more images are expected as the MRO automatically steers itself to about 40 designated targets , which include the north polar cap and the Phoenix Mission landing region .
NASA 's Scout - class Phoenix Mission is expected to launch in August 2007 and touchdown near Mars ' polar region in May 2008 .
" HiRISE 's best chance for photographing candidate Phoenix mission landing sites is in October and November because the sun is getting lower as northern Mars moves into fall , " McEwen said .
Fogs and hazes will likely degrade viewing by early 2007 , he added .
Rumor and Gossip Psychology
A flurry of rumor and gossip followed recent reports of a small plane hitting a high - rise apartment building on New York 's Upper East Side .
Was it a helicopter or a plane ?
Was it an accident or a terrorist attack ?
The pilot 's celebrity identity added another strange twist as the rumor unraveled to substantiated fact .

What are Mailfence Groups ?
Mailfence Groups are group collaboration spaces that allow sharing of data with other users .
With groups , you will use the full potential of Mailfence !
Sharing is done in two ways :
Sharing via the group space : group Documents , group Calendar , etc .
All group members have access to this common space .
Sharing your private space :
This can only be done with your Mailbox and Calendar that can be shared with selected group members .
Belonging to a group has the following consequences .
You can :
view the shared mailbox .
view the shared group Contacts .
see the busy timeslots ( but not the event details ) in the group members ’ Calendars .
share the group Calendar publicly via ‘ public access link ’ .
see all the shared data in the group spaces .
share your group Documents publicly via ‘ public access link ’ .

One way to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere is to put it back in the ground .
In the first of two News Features on carbon sequestration , Quirin Schiermeier asked when the world 's coal - fired power plants will start storing away their carbon .
In the second , Emma Marris joins the enthusiasts who think that enriching Earth 's soils with charcoal can help avert global warming , reduce the need for fertilizers , and greatly increase the size of turnips .
Drop of the black stuff : terra preta contrasts strongly with normal soil in colour ( above ) and produces much more vigorous crops ( below ) .

In 1879 , the explorer Herbert Smith regaled the readers of Scribner 's Monthly with tales of the Amazon , covering everything from the tastiness of tapirs to the extraordinary fecundity of the sugar plantations .
“ The cane - field itself , ” he wrote of one rum - making operation , “ is a splendid sight ; the stalks ten feet high in many places , and as big as one 's wrist . ”
The secret , he went on , was “ the rich terra preta , ' black land ' , the best on the Amazons .
It is a fine , dark loam , a foot , and often two feet thick . ”
Last month , the heirs to Smith 's enthusiasm met in a hotel room in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , during the World Congress of Soil Science .
Their agenda was to take terra preta from the annals of history and the backwaters of the Amazon into the twenty - first century world of carbon sequestration and biofuels .
They want to follow what the green revolution did for the developing world 's plants with a black revolution for the world 's soils .
They are aware that this is a tough sell , not least because hardly anyone outside the room has heard of their product .
But that does not dissuade them : more than one eye in the room had a distinctly evangelical gleam .

The soil scientists , archaeologists , geographers , agronomists , and anthropologists who study terra preta now agree that the Amazon 's dark earths , terra preta do índio , were made by the river basin 's original human residents , who were much more numerous than formerly supposed .
The darkest patches correspond to the middens of settlements and are cluttered with crescents of broken pottery .
The larger patches were once agricultural areas that the farmers enriched with charred trash of all sorts .
Some soils are thought to be 7,000 years old .
Compared with the surrounding soil , terra preta can contain three times as much phosphorus and nitrogen .
And as its colour indicates , it contains far more carbon .
In samples taken in Brazil by William Woods , an expert in abandoned settlements at the University of Kansas in Lawrence , the terra preta was up to 9 % carbon , compared with 0.5 % for plain soil from places nearby1 .
From Smith 's time onwards , the sparse scholarly discussion of terra preta was focused mainly on the question of whether ' savages ' could have been so clever as to enhance their land 's fertility .
But Woods ' comprehensive bibliography on the subject now doubles in size every decade .
About 40 % of the papers it contains were published in the past six years .
Loam ranger
The main stimulus for this interest was the work of Wim Sombroek , who died in 2003 and is still mourned in the field .
Sombroek was born in the Netherlands in 1934 and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944 — the Hongerwinter .
His family kept body and soul together with the help of a small plot of land made rich and dark by generations of laborious fertilization .
Sombroek 's father improved the land in part by strewing it with the ash and cinders from their home .
When , in the 50s , Sombroek came across terra preta in the Amazon , it reminded him of that life - giving ' plaggen ' soil , and he more or less fell in love .
His 1966 book Amazon Soils began the scientific study of terra preta .
Since then trial after trial with crop after crop has shown how remarkably fertile the terra preta is .
Bruno Glaser , of the University of Bayreuth , Germany , a sometime collaborator of Sombroek 's , estimates that productivity of crops in terra preta is twice that of crops grown in nearby soils2 .
But it is easier to measure the effect than explain it through detailed analysis .
Everyone agrees that the explanation lies in large part with the char ( or biochar ) that gives the soil its darkness .
This char is made when organic matter smoulders in an oxygen - poor environment , rather than burns .
The particles of char produced this way are somehow able to gather up nutrients and water that might otherwise be washed down below the reach of roots .
They become homes for populations of microorganisms that turn the soil into that spongy , fragrant , dark material that gardeners everywhere love to plunge their hands into .
The char is not the only good stuff in terra preta — additions such as excrement and bone probably play a role too — but it is the most important factor .
Leaving aside the subtleties of how char particles improve fertility , the sheer amount of carbon they can stash away is phenomenal .
In 1992 , Sombroek published his first work on the potential of terra preta as a tool for carbon sequestration3 .
According to Glaser 's research , a hectare of metre - deep terra preta can contain 250 tonnes of carbon , as opposed to 100 tonnes in unimproved soils from similar parent material .
The extra carbon is not just in the char — it's also in the organic carbon and enhanced bacterial biomass that the char sustains .
Ground control
That difference of 150 tonnes is greater than the amount of carbon in a hectare 's worth of plants .
That means turning unimproved soil into terra preta can store away more carbon than growing a tropical forest from scratch on the same piece of land , before you even start to make use of its enhanced fertility .
Johannes Lehmann of Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , has studied with Glaser and worked with Sombroek .
He estimates that by the end of this century terra preta schemes , in combination with biofuel programmes , could store up to 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon a year — more than is emitted by all today 's fossil - fuel use4 .
Mud pack
The year before he died , Sombroek helped to round up like - minded colleagues into the Terra Preta Nova group , which looks at the usefulness of using char in large - scale farming and as a carbon sink .
The group was well represented at the Philadelphia meeting , although Glaser was not there .
Their aim is to move beyond the small projects in which many of them are involved and find ways of integrating char into agribusiness .
After all , wherever there is biomass that farmers want to get rid of and that no one can eat , char is a possibility .
That means there are a lot of possibilities .
One problem is that there is a new competitor for farm waste .
Plant are largely made up of cellulose , indigestible material in cell walls .
Recent technological advances make it likely that quite a lot of that cellulose might be turned into biofuel .
At the moment , ethanol is made from corn in the United States and from sugar in Brazil ; if it were made directly from cellulose , producers could work with a wider range of cheaper biomass .
Given the choice of turning waste material into fuel or into charcoal , farmers might be expected to go for fuel , especially if that is the way that policy - makers are pushing them : US President George W. Bush promised $ 150 million for work on cellulosic ethanol in his 2006 state of the union speech .
But Lehmann and his colleagues do n't see biofuel as an alternative to char — they see the two developing hand in hand .
Take the work of Danny Day , the founder of Eprida .
This “ for - profit social - purpose enterprise ” in Athens , Georgia , builds contraptions that farmers can use to turn farm waste into biofuel while making char .
Farm waste ( or a crop designed for biofuel use ) is smouldered — pyrolysed , in the jargon — and this process gives off volatile organic molecules , which can be used as a basis for biodiesel or turned into hydrogen with the help of steam .
After the pyrolysation , half of the starting material will be used up and half will be char .
That can then be put back on the fields , where it will sequester carbon and help grow the next crop .
Negative thinking
“ This is the only way to make a fuel that is actually carbon negative .
Johannes Lehmann ”
The remarkable thing about this process is that , even after the fuel has been burned , more carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere than is put back .
Traditional biofuels claim to be ' carbon neutral ' , because the carbon dioxide assimilated by the growing biomass makes up for the carbon dioxide given off by the burning of the fuel .
But as Lehmann points out , systems such as Day 's go one step further : “ They are the only way to make a fuel that is actually carbon negative ” .
Slow burn : the idea of using charcoal to sequester carbon may take a while to catch on .

Day 's pilot plant processes 10 to 25 kg of Georgia peanut hulls and pine pellets every hour .
From 100 kg of biomass , the group gets 46 kg of carbon — half as char — and around 5 kg of hydrogen , enough to go 500 kilometres in a hydrogen - fuel - cell car ( not that there are many around yet ) .
Originally , Day was mostly interested in making biofuel ; the char was just something he threw out , or used to make carbon filters .
Then he discovered that his employees were reaping the culinary benefits of the enormous turnips that had sprung up on the piles of char lying around at the plant .
Combining this char with ammonium bicarbonate , made using steam - recovered hydrogen , creates a soil additive that is now one of his process 's selling points ; the ammonium bicarbonate is a nitrogen - based fertilizer .
“ We do n't maximize for hydrogen ; we do n't maximize for biodiesel ; we do n't maximize for char , ” says Day .
“ By being a little bit inefficient with each , we approximate nature and get a completely efficient cycle . ”
Robert Brown , an engineer at Iowa State University in Ames , has a $ 1.8 - million grant from the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) to fine - tune similar technology , although being in Iowa , he uses corn stalks not peanut hulls .
“ We are trying an integrated approach : we are trying to evaluate the agronomic value , the sequestration value , the economic value , the engineering , ” he says .
Brown thinks a 250 - hectare farm on a char - and - ammonium - nitrate system can sequester 1,900 tonnes of carbon a year .
A crude calculation on that basis suggests the US corn crop could sequester 250 million tonnes of carbon a year .
At the moment , no one knows how long this could go on ; no one has yet found a ceiling for char addition .
Stephen Joseph of Biomass Energy Services and Technology in New South Wales has built a number of char - producing machines in Australia that work at fairly large scales ( the models have grown from an original ' Piglet ' through a larger ' Daisy ' to a positively bullish ' El Toro ' ) .
Joseph looks for companies with a waste problem such as a paper mill with spare scraps or a dairy with old bedding and manure , and then integrates char production into the business so that the heat produced in pyrolysis is used where the firm needs it .
So far , Joseph 's company is being brought in to solve waste - management problems , but he hopes the value of the char will become a selling point in itself .
For that to happen , however , he needs some help .
His machines can be tuned to make char of various sorts : different sized particles with different sized pores and different amounts of other elements .
Which is the best ?
It 's a question he asks in Philadephia , and one of the things that Brown 's research in Iowa aims to find out .
The right protocol
Such technical unknowns are not the only obstacles on the road to a black revolution .
One problem is that the purported benefits of char do not slot easily into the framework of the Kyoto Protocol , an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions .
Lehmann hopes to see the process get going under the aegis of the protocol 's Clean Development Mechanism , in which rich countries sponsor green projects in poor countries and get credit for the reduced emissions .
To this end , he is amassing evidence that modern char techniques can actually keep the carbon involved locked up for centuries .
His Cornell colleague John Gaunt is working on ways to present the technique as the sort of ' change in practice ' that could count as a tradeable carbon - emission reduction of the sort allowed under Kyoto .
Then there are your risk - averse farmers .
They have n't heard of char .
And they are n't going to buy it — let alone buy a strangely named machine to make it — unless they know it will make them money .
It is no good pitching it to them with a mouthful of scientific caveats about not knowing the right kind of char for each type of soil or exactly how it works .
You have to be able to sell specific benefits and real attractions .
“ A lot of farmers are environmentalists , ” says John Kimble , a USDA man who has just retired from the National Soil Survey Center in Lincoln , Nebraska .
“ But they look at the bottom line , as we all do . ”
Father of the field : Wim Sombroek championed the study of the Amazon 's dark soils .
After the afternoon coffee break in Philadelphia , Kimble takes the podium and the wind out of everyone 's sails .
He is sympathetic to the terra pretans goals — indeed he was a good friend of Sombroek 's — but that does n't stop him asking hard questions .
“ Can you do this in a no - till way ? ” is one tricky query .
Kimble and many others have been pushing no - till farming , which basically means doing without ploughs , as a partial solution to erosion , pesticide run-off and fuel costs .
The idea is that the less you mess with the soil , the less its components separate and wander away .
But biochar is light and fine , like the black grit left in a barbecue .
If you do n't physically insert it into the soil , it might just blow away .
Everyone listens politely .
But while watching their responses , it was hard not to worry that the same enthusiasm that has brought them together might also trap them in a cul de sac .
They obviously respect economics and pragmatic requirements .
But these are not people principally moved by practical politics or bottom lines ; they are people moved by ideals .
They start from the basis that the answer lies in the soil , more or less whatever the question is , and can't quite understand why this is n't self - evident to everyone else .
Faced , for example , with the suggestion that all corn matter be turned into ethanol , they tend simply to say “ Well it could be — but we hope , of course , it will go into the soil . ”
They know they ought to be marketing terra preta as a resource , or a policy instrument ; but they can't stop seeing it as a wonder .
Policy is not always , or even often , dictated by pure rationality .
Perhaps terra preta 's compelling history and rich , earthy smell will go to the heads of that diffuse band of policy - makers who hand out the cash .
The enthusiasts need to be more down to earth ; but the policy people might benefit from getting their hands dirty .

Windows Vista wird nicht mehr in diesem Jahr in die Regale der Händler einziehen .
Unabhängig vom Erscheinungsdatum des kommenden Windows - Betriebssystem befeuern Sorgen um den Schutz der Privatsphäre die Diskussionsforen im Web : Im Februar sorgte ein Bericht von BBC News über eine geplante Hintertür im kommenden Microsoft - Betriebssystem Vista für Aufregung .
Angeblich führte die britische Regierung bereits konkrete Gespräche mit dem Redmonder Softwarekonzern über einen Zugriff auf das Betriebssystem durch eben ein solches Backdoor .
Microsoft widersprach nun den Spekulationen vehement – Ermittlungsbehörden sollen keine solche Zugriffsmöglichkeit erhalten .
„ Microsoft hat in Windows keine Hintertüren eingebaut und wird dies auch nicht tun “ , so ein Firmensprecher in einer per E - Mail verbreiteten Erklärung .
Doch ganz von der Hand zu weisen sind die Hintertürchen - verdächtige Bestrebungen der Mannen um Bill Gates nicht : Konkreten Anlass zu Vermutungen über ein geplantes Backdoor gibt die „ Bitlocker Drive Encryption “ , eine geplante Sicherheitsfunktion in Vista .
Bitlocker verschlüsselt Daten , um diese vor unerlaubtem Zugriff zu schützen , falls der Computer verloren geht oder gestohlen wird .
Diese Funktion kann es Ermittlern aber auch sehr erschweren , Zugriff auf Daten von beschlagnahmten Computern zu erlangen .
„ Es gibt einen Vorschlag , wonach wir mit Regierungsbehörden zusammenarbeiten sollen , um eine Hintertür einzubauen .
So hätten sie immer Zugriff auf Daten , die mit Bitlocker verschlüsselt sind “ , bestätigte Niels Ferguson , Entwickler und Kryptograph bei Microsoft in einem Unternehmens - Blog mit dem Titel „ Backdoor - Nonsense “ .
Jedoch fügte er hinzu : „ Nur über meine Leiche “ .
Dennoch : Microsoft ist in Sachen Vista mit mehreren Regierungen im Gespräch .
Allerdings gehe es dabei um den Einsatz des neuen Betriebssystems und von Bitlocker für deren eigene Sicherheitsbelange , schreibt Ferguson .
„ Wir erhalten auch Anfragen von Ermittlungsbehörden .
Sie rechnen damit , dass sie es mit Bitlocker - verschlüsselten Daten zu tun bekommen werden , und wollen darauf vorbereitet sein . “
„ Hintertüren sind schlicht nicht akzeptabel “ , beeilt sich Ferguson zu erklären .
„ Außerdem würden sie hier bei uns im Team niemanden finden , der bereit wäre , eine solche Backdoor zu implementieren und zu testen . “

The War Against Boys ,
How Misguided Feminism is
Harming Our Young Men
by Christina Hoff Sommers
Simon & Schuster , 2000
The first provocative book by Christina Hoff Sommers , Who Stole Feminism ? , was especially noteworthy for its exposure of the outright lies perpetrated by establishment feminism -- many of which are still simply repeated and perpetuated by the press and politicians , like the Super Bowl domestic violence hoax : the lie that large numbers of women beaten by drunken male football fans flood into emergency rooms on Super Bowl Sunday .
The War Against Boys continues in the debunking project but goes considerably further .
The title itself is a challenging turnabout with feminist rhetoric , reminiscent of the title of Susan Faludi's Backlash : The Undeclared War Against Women .
Establishment " gender " feminists love to see men and society as literally attacking and assaulting women and girls , and much in the way of their bogus statistics is supposed to support this view -- like Katherine Hanson , director of the publicly funded " Women 's Educational Equity Act Publishing Center , " claiming that " every year nearly four million women are beaten to death " ( the total female deaths per year are no more than one million , while female homicide deaths are actually about 3,600 -- cf. pp.48-49 ) .
The statistical claims that Sommers must centrally address in this book , however , are those about the self - esteem and educational disadvantages of girls , which gave rise to a decade of feminist rhetoric and activism to promote the cause of girls in schools .
The federal " Educational Equity Act " itself was a consequence of this , as the " Violence Against Women Act " was the result of the overheated rhetoric and overblown statistics about women 's physical safety .
The truth , however , is that boys , not girls , display the signs of educational and social disadvantage , and the cause of this turns out to be a combination of feminist reeducation programs and general " progressive " educational theory .
The interaction of these influences is one of the most interesting features of the book .
As part of her conclusion , Sommers says :
In our schools , therapeutic practices have effectively supplanted the moral education of yesterday .
Ironically , those who pressed for discarding the old directive moral education did so in the name of freedom , for they sincerely believed that moral education " indoctrinated " children and " imposed " a teacher 's values on them , something they thought the schools had no right to do .
In fact , the " therapism " that took the place of the old morality is far more invasive of the child 's privacy and far more insidious in its effects on the child 's autonomy than the directive moral education that was once the norm in the every school . [ p.212 ]
As we see from the earlier parts of Sommers ' treatment , however , things go considerably beyond this .
The feminist educational project is quite openly one of indoctrination and imposition , in which the wishes of the subjects , whether boys or girls , and irrelevant or even dangerous .
Privacy is invaded because the radical feminist project , like all totalitarian projects , allows no privacy .
The fundamental incongruity between feminism and " progressive " education is the contradiction between the principle of the latter that children should be allowed to grow and develop naturally , determined by their own autonomous impulses , and the principle of the former that nothing about human society or personality is natural at all and that " social conditioning " is responsible for all forms of behavior .
The " progressive " valorization of autonomy is flatly contradicted by the extreme heteronomy of the feminist approach .
The drawbacks of both these approaches , as they pursue their contradictory purposes , contribute to the problems that boys have today , and they end up unintentionally reinforcing each other .
The purpose of " progressive " education is noble enough , to cultivate and honor personal autonomy .
This would seem to be in the best tradition of American society and even of Kantian philosophy .
However , the purpose is largely undone by a confusion .
Children are not ready for autonomy .
They have neither the internal moral nor intellectual resources to think and judge for themselves in important matters .
The real key assumption of " progressive " education , therefore , is not so much that individuals should be allowed their autonomy , but that children are naturally ready for it .
This , as Sommers notes , is the thesis of Rousseau , though evidently he did not pursue its logic quite so far as his modern disciples .
The autonomy of children is only going to make sense when autonomy is naively understood as simply pursuing one 's spontaneous preferences .
Moral autonomy is nothing of the sort .
A Kantian moral autonomy is a rational autonomy , and consequently , it is not reasonable to expect children to be able to recognize and exercise it until they reach what traditionally was called the " age of reason , " i.e. 13 years or so , when Catholics are Confirmed and Jews are bar mitzvahed .
Even then , when in Mediaeval society many of the responsibilities of adulthood were rapidly assumed , youths were not expected to be fully competent adults until later -- all the rights and duties of Athenian citizenship did not descend until 21 , which has remained a key age ever since .
In our peculiar times , the United States now prohibits the consumption of alcohol until 21 , but allows voting at 18 , as though an 18 - year - old is wiser in politics than in sobriety -- a conceit that would astonish the political thinkers and moral authorities of most ages and cultures .
" Progressive " education cannot hope to nurture autonomy where it is not naturally ready to grow .
Instead , children require the kind of morally heteronomous upbringing , in discipline and restraint , just as described by Aristotle and Sommers .
Where children are not raised in a morally appropriate fashion , they will behave impolitely , imprudently , or illegally -- more like all three .
The insolence and rudeness of many of the recent young is now evident to many .
The imprudence of the young , from teenage pregnancy to the kind of drunk driving incidents that returned the drinking age to 21 from 18 , is a matter of large public concern .
The criminality of the young , especially the sociopathic and even psychopathic behavior evident in recent school shootings and massacres , let alone the criminal slaughter found in inner cities for some decades now , is a matter of frequent sensational headlines .
That the public debate over such incidents is typically diverted into controversy over firearms is one of the most disturbing and damaging misdirections in all of recent politics .
Indeed , it is most instructive :
The outrageous crimes of virtually feral children are adopted as a pretext to restrict the autonomy of adults by limiting general access to arms .
This connection is not accidental , since the political projects related to feminism , as we shall see , typically desire a disarmed population unable to resist the government .
Since " progressive " education does not have a true capacity for autonomy to work with in children , what does it do instead ?
Indeed , we have already seen described what happens in Thomas Sowell 's fine Inside American Education , The Decline , The Deception , The Dogmas [ Free Press , 1993 ] .
Sowell discovered that educational techniques like " values clarification , " which are supposed to promote the autonomy of children , instead are subtle forms of social control and indoctrination .
Indeed , Sowell classifies " values clarification " as a form of " Classroom Brainwashing " ( the title of his Chapter 3 , pp.34-69 -- especially cf. " Brainwashing Agendas , " pp.47 -56 ) .
" Autonomy " in that practical context ends up meaning the repudiation of parental authority and values ( " Parents as Pariahs " ) and the adoption of what are said to be the values of a child 's own peers ( " Peers as Guides " ) .
Pretty much any sort of social agenda can then be presented as favored by peers .
While Sommers focuses on the moral anarchy that results from lack of traditional directed moral education ( Chapter Eight , " The Moral Life of Boys , " pp. 179-206 ) , her emphasis and that of Sowell are complementary .
Moral anarchy results , despite the heteronomous agenda that creeps into " progressive " education , because the agenda is not a moral one , but a political one .
" Progressive " education 's idea of moral truth is actually moral relativism , which it is willing to advocate quite freely , though this is only the crudest possible version of a theory of moral autonomy .
But the political content of the " progressive " message is anything but relativistic :
It is absolutist , doctrinaire , and dogmatic with a vengeance .
" Progressive " education thus shades over into " progressive " politics , both in the early century version of the Progressivism of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and the version of the later century when " progressive " became a codeword for leftist totalitarian , i.e. communist , regimes , from the Soviet Union , to Maoist China , to Cuba and Nicaragua .
A doctrine that begins with moral autonomy and even relativism and then incoherently shades over into harsh heteronomy and even totalitarianism bears all the stigmata of moralistic relativism , by which moralism ( everything is a moral issue ) and moral aestheticism ( nothing is a moral issue ) are illogically combined .
Feminism , a paradigmatic torchbearer for political moralism , thus finds the way open for it to hijack " progressive " education for purposes that have nothing to do with autonomy or natural development .
Thus , very confused theories about education have two important results : ( 1 ) the means are provided for illiberal political control and indoctrination , and ( 2 ) the absence of real moral upbringing produces a drop in achievement for all , but especially for boys ( which can be ignored , or acknowledged as part of the demands for more money by the rent - seeking educational establishment and teachers ' unions ) , and , more importantly , the wild , destructive , amoral , anti-social , and even violent and murderous behavior of many boys and young men .
The latter makes " progressive " education an unwitting ally of feminism 's totalitarian project , for the worse the behavior , the more that feminism can offer its own ready - made explanation : patriarchy .
Patriarchy , to feminism , is the result of sexist social indoctrination by a reactionary society .
That this is ahistorically and absurdly seen as a recent and Western phenomenon , for which the West is uniquely culpable , never occurs to any of these people .
They want the blame squarely on their own villains .
The only way to fight " patriarchy , " in turn , is with feminist indoctrination and reeducation , with all the necessary vigor that has long been explored by the " progressive " ( in the later century sense ) regimes .
As we see from the title of Sommers ' Chapter Two , " Reeducating the Nation 's Boys , " she has grasped the origin and technique of this approach .
The techniques and purposes of feminist reeducation , well exposed by Sommers , are appalling and terrifying .
The title of the book is fully motivated by this chapter alone .
It truly is a " War on Boys . "
The kinds of feminists whom everyone always assumed simply hated men have now turned on a more vulnerable target , entrusted to them by their parents : boys .
The catechism is more or less simple : " Girls , good ; boys , bad . "
Even the propensity of boys to run and jump , let alone engage in rough - and - tumble play , is now suppressed in many schools , to the point of it becoming a movement to abolish recess -- this at a time when health activists continue to lament the overweight and inactive lifestyles of American children .
If sedentary and junk - food nourished children are to be denied free outdoor exercise , there must be some powerful reason for doing so .
The reason , indeed , is that the boys behave differently from the girls .
This can not be allowed .
We find establishment feminists forthrightly stating that boys should be raised like , and should be like , girls .
Any other kind of behavior or interest must be the result of " patriarchy " and must be combated as an ideological deviation that will lead directly to rape , mass murder , and capitalism ( yes , that 's in there too ) .
In ordinary language there is a blunt term , unused by Sommers , for this kind of feminist " education " : Castrating .
One wonders if , in their heart of hearts , this is not what some of the feminists would really like to do .
Ritalin may do for the time being , while it is constantly drummed in that the boys are class enemies , responsible for all the evils of the world -- for the feminist world , like that of the familiar totalitarian regimes , is one of collective and inherited guilt .
That the enemies of feminism are " gender " ( i.e. sex ) enemies gives the doctrine more of a racial edge ( such as pursued by Hitler ) than the original theory had in pure Marxism .
Of course , the doped - up and denigrated boys then hit adolescence , the hormonal rockets are lit off , and we find resentful , angry , and unsocialized youth bouncing around the landscape .
This , then , can again be taken in turn as evidence that more vigorous non-sexist reeducation must be instituted .
However , since feminist educational ideas have been the vogue for a quarter of a century now , with whole generations raised under their influence , one begins to wonder why the futility and nastiness of the whole project is not generally recognized .
Perhaps it is -- though the educational and academic establishment , and the " progressive " intelligentsia , are too ideologically committed to ever revise their ideas in the face of mere evidence and results .
We can count on them never to do so .
The feminist educators who exult in the formlessness and malleability of children ( in contradistinction , note , to the " progressivist " comparison of children to small plants that must be nurtured into their own growth ) , then must face what to do when the brainwashing does n't take and the little boys turn out to be not quite so malleable after all .
Well , that 's easy , what you do is call the police .
All the permissiveness of " progressive " education is completely forgotten the minute that a child can be credibly accused of a gender / sex crime .
Sommers relates the case of a nine - year - old boy who drew a picture of a naked woman in art class , after a visit to the National Gallery of Art ( there are nude pictures there , you know ) , and then rubbed up against a girl in the cafeteria line .
The boy was literally arrested , handcuffed , fingerprinted , and charged with " aggravated sexual battery " ( p.54 ) .
Charges were eventually dropped , but it is not hard to tell what was going on .
The loving , nurturing feminist touch is the iron hand in the velvet glove .
To feminism , there is no difference between a little boy pulling a girl 's braid and a teenage youth raping her .
The typical incoherence of moralistic relativism is evident in some of these examples .
Children are exposed to very explicit sex education , a cause célèbre of " progressives " for many years , often with overt advice for " safe sex " techniques .
They are taken to see adult art , with nudes , if not with the sado - masochistic themes made so sensationally famous by Robert Mapplethorpe .
Yet the minute the slightest bit of sexual expression or play , or even of something that can simply be interpreted as something of the sort , is manifest , the feminist fist comes down like a ( mixed metaphorical ) ton of bricks .
Thus , Sommers cites the case of a three - year - old boy who had been reprimanded and punished for " having hugged another child . "
His mother was told , " He 's a toucher ... We are not going to put up with it " ( p.54 ) .
This harsh anhedonia , of course , is another characteristic of political moralism , and in contrast , again , to the infamous " touchy - feely " approach of " progressive " education -- where children affectionately touching each other is seen as a success rather than as criminal .
A similar case , where a young boy was penalized for kissing a girl , made national news not long ago .
Any sensible person would regard these antics as insane .
As Thomas Sowell already discovered about educational abuses , this is all , however , concealed from the public as much as possible .
But the public has by now become aware of the bizarre fanaticism that would extend " sexual harassment " principles , originally formulated on the principle that adult male bosses could extort sex from exploited female workers , to the naive behavior of pre-teen children with their peers .
What to do about it is something else , since the process is in the hands of legal and academic ideologues , whom the public never gets to vote in or out of their power .
The brainwashing , with its socially destructive and politically frightening results , will thus continue for the foreseeable future .
Between the first and last chapters of The War on Boys , which detail the assault on boys and the consequences of lack of moral education , respectively , we find Sommers in some of her classic debunking of feminist junk science , in this case the work of Carol Gilligan , who became famous for her theory that women 's moral reasoning is different from that of men .
Women are supposed to be more concerned with compassion than with the application of abstract moral rules .
Gilligan cannot be unaware this is a very old stereotype about women .
We find Schopenhauer saying ,
... women are decidedly more matter - of - fact than men and thus do not see in things more than actually exists , whereas when the passions of men are aroused , they easily magnify what is present or add something imaginary .
From the same source may be traced the fact that women show more compassion and thus more loving kindness and sympathy for the unfortunate than do men ; on the other hand , they are inferior to men in the matter of justice , honesty , and conscientiousness .
For in consequence of their weak faculty of reason , that which is present , intuitively perceptual , immediately real , exercises over them a power against which abstract ideas , established maxims , fixed resolves , and generally a consideration for the past and future , the absent and distant , are seldom able to do very much ...
In accordance with the foregoing , we find that injustice is the fundamental failing of the female character .
[ " On Women , " Parerge and Paralipomena , Volume 2 , §366 , Oxford , Calarendon Press , 1974 , p.616-617 , boldface added ]
Nevertheless , on the principle , " girls , good ; boys , bad , " this stereotype resulted in the educational promotion of a " non-judgmental " ethics where only feelings count but that , of course , those feelings better be politically correct .
Gilligan then went on to make sensational claims about the lack of self - esteem and of ambition in teen - age girls , whose spirit is broken by the Patriarchy as they reach adolescence .
This created a whole girl - advocacy movement in the early 90's .
Gilligan then moved on to characterize ( " somewhat ominously , " as Sommers says ) boys as similarly broken in spirit .
Since boys generally act like boys since infancy , then the Patriarchy must have already broken them that early .
In three chapters , " Carol Gilligan and the Incredible Shrinking Girl , " " Gilligan 's Island , " and " Save the Males , " Sommers tears this all to shreds .
Such a direct attack on Gilligan may attract more notice than anything else in the book , and feminists are sure to characterize the whole tome as " The War on Carol Gilligan . "
But it is a defining case , both for the fractured , irresponsible , and imaginary scholarship of establishment feminism and for just how establishment that feminism is , with Gilligan at a federally funded institution at Harvard University .
Much bears greater attention in this timely book .
For the moment , however , I wish to leave the emphasis on the characteristic incoherence of a modern education , supposedly based on the autonomy and natural growth of children , but which nevertheless has wholeheartedly adopted an ideology that flatly denies that there is anything natural or autonomous about children at all , using this theory as the basis of a bogus kind of " socialization " that is really an abusive and intrusive political indoctrination of children .
This results in nothing but a kind of self - fulfilling prophecy of the violence and social pathology of young men .
Verily , they have their reward .

Objectivity in the Media and Politics ( The Chicken or the Egg ? ) September 6 , 2006
Posted by earthlingconcerned in Social and Politics
A few weeks ago , I was watching an interview with Thom Yorke , the lead singer of Radiohead , on CBC Newsworld .
He discussed his recent solo work , but also his frustrations with the objectivity in modern media .
On global warming , he suggested that because the BBC has to remain impartial at all times , they hire any schmuck off the streets just so they can present both sides of the story .
The obvious weakness , as he saw it ( and I would agree ) , was that no matter how much evidence there was to support one argument , the network must always present both sides equally .
It ’s for these reasons that shows like Crossfire existed on CNN .
If for any reason there was any question regarding the legitimacy of the color red , the networks would give equal time to the side arguing the existence of red and to the person who suggests otherwise .
What this sort of reporting does is confuse the viewers , it creates conflicting opinion where no such opinion should exist .
The problem is that if one side is favored over another , you run into the problem of favoring something that may be incorrect after all .
Choosing the wrong road to follow , so to speak .
So objectivity , the solution , allows for all the facts to be presented from all sides and subsequently discussed so that a consensus can be reached and both sides are satisfied in the compromise or at the very least understand perfectly where they erred .
Sadly , I believe , coming to a conclusion objectively works in the realm of academia but not so much in the media which relies so much on conflict over consensus .
Allowing for this opinion , I would further suggest that this ongoing objectivity in most of the media today ( advocacy journalism does still exist , but its voice is severely muted ) gives a huge advantage to any government in power .
And that this ongoing objectivity may have something to do with the growing partisanship seen around the world .
Before I go any further , I will admit that a lot of what I will say is simply an opinion that I ’ve gathered for myself by living in the world I live in .
I ’m aware that the topic has been discussed and criticized by the likes of Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky ( along with thousands upon thousands of others ) .
But this time around I ’m going to simply write what I see , before gathering all of the possible opinions .
In doing so , I am disallowing a certain tint of objectivity that I myself tend to strive for .
Using the United States as my guinea pig , I would like to suggest there are several topics that have fallen into the eternal trap of objectivity in the media .
The war in Iraq , Global Warming , Stem Cell Research , Gay Marriage , and illegal immigration are all topics that will never be resolved in the media because the requirement to present both sides and kindly agree to disagree .
Using the now defunct Crossfire ( Thank you Jon Stewart ) as an example , Tucker Carlson and James Carville were not paid to ever come to a consensus .
Their primary objective was simply to object what the opinion of other and do so convincingly .
To suggest that there was ever any debate on the show is truly asinine .
It was a platform that would have been able to discuss , with much passion and supposed certainty , the legitimacy of the colour red .
The true tragedy is how this obvious fallacy continues and is subsequently understood by the governing parties .
You ’ve probably heard about how Iraq is showing the historic signs of an impending civil war .
A recent pentagon report stated that the conditions for a civil war were in place .
This resulted in several articles written on the topic until George W. Bush , in his weekly radio speech , suggested otherwise .
It was only a matter of increased violence , nothing more .
Considering civil wars and violence do n’t have anything to do with each other , I should probably believe the president .
But , then there ’s always the pentagon initial report that stated otherwise .
The media , I ’m sure , will hammer out all the kinks and come out with a responsible conclusion by the end of the week .
Mr. Carlson , you represent the right so do some research on what Bush said .
Mr. Carville , it ’s your job to discuss the impending civil war .
Go !
But realistically , and this is what this entire article is about , the second Bush suggested that there was no real concern of a civil war in Iraq , the topic was forever condemned the world of partisan bickering .
But it is indeed a touchy topic , so why not have Condoleezza Rice compare the Iraq War to the American Civil War .
That way , when you search for “ Iraq Civil War ” you are n’t presented with the potentially damaging civil war discussion , but a government sponsored message .
Out of Sight , out of Mind .
The stench of paranoia was evident in the last few statements so I ’ll just leave it at that ( although , since then Dubya has compared the middle - east extremists to Hitler ’s fascist Germany and Communist Russia ) .
Providing a counter argument is presented , the information messenger to the majority of the public will always falter so long as the objective approach continues to dominate .
Humanity has made progress through discussion which leads to agreement , not because its agreed to disagree .
I ’m not saying that this flaw in objectivity is an American issue .
It is a kink in the democratic ideal .
The Prime Minister of my country , Stephen Harper , has rewritten his role since his election .
As the recent Toronto Star article suggests , he ’s succeeding by failing to explain Canada ’s role in Afghanistan to the Canadian people .
His Conservative party won the election partially because of a liberal scandal , but also because of the merger of the right .
And baring a complete breakdown their ability to run the government , they will likely hold the upper hand until the left concedes and has a similar merger .
So now it ’s always about two parties , not three , not four , not fifty .
But this is all part of the partisan world we live in .
As the last two American elections , and most recently , the Mexican election has shown , is that the voters of the world are either Tucker Carlson or James Carville .
You ’re either with us , or against us , as the US president put it ever so eloquently a few years back .
How did this all come about ?
The chicken or the egg story can be used in several situations and this is one of them .
Ross Perot won 18.9 % of the popular vote in 1992 , Bill Clinton selected a republican as his Secretary of Defense in 1997 and George Bush has a republican , well , everything today .
It is possible that the population at large is to blame .
It is us who still hold the vote .
But it appears the trend of partisanship is here to stay .
Many of us are being raised in a time of politically correctness .
Where having an opinion is frowned upon unless it fits the accepted norm .
We ’re being raised where a debate does n’t resolve anything but the continuation through time .
So yes , we are polluting our planet far too much but the ice bergs would have melted anyway .
Stem cell research will allow for giant leaps in modern medicine but it ’s not worth it because it ’s a form of murder .
America is a country built on immigration yes , but Mexicans are different .
The war in Iraq was illegal , but the war on terror must be fought .
“ Bah Bah ” , said the sheep .
Digital Information Development ( DID ) has developed a highly portable virtual piano that is played with a keyboard consisting of projected laser beams .
The box - shaped device measures about 10 x 3 x 3 cm ( 4 x 1 x 1 in . ) and weighs about 100 grams ( 3.5 oz . ) .
Using a red semiconductor laser module and holographic optical element , the device projects a 25 - key 2 - octave keyboard onto the surface in front of it ( black surfaces do n't work because they absorb the light ) .
A CMOS camera module and infrared ( invisible ) red semiconductor laser module detect which keys are touched , and the corresponding notes are emitted from speakers built into the device .
Chords can also be played , and DID claims it is technically possible to reproduce weighted notes ( but presumably not with this version ) .
The keyboard has 3 other voices in addition to piano -- organ , pipe organ and harpsichord .
It is scheduled for release in Japan in November 2006 and is expected to cost around 15,000 yen ( US $ 130 ) .
DID says that a virtual 88 - key grand piano can be created by increasing the size of the device .

On Feb. 15 , 2005 , someone walked into a Connecticut library , sat down at a computer and used the Internet from 4 to 4:45 p.m .
Five months later , two FBI agents walked into George Christian 's Windsor office and handed him a letter .
It demanded " any and all subscriber information , billing information and access logs of any person or entity related to " the library computer 's IP address on that February day .
To Christian , executive director of the Library Connection , the scene seemed a G - man version of the Odd Couple : one agent dressed nattily in a blazer and tie ; the other gruff , in a knit muscle shirt .
And though the atmosphere of the meeting was tense , Christian suspected the FBI 's demand was n't its Priority No. 1 .
" It was addressed to the wrong person ; it was dated May 19 , 2005 , and it referred to an event that had taken place six months ago . "
The document they handed Christian was a national security letter , a piece of the Patriot Act few people had heard of at the time .
Did Christian understand , the agents asked , that he could discuss the letter with no one ?
" I said I did , but I would like to speak to my lawyer . "
" Fine , have him give me a call , " one agent said , and gave Christian his business card .
Even the agent apparently did n't know that the order he had handed Christian prohibited the library executive from discussing it with anyone - including his organization 's board of directors , his wife or even his own attorney .
Had the national security letter been issued to someone else , it might have attracted little attention or created much stir as its recipient complied with its terms .
But for Christian , whose agency oversees computer and other services for a consortium of 27 libraries around the state , it was a boot on his neck .
For one thing , he knew that Connecticut is one of 48 states with a statute expressly protecting the confidentiality of library users .
Secondly , the letter struck at the core of Christian 's definition of a library : " The nation 's most democratic institution that supports a free exchange of information . "
Nevertheless , Christian was caught in every thoughtful American 's dilemma with the Patriot Act .
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , existing surveillance laws seemed ineffectual vestiges of a half century past when the bad guys wore a uniform or a trench coat .
Facing a ubiquitous and virulent enemy with no particular geography or nationality , the government searched for broader authority .
The Patriot Act was promulgated quickly , while shocked and angry Americans were still staring at a chasm of ashes and fearful that their government could not protect them from further attack .
The national security letter is a written demand for information without a court order .
Under Section 505 of the Patriot Act ( adopted five years ago next week ) , searches are no longer confined to people under suspicion .
Anyone can be a target , as long as that person is considered relevant to a terrorism investigation .
The letter also comes with an automatic gag order that forbids the recipient from discussing the letter 's contents , or even the fact that the letter exists .
" You are further advised , " the letter to Christian said , " that Title 18 , U.S.C. Section 2709 ( c ) , prohibits any officer , employee or agent of yours from disclosing to any person that the FBI has sought or obtained access to information or records under these provisions . "
The Justice Department papered a lot of territory with the letters : businesses , colleges , even casinos .
Some 30,000 were going out annually , The Washington Post reported .
Proponents view the Patriot Act as necessary adaptation ; after all , there were no suicide bombers or terrorist cells in 1789 .
And sometimes personal freedoms have to be sacrificed for the sake of security .
Three months after its passage in 2001 , then - Attorney General John Ashcroft sharply dismissed critics , telling Congress : " To those who ... scare peace - loving people with phantoms of lost liberty , my message is this :
Your tactics only aid terrorists , for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve . "
In Windsor , however , lost liberty was no phantom .
To Christian it felt very real .
Even on a practical level , the FBI 's demand seemed wrong .
The government said it was interested in only about an hour and a half of computer data from that February day - but Christian knew such precise disclosure was not possible .
The FBI would have to siphon off a large stream of the telecommunications database , perhaps exposing the Internet activity of 300,000 library patrons .
But more importantly , as a student of the Constitution and a strong believer in its principles , Christian felt the FBI 's demand violated his library patrons '
First and Fourth Amendment rights - and he was not about to allow it .
" When a soldier takes his oath , he does n't swear to defend the president or the country .
He swears to defend the Constitution , " Christian said .
He believed he should deny the FBI 's request , but knew he could not make such a decision on his own .
" So I broke the law in small steps , " Christian said .
He set up a secret meeting with the library organization 's executive board .
Like Christian , the members of the Library Connection 's executive board are veteran librarians and staunch believers in the freedoms bestowed by the U.S. Constitution .
Beyond that , they understood the role of the library in preserving democracy .
And , after some difficult reflection , they all agreed with Christian 's assessment .
" We protect access to ideas , even if those ideas are unfashionable , " said Peter Chase , director of the Plainville Publc Library .
Chase serves on the board with Janet Nocek , head of the Portland library ; and Barbara Bailey , board president at the time and director of the Welles - Turner Memorial Library in Glastonbury .
" We are trained in privacy issues , " said Bailey .
" Protecting our clients ' privacy also guards freedom of ideas and expression . "
But never in Bailey 's education or training had she anticipated a showdown with the U.S. government .
It was , she conceded later , " an emotional roller - coaster . "
The decision to deny the FBI 's request was unanimous .
But not easy .
Nocek , for example , vigorously supports the government 's fight against terrorism , perhaps more than some .
She and her husband lost a longtime friend when the first plane hit the World Trade Center 's North Tower , and their colleagues had relatives who died .
" It became very personal , " she says quietly .
" We could have agreed to it and no one would ever know we sold out , " said Chase .
" But we would not .
They were illegally spying on citizens and wanted us to go along with it . "
Bailey worried about the other 14 members of the board whose opinions she could not poll .
This would have to be a decision made by just the four of them and would affect every library and library user in the state .
The librarians never argued the government 's need to conduct clandestine surveillance in the pursuit of homeland security .
Their concern was solely the absence of a court order , given that the government could easily obtain one from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court , created to handle these issues .
Further , they wanted the gag order lifted , not to disclose the contents of the letter , but to be able to testify before Congress , which was debating re-authorization of the Patriot Act .
They wanted to say that national security letters were indeed being used on libraries - something the government had denied .
The board members did their homework and discovered that , a year earlier , the American Civil Liberties Union had sued on behalf of a private New York Internet company that received a national security letter .
The judge ruled that the letter violated the company 's constitutional rights .
However , that ruling had been stayed and could not help them now .
They asked the ACLU to represent them and quickly learned the enormity of that decision :
They would have to sue the attorney general of the United States .
Still , they could not know that their decision would turn into a legal head - on collision of the First Amendment and the Patriot Act that commanded national news coverage for more than a year .
Ann Beeson , the ACLU 's associate legal director and lead attorney for the case , did n't trust the telephone .
Instead , the attorneys and the librarians communicated back and forth with e-mails they opened with a secret code , carefully watching should anyone come near .
On Aug. 9 , 2005 , the ACLU , on behalf of Library Connection Inc. , filed suit against U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , FBI Director Robert Mueller and an FBI official whose named was sealed .
The suit charged that the national security letter violated the Fourth Amendment because it demanded personal records without a court order , the Fifth Amendment because it is " unconstitutionally vague " and the First Amendment because of the gag order .
The case would be kept under tight seal and the Library Connection would be known only as John Doe .
The gag order was more like leg irons ; the librarians dragged it wherever they went .
The New York Times said the " Library issue has become the most divisive in the debate on whether Congress should expand or curtail the government 's power under the Patriot Act . "
" ... We have not sought a section 215 order to obtain library or bookstore records , medical records , or gun sale records , " Gonzales told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on April 27 last year .
" Let me be clear - the reading habits of ordinary Americans are of no interest to those investigating terrorists or spies , " he said .
The librarians wanted to scream .
This is a " national political debate of historic consequence , " said the ACLU .
But the court case could take years .
So , on Aug. 15 last year , the organization filed an emergency application with the U.S. District Court , 2nd District , to lift the gag order .
John
Doe won that round .
However , Judge Janet C. Hall stayed the ruling to give the government time to appeal .
Pleased with the ruling , but not her situation of still being barred from attending her own organization 's court hearing , Bailey recalls her anger : " We had just won the right to speak , but we were forced to sit in a small room in the Federal Building in Hartford , gagged , watching the proceedings in Bridgeport on closed - circuit TV .
I felt like I was living in ` 1984 , ' " she said referring to George Orwell 's classic novel about a repressed society .
The silence order made the librarians ' personal lives miserable .
This was the most difficult decision of their careers and they could n't confide in the people closest to them .
" How was I going to go to New York to meet with the ACLU staff and not tell my wife ? "
Chase recalls .
They never knew what would happen to them or how long the case would go on .
They went to work , sometimes scared , always worried .
In preparation for the case , Chase and Christian had to submit affidavits , which included their professional histories .
Chase had something in his record that could identify him :
He was one of the few Connecticut people selected for inclusion on the national Intellectual Freedom Commission 's Honor Roll .
It was in recognition for his successful fight to keep Madonna 's controversial book , " Sex , " on library shelves .
He feared other librarians would be able to deduce his identify , but those who did said nothing about it .
Then came an additional insult to their sensibilities .
In an apparent case of sloppy redacting , the FBI left exposed the names of both the Library Connection and Peter Chase in several documents posted on the district court 's website .
They were published in The New York Times .
Calls from the press kept coming , Chase could n't talk , and his staff simply took messages , no questions asked .
He is still touched by their deference to his plight .
The silence was the worst of it .
" We had only each other , " Bailey said .
But she got by with her sense of humor .
" When we went to meet with the ACLU attorneys [ in Manhattan ] , we got to Battery Park .
There were people dressed like the Statue of Liberty , so I had my picture taken with them .
I am the one holding up the American flag . "
Their meetings at the ACLU offices played like a scene from " All the President 's Men " where Bob Woodward meets Deep Throat in the garage .
" We could n't walk in together , could n't make eye contact with our attorney .
They would n't even introduce us to anyone , " Nocek recalls .
When she was summoned to jury duty , " They asked if I was involved in any civil suits .
I did n't know what to say .
Fortunately , I was n't asked to serve . "
One night , Chase returned home from work when his son , Samuel , rushed to him .
" Dad , someone from the AP [ Associated Press ] called and mentioned the FBI .
Are they coming after you ? "
" I answered , `I 'll be safe as long as I do n't talk about it . ' " He hoped that was true .
Nocek found that being mute has profound intellectual consequences .
Christian says he 'll never forget her analysis when she said : " Having your speech cut off impedes your thinking .
I had to put my thoughts into a box .
The lack of discourse truly affects the democratic process . "
There was another insult .
That spring , Chase , the president of Connecticut 's Intellectual Freedom Commission , was invited to debate the Patriot Act with U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor .
Of course , he could n't participate and had to keep his mouth shut , fuming inside as O'Connor told the audience that the government did n't use national security letters against libraries .
In the meantime , support for John Doe was coming from many directions .
Editorial writers took up its case .
The ACLU 's online petition , " Let John Doe Speak , " pulled 25,000 names .
The American Library Association and the Free Congress Foundation joined the ACLU at a rally in Washington , D.C. , to demand that the Justice Department lift the gag order .
Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , and Reps. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , and Bernard Sanders , I - Vt. , came to support them .
They were running out of time .
Congress was nearing the end of its debate .
A second emergency application , this time to the Federal Court of Appeals , failed to lift the stay .
All that was left was the Supreme Court , so the librarians brought their plea to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
In their plea , the ACLU lawyers said : " John Doe is a crucial messenger in the debate because it is the only known NSL recipient that can provide firsthand knowledge of the FBI 's use of NSLs to demand library records .
" Ginsburg , too , maintained the stay , but issued what the ACLU termed , " an unusually detailed opinion in which she noted the merits of the ACLU 's arguments . "
There was yet another insult .
John Doe was honored by The American Library Association with the 2005 Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award , which was to be presented at its convention in Texas .
But the guests of honor had been stripped of the intellectual freedom to comment or attend .
The clock ran out .
In March of this year , President Bush signed the revised Patriot Act into law .
The Connecticut librarians had lost their chance to participate in the debate .
Then came a cascade of events that , although welcome , deprived the four of their hoped - for court ruling on the constitutional issues .
Incredibly , about six weeks after Congress re-authorized the Patriot Act , the FBI voluntarily lifted the gag order .
" Clearly , national security was n't threatened , " said Chase .
" This was sheer hypocrisy and unapologetic deception .
And I was supposed to throw my lot into it . "
Nocek learned about it from her husband , who was reading the newspaper while they were flying home from Europe .
He mused that the librarians " had done the right thing , " unaware that one of them was sitting right next to him .
The relief was immense .
" Finally I could tell him a little , " Nocek says .
They still could not speak to the public until the court processed the FBI 's withdrawal of the gag order .
In May , John Doe was named " Outstanding Librarian of the Year " by the Connecticut Library Association .
The association asked Bailey , as president of both the Connection and of the Library Association , to accept the award on Doe 's behalf .
She had to find an excuse to decline .
Next , the federal appeals court acted on the FBI 's withdrawal and officially lifted the gag order .
The four librarians held their first press conference on May 30 , although there were still some constraints on what could be said .
The second shoe dropped three weeks later , on June 26 , when the government abandoned its demand for the information altogether .
A letter from the FBI 's New Haven bureau to the ACLU said it would " not seek to enforce the national security letter delivered to your client , Library Connection , Inc. , by FBI personnel on or about July 12 , 2005 . "
They were free - for the most part .
In June , Chase attended the American Library Association Convention in New Orleans .
" We announced that the FBI had abandoned the case and everyone drank a toast . "
That same month , the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information honored the four with the Stephen Collins Award for their " commitment to the public 's right to know . "
This time , they could accept it .
" But it 's not over , " Chase warned .
" There are still sealed documents that , when opened , will show [ the Justice Department 's ] arguments are not what they said they were . "
It did n't take long .
On Aug. 3 , 2006 , Justice Ginsburg ordered some of those documents open .
The FBI had sealed some pretty benign stuff : the judges ' positive comments on John Doe 's arguments ; a copy of the New York Times that published the names exposed by FBI error ; and a list of clichés from previous cases the ACLU had cited in its argument , such as " Once the cat is out of the bag , " " The ballgame is over " and " The genie is out of the bottle . "
But with the abandonment of the government 's request , there would be no resolution , something all four librarians regret .
But not the fight .
Nocek : " Because the terrorists tried to scare us all , we should refuse to be scared .
The best way to honor those who died on 9/11 is to support our freedoms .
If we are quiet , we take away the very thing we are fighting for . "
Chase : " The NSL is catastrophic for the nation .
For government to be viable , it can not abuse its powers .
It 's just as important as the privacy of the voting booth . "
Bailey : " This has been a year out of our lives .
It was very scary , but I learned a lot .
I would like people 's awareness to be heightened and my fellow librarians not to be afraid . "
Beeson : " This administration has repeatedly shown that it will hide behind the cloak of national security to silence its critics and cover up embarrassing facts .
Every time the government invokes national security in defense of secrecy - as they 've done most recently with NSA [ National Security Agency ] wiretapping - the American public should remember these four librarians . "
Christian : " I view myself as a patriot .
The people who invented this country knew we had to be vigilant to keep what they were fighting for : dignity , human rights and political rights . "
He quoted one of those inventors , Benjamin Franklin : " They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety . "

Outstanding stuff !!
Really pretty girl , and the eyes and mouth look pretty much photoreal !
I find the plant on the middle left distracting though - it would look better if it didnt seem to be transparent .
I like the out of focus background too .
Excellent shader work .
Thanks for the super - high res image - its now my wallpaper
Ace !
ROME — Every patient in the cardiac care unit at the San Filippo Neri Hospital who survives a heart attack goes home with a prescription for purified fish oil , or omega - 3 fatty acids .
“ It is clearly recommended in international guidelines , ” said Dr. Massimo Santini , the hospital ’s chief of cardiology , who added that it would be considered tantamount to malpractice in Italy to omit the drug .
In a large number of studies , prescription fish oil has been shown to improve survival after heart attacks and to reduce fatal heart rhythms .
The American College of Cardiology recently strengthened its position on the medical benefit of fish oil , although some critics say that studies have not defined the magnitude of the effect .
But in the United States , heart attack victims are not generally given omega - 3 fatty acids , even as they are routinely offered more expensive and invasive treatments , like pills to lower cholesterol or implantable defibrillators .
Prescription fish oil , sold under the brand name Omacor , is not even approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in heart patients .
Episode 30 " WHERE THE **F#@K** HAVE YOU BEEN ? " the Boss screams at me the moment I try my key in the door to mission control .
" Uh ... On holiday ? " I respond , noting two things - ( a ) my key does n't fit and ( b ) the door 's new .
" You should know , you signed the leave form !
Or you could have asked the PFY . "
" Oh I was on holiday too , " the PFY says , bringing up the rear .
" But he signed my leave form as well . "
" That 's uncommonly generous of you , letting us both off at the same time ! " I say , turning to the Boss .
" Now how do we get into our office ? "
" It 's not your office any more - we took on new Systems people when you abandoned the workplace . "
" Abandoned the workplace ?
We were on leave - and you apparently signed both forms which means you must have known it ! "
" I.. do n't recall any such thing !
In any case , it 's just bloody irresponsible for you both to go on holiday at the same time without being contactable . "
" I had my mobile with me , " I counter .
" I tried it and got no response ! "
" Well , coverage in the third world is always a bit dodgy ... "
" Really ? " the PFY responds .
" Where did you go , Luton ? "
" Luton , Hull and Glasgow .
A package hole - iday "
" You did n't drink the water did you ? "
" Hell no , my interpreter warned me about that ! "
" LOOK ! " the Boss interrupts .
" We were talking about you two not being needed any longer .
We 've replaced you ! "
" Oh , right ! " the PFY says .
" Okay then , if you 'll just organise the cheques we 'll be on our way . "
" What cheques ? "
" The contract severance cheques - in our contract ...? "
" Contract ? "
" Our contract with the company , " I explain helpfully .
" Premature termination of the rolling contract outside of a negotiation period incurs a penalty payment equivalent to the remaining period plus one full period of the rolled - on contract . "
" Which means ? "
" You 'd have to pay us a full year plus the six or so weeks left in this contract . "
" Unless I wait six weeks for the ' negotiation period ' then decide not to renew your contract ... "
" You could do that , yes , but who'd run the systems ? "
" The two new guys .
They 're permanent staff - much cheaper than contractors ! "
" And you seriously think they 'll still be here in six weeks ? "
" I would n't even put money on six minutes ! " the PFY says helpfully .
" Well we ca n't get rid of them ! " as the two geeks in question roll up .
. . .
Two minutes and a very quick recce later . . .
" I ca n't say I like what you 've done with the place " I say to one of the geeks .
" Where 's the tape safe door ? "
" We had to cut it off to get to the backup tapes because no one could find the keys - like we had to break down the door to this room because it did n't use the building keying system . "
" Just ensuring data protection on site with enhanced physical security , " I comment .
" If it 's that protected why were n't there any tapes in the safe ? "
" That 's the first place a corporate spy would look . "
" So where ARE the backup tapes ? "
" In boxes in the storeroom marked ' Asbestos ceiling tiles ' . "
" WE GOT AN ENVIROMENTAL PROTECTION GROUP TO DUMP THEM ! " the second geek gasps .
" I see .
And the financials archive media ? "
" What archive media ? "
" About a hundred DVDs which used to be in a bin in the corner marked ' Used Needles , dispose of with care ' . "
" Why the hell would you put backups in there !? ! "
" Again , Data security .
I mean , who in their right mind would go fossicking around in there ?
And where 's the Dilbert doll from my monitor ? "
" We probably threw it out when we cleaned up . "
" Not thinking as you did so that it was rather heavy for a doll - to the tune of a set of tape safe keys ? "
" You should have been more careful with them , " the first geek snaps .
" So you cut the door off a ten grand fireproof tape safe , dumped about five grand worth of backup tapes , then destroyed the company 's financial archives and you 're giving me suggestions about due care ? "
" YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THE TAPE SAFES !! " the geek shouts .
" And what would the tapes have looked like after someone had thermal lanced the door off the safe ? "
" I... "
" But more importantly , how long have you worked for our opposition ? "
" What ? !? " the geeks , Boss and PFY say in unison .
" Well look at the facts , they 've destroyed our backups , archives and tape safe and have probably not taken any backups since ... "
" WE HAD TO BUY NEW TAPES ! " the first geek cries .
" And , if I 'm not mistaken , have isolated the fire suppression system in preparation for the tragic workplace fire .... "
" IT'S HALON , YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT ANY MORE ! "
The PFY and I raise our eyebrows at the Boss wordlessly .
" GET ME SECURITY ! "
Ah , it 's great to be back in the saddle again . ®

Featuritis vs. the Happy User Peak
It 's a gazillion degrees in my house right now , but I can't figure out the thermostat controls , so the heat 's still on and the air conditioning unreachable .
My new Denon receiver / tuner sounds amazing -- good thing I 'm using it mostly with my iPod ; I have no clue how to tune in a radio station .
When I bring up the newer versions of Microsoft Word , it looks so utterly foreign and overwhelming to me now that I give up and close it .
And all I wanted to do was type a simple letter ...
Most of you here know that Don Norman talked about this forever in the classic The Design of Everyday Things , but why did n't the designers and manufacturers listen ?
My new Subaru factory - supplied car stereo uses that most evil of designs -- modes .
With so many features to support , they ran out of controls ... so every control does multiple things depending on which mode you 're in .
None of it is intuitive or natural .
Lose the manual and I 'm screwed .
Ten years ago , if you 'd told me I 'd one day need a manual to use my car radio , that would have been inconceivable .
All I want to do is find a frickin ' radio station !
Here 's a little list of some of the things that seem to suffer the most from pushing too far past that " Happy User Peak " :
* Courses that pack way too much content in .
The learner is " exposed " to material that 's " covered " , but the learner has n't truly " learned " much and can't " do " much .
Sun has a great 12 - day Java course , except for one problem ... it 's delivered as a five - day class .
The students leave on Friday with their heads exploding , unable to remember where they parked the car let alone how to compile their Java code .
* Stereos ( or other consumer electronics and appliances ) that use " modal " controls so that you cannot obviously figure out how to make it do the most BASIC FRICKIN ' THINGS ; (
* Software that keeps adding feature upon feature until the simple things you used to do are no longer simple , and the whole thing feels overwhelming .
* Technical books that try to be " complete " but do n't provide the focus and filtering and weighting the reader was hoping for .
The more that 's in the book , the longer it 's going to take the learner ( and the harder it 'll be ) to actually get through and learn .
And the greater the chance that they 'll stop reading before they become successful and have " I Rule " experiences .
This seems to happen most when the publisher / editor / author did n't want to commit with both feet to being a learning book vs. a reference book , and tried to do both .
When I see marketing copy for a learning book that says , " And you 'll refer to it again and again after you finish ... " or , " You 'll want to keep it close even when you 're done . " red flags start flying .
Reference books are for referring to ( like the wonderful Nutshell series ) .
Learning books are for reading once , maybe with some extra review , and a refresh if you do n't use what you learned right away , but that 's about it .
( Note : our books suck as reference books . )
So again , why does this happen so often ?
Our guess is fear .
Fear of being perceived as having fewer features than your competitors .
Fear that you wo n't be viewed as complete .
Fear that people are making purchase decisions off of a checklist , and that he who has the most features wins ( or at the least , that he who has the fewest features definitely loses ) .
Fear of losing key clients who say , " If you do n't add THIS ... I 'll have to go elsewhere . "
Screw 'em .
We believe that those providing the products and services that give the most " I Rule " experiences , without tipping too far over the Happy User Peak , will be the most successful .
( Obviously there are a ton of exceptions , and yes of course I 'm overgeneralizing . )
Push back .
Of course you 'll lose customers if you stop adding as many new features .
Or will you ?
What if instead of adding new features , a company concentrated on making the service or product much easier to use ?
Or making it much easier to access the advanced features it already has , but that few can master ?
Maybe what they lose in market share in one area will be more than compensated for in another area .
In a lot of markets , it 's gotten so bad out there that simply being usable is enough to make a product truly remarkable .
We will resist the siren call of the market , because we believe the best path is :
Give users what they actually want , not what they say they want .
And whatever you do , do n't give them new features just because your competitors have them !
Each of our books , for example , covers fewer topics than its closest competitors .
Yet we outsell all of them , and part of that is precisely because we cover less .
Our readers learn fewer topics , but nail the important ones , and it turned out that for most people , nailing it was more important than reading it .
Our readers put their trust in us to work hard at finding and focusing on what really matters , and brutally cutting the cognitive overload that comes with the rest , and we try not to let them down .
( We definitely do n't always get it right ...
I had to add a huge new chapter to the second edition of Head First Java , for example , because so many readers felt that collections / data structures were too important to have been relegated to an appendix . )
Be brave .
And besides , continuing to pile on new features eventually leads to an endless downhill slide toward poor usability and maintenance .
A negative spiral of incremental improvements .
Fighting and clawing for market share by competing solely on features is an unhealthy , unsustainable , and unfun way to live .
Be the " I Rule " product , not the " This thing I bought does everything , but I suck ! " product .
And I 'll be your happy user : )

I think one of the best user interfaces I 've come across is the Lexmark all in one center on my dad 's PC .
He has a Lexmark X1100 all in one scanner / copier / printer .
The software for it features three " modes " ( though here they 're used differently to how your car stereo uses them ) - beginner , intermediate and expert .
The beginner UI has just three buttons , and a couple of drop - down boxes : just enough to do the three main functions , taking all the common default settings .
The intermediate UI builds on that , adding some controls for things you might want to change if you 're a little more confident in your abilities or want to experiment a bit , but you 'll still get decent results with it , and nothing that 's on the beginner UI is moved anywhere you 're not expecting to see it .
The advanced UI builds on it even further , so that you have an industrial strength graphic artist 's scanning and printing tool combined with a full - fat photocopier type menu - but by the time you get to that menu , you know all the basics inside out , and anything else is just fine tuning and special effects .
The learning curve is deliberately kept nice and smooth , and shallow - so that the user can rule from the get - go , and continue to rule as he or she gains experience and seeks further learning with their equipment .
That to me is the only really good use for " modes " in UI design , and it * so * works .

hi , i've been dropping by for quite a bit ;
p
I can totally relate to the car radio - years ago when I was a kid I used to be able to program car radios for my parents .
Now owning my own car itself , is a whole different matter .
Too many dials and buttons , and even though I 've been taught how to use it ( although it might be a common misconception that females can't work electrical items - it will be true on my end ) I still can't get the full function of it WITHOUT looking at the manual .
Gone were the " I RULE ! " days , really .
No doubt features are the greatest sellable points of a product , however if the user itself is unable to make it work , then there is n't a point anymore - Features are then done for only one purpose - to garner sales .
I sorta miss those days when I ( as a kid ) could even work things out on my own , truly .
;p Well , just a little two cents from me anyway !
Posted by : Jill | Jun 13 , 2005 7:09:27 AM
I 've long joked that the next great " breakthrough " in software development will be the REMOVAL of features .
Case in point : I use Photoshop and Word constantly ( and have for many years ) .
However , I 'm convinced that Microsoft and Adobe could n't care less about their customers .
Their goal is simply to keep us on the upgrade treadmill ; to come up with enough new features to justify putting out a new product " upgrade " every 18 months .
Their true goal is to create a steady , predictable revenue stream .
Screw the customer .
The problem is that both products already have so many obscure , seldom - used , poorly - implemented features that they 've become bloated pigs .
I rarely use more than a fraction of the features available in either program .
The rest of them just get in my way and complicate matters .
So , in the near future , when both Microsoft and Adobe run out of lame ideas for new " features " and the software becomes virtually unusable , they 'll simply start to REMOVE them .
That way they can sell us " ease - of - use " upgrades ... and keep the revenue stream flowing .

You 've described my cell phone experience .
The last time I was getting a cell phone my husband asked me what kind I wanted and I said one I can make phone calls on that wo n't dial anyone by accident in my pocket .
It turns out it was cheaper to get one with more bells and whistles .
So now I have a camera phone that periodically takes pictures of the inside of pocket and is more complicated than necessary as a result .
And I would never take pictures with it because it's a wretched camera .
A nice simple phone that was just a phone would be so much nicer ... :)

Two things happened over the last two days .
One , some shopping on kids toys , which I capture here http://ecophilo.blogspot.com/2005/06/fisher-price-toys.html and the other a plain boring presentation meant to be a training .
Fisher price toys ( or similar makes ) are the best user experience to a child .
They engage the child , not for a moment do they appear pedantic and by the end of it , theres a lot of learning .
If only my presenter would have learned that , I wouldnt have dozed off during training .

Hallelujah .
I discovered this blog a few weeks ago and find myself saying " Hallelujah " a lot .
Or " Right on ! " or simply , " Yes ! "
Another benefit of a clear , simple interface is that if a function you want is n't available , you can learn this fact easily and move on .
With a complex interface , you have to push a lot of buttons and read the manual to even figure out that it does n't do that .
And you 'll never really be sure ; you 'll carry the nagging uncertainty around with you until it settles in as a knot in your neck or something .

I have the exact same problem with both my Honeywell thermostat and Denon A/V Receiver !
Solution for the thermostat : Buy a " low - end " simple thermostat .
It wo n't feed the cats and brew the coffee but my fiancée IS able to change the temperature .
Solution for the Denon : I 've never figured out how to use its radio tuner .
So I just stream radio stations from my Mac into the Denon using an Airport Express .
( Actually , that 's not true .
Once , after spending an hour with the manual , I was able to preset some radio stations .
But the next time I wanted to listen to the radio I had forgotten how to do it . )
Posted by : Nate | Jun 13 , 2005 11:45:52 AM
I just spent a couple of days shopping for a car stereo , and boy is this true .
I started out trying to compare models on features and price , but this ended up being frustrating because 90 % of the features are ones I do n't care about .
Finally , since I mainly wanted something to play MP3 CDs when I was n't using my iPod , I just took an MP3 CD to a couple of stores and played with every model .
I bought the first one I was able to figure out completely without looking at any instructions , which turned out to be a nice JVC .
It 's amazing how many of them include ridiculous features ( a VIDEO SCREEN SAVER on a car stereo ? ) but do n't properly display the names of songs or implement " next track " and " previous track " buttons with single functions .
Posted by : Michael Moncur | Jun 13 , 2005 12:08:33 PM
Car radios should be SIMPLE .
When I am driving along at 65 mph is not when I want to have to scan the radio to see what mode I am in and try to figure out how to change the station .
My real pet peeve though is electronic equipment that REQUIRES the remote to do simple things .
I can't program my VCR to record a show unless I find the damn remote .
And my DVD player does n't let me skip to the next program unless I find the damn remote .
Do n't any of these damn engineers have kids ?
As far as software features , I have no problem with adding features after all there are some people who want and need these features .
BUT make sure that it is still simple enough for the occasional user who just wants to write a memo .

MATT : I agree with you that user - level modes can be an excellent approach , and I think having multiple user levels is also REALLY useful and important ( keeps the challenge levels right , etc . )
The " modal " problem is much more malicious when it's in device controls .
JILL : Yep , I can so relate . : )
But now even my very geek , very hip teenage daughter can't be bothered to figure out the radio .
She just puts on her iPod headphones ...
JOHNNY : " That way they can sell us " ease - of - use " upgrades ... and keep the revenue stream flowing . "
Oh , that is priceless Johnny ... because it just is n't that much of a stretch to believe it could happen ; )
GRUMPY : I bet there 's a whole flickr group 's worth of people with pictures of the inside of their pockets !
I like your response to the question about what kind of cell phone you wanted ... one that can make calls .
I wish the stereo people had asked what I wanted in a CAR RADIO ( one that lets me play the radio without having to become a licensed car audio specialist ) .
BILL : You make a really important point about that nagging feeling .
It took me months to be sure that my original digital camcorder would not let me control the exposure manually , but now that I think about it , I still have that little nagging doubt ...
MICHAEL : I am now SO pissed off that my car radio does n't have a video screen saver .
TOM : Totally agree .
Maybe the car insurance companies should raise or lower your premiums based on the kind of car stereo you have ...
Thanks everyone .
It 's always nice to be reminded that it 's not your fault you can't set the clock on your digital devices ...

Posted by : Mike | Jun 13 , 2005 6:54:27 PM
Kathy -
Agreed ; what 's needed for a car stereo is the main controls to be big and friendly and accessible by just leaning across and groping around for them without once taking one 's eye off the road .
Ideally the control shouls be placed on the steering column , and should be so simple to use it 's instinctive .
The last thing you want is something you have to think about even for a second - that way lies fatalities , if you 're trying to sort out your CDs at 70 m ph +.
Posted by : Matt Moran | Jun 14 , 2005 8:25:17 AM
I can relate to the " featuritis " issue specially in audio appliances .
Every year I see consumer - grade stereos trying to pack in more and more " features " , most of dubious value at best , pure marketing BS at worst .
It 's like if stereo makers were trying to push sales because of the lots of features they cram on their products in " look at all you 're getting for your money " fashion .
The contrast with what you see on the high - end audio market - which I 'm familiar with - is startling .
Most high - end amplifiers , for instance , feature at most a selector knob , a volume control and a power button .
Period .
End of story .
And we 're talking about components with 4 - to - 5 - figure price tags ( It 's what 's inside the box what counts ) .
Probably in few markets the " less is more " statement is as true as in high - end audio , in my experience .

Greetings ,
Well said , but I bet you never thought quite how old the feeling is ...
" Perfection is achieved , not when there is nothing more to add , but when there is nothing left to take away . " -- Antoine de Saint - Exupery ( 1900 - 1944 )
I 'm sure there are even older quotes , but that 's the one I 'm especially familiar with because I put it in the source comments of my software , just to remind me .
( Not that it always helps , of course ; I am but a weak human , and those custom controls are so pretty ... )
-- Morgan Schweers
Posted by : Morgan Schweers | Jun 14 , 2005 6:19:20 PM
" Less is more . "
Originally a Miles Davis quote , I think , so not as old as M de Saint - Expury , but shorter ;)
The important thing is that simplicity has to be carried through .
A DVD player with one button and one dial looks great , but if it means using a tangle of modes and menus behind the scenes then it 's only half a job .
The designer 's intent is clear - unfortunately , she 's compromised with the marketing department 's demand for more features .
Forgive me if this situation sounds like a cliche , but cliches are cliches for a reason .
Posted by : Moomintroll | Jun 15 , 2005 3:56:27 AM
My mistake : " less is more " is apparently a Robert Browning quote from 1855 .

Since we are using musical comparisons , one of my favorite comments from Stevie Ray Vaughan was when he said that learning to play lots of notes really fast on the guitar was easy , the tricky part was learning which not to play .
I am not so sure my little fingers agree with the first part but I have listened to enough really boring speed players to agree with the second .
Posted by : Julie | Jun 15 , 2005 11:23:35 AM
I have to say I disagree .
Not that products should n't be easy to use , but I disagree with the assessment that companies that put lots of features in their product do n't understand or care about usability .
The program manager for Word , Publisher , and OneNote , Chris Pratley , has written much about the development of MS Word on his blog : ( REQUIRED READING ! )
http://blogs.msdn.com/chris_pratley/archive/2004/04/27/120944.aspx
One of the comments to this article makes the exact point I 'm making here , so I 'll just quote it :
" Everyone talks about feature bloat in word , often saying that ' 90 % of the customers only use 10 % of the features . '
This is true ... however , each customer uses a * slightly different * 10 % cross section of the feature base ... and in order to truly hit 90 % of the customers you really do need all ( or most ) of the features .
I think that the Word team has done an admirable job of growing exponentially in inherent complexity and feature count without getting much harder to use . "
- Joseph R. Jones
Some of their attempts to make the product easier to use have failed ( clippy ) , but others ( imho ) have really been effective ( smart tags , task pane ) .
Let me ask YOU : what features would YOU remove from MS Word ?
And what are you going to tell the 4.7 million people that NEED that feature for their next report / project / document ?
( Even if only 1 % of Word users use a feature , that 's still a PRETTY HUGE number ! )
Posted by : BradC | Jun 16 , 2005 8:49:56 AM
This all works well UNTIL YOU DISCOVER that the simplified product DOES NOT include a feature you need or really want .
Apple is a shocker for doing this --
There is no way that I could find to remove or disable a user account , burn a multisession CD , at least I found multiple tabs in the webbrowser after going through the preferences .
Maybe my requirements are sometimes a little unual but I find that simplified programs rarely cut it .
I just have to go with the programs with " featuritis " and mentally tune out the stuff that is not important to me .
Posted by : Danni Coy | Jun 16 , 2005 5:08:58 PM
Comparing choosing content for a book ( or playing music on an iPod ) to complex software like Photoshop or Word is just ridiculous .
In general , this post presents a real problem that users face but presents a vast oversimplification of the issue .
Yes , compaines should emphasize making existing features easier to use , but they should also add new features as technology improves .
It does not have to be an either / or situation .
BradC is right on point in pointing out that every user is using their particular 10 % of the software .
Photoshop is used by so many different user segments and it is still not a complete solution for many of them .
It may be complete for your use , but there are many users who complain of its shortcomings .
How can a product allow the user to get to what they want to do as quickly as possible ?
Halting the addition of features is not the answer .
A better question is how can products learn about its users ( what they want to do ) and present a more customized experience .
Posted by : Mark | Jun 17 , 2005 1:18:36 PM
More direct information from Word 's creators :
http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/28/81532.aspx
" Another issue we have is the variety of Office users .
It ’s often said that no one uses more than 60 % of Word ’s features .
On the other hand , every feature that ’s in Word is used by somebody — well , I suspect that nobody uses Marching Red Ants , but the list of features that go completely unused is really very small .
This variety of users implies a variety of itches .
Talking to a handful of users , or even talking to some people who administer Macs in a large organization , can lead to a skewed understanding of our users needs .
And , again , I want to emphasize that we ’re talking about their needs in terms of what tasks they want to accomplish , not their needs in terms of specific feature requests . "
Posted by : BradC | Jun 17 , 2005 3:31:56 PM
Mark : you 're right , I 've definitely way oversimplified to make a point , you missed my standard " I 'm way oversimplifying " disclaimer that implicitly appears at the top of every post ; )
But I absolutely agree with you .
" A better question is how can products learn about its users ( what they want to do ) and present a more customized experience . "
That is the heart of it .
The best designed products may not have to make the tradeoff of features for ease of use .
If removing features improves the user experience , then it 's probably because the user experience itself was never well - designed .
So " features " is a relative term .
What feels like too many in one product , might be just the right amount in another , better designed user experience .
And I should n't have picked on Word in my opening example .
That was simply * my * feeling about Word .
We did our first book in Word , and I was struggling horribly .
The next book ( and all the others ) we did in Adobe InDesign , and it just felt lighter and more intuitive .
But that was just one person 's experience , and I never took the time to learn Word .
But then again , I never even cracked the manual on InDesign ...
I might disagree with this one statement , though :
" Comparing choosing content for a book ( or playing music on an iPod ) to complex software like Photoshop or Word is just ridiculous . "
The core of the problem comes down to cognitive overhead , and being able to withstand the pressure to add features .
But if your point is that a software product could find a way to deal with this -- through a customized experience -- then I reckon you 're right .
I should think about this more ...

I wrestle with this issue all the time on our site , Logware .
Our customers love us because of our easy to use interface and ' to the point ' features , but I find I spend half my time wrestling with whether to add a new feature and loose simplicity or gain ' one more customer ' for some silly feature request that will only confuse everyone and be used by one user .
It is a balance .
Spending time on UI is usually what happens .
I talk to users and find out their ideas and then sneak the new features into the app without scaring anyone .
I also find that if I start a dialogue about the feature ' before ' I roll it out , I alienate less users .

You can do the most basic things with it : call , answear , send and recive text messages and turn it on and off .

If your site uses user - accounts why not just add that feature for that user ?

Pete that if he does n't comply , their relationship is off .
" It is also alleged that the couple had a blazing row last week after Kate saw the Babyshambles singer flirting with a French woman at popular London concert venue , Brixton Academy .
The source is quoted by Britain 's Daily Star newspaper as saying : " They were screaming at each other the whole night .
" Kate knows he loves her but he 's a free spirit and there 's no holding him down .
He hates it when she gets jealous .
She gets really wound up by him getting into intellectual conversations with arty young women who idolise him as a poet . "
Kate and Pete are apparently planning to marry in Ibiza on her 33rd birthday in January next year .
She agreed to marry the rocker after he checked into The Priory rehab centre to battle his addictions to crack cocaine and heroin .
Since leaving rehab Pete has managed to stay clean .
The discovery comes weeks after the fifth anniversary
Scene of excavation
The remains were found in rubble excavated from a manhole near the site of the World Trade Center .
Relatives say the find proves the need for a thorough new search of the area around Ground Zero .
" We can no longer rely on accidental discoveries , " said WTC Families for Proper Burial in a statement .
' Never fully searched '
" This must be a deliberate search .
May this awful news be the catalyst needed to go back and do the job well . "
Families of more than 1,100 of the victims of 9/11 have never received any remains of their loved ones .
The campaign group is to hold a news conference over the latest discovery later on Friday .
The BBC's Jeremy Cooke in New York says that for some of the relatives , the find is an indication that the site has never been fully searched for the remains of the 2,749 people who died there .
Charles Wolfe , whose wife Kathryn was among the victims , told the BBC he was totally shocked by the new discovery of body parts , adding that in his view , there was a major shortfall in the original recovery effort .
Abandoned site
The material excavated from the manholes was removed from the site without anyone noticing it contained the remains , said utility company Consolidated Edison .
No official identifications have been made at this time
Patrick J Brennan , Mayor 's Community Assistance Unit
On Thursday , the Port Authority contractor spotted the remains , the Associated Press news agency said .
Some of the remains were as big as arm or leg bones , Steve Coleman , a spokesman for the Port Authority , was quoted by AP as saying .
Construction workers have been instructed to look for human remains and notify the medical examiner 's office when they find them .
" No official identifications have been made at this time and the New York City Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner are heading up the investigation , " said Patrick J Brennan of the Mayor 's Community Assistance Unit was quoted by the AP news agency .
The discovery comes just weeks after the fifth anniversary of the attacks .
Earlier this year , construction workers in New York discovered 74 bone fragments from 9/11 victims .
The remains were found mixed in with roofing material at the condemned Deutsche Bank building , which stands next to Ground Zero .
Binyamin Netanyahu launched a bid to unseat the Israeli prime minister , Ariel Sharon , yesterday in a challenge that threatens to split the ruling party and cause a radical realignment of Israeli politics .
Mr Netanyahu said he will seek the leadership of the ruling Likud party ahead of a general election next year , a contest he appears likely to win with the backing of the party 's dominant rightwing , which is embittered by Mr Sharon 's demolition of Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip .
But Mr Sharon , who commands more support than Mr Netanyahu with the wider public , is not expected to bow out of politics without a fight and some of his supporters are urging him to launch a new political party in alliance with the Israeli left .
Opinion polls suggest such an alliance would win a national election .
Mr Netanyahu , who served as prime minister from 1996 for three years , launched his challenge by accusing the prime minister of betraying Likud 's core belief in Israel claiming occupied land as its own .
" Sharon abandoned the principles of the Likud and has decided to go another way - the way of the left .
He is threatening to destroy the party that he built with his own hands , " said Mr Netanyahu .
" The Likud needs a leader who can unite the nation and smooth the fissure developing in the country and in the party , someone who represents the party 's principles , and I believe that I can do that . "
The contest between the two men , who loathe each other , is shaping up to be bitter .
On Monday Mr Sharon said his rival , who quit the government a week before the Gaza pullout after previously voting for withdrawal , was too weak to govern .
" Anyone who gets up and flees before disengagement , after he 's supported it four times , is fleeing from responsibility , " the prime minister said .
" He panics and loses his wits .
I 've seen him that way not just one time , but many times .
That 's Netanyahu . "
Likud is expected to hold the leadership election in November .
If Mr Netanyahu wins , as opinion polls suggest , he is expected to bring down the governing coalition and force a general election in February , nine months ahead of its due date .
But while Mr Netanyahu is favoured to unseat Mr Sharon as party leader he is far from assured of being Israel 's next prime minister .
Opinion polls show that Mr Netanyahu only has a clear shot at running the country if Mr Sharon can be persuaded to quit politics .
But if the prime minister were to create a new centre - right party for the next election , taking a core of prominent Likud politicians with him , he would emerge in a strong position to put together a coalition government with Labour and the third largest party in the present parliament , Shinui .
Mr Netanyahu would then struggle to form a working administration as he would have to rely on smaller far - right and religious parties for support .
Labour is already implicitly throwing its weight behind Mr Sharon in the belief that he is the party 's best hope of remaining as a partner in government , as it stands little chance of winning the election .
A Labour cabinet minister , Ofir Pines Paz , said Mr Sharon had effectively broken with Likud . " [ He ] said he adopted the policy of the Labour party , which practically he did .
He adopted the policy of the peace camp in Israel , " he said .
" Our supporters feel that we have to give more credit to the government and try , really try , to see if there 's a possibility to continue " in government .
But some of Mr Sharon 's allies in Likud said the party would be foolish to topple its leader when he has so much public support .
" I 've never before seen collective suicide committed with such joy , " said a cabinet minister , Meir Shetreet .
The worldwide market is at work , and traders and speculators are driving up the price , based on uncertainty of supplies and inventories , and presumably becoming very rich in the process ( at least some of them ) .
That 's the market at work .
It 's not up to the government to set the price or to fix the situation except by opening more space for exploration , and even that may not help .

In the same way , even I was startled when I read about the pay of Lee R. Raymond , the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil , who recently retired .
His retirement package was in the neighborhood of $ 400 million  a breathtaking sum , even for those of us who admire the job that Big Oil does and think that the industry gets a bum rap .
Still , that 's between him and his stockholders , not a matter for Congress .
And it would not even remotely be addressed by a windfall profits tax  an idea that has been tried and has failed miserably .
The real problem is the difference between the rich  including rich oil people , of whom there are not many , but there are enough  and the poor .
It is up to the government to redress this extraordinary difference in incomes of the rich and the nonrich , even at the margins .
What Congress can do , and should do , is address the stunning underpayment of military men and women and the staggering budget deficits that will be a burden on our posterity for decades , by raising the taxes on the rich .
It 's fine that there are rich people .
It 's even fine that there are superrich people .
But if they are superrich , they derive special benefits from life in the United States that the nonrich do n't .
For one thing , they can make the money in a safe environment , which is not true for the rich in many countries .
It is just common decency that they should pay much higher income taxes than they do .
Taxes for the rich are lower than they have been since at least World War II  that is to say , in 60 years .
This makes no sense in a world at war , in a nation with so many unmet social needs , in a nation with so many people without health care , in a nation running immense and endless deficits .
Hooray !

The most common retort against privacy advocates – by those in favor of ID checks , cameras , databases , data mining and other wholesale surveillance measures – is this line : " If you are n't doing anything wrong , what do you have to hide ? "
Some clever answers : " If I 'm not doing anything wrong , then you have no cause to watch me . "
" Because the government gets to define what 's wrong , and they keep changing the definition . "
" Because you might do something wrong with my information . "
My problem with quips like these – as right as they are – is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong .
It 's not .
Privacy is an inherent human right , and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect .
Two proverbs say it best : Quis custodiet custodes ipsos ?
( " Who watches the watchers ? " ) and " Absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
Cardinal Richelieu understood the value of surveillance when he famously said , " If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man , I would find something in them to have him hanged . "
Watch someone long enough , and you 'll find something to arrest – or just blackmail – with .
Privacy is important because without it , surveillance information will be abused : to peep , to sell to marketers and to spy on political enemies – whoever they happen to be at the time .
Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power , even if we 're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance .
We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom .
We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation .
We keep private journals , sing in the privacy of the shower , and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them .
Privacy is a basic human need .
A future in which privacy would face constant assault was so alien to the framers of the Constitution that it never occurred to them to call out privacy as an explicit right .
Privacy was inherent to the nobility of their being and their cause .
Of course being watched in your own home was unreasonable .
Watching at all was an act so unseemly as to be inconceivable among gentlemen in their day .
You watched convicted criminals , not free citizens .
You ruled your own home .
It 's intrinsic to the concept of liberty .
For if we are observed in all matters , we are constantly under threat of correction , judgment , criticism , even plagiarism of our own uniqueness .
We become children , fettered under watchful eyes , constantly fearful that – either now or in the uncertain future – patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us , by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once - private and innocent acts .
We lose our individuality , because everything we do is observable and recordable .
How many of us have paused during conversation in the past four - and - a - half years , suddenly aware that we might be eavesdropped on ?
Probably it was a phone conversation , although maybe it was an e-mail or instant - message exchange or a conversation in a public place .
Maybe the topic was terrorism , or politics , or Islam .
We stop suddenly , momentarily afraid that our words might be taken out of context , then we laugh at our paranoia and go on .
But our demeanor has changed , and our words are subtly altered .
This is the loss of freedom we face when our privacy is taken from us .
This is life in former East Germany , or life in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
And it 's our future as we allow an ever - intrusive eye into our personal , private lives .
Too many wrongly characterize the debate as " security versus privacy . "
The real choice is liberty versus control .
Tyranny , whether it arises under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic authoritative scrutiny , is still tyranny .
Liberty requires security without intrusion , security plus privacy .
Widespread police surveillance is the very definition of a police state .
And that 's why we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide .

SEVERAL YEARS AGO , I provoked a storm of controversy by advocating “ torture warrants ” as a way of creating accountability for the use of torture in terrorism cases .
I argued that if we were ever to encounter a “ ticking bomb ” situation in which the authorities believed that an impending terror attack could be prevented only by torturing a captured terrorist into revealing the location of the bomb , the authorities would , in fact , employ such a tactic .
Although I personally oppose the use of torture , I recognize the reality that some forms of torture have been , are being and will continue to be used by democracies in extreme situations , regardless of what we say or what the law provides .
In an effort to limit the use of torture to genuinely extreme “ ticking bomb ” situations , rather than allowing it to become as routine as it obviously became at Abu Ghraib , I proposed that the president or a federal judge would have to take personal responsibility for ordering its use in extraordinary situations .
For suggesting this approach to the terrible choice of evils between torture and terrorism , I was condemned as a moral monster , labeled an advocate of torture and called a Torquemada .
Now I see that former President Clinton has offered a similar proposal .
In a recent interview on National Public Radio , Clinton was asked , as someone “ who ’s been there , ” whether the president needs “ the option of authorizing torture in an extreme case . ”
This is what he said in response : “ Look , if the president needed an option , there ’s all sorts of things they can do .
Let ’s take the best case , OK .
You picked up someone you know is the No. 2 aide to Osama bin Laden .
And you know they have an operation planned for the United States or some European capital in the next three days .
And you know this guy knows it .
Right , that ’s the clearest example .
And you think you can only get it out of this guy by shooting him full of some drugs or water - boarding him or otherwise working him over .
If they really believed that that scenario is likely to occur , let them come forward with an alternate proposal .
“ We have a system of laws here where nobody should be above the law , and you do n’t need blanket advance approval for blanket torture .
They can draw a statute much more narrowly , which would permit the president to make a finding in a case like I just outlined , and then that finding could be submitted even if after the fact to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . ”
Clinton was then asked whether he was saying there “ would be more responsibility afterward for what was done . ”
He replied : “ Yeah , well , the president could take personal responsibility for it .
But you do it on a case - by - case basis , and there ’d be some review of it . ”
Clinton quickly added that he does n’t know whether this ticking bomb scenario “ is likely or not , ” but he did know that “ we have erred in who was a real suspect or not . ”
Clinton summarized his views in the following terms : “ If they really believe the time comes when the only way they can get a reliable piece of information is to beat it out of someone or put a drug in their body to talk it out of ‘em , then they can present it to the Foreign Intelligence Court , or some other court , just under the same circumstances we do with wiretaps .
Post facto .
“ But I think if you go around passing laws that legitimize a violation of the Geneva Convention and institutionalize what happened at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo , we ’re gonna be in real trouble . ”
It is surprising that this interview with the former president has received so little attention from those who were so quick to jump all over me .
Clinton goes even further than I did .
He would , in extreme cases , authorize the granting of a warrant “ post facto ” by a specialized court , as is now the case with national security wiretaps .
What I proposed is that the warrant authorization be issued before the use of extreme measures is permitted .
A preliminary warrant could be issued in a manner of minutes , to be followed up by a more thorough , after - the - fact evaluation and review .
I offered my controversial proposal as a way to stimulate debate about a difficult choice of evils .
I hope that the silence following the Clinton interview does not mean the debate has ended .
The problem persists .
Torture will continue .
Let ’s not stop thinking and talking about whether the evil of torture is ever a necessary evil .
10.23.2006 - AIM
Javascript API
I 've finally been given the okay to talk about it since Stephen announced it at Web Guild last week .
I would have mentioned it sooner but I was in Las Vegas , losing money and celebrating my sister 's wedding :)
So - AOL , as part of the Open AIM initiative , is releasing its AIM service to the web via a series of JSON / XML APIs .
I 've been working on a set of Javascript APIs to make it easier to interface with this since the beginning of the summer , which is primarily why it has been so quiet around here lately .
I 'm still not allowed to show anything off ( probably in a week or so ... keep an eye out ) , but I can tell you that I 've written a complete AIM client in javascript that you can embed wherever you like ( no popup and not hosted in an iframe ) .
And , since its just HTML , you can style it however you want ( we have some really kick ass , off the wall themes for it ) , or add functionality to it , or mash it up with other public APIs , or whatever you can dream up .
All you have to do is get an API key ( link forthcoming ... ) include a pointer to the javascript and include an element for it to hook into .
After that , you can define your own params and callbacks if you want to extend it .
I stress that the AIM client I 've written is just an example of what the API is capable of .
Maybe you 're just interested in the IM portion of the technology - thats fine , you can just use that part and never expose a buddy list .
Or , maybe you 'd just like to compile a list of your friend 's away messages .
That 's cool too - you can just subscribe to presence updates and grab their away message , never rendering a buddy list at all or worrying about incoming messages .
Or , maybe your wiki can have its own screen name and listen for incoming updates from you and your friends via IM while you attend different panels at SXSW , adding and editing entries appropriately based on your extension to the API .
It 's cool stuff , and absolutely possible and easy to implement .
What 's better is this is just the beginning of what we intend to do .
We 've got loads of stuff we want to add , like " capability " support so you can do things like send non -chat data between clients .
This is exciting for me primarily because its going to make multiplayer javascript games really , really easy .
I do n't have to stand up a database of user names ( or ask you to come up with one and remember yet another password ) , or a protocol for data transport , or any of the other things you 'd have to do for something like this .
Its already there with what exists with AIM .
I 'm really stoked to have worked on this - its gotta be one of the coolest projects , if not the coolest , that I 've been part of in my time with AOL .
The first time an IM went from my Safari window and the Adium icon in my dock starting jumping up and down , I squealed like a little girl .
It was just that bad ass .
So thats my cool news - keep an eye on the RSS feed for updates about documentation , FAQs and demos - I 'm still finishing up docs for the CSS hooks the API uses as well as the API proper with how - to's , and hope to have them available here within the week .

Microsoft and Yahoo have followed through on a promise made nine months ago to enable interoperability between the companies ' instant messaging networks .
Beginning late Wednesday , customers will be able to beta test the functionality by registering their accounts .
The effort , announced in October , was expected to be complete last quarter , but Microsoft developers said they had to try a number of different technical methods to make it work .
The Redmond company still considers the interoperability to be in beta , and adjustments will be made before the feature is available to all users .
" We 're pretty excited about the solutions we ’ve come up with for our first version of yahoo + messenger , " said Microsoft program manager Dan M. " I have been working on this for way too long .
It was awesome to work with the Yahoo !
Messenger team on this project and some amazing people here at Windows Live . "

Initially , the two companies have focused on enabling text messaging between Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo !
Messenger with Voice .
Voice capabilities across the networks will be supported at a later date , but cross - network video conferencing is not currently in the plans .
The agreement marks the first time major players in the highly - competitive IM industry have officially partnered up to enable cross-network communication .
Interoperability has always been a hot topic among instant messaging providers , but had never yielded a compromise .
Yahoo and Microsoft together will command over 50 percent of the instant messaging market , with more than 350 million accounts in total .
The pressure is now on AOL , which has long been the dominant force in instant messaging .
AOL and Google inked a deal to link their IM networks as part of an investment by the search giant in the struggling ISP , but no date for interoperability has been set .
In order to send messages from a Windows Live Messenger account to someone on Yahoo !
Messenger and vice versa , users must download the latest builds of the software they want to use .
Microsoft will make a new Messenger beta release available on ideas.live.com , along with a signup process to enable interoperability .
Likewise , Yahoo will host a beta signup on its Messenger with Voice Web site .
Yahoo users must be running version 8 of the software , which is currently in beta .
The interoperability beta program will be limited , Microsoft said , but the companies are expected to roll out the feature to all customers within a few months .
" To add a Yahoo ! contact in Windows Live Messenger , ( after you 've signed up for the beta ) just click on the add a contact button .
Then type their Yahoo !
ID + @yahoo.com ( example : [ email protected ] ) , " explained Dan M .
" Your Yahoo !
friend will get an invitation , and once they accept you are ready to chat , see when they ’re online , nudge them , send emoticons , send offline IMs , and share your witty personal status messages ...
And though we are planning to add many cross -network features in the future , this should be more than enough to get you started . "
One of the leading romantic singers of his generation , he sold 25 million albums and won dozens of awards .
Even after his stroke in 2003 , he kept recording , winning four Grammys for his final album Dance With My Father .
Tributes from stars such as Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson poured in after his death , at the JFK Medical Centre in New Jersey , was announced .
The singer " had a peaceful passing under the watchful eye of friends , family and the medical support team , " said hospital spokesman Robert Cavanaugh .
He did not give the cause of death but said the singer had never fully recovered from the stroke he suffered in his Manhattan apartment in April 2003 .
His publicist , Jeff O'Conner , said his death was " a huge loss in the R&B industry " .
" He was a close friend of mine and right now it 's shocking , " he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying .

I just came across a story that makes me quite angry but also has an important lesson in it for bloggers on shared servers .
It concerns the story of idolbloglive .com – a blog about Amercian Idol .
As you ’d expect with a blog on the topic of American Idol it ’s a blog that has had a bit of traffic in the last week or so ( the grand final is tomorrow ) .
Unfortunately for it ’s owner ( djslim ) his hosting provider suspended his account saying that he had crashed their server and is virtually holding his content ransom .
He writes , “ The only way to come back online or to retrieve the files is to upgrade my account which costs $ 110.00 a month . ”
From what I can discern having spoken with one of djslim ’s associates – the server apparently ‘ crashed ’ when it peaked at about 3500 page views in an hour from about 500 visitors ( see graph below ) .
I ’m not sure what server from a professional hosting company crashes with a load of 500 visitors but thats what the host reported .
At that point the host ( Surpass Hosting ) of the site switched the hosting off without any warning and is refusing to allow access even to retrieve files .
Obviously this blog had ‘ surpassed ’ what it ’s host would allow ( sorry – could n’t resist ) .
I get angry when I hear of hosts switching off account without warning and holding content ransom in this way .
Having said that this is a good warning for bloggers to check into their hosts before signing up both to read their contract see what the limits are in terms of bandwidth but also what the host does when those limits are reached .
It ’s also a pretty good argument for dedicated hosting instead of shared hosting and for backing up your files along the way .
Competition results
It 's taken our photo interpretation bureau the best part of two weeks to sift through the hundred of entries we had for our " Spot the Black Helicopter " competition - giving readers a chance to win one of our lovely Black Helicopter t- shirts .
Well , the results are in , but before announcing the winners , we thought it would be a lovely idea to have a look at some of the other entries which prove just why Google Earth will eventually provoke the complete collapse of Western civilisation .
If your stuff is n't included , do n't take it too hard : we had so much material that it would have taken us another month simply to knock it into shape for publication .
First stop : Devonport and Portsmouth .

Here 's a couple of pics though to show everyone else what they 're missing :

Oct. 26 , 2006  --
From the start -- from the day the first of the two Mars rovers safely landed there in 2004 -- Steve Squyres has been warning that their time was limited .
At some point a computer would crash , or a circuit would give out , and one rover or the other would die .
It has n't happened .
The two robotic rovers were supposed to last for 90 " sols , " or Martian days .
As of today , Spirit , the first rover , has survived 1,000 sols .
" It 's pretty amazing , actually , " said Justin Maki , the lead imaging scientist for the rover project .
" The rover 's basically in good health , especially considering its age . "
Cold Mountains
It has n't been easy .
In the summer , the daytime temperature may rise above freezing , but much of the time it is more than 100 degrees below zero .
The air is thin -- but not too thin to deposit a fine layer of dust on the rover 's top deck of solar panels , lessening their ability to turn sunlight into electricity .
And the rovers are wearing down .
Squyres has said the temperature swings are hard on electric motors and computer circuits .
" All that expansion and contraction , freeze - thaw , freeze - thaw , freeze - thaw -- something 's going to pop , " Squyres said last year in his office at Cornell University , back when Spirit had survived " only " 575 sols .
Squyres , the principal investigator for the rover project , still commutes when necessary between Cornell , in central New York state , and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Perhaps the biggest inconvenience is that Spirit 's front - right wheel has stopped working .
When engineers command the rover to move , they tell it to go backward , dragging the bad wheel behind it .
In fact , though , Spirit has n't moved in about 200 days .
It is currently winter in the southern hills it has been exploring , and the sun is low on the horizon .
Engineers strategically parked it on a slope facing north , so that its solar panels would get more energy .
They get very little unless the sun shines almost directly down on them .
But luck has been with the rover team .
" We 're getting these cleaning events , " said Maki , the lead imaging scientist .
" That was probably the biggest surprise .
Our power was going down and down and down , and then the wind comes along and blows the dust off the solar panels .
Who would have guessed ? "
' McMurdo Panorama '
NASA took advantage of the break from driving to shoot the single most detailed picture it 's gotten to date from the Martian surface .
NASA officials called it the " McMurdo panorama , " naming it after America 's largest research station in Antarctica -- where it is usually somewhat warmer than on Mars .
You can see it here .
Maki did some calculations and said the picture was the equivalent of what you would get if you had a digital camera that could shoot 130 megapixels .
Most cameras sold today shoot five megapixels to eight megapixels .
" We are on Mars , so there are lots of interesting and new things to look at , " he said .
" The closer you look at things , the more you discover . "
At some point , of course , something onboard the rover will presumably go wrong , and the engineers on Earth will realize , after several days of radio silence from Spirit , that its mission is over .
Even though the rover has far outlived its expected lifetime , Squyres said he knew that he'd be disappointed .
" I just know there will be something , just out of reach , that I still want to explore . "

You were very unattractive , but your sister was cute .
And yet I chose to sleep with you .
A pattern was starting to develop .
Sorry if I caused a problem between the two of you .
Hope things turned out OK .

My first slut .
How many guys in the dorm did you do ?
Do n’t get me wrong , you were great in bed , but it was a little unnerving every week seeing a different guy coming out of your room .
You were smart and sassy - you should have respected yourself more .
But thanks for the great Bjs.
Mrs. Horn -
I do n’t even know your first name .
But I do n’t feel badly because I do n’t think you even knew you slept with me after that New Year ’s Eve party , you were so drunk Although you did insist I cum inside you .
You know something funny , I ran into you a few years ago .
I saw you down by the waterfront with your husband .
I started chatting with you but you did n’t recognize me .
You just thought I was a kind stranger .
You ’re screwed up .
There are laws out there you know .
I regret the sex even if you do n’t .
Guess I ’ve changed a lot since I was 17 .
Judy -
You were very unattractive .
I slept with you because I thought that ’s the best I deserved .
I see now that I was lacking in self esteem .
But still , you smelled wonderful and I think you are a good person .
You could lose some weight , but it would n’t really matter because you would still be ugly .
Sorry about pissing in your mouth .
I liked it , but I do n’t think you did .
Kathy -
My fellow lab intern .
You met me one day and came on to me .
You asked me over for dinner and we fucked .
Can I tell you the truth , it was like a Seinfeld episode - I did n’t know your name .
Yeah , you told me that afternoon , but I had forgotten .
I had to check your time card the next morning in the lab .
The sex was uneventful .
I think you just wanted to betray some boyfriend .
I did n’t really care .
Allison -
You are one weird chick .
You are the shyest person I ’ve ever met .
Kinda odd seeing that your father is such a well - known bigshot .
I do n’t think you are a bad person , but so socially awkward .
You need to read a romance novel or rent a sexy movie or something .
You know , it ’s OK to move while having sex .
I got the sense you stayed so still because you did n’t want me to notice I was fucking you , for fear that I ’d run out of the room .
I dunno , maybe I would have .
You ’re academically very smart , now apply those brains to your personal life and stay away from people like me .
Julia - I could write a book on you , but no one would believe it .
You were filled with conflict .
You were an anorexic who became fat .
You were brilliant , yet flunking out of Grad School .
You were a lesbian sleeping with a man .
Oh , you so hated men and tortured them in much the same way that I began to realize that I hated women .
Was that our bond ?
Anyway , the dialog was incredible - Art History , Mathematics , speaking French all the time .
The sex was incredible too .
You taught me everything .
Unfortunately I later found out that you were teaching the whole dorm everything .
Great sex , but such a bad person .
Ug , the number of times I spontaneously showed up at your room , only to find your diaphragm was already in place .
Yeah right : “ I thought you might come over . ”
Can you tell me how many times I ate your pussy after a guy had creamed in it 2 hours earlier ?
Carolyn -
You were so vulnerable .
You would do anything to have a man in your life .
You needed more self worth .
Why would you sleep with me knowing Julia was in the room next door ?
Why did you let me finger you under the table knowing my girlfriend was sitting across from us .
Yeah , I was beginning to realize what a dog I was , but you still allowed me to get away with it .
All these years later , I looked you up on the interent and found you live with your mother .
Time ’s ticking .
You gotta start standing up for yourself .
BTW , the sex was terrible !
Kathryn - What God sent you to me ?
I was a rat- assed , foul smelling dog .
And you came along and believed in me .
You were a virgin .
You were the Valedictorian .
You were such a skilled debater and writer .
Sex with you started a little slow , but boy were you a good learner .
I should have married you back then .
I blew it .
All my fault .
As you could see from my history , I had a little problem respecting women .
The undergrad psych major in you pointed to my mother .
I think the scientific term you used was “ psycho bitch ” .
I ’m so sorry Kathryn that you got to see all that family stuff .
You were the one .
And I let you go .
I know you still care about me because you ’ll always call me on my birthday to wish me well .
Last time , I heard you lie to your husband , telling him it was your brother on the phone .
Thank you .
Anne -
You were Kathryn ’s best friend since you were both 10 years old .
Why would you let me seduce you ?
Yes , I take most of the responsibility , but why would you constantly come over and tell Kathryn all the sordid details about how you were cheating on your husband - all the details except the part where you were doing all this cheating with me , Kathryn ’s fiancee .
You ’re as twisted as me .
Think about that .
In the evenings , after you were gone , Kathryn would excitedly retell the story of your naughty adventures that day .
But she did n’t know the punchline , that the male in the story was her own boyfriend .
Shakespeare could n’t have come up with a more ingenious plot twist .
BTW , the sex with you was the best ever .
The dirty things you would say still make me come today .
You are brilliant .
Sick , but brilliant .
Katie -
You were a receptionist from Queens that I picked up at McSorelys .
I was so angry that day .
And just wanted to fuck somebody .
You should really consider choosing better sex partners .
Polly - I ’m just not ready to say anything here .
I ’ll give this one sentence and then move on .
You are my s****r and that should never have happened .
Roberta -
You are low - life trailer trash , but with a sparkly edge .
If you had been born into privilege , you would have gone to Harvard and become a bigshot CEO .
I hope good things happen to you .
BTW , I still fantasize about that night we had sex in front of your friends .
Wow !
Tammy -
All summer long you kept making a dumb joke about how the Hampton ’s rule book says you must wait until after Labor Day .
So the day after Labor Day I banged you and never called you again .
Kinda wasted my entire summer - except that after I dropped you off each night and you ’d give me that ridiculous kiss on the cheek while wagging your finger , “ No , no no .
Not until after Labor Day ” , I ’d go over and fuck Roberta ’s brains out .
I ’ll bet you ’re now married , living on Park Avenue and your husband hates you .
Never want to see you again .
“ No , no , no .
Not until after I ’m dead ! ” ? -
For 3 nights in a row , during that week after Labor Day - after everyone else had ended their season and gone back to New York City , I see you hanging around outside that Hampton ’s bar at closing time , sitting on the fence post .
You tried to make it look like you were waiting for your ride , but you fooled nobody .
At first I thought you might be a hooker , but then I realized you were too unattractive for anybody to pay .
By the third time I saw you there , I recognized the look - I knew you were just a desperate woman wanting to hear something that no one was ever going to be able to tell you .
So I offered you a ride , spent about $ 5 at 7 - 11 to buy some beers and fucked you doggie style because I did n’t want to see your face .
You were in need .
I was in need .
I never even asked your name .
After I gave you a ride home , I went over the bridge and drove down Dune Road for maybe a mile .
The road was deserted and dark .
I pulled over and just sat there .
I did n’t want to go back to the beach house .
I did n’t want to go back to New York City .
So I just sat there .
I think maybe I wanted to cry - I did n’t - I have n’t cried since 3rd grade when my mother drove away .
So no I did n’t cry .
But I sat there until the sun came up .
Alexis -
After that crazy Hampton ’s summer , I really began to hate myself .
So I kept myself in lockdown and spent the next two years taking my work very seriously .
No sex at all .
Then out of the blue , I meet you on a elevator .
You were a wonderful person .
You were beautiful , funny and kind .
Your pubic hair was magically soft .
I just was n’t ready to start again .
Sorry .
Wish you well .
Jill # 1 - You were an annoying Jap .
You were ugly .
Your tits sagged .
Sex was atrocious !
Hey , I know the saying is “ Suck my dick ” - but you took it too literally .
Do n’t just put it in your mouth and make a sucking sound .
Oh ... never mind ... go watch a porn movie .
Ca n’t believe I waited two years for this ?
And the 2nd time you came over , you brought your contact lens solution and 2 business suits !
What ?
Who invited you to move in ?
I should never have fucked Alexis , because it re-opened the flood gates and you washed in .
Jill # 2 - You made me both excited and sad .
You were constantly trying to get in with the right crowd .
Get it into your head already :
You are not attractive , they do not want you in their clique .
You mother obviously drank when she was pregnant because you have that classic scrunched fetal alcohol symptom face .
But you kept trying , to the point of desperation .
My God !
You went to an Ivy League College , but you ’d suck your doorman if he got you into the right club .
All that said , you did provide some wicked sex ..
That time in the sand dunes when we fucked and that total stranger came up to watch and you started jerking him off .
And that time in front of your sister ?
What the fuck was that ?
I probably jerk off to your memories more than anyone else .
Fiona -
You were the most boring girl I ’ve ever endured .
Who goes shopping for a pen ?
You want a pen , look between my couch pillows .
There are a dozen pens in there .
What a painfully dull bitch you are .
And the sex was embarrassing .
I cum on your face and you pat my back saying , “ There , there .
That ’s OK .
Accidents happen . ”
News flash , I came on your face to degrade you .
And you react like a mother soothing a child with a scraped knee .
You ’re boring and you ’re an idiot !
Karena - I thought you were an exotic beauty from Turkey .
But you were really just a bitchy Staten Island girl hiding in the exotic body of a foreign national .
You had the most sexual look , but you had no idea how to use it .
It was like a Ferrari was given to a 12 year old without a driver ’s license .
And maybe it was a cultural thing , but do you realize that I can pick out my own shirts ?
And I know how to choose an item from the menu .
You were constantly trying to dictate everything .
You suffocated me .
I could have tolerated you more if the sex was better , but it was n’t .
I ’m not surprised you are still single .
Go back to Turkey and suffocate your own kind .
Barbara - I met you at a party , two hours later , you stripped for me .
You seemed neurotic to the point of flaky .
You called me 2 months later to say you had an ovarian cyst and you wanted to know if I caused it ?
Yeah , I did - just after I disrupted the Earth ’s magnetic field .
Flake .
Helen -
That was gross , you had more facial hair than me .
And you were such a whacko .
Believing yourself to be an artist .
Your art was shit .
And your meditation .
And the vegetarian thing .
You were much older than me .
I thought that could be fun .
But you got off the bus in the ‘ 60s and stayed there .
And what ’s more , the sex was so dull and your apartment smelled like cat piss .
Emily -
You are the poster child of what can go wrong with long term use of prescription drugs .
You are destined to forever be medicated .
Here are some things you should n’t do :
Do n’t turn to the table next to us in a restaurant and ask if the fellow is done with his cake .
I do n’t know who was more horrified when you ate it , me or him .
And do n’t take a leak in a subway car .
Even the homeless know how to hold it better than you .
I can only image that was the drugs fucking up your frontal lobe .
But I will say something kind about you .
You loved it in the ass , “ Yes , fuck me in the ass !
Fuck me deep and make it hurt ! ”
You were at least good for something .
Page -
All right , this is a bizarre one .
You are smart .
You are pretty .
You are successful .
But never ever should you sleep with a guy and then tell him the next morning that your last boyfriend died of AIDS .
That was a dickish thing to do .
I never wanted to go near you again .
JoAnn - Picked you up on an Amtrak train .
You were dull , but I went along on the ride for a while , mainly because I thought your mother was hot .
I was actually hoping for a chance to bang her .
She certainly had more personality than you .
Hey , some sexual advice .
It is not a lollipop .
You do n’t hold it by the stem and lick it .
Go ask your mother .
Elana -
I had a live - in girlfriend at the time , so I could n’t take you to my place .
You had roommates who knew my live - in girlfriend , so we could n’t go to your place .
So I took the spare key to my girlfriend ’s father ’s apartment because I knew he only used it a few times a month .
DAMN !
That was so embarrassing - to find his potential son- in - law in HIS bed with a woman who was n’t his daughter .
I ’m sorry about that .
You seemed nice , but after that incident I just had to hide from everyone .
Donna -
You were on the cruise ship because you were afraid to take the plane to Europe .
You took me to your cabin , but you were afraid of catching a disease , so we watched each other jerk off .
That was hot .
Too bad we never met up again .
My guess was that you were afraid of too many things in life .
But still , I loved that jerk off thing and have done it many times since .
A lot of girls get into it .
Thanks .
Ellen -
I met you at that party and we fucked later that night .
And I got the definite sense you were using me to get back at some boyfriend .
Do n’t do that .
That kind of behavior is reserved for pricks like me .
Dr. Lisa -
You are a doctor .
And on the first date , you asked me to fuck you in the ass .
Did n’t you learn anything in Med School about Safe Sex ?
Other than the ass part , you were dull .
You kinda reminded we of someone who went to Band Camp .
And what ’s with the beret .
You look like some 1970s graduate of the Lycee Francaise .
You are such a dork .
Kate -
You were great .
Smart .
Good looking .
Such a part of Grand New York , with your cocktail parties and benefit dinners .
Remember that time you introduced me to your friend Anna ?
I talked to her for hours , exchanging stories .
As she was leaving , I told her she should be a writer .
She laughed .
Later that night you told me her full name - Anna Quinlan .
OK , I ’m a jerk .
I ’m not sure why it did n’t work out with you .
Maybe your family was too rich .
People might have called me a gold digger .
So I walked away .
Sue - I lied to you .
I just wanted to get into your pants and fuck you .
And as soon as I did , I dumped you and made you cry .
I did n’t really care .
But I ’ve always wondered though , why did you insist that we fuck in your roommate ’s bed ?
Why did you insist I use your roommates vibrator on you ?
I think your a closet lesbian .
Holly -
You are a sexual weirdo .
You take me home .
I suck on your pussy til you come .
Then you ask me to leave .
Next date , same thing .
So I asked our mutual friend , your ex .
He said you did the same thing with him .
I mentioned to our other friend in Seattle , same thing .
You have some sexual baggage going on there , do n’t you .
But no matter , I did n’t really like you .
I just wanted to see your pussy so I could talk to my friends about you .
Lisa - Skinny as can be , red pussy hair and enormous tits .
I still have that vision of you on all fours with me banging you from behind - you tits swaying , the size of bowling balls .
I jerk off to you sometimes .
Too bad you were a bitch .
Mary Lee -
You are that typical fat girl who over compensates by trying to be too social .
And to be 33 and still a virgin .
That is fucked up .
Thanks for the BJ , but I just could n’t be the one to pop your cherry .
I heard that you lost the weight .
That was good .
Then I heard you died of cancer .
That was bad .
Sorry .
Pat -
You were Mary Lee all over again .
Why do fat girls date me and then when I dump them , they lose 50 lbs and try to turn their lives around .
I should market myself as a diet plan .
But I loved the way you swallowed my cum .
You really knew how to play with it .
Donna -
You were old , I was drunk .
I should have just masturbated that night .
But my mother was in the hospital and I did n’t want to be alone .
I never think about you .
Maura -
You were so sexy hot .
We went on a hike and you took your shirt off .
And when we passed other hikers , you just smiled and said hello .
So hot .
Sorry I came inside you .
I know that freaked you out .
Mary -
I think that car accident when you were 22 gave you brain damage .
You were a math major in college , but 10 years later you could n’t finish a fucking sentence : “ I can .
I can finish a - hey , is it rain - I ’m sleepy . ”
I dunno , you were like a character from a Simpsons episode , saying off - the - wall things all the time , but not realizing how ridiculous they sounded to the rest of us .
“ Starsky and Hutch , that ’s a kind of ice cream is n’t it ? ”
And sex with you was like something from a bad tv sitcom .
I ’m banging your pussy .
I ’m staring at your beautiful face .
I ’m about to come , when you look deep into my eyes and say , “ You know , tomorrow , I think I ’ll wear that green dress with the brown belt . ”
Externally you were beautiful .
Internally , I think your brain had turned to apple sauce .
Regis - Ug .
You are not in my masturbation fantasies .
You are not in anyone ’s masturbation fantasies .
I thought I ’d feel guilty about being your first .
I knew when I popped you that I ’d never see you again .
But in the end , I did n’t care .
Maybe you should get a tattoo or something .
Anything that might give you the sex appeal you so desperately need .
Kristin - I ’m not sure what to say .
I certainly ca n’t get mad at you .
It was all my doing .
You worked in the cafeteria in my office building .
You had a strangely deformed face .
Your chin was too long .
Your cheekbones were n’t symmetrical .
And you were overweight .
I saw you leaving the building that day .
I should n’t even have been there , but I did n’t want to go to the hospital and I did n’t want to go to the office .
I took you home and we fucked .
You know what I remember most about you ?
It was n’t your twisted face .
It was n’t your sickeningly artificial childish mind set - “ So I said to him I said , first of all , like ... whatever ! ”
What I remember about you most was the disturbing image of removing you pants and seeing the inches of curly black pubic hair poking out in all directions from your hole - ridden panties .
I ’m guessing you did n’t have any visitors down there for a while and certainly were n’t expecting anyone that day .
Maybe when you were 16 , you kept yourself well groomed , thinking you might meet a nice man and have a relationship .
But as the years went by and nobody called , you let yourself go .
And here you were at 35 years old .
Deformed and alone .
Maybe you thought no man would ever see you naked again ?
You were almost right .
I was n’t a man .
I was a sniveling , crying 3rd grade piece of shit .
Just like Helen who got off the bus in the 60s and missed her connection back to the modern world - just like that - my mother threw me out of the car when I was 10 and left me there on that dark road all alone with no chance of finding my way home .
Fuck you bitch .
And like ... whatever !*************** That ’s it .
Well , at least those are the ones I can remember .
And now ?
Now , I do n’t sleep with anyone .
It has been 4 years , cold turkey .
I dunno .
Everytime some friend tries to set me up on a date , I have this flashback to that no -name girl sitting on the fence post outside that Hampton ’s bar .
The one I fucked , but did n’t want to see her face .
I think of that girl and then politely decline the offer of a date .
It sounds hard not to have sex , but actually , it ’s just easier .
You know what Kathryn would say - my true love who I should have married all those years ago - you know what she would say ?
She would wave her psych degree in my face and say , “ When was the last time you slept with a girl ?
And when was it that your psycho - bitch mother died ?
Hmmm , what an interesting coincidence .
” Yeah , I dunno .
It does n’t matter .
I like my job .
I like my friends .
Maybe one day I ’ll go on a date again , but no rush .
Is Justice Being Delayed by Bush Administration Politics ?
Several high - profile FBI investigations , in which substantial progress have been made , may well have been put on hold by the Bush administration for political reasons .
That is , it has been alleged to me that the White House may have leaned on the FBI – not to drop the [ … ]

Professor of economics , Cornell University
India 's per capita income is a tad higher than sub-Saharan Africa's
But , as an economist , I find the WDI to be a very valuable source book .
The paucity of words means I need have no fear of being burdened with somebody 's expert opinion ( and can merely inflict mine on you ) .
While impressionistic writings and generalisations have their role , and pure statistics has its own risks , the latter often helps us cut through popular hype to see economic reality as it is .
The recently released WDI 2006 is a wonderful document for evaluating cross-country performance .
This column 's focus being what it is , let us begin with South Asia .
Sobering
Given the huge positive press that India has received in recent times , it is sobering to discover that India 's per capita income is just a shade higher than that of sub -Saharan Africa , and about one - sixth that of Latin America .
Equally surprising is that 35 % of India 's population lives on less than $ 1 a day , which is comparable to Bangladesh 's 36 % and much worse than Pakistan 's 17 % and Sri Lanka 's 6 % .
The problem with South Asia is that , being poor , even this smaller inequality means much greater hardship for the poor and this is what is feeding various kinds of rebellious movements in the region
Your comments on the article
What then is the basis of optimism for India ?
It has everything to do with change .
To check this out statistically I pulled out WDI 1998 from my shelf .
This gives data for mainly 1996 and so is unaffected by the East Asian crisis which started in 1997 .
In 1996 , India had a per capita income of $ 380 , Pakistan $ 480 , Bangladesh $ 260 and Sri Lanka $ 740 .
Compare these with the figures in the latest WDI ( which pertain to 2004 ) .
India 's per capita income has risen to $ 620 and has overtaken Pakistan 's $ 600 ; and the relative gap with Sri Lanka , which now has a per capita income of $ 1010 , has narrowed .
Bangladesh which currently has a per capita income of $ 440 has grown reasonably well and so has lost out with India more marginally .
Exaggeration
How does India 's growth compare with the world beyond South Asia ?
A lot still needs to be done to combat poverty in Bangladesh
The WDI allows us to check the veracity of this statistically .
And this common wisdom turns out to be an exaggeration .
If we take the national income growth rate over the period 2000 - 04 , with an annual growth rate of 6.2 % India was not second but the 17th fastest - growing nation in the world .
If we take a longer period , 1990 to 2004 , India moves up to being the fourth fastest - growing economy in the world , behind China , Vietnam and Mozambique .
And if we take an even longer view - from 1980 to now , India does indeed come second , behind China and virtually tying with Vietnam .
So what India has excelled in is sustained growth .
It is this that has given rise to hope .
And , combined with the vibrancy of democracy and the successes of higher education in India , this has led some commentators to argue that its future augurs even better than China's .
Inequality
One worrying feature that could cause political instability and jeopardise this bullish forecast - and much of South Asia shares this anxiety - is the problem of poverty and inequality .
Much has been written about this but again some statistical fact checking sheds new light .
Inequality in South Asia is large but not as large as in much of the rest of the world .
Even smaller inequality means much greater hardship for the poor in South Asia
All South Asian nations have similar ratios .
This is a lot of inequality but not as much as in China which has a ratio of 18.4 or the United States 15.7 .
The problem with South Asia is that , being poor , even this smaller inequality means much greater hardship for the poor and this is what is feeding various kinds of rebellious movements in the region .
This will be one of the most formidable challenges confronting India over the next decade if it is to live up to its promise .
The difficulty arises from the fact that the rising inequality is largely a concomitant of globalisation and , hence , for a single country to take action against this is to take the risk of a pathological backlash on the economy .
To try to cap high - end income , as some have naively suggested , will cause the flight of skilled citizenry and capital to other nations and will exacerbate poverty .
To wantonly subsidise the poor or to dole out largesse will cause fiscal bankruptcy , which will make the problem worse in the long run .
The focus will have to be on creating private - sector jobs with the complementary use of a few well - directed subsidies .
This is not a matter of sloganeering and populist pronouncements but will require a combination of scientifically designed policy interventions that reach out to the poor without damaging market incentives and the entrepreneurial spirit .
This debate is now closed .
Here are a selection of your views .
India is very unique country in the sense that the top 10 % and the bottom 10 % of India each include a population of over 100 million .
Of course , the ratio of income of the top 10 % to the bottom 10 % is very small .
To see the inequality , try using the ratio of the income of top 1 % to the bottom 1 % .
I assume India will be among the worst .
There are no minimum wage laws in India ; the tea plant workers , recently had to go on a strike and still their wages are well below a dollar a day .
Ajay , USA
Interesting that India 's comparative growth record looks best over the longer term - that is , when including much of the long period when it was practising protectionist , socialistic policies of the kind " free - market " ideologues like Basu deplore .
Of course , " globalisation " is just these ideologues ' cant word , intended to make the worldwide and highly successful class war the very rich have been waging on the rest of us for the past quarter century look like a natural phenomenon .
What we need is a global , democratic response to this class war , to prevent the rich playing off the poor in different countries against each other in the way Basu depicts as inevitable .
Nick Gotts , Scotland
If India was 2nd fastest growing economy between 1980 - 2004 , 4th fastest between 1990 - 2004 , and 17th fastest between 2000 - today , does n't it mean that growth ( relative to the rest of the world ) is slowing ?
Could it be that the " market reforms " have slowed down the economy and not sped it up ?
I guess we will know in another decade or so after this outsourcing hoopla has died down and may be the world economy goes through a downturn .
Then people will realize that the social ( education ) and infrastructure ( dams , industries ) spending after independence was the cause of the high growth ( relative to the world ) during the 80s and 90s .
And that the " reforms " reduced social spending ( human capital investment ) and hence led to the decline in growth rates .
The last decade 's growth rates around the world are masking this statistic .
Ashish K , USA
It was very surprising to know that the disparity between the richest 10 % and the poorest 10 % is much lower in India than countries like USA and China .
This is quite anti intuitive .
The general perception in India is that the few really rich Indians are infinitey richer compared to the average .
This statistic shows that on a sociological level there is more economic justice in relative terms , though on an absolute scale , the bottom is still way below poverty line .
It will however be very interesting to know the comaparative results if we broaded the dataset a bit , say from 10 % to 20 % or 30 % .
And also to compare the middle classes together as it is in this region that I beleive India has gained a lot of ground in the last decade alone .
Indranil Mustafee , United Kingdom ( India )
Mr Basu 's comments will hopefully be an eye opener to the all the BBC readers .
India 's recent growth has been at best chaotic with extraordinary emphasis on the service sector .
Orderly infrastructure development and agricultural growth will be the key to sustained growth .
India also needs high level of expertise in all sectors to make these newfound facilities work .
P Srinivasan , UK
India resides in its village's .
Around 65 % of the population lives in rural India .
I come from one of those village .
These villages are hardly untouched by so called growth and modernisation .
The fourth generation of the families in my village still are same as their forefathers .
None of government reforms or reports have ever made difference !
And nor will they make any in future .
Its upon educated people like us who can be catalyst in changing their tomorrow .
Even if its one step at time .
I am in process of taking that step .
How about you ?
Rajshree Jadeja , USA
The article misses the main point .
It compares the per capita incomes of different countries in terms of US $ .
It ignores the basic fact that US $ has widely varying purchasing capacities for essential items in different countries and this makes all the difference in comparing relative living standards .
S.R.S.Sastri , India
From the article it seems that as of 2004 India 's per capita was $ 620 and Pakistan 's $ 600 .
The article also says that all South Asian nations have similar ' inequality ' ratios .
Yet in India 35 % of people live on less than $ 1 a day and in Pakistan it is half that number or 17 % .
Both India and Pakistan officially claim that poverty levels are around 25 % .
As of 2005 - 2006 Pakistan has claimed to have increased its per capita to around $ 840 while India seems to be stuck at around $ 740 despite both having similar growth rates .
Do we really trust such statistics ?

You argue that increasing wealth disparity in nations where the poorest live in absolute poverty is a more politically destabilising issue than in nations where the wealth gap is larger but the poor not so poor ( although your examples include China where the poorest are as absolutely poor as India 's poor , however as China is not a democracy it may quash unrest in a way that would not be acceptable in India ) .
This needs further explanation .
What are the forces within Indian politics that represent the poorest and how destabilising are they ?
Also ,
While the wealth gap between the top and bottom has widened how has the bottom moved in relation to absolute poverty ( you say 35 % now but what was the figure in 1998 ? ) .
I have read arguments that say that even if the top is getting richer faster than the bottom , that the bottom is !
getting wealthier at all is a good thing , reducing absolute poverty .
How is that destabilising ?

While it is true that the Indian economy is booming thanks to the service sector , gross inequalities still persist as pointed in the report .
What India now needs to do is focus on the manufacturing sector .
Remember , IT and BPO , high technology etc can provide jobs only to the educated elite .
The vast majority are blue - collar workers .
Only if they are able to get jobs in industries will poverty decrease .
That is where China has succeeded and we need to emulate that .
In China if a migrant goes to the cities , he ends up in a factory with a job while in India if a migrant goes to the cities , he ends up as an unemployed in the slums !
Arun Kumar , India
As Basu points out , India needs to create more jobs in private sectors .
But the focus also needs to be in increasing agricultural productivity than just high - tech industry .
India also needs to address issues such as reservation which is a big hindrance to growth .
Free , quality education to all will take the economy to great heights , as it is very fundamental to growth .
We all Indians have a part to play in this and we can make this happen collectively .

The decelerating growth in household savings rate in india ( 1970 - 2000 ) , thanks to the conspicous consumption by post independence younger generation is resulting economic and socio-cultural pressures ( be it high profile drug abuse , juvenile diabetes , rebellious movements : Naxalite , aoists ) .
India needs a benevolent dictator Singapore or a presidential form of govt .

Just returned from India .
I concur with Professor Basu 's observations .
I wish that he had been more open about India 's perennial evils perpetrated by its politicians , businessmen , and even independent professionals such as physicians , auditors , lawyers etc , not fully disclosing their incomes and remitting income taxes , widespread stealing of electrical power , flaunting zoning regulations , encroaching on public lands and rampant corruption in dealing with public and elected officials .
Until , the state and central governments address these issues , I see little hope for India to progress faster .
Alex , USA
India 's biggest challenge comes from infrastructural problems .
Also , at some point , the government has to stop and think about various social safety nets .
Three years ago when I went back home , the kids on the streets were making money by wiping car windows , two yrs ago - by selling hand - made jute ropes & peanuts and last year they were selling the World is Flat by Friedman and the Financial Times !
Monika Kochhar , New York , USA
I think the problem in India is size ...
India is not the same story as it was 20 - 30 years before .
I think things are moving in right direction .. but in a very slow way .
Rreal investment needs to make in agriculture and irrigation .
Land reforms needs to be implemented throughout India

I dont know why the World Bank comes up with such reports or statistics every two days .
I mean all the stats presented here is well known ( although I am a little confused with 35 % figure below poverty line as according the gov. its 26 % ) .
Anyway , this report and as such this article adds little new information and reiterates the same old broken record .
And btw , why is BBC so obsessed with telling us how poor we are with an article every couple of days .
I know we are , I can see it daily .

Indian fiscal system has to be revised and tax collection should be made more efficent .
I have been to India and seen it first hand , there is lot of black market and corruption .
Business people normally deal in hard cash there is no record keeping in small businesses .
they are escaping from the paying tax .
and also it is very difficult to start a Comapny in India .
You have to go through different channell and time consuming and burocratic .
In Uk you can form a Company in 8 Hours .
In India it take more than 3 months .

The great thing about India is that there is hope and so long as corruption and political influence can be rooted out , India will do well .
Shovan Das , USA
Do you think that India will sustain this GROWTH RATE in this decade ?
VIKI SHAH , INDIA
Well this article is clearly written by a non-economist , as most economists would know that they would never trust figures published by the world bank .
The figures are made that way to give out more loans to poor countries .
A friend of mine used to work for the World Bank , but he has learnt the truth about these figures .
Which is purposely lowered so that they can dish out more debt to already debt stricken nations .
Ananth , UK
India has made remarkable progress from 1947 when Indians on the whole were the poorest of the poor .
The dire poverty prevailing then is not seen in most of India today .
Caste , and communalism is still a major problem but these are abating with the rise of urbanisation .
amrat jivan , Canada
It is one thing to piggy back on the IT sector and another thing to bring in innovation in the policy sector .
Considering that majority of Indain population is rural and agriculture is the main occupation it is urgent that the rural infrastructure needs development and this will lead to better access to markets and reduction in the transport costs both of will contribute to the growth in the rural sector .
Some how there seems to be too many vested interests whihc are patting on Indias back whihc seems to be leading to a situation of " Emperor has no clothes " .
SV Nagappa , Australia
Very true Mr Basu .
Indians have been living on hype .
Call centers do not a superpower make ...
We need more people like you and Amartya Sen to shed light on true issues .

India for its population does not have a lot of natural resources .
India must rely on technology to drive its future growth and emulate Japan .
The wealth of sub -Saharan Africa is mostly from natural resouces , the same is true for the oil rich middle east .
India which gave the world the decimal system and Algebra must use its brain power as its engine of growth .
V Narayan , Sweden
That was an eye opener .
Especially the ratio of income of rich and poor .
Surprisingly we are way above US and China atleast in that category .

On August 28 , the Pirate Party of Sweden made their election program official .
An introduction stating the ideas and ideology behind their program , the party stated their program for the election in a number of concrete points .
The program consists of a total of 15 pages , and should be the most concrete and factual of the programs presented by parties running in the elections .
After
The raid on the popular BitTorrent tracker “ The Piratebay “ , the Pirate Party has transformed into the largest party without parliament seats .
In Sweden , you get seats in the parliament if you get four percent of the votes .
The Pirate Party has arount the same member count as the Green Party , which is a party that supports the current government , and without them , the current government can’t maintain their majority
This leads the Pirate Party to believe that if they get into the parliament they can fill such a vital role , and thereby make a big difference .
Worth noting is that some unofficial gallups from various sources indicate that the Pirate Party is the most likely party for a Swedish first - time voter to choose on election day .
Here is a translation of the introduction .
If you happen to read Swedish , the manifesto can be retrieved in PDF here .
The Pirate Party Election Manifesto 2006
Preface
The election program of the Pirate Party consists of various nautical charts , describing what we want to do in each of the areas within the Pirate Party policies .
These charts are divided in sections based on deadline and what is to be done on a Swedish and on a European level .
As an introduction to these charts , we describe our ideology and our main policies .
Protected integrity in an open society
The development of technology has made sure Sweden and Europe stand before a fork in the road .
The new technology offers fantastic possibilities to spread culture and knowledge all over the world with almost no costs .
But it also makes way for the building of a society monitored at a level unheard of up until now .
In no time , the monitoring state has advanced its positions strongly in Sweden .
This development threatens equality and safety before the law , and nothing indicates that it even adds to security .
The Pirate Party believes this is the wrong way to go .
The right to privacy is a corner stone in an open and democratic society .
Each and everyone has the right to respect for one ’s own private and family life , one ’s home and one ’s correspondence .
If the constitutional freedom of information is to be more than empty words on a paper , we much defend the right for protected private communication .
The arguments for every individual step towards a monitoring society may sound very convincing , but we only have to look at the recent history of Europe to see where that road leads .
It is less than twenty years since the fall of the Berlin wall , and there are numerous other terrible examples .
To claim that it ’s only those with something to hide that has anything to fear is simply lacking knowledge of history , and lacking courage .
We have no problem with police monitoring and spying on suspected criminals .
That is exactly what the police is suppose to be doing .
But routinely monitoring ordinary citizens hoping for something suspicious to turn up is not only a gross violation of the privacy of honest people .
It is also a waste of valuable police resources .
We have to pull the emergency break on the train running towards a society we do n’t want .
Terrorists can attack our open society , but only governments can disband it .
The Pirate Party wants to ensure that this does n’t happen .
Private communication and file sharing
A driving force behind the current monitoring hysteria is the entertainment business , which wants to prevent people from file sharing copyrighted material .
But to achieve this all private communication must be monitored .
To know what ones and zeros make up a movie , the ones and zeros has to be analyzed .
It is the same sort of ones and zeros that is sent , regardless of if it makes up a piece of music , or a letter to a doctor or a lawyer .
Therefore society ha to choose : do we want a possibility to trustingly communicate over the Internet to exist ?
If your answer is yes , it means that also those that shares copyrighted material can use these possibilities .
If you answer is no , it means that you abolish the right of information , the right to mail secrecy and the right to a private life .
There are no other answers .
It is not possible to claim that society should allow mail secrecy for certain purposes , but not for others , since it is impossible to separate the different cases without breeching the secrecy .
It is the same types of ones and zeros being used , and only by opening the message , it is possible to see what it contains .
The current copyright legislation can not be combined with freedom of information and protected private communication .
Since the fundamental principles of the open , democratic society is more important than conserving old business models within the business of entertainment at all costs , copyright has to fold .
But this is not negative .
A reformed copyright legislation , expressing a balance between different interests in society instead of being an order form from the large media companies , has its own benefits .
It is a possibility for Sweden and Europe , not a threat .
The spreading of culture and knowledge is a positive thing
Thanks to the Internet it is today possible for everyone with a computer to take part of a fantastic treasure of culture and knowledge .
Instead of being limited to a cultural canon decided from above , the youths of today has access to the music , theater and pictures of an entire world .
This is something we should embrace , not something we should try to forbid .
File sharing is good for society and its people .
All non-commercial acquiring , using , bettering and spread of culture should be actively encouraged .
The Internet is filling the same function today as popular education did a hundred years ago .
It is something positive and good for the development of society .
The copyright legislation must be changes so that it is made perfectly clear that it only regulate use and copying of works done for commercial purposes .
To share copies , or in any other way spread or use someone else ’s work , should never be forbidden as long as it is done on an idealistic basis without the purposes of commercial gain .
Unfortunately , the legislation has developed in quite the opposite direction .
On July 1 , 2005 , a million ordinary Swedes were suddenly turned into criminals over night , simply because they download movies and music .
This does n’t only hurt our possibilities to take part of culture .
In the long run it undermines the trust of our entire judicial apparatus .
This development has to end .
In a similar fashion , patents are used to inhibit the spread and use of knowledge , which hurts society as a whole .
Medical patents make people in poor countries die for no reason .
It twists the priorities in research and makes the costs for medications a problem in every health care budget .
Software patents inhibit technical development within the info tech area and presents a serious threat against small as well as mid-sized businesses and individual developers .
They run the risk of putting the power over the Internet completely in the hands of a small number of multi national businesses .
We want to release knowledge , and have specific suggestion on how to avoid the negative consequences that the patent system means .
Sweden and Europe has everything to gain from choosing the path of openness .
No other issues
The Pirate Party does not have any policies on issues that traditionally concerns the left - right scale , or any other issues outside of our program of policiies .
We particularly does not concern ourselves with the division of wealth .
We are not after dividing money between different groups in society .
None of our propositions costs any money for the state , and several of them may potentially save money in the budget .
Because of this , we can place ourselves outside of the struggle concerning the budget , with good faith , and leave it to the old parties .
We are ready to support a social democratic as well as a non-socialist government , we claim that both GÃ¶ran Persson as well as Fredrik Reinfeldt are well capable of taking the role as the head of government in a satisfactory manner .
We do not believe that the differences between them are that big , in reality , and every one of us are ready to live with any of them as our prime minister .
The only thing that concerns us , is the protection of our open society and democracy , that the march towards a controlled society is cancelled , and that culture and knowledge are set free .
Our goal is to reach the parliament and being in a position where we can tip the scale .
If we succeed in this we will talk to both GÃ¶ran Persson and Fredrik Reinfeldt alike .
We will explain what we want , and point out that our policies in no way differs from either traditional social democratic policy or traditional liberal / non - socialist policy .
After that , we will support the person aspiring to form a government , who is ready to make the best deal with us on our policies .
On any matter outside of our policy statement , we will support and vote for the current government , no matter what we believe individually on different matters .
Due to the fact that we do not have a view on everything on this earth , but concentrate completely on the issues where we have formed a policy , we can promise a result if we make it to the house of parliament in a scale - tipping position .
That makes us unique in Swedish political history .
We are the only party that will never deal away our free and open society for the benifit of any other issue or interest .
More on the Pirate Party tipping the scale
The Pirate Party does not take a stand in issues generally associated with the right or left , or any other issues that are not part of our declaration of principles .
We are ready to support a socialdemocratic as well as a non-socialist government .
The only thing that concerns us is that the march towards a controlled society is cancelled , and that culture and knowledge in society are set free ,
On of the factions within Swedish politics has really anything to lose in reality by satisfying more or less all of our demands .
Neither Persson nor Reinfeldt have any personal interest in keeping the absurdity that is current copyright legislation .
The fact that things look like they do , is primarily due to lack of interest in the area , and that they have therefore allowed the ‘ experts ’ ( i.e. the lobbyists of the entertainment industry ) have their way .
In a situation where they can gain position of forming a government by striking a deal with us in an issue that they , themselves , believe to be less important , there is every reason to believe that they will be eager to find a solution .
But in either case , there are three possible scenarios :
1 ) One of the factions agree to our demands , and the other does not .
Then we will choose the faction that agree with us .
Whether this is the red faction of the blue faction is of no concern for us .
As long as we see that they are doing their best to seriously run our issues , we will support the government in all other issues as well , without questioning .
2 ) Both the factions agree to our demands .
If there are differences of nuances making one faction looking slightly better than the other , we will choose this faction .
If both are exactly as good , we will support the faction with the more votes .
This way we wo n’t influence the balance between the factions in Swedish politics .
As long as the government is running our issues , we will support them in all decicions , just as in the first scenario .
3 ) Both the factions refuse to meet our demands .
This is the more complicated case , but we can handle this one too .
Initially we will support one faction , and make a government possible .
Most likely this will be the ones with the less votes , so that the others , the ‘ victors ’ , will feel that they have lost power they were entitled to .
They can , however , not do much about it , since we will support the government without questioning in anything that does not involve our principles .
When the “ victors ” are safely placed in the penalty box of opposition , we start our businesslike , low - voiced conversations with them , until they realize that our proposals are not , in fact , that dangerous , and that they can only win from working with us .
When they have seen our arguments in the glow of the miraging governmental position for a while , there are good reasons to believe they will agree with us .
This is when we will call for a vote of non-confidence and change the government .
After that , the Pirate Party with support the new government without questioning , in all issues , as long as the government runs our issues forcefully , just as in scenario 1 and 2 .
This is our entire strategy .
This way we can guarantee that our policies will have a break - through .
Questions and answers about our scale - tipping strategy
– How do we handle parliamentary votes that do not include any issues that the Pirate Party runs ?
We will support the government in office , no matter what our personal opinions might be .
– Will the party try to make deals with other parties ( “ if you vote for us on issue “ X ” and “ Y ” we will help you with “ Z ” ) ?
No , we will talk to the party in office .
As long as they do as we want in our issues , we will support them in all other matters .
We do not wish to try shopping a la carte from different parties ( if we do , we will only be shoved aside ) .
If the government stops this manner of cooperation , we will change the government , but as long as we tolerate a government , we are completely loyal to them in all other issues , those not in our program .
– …or not vote ?
If the government needs our support in the parliament it can count on it .
We will not cancel our votes if this would affect the turnout against the government .
– …or let the individual MPs decide for themselves ?
Under no circumstances .
The day we start voting after personal preference , we have nothing more to offer the other parties in a negotiation .
If this happens , we can no longer benefit from our position , and have no longer any means to influence the policies that is the closest to our hearts .
– But in the third scenario ( that is if none of the factions wants to offer anything at all , even though we are tipping the scale ) , why would we want to support the government ?
We should obviously be able to offer them to vote , from their perspective , in an unseemly manner ?
It seems a bit awkward to give them what they want first ( by support ) and then trying to negotiate .
The idea in the third scenario is that we help a government form , that we ourselves are n’t happy with , but who we choose to support indefinitely anyway .
Principally only to tease the opposition , in other words .
When the opposition has spent a few months being grumpy because they can’t form a government even though they think they won the election , they have two alternatives to choose from .
They can either stay grumpy for the next four years , or they can start talking to us to find out if they can “ talk sense in to us ” and have our support .
The big prize is the government , both for the left and the right , and they have nothing to lose from having a dialogue with us .
With that , we ’ve managed to initialize a discussion with the opposition concerning these issues .
Since our proposals does not , in any way , clash with the basic values of neither the left wing nor the right wing block , and since they are good proposals , objectively , for Sweden , there is no reason to believe that they would prefer to stay grumpy for the next four years instead of making a deal with us .
But until they have done so , we will consistently vote with their opponents ( i.e. the government that we support even if we think they are no good ) .
That way the opposition will have an even bigger reason to strike a deal with us , even more so than if we voted without a clear direction .
The more votes the opposition loses concerning health care / education / taxes / disbanding of military units , the more eager they will become to have a change of government .
The government that is in power even though we think they ’re no good will perhaps feel happy to be able to carry through whatever they want without giving us anything in return .
But they will know that all it takes for them to lose office is one word from the opposition .
So the joy they ’re feeling will hardly be very deep or long lasting .
The point of helping a government to form even if none of the players gives us what we want is that we want to add to stablity and let things calm down a bit .
One ca n’t postpone negotiations about the government more than a couple of weeks after the election .
If we ca n’t have a government that we want because it promises to see our points and work for them , it ’s still better to help a government we do n’t like .
The country needs a government .
Parliamentarism is such an ingenious system because the parliament can throw out the government in office whenever a majority of its members wish .
The leader of the opposition will know this , no matter if his name is Persson or Reinfeldt .
So why would he not talk to us to see if he can create a majority for a vote of no confidence ?
And why would he not meet our demands when he has had time to think about them , and realize that they do not oppose his own ideology or any core party issues in any way ?
If we make it to the parliament , but can not tip the scale
Even if we would not reach a position where we can tip the scale , we can still do a lot of good in the standing committees .
Much of the malfunctioning legislation that is voted through is often voted through because the established parties do not understand the Internet and all the new technology .
They have not thought through the consequences of building a controlled society to conserve the old instead of embracing the possibilities we have in our time .
They often blindly trust what lobbyists and civil servants at the departments tell them to think .
They do not see these issues as important enough to put down time getting an informed opinion .
We can hopefully change this , simply by being part of the committees , pressing the fact that these are important issues .
Neither social democrats nor moderates really want to make it illegal for small businesses to develop new software , after all , or put all Swedish youths in prison .
The fact that they still make or argue for laws that has these consequences is mostly due to lack of knowledge .
We can supply the standing committees with a well needed competence and a valuable perspective .
– If we ca n’t tip the scale , will we try to negotiate about individual issues ?
In this scenario , negotiations will hardly be our most important tool , simply because we would n’t have much of a negotiation position .
If they can create a majority without us , they wo n’t need to negotiate with us at all .
But this does not mean that all would be lost .
We could still add a lot , simply by being constructive in our committee work .
Much of the worst legislation is due to the fact that the established parties lack knowledge and interest in our issues .
– …or will we simply cancel our votes ?
In a situation where there is a parliamentary majority without us , it would n’t matter how we voted , and then it does n’t make a difference .
The simplest thing would be to simply not vote .
– …or do we present bills that are promptly turned down ?
We might want to present bills as part of our work to clarify the choices our society has , but the purpose then would only be to raise these issues .
We would probably have to spend more time discussing the pros and cons of the bills that are about to be clubbed .
– …or should we simply stay home with our kids ?
Participating in the committees in a constructive manner aside , there will be much work to be done on the European level .
Some of the decisions we want carried through can only be made in Brussels .
Therefore we have all reason to do what we can to support our sister parties in other countries , and help them get started .
So there might not be much time for vacation , even if we do n’t get to support a government .
SEVEN hundred and forty centuries ago , give or take a few , the skies darkened and the Earth caught a cold .
Toba , a volcano in Sumatra , had exploded with the sort of eruptive force that convulses the planet only once every few million years .
The skies stayed dark for six years , so much dust did the eruption throw into the atmosphere .
It was a dismal time to be alive and , if Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois is right , the chances were you would be dead soon .
In particular , the population of one species , known to modern science as Homo sapiens , plummeted to perhaps 2,000 individuals .
The proverbial Martian , looking at that darkened Earth , would probably have given long odds against these peculiar apes making much impact on the future .
True , they had mastered the art of tool - making , but so had several of their contemporaries .
True , too , their curious grunts allowed them to collaborate in surprisingly sophisticated ways .
But those advantages came at a huge price , for their brains were voracious consumers of energy — a mere 2 % of the body 's tissue absorbing 20 % of its food intake .
An interesting evolutionary experiment , then , but surely a blind alley .
This survey will attempt to explain why that mythical Martian would have been wrong .
It will ask how these apes not only survived but prospered , until the time came when one of them could weave together strands of evidence from fields as disparate as geology and genetics , and conclude that his ancestors had gone through a genetic bottleneck caused by a geological catastrophe .
Not all of his contemporaries agree with Dr Ambrose about Toba 's effect on humanity .
The eruption certainly happened , but there is less consensus about his suggestion that it helped form the basis for what are now known as humanity 's racial divisions , by breaking Homo sapiens into small groups whose random physical quirks were preserved in different places .
The idea is not , however , absurd .
It is based on a piece of evolutionary theory called the founder effect , which shows how the isolation of small populations from larger ones can accelerate evolutionary change , because a small population 's average characteristics are likely to differ from those of the larger group from which it is drawn .
Like much evolutionary theory , this is just applied common sense .
But only recently has such common sense been applied systematically to areas of anthropology that have traditionally ignored it and sometimes resisted it .
The result , when combined with new techniques of genetic analysis , has been a revolution in the understanding of humanity 's past .
And anthropology is not the only human science to have been infused with evolutionary theory .
Psychology , too , is undergoing a makeover and the result is a second revolution , this time in the understanding of humanity 's present .
Such understanding has been of two types , which often get confused .
One is the realisation that many human activities , not all of them savoury , happen for exactly the same reasons as in other species .
For example , altruistic behaviour towards relatives , infidelity , rape and murder are all widespread in the animal kingdom .
All have their own evolutionary logic .
No one argues that they are anything other than evolutionarily driven in species other than man .
Yet it would be extraordinary if they were not so driven in man , because it would mean that natural selection had somehow contrived to wipe out their genetic underpinnings , only for them to re-emerge as culturally determined phenomena .
Understanding this shared evolutionary history with other species is important ; much foolishness has flowed from its denial .
But what is far more intriguing is the progress made in understanding what makes humanity different from other species : friendship with non-relatives ; the ability to conceive of what others are thinking , and act accordingly ; the creation of an almost unimaginably diverse range of artefacts , some useful , some merely decorative ; and perhaps most importantly , the use of language , which allows collaboration on a scale denied to other creatures .
There are , of course , gaps in both sets of explanations .
And this field of research being a self - examination , there are also many controversies , not all driven by strictly scientific motives .
But the outlines of a science of human evolution that can explain humanity 's success , and also its continuing failings , are now in place .
It is just a question of filling in the canvas — or the cave wall .
This is the first article in a four part series that tells of the rise and fall of Virtudyne , one of the largest privately - financed ( $ 200 M ) disasters in our industry .
Though all names have been changed to protect the guilty , I 've worked very closely with Rob Graves ( the submitter ) to ensure that this presentation is as close to how it happened as possible .
By most people 's standard , The Founder was very wealthy .
A successful entrepreneur since age seventeen , he built several multi-million dollar companies and amassed a fortune larger than that of most A - list Hollywood celebrities .
He prided himself on having one of the largest private collections of Egyptian artifacts in the world and prominently displayed many of them in his Great Room .
And it truly was a great room : having been to The Founder 's mansion several times , Rob recalls that his two - story , four - bedroom home could easily fit inside the Great Room .
The Founder was at home one day , doing whatever retired rich people did in 1999 , and became extremely aggravated with how slow his brand - new , top - of - the - line computer was running .
While cursing Microsoft Office , he had an " ah - ha " moment : he could build a better Microsoft Office .
Recalling his days as a Digital PDP - 11 programmer , he knew that he could write financial software that would support fifty users , perform great , and run in 256 - bytes of memory .
Given the monumental advances in the twenty - years since he coded , he was elated just to think what would be possible with a bunch of top - notch programmers such as himself .
He wondered just how many people it would take to build a Microsoft Office killer .
One thing led to another and Virtudyne was born .
Its goal was modest : become the next Microsoft Office killer .
The Founder hired his long - time colleague as the Chief Information Officer and together , they would create The Plan .
It was simple : develop an internet / intranet based Office / Collaboration system that would deliver " 90 % of functionality that 90 % of [ Microsoft Office ] users use . "
An avid programmer himself , the CIO knew exactly how they could accomplish this .
He convinced The Founder that , with a handful of programmers helping him , he could develop a client / server Microsoft Office Killer using Visual Basic 6 .
And with the latest hardware available , their application could easily scale to support twenty million users using one , maybe two servers .
And best of all , it would all take only six months to create .
It was the perfect opportunity to jump on the .com bandwagon .
They just could feel the IPO beckoning them .
The Founder invested a few million of his own dollars and the CIO started hiring .
One of the first people the CIO approached was Rob Graves .
He wanted Rob to become the database administrator , telling him only that Virtudyne was a pre-IPO startup bankrolled by The Founder .
As tempting as it was , Rob had a second kid on the way and declined the offer .
The CIO would have to find another DBA for the project .
What better place to find a DBA than the same place he turned for the rest of the initial hiring : the local Visual Basic special interest group .
In fact , not only did he find a DBA at the SIG , he found one that proclaimed to be one of the greatest DBA in the world .
And not because he possessed extensive database administration skills , but because he was willing to admit to The Truth : with the GUI - tools and automagic processes that modern databases offer , all those extensive database administration skills are meaningless .
Sadly , the DBA was one of the more talented members of the initial Virtudyne team .
Next Article : Virtudine : The Gathering .
It 's what happens when you give this team tens of millions of dollars to develop a client / server Microsoft Office Killer using Visual Basic 6
If you 're going to survive a zombie outbreak , there are some things you will need to keep in mind not to do :
If you live anywhere near an industry that produces toxic waste of an unknown type , do n't just sit around , move to a different town !
This toxic waste will eventually somehow contaminate the area and turn everyone but you into cannibal zombies .
Do not read from any books written in blood and bound in human skin , or listen to any tapes made thereof .
This has a tendency to cause zombies to appear .
If you pick a place to hide out , make sure that there are no dead people already inside , since they will eventually become zombies and attack you .
Do n't try and reason with any zombies , just run .
They may appear to be paying attention to you , but that is because they are actually trying to gauge the quickest way through your skull .
Do n't use a blunt instrument if you have to fight zombies .
This will only break a bone or two and make them mad .
Projectile weapons are the most effective ( but only if you can consistently hit the brain ) .
Otherwise , chainsaws and lawnmowers have been known to work in a pinch .
If any of your friends die , do n't just let them lie there ( assuming that there 's anything left ) .
Make sure and shoot them in the head .
Otherwise , they will rise again and somehow find you later when you least expect it , and you 'll have to shoot them in the head then anyway .
If you are trapped by zombies with someone that you do n't get along with , keep a close eye on that person .
Experience has shown that conflict within a group of defenders can provoke irrational actions , leading to the demise of one or more of the group .
While trapped inside a building by zombies , do n't go near the windows , even boarded up ones .
The zombies will stand outside moaning quietly to themselves until you are right by the window , and then they will suddenly punch through it and grab you .
The other zombies will try and distract you by pounding on the doors and walls , and saying " Braaaaaains " .
If you have to run through a crowd of zombies , do n't get too confident just because they have limited brain power and move slowly .
Zombies have a death grip ( no pun intended ) , and if you get too close to one , you 'll regret it .
If you 're trapped in a farmhouse by a zombie horde , do n't just sit there waiting for rescuers .
Use your spare time to make a big sign that says " DON'T SHOOT ME , I'M HUMAN ! " so that said rescuers do n't make a mistake when they see you .
A New Sun Born in Computer Wears the Right Look for Eclipse
Introduction

Resources
New NASA and National Science Foundation - funded research has produced the most true - to - life computer simulation ever made of our sun 's multimillion - degree atmosphere , as confirmed by actual observations during the March 29 solar eclipse .
This modeling effort marks the beginning of a new era in space weather prediction , showing that computer models can in fact describe the physics of the sun 's active outer atmosphere , also known as the corona .
The better scientists understand this region , the better prepared they are to understand and forecast space weather events and protect astronauts , satellites and communications and power systems on Earth .+

In last week 's show we drew your attention to the new sedition offences , as proposed in the leaked draft of the government 's Anti Terrorist bill , which is still on our website .
Dictionaries define sedition as conduct or language inciting rebellion against the government .
As a criminal offence it has a long and dishonourable history as a means of shutting down political dissent , back in the Cold War and before .
Our concern is how the new sedition offences might criminalise the expression , reporting and publication of the range of opinions in our society .
Read Schedule 7 of the Draft Bill here
The Attorney General 's office had sent us this :
Will this offence prevent journalists from reporting on terrorist activities ?
These offences are not designed to prevent journalists from reporting in good faith .
— Question and Answer brief from the Attorney General 's Office
Read the Talking Points on Sedition in full here
But there 's nothing in the good faith provisions that explicitly refers to the media .
So rather than just rely on the Attorney General 's good faith , we sought senior counsels ' legal advice .
They confirmed we were right to be worried .
The Bill does not do anything to provide that assurance ...
In terms of any possible defences for acts done in good faith , it seems to us that they have relatively limited operation to media publications of " seditious " opinions .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 19

So , how might the media find itself in trouble ?
Let 's look at some specific examples .
This is journalist John Pilger speaking on the ABC's Lateline programme last year , about the insurgents in Iraq :
John Pilger : ... we 've always depended on resistances to get rid of occupiers , to get rid of invaders .
And what we have in Iraq now is I suppose the equivalent of a kind of Vichy Government being set up .
And a resistance is always atrocious , it 's always bloody .
It always involves terrorism .
You can imagine if Australia was occupied by the Japanese during the Second World War the kind of resistance there would have been , and so on .
We 've seen that all over the world .
Now , I think the situation in Iraq is so dire that unless the United States is defeated there that we 're likely to see an attack on Iran , we 're likely to see an attack on North Korea and all the way down the road it could be even an attack on China within a decade , so I think what happens in Iraq now is incredibly important .
Tony Jones :
You mean defeated militarily ?
John Pilger : Yes .
Tony Jones :
Can you approve in that context the killing of American , British or Australian troops who are in the occupying forces ?
John Pilger :
Well yes , they 're legitimate targets .
They 're illegally occupying a country .
And I would have thought from an Iraqi 's point of view they are legitimate targets .
They have to be , sure .
— Lateline , ABC TV , 10 March 2004
Read the Lateline transcript in full here
Pilger 's comments caused an uproar at the time .
Foreign Minister Downer described them as " dangerous " .
Pilger Should Say Sorry John Pilger has plumbed new depths with his distasteful and dangerous comments about Iraq .
He should immediately apologise to his fellow Australians , especially the relatives and friends of our armed services personnel serving in Iraq .
— Foreign Minister Downer , 11 March 2004 www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2004/fa036_04.html
Many Australians would probably agree with Alexander Downer .
But do we think Pilger should be charged with sedition for comments like those ?
Our legal advice is that he could be found guilty under s80.2 of the Draft Bill .
In our view it would be open to construe Pilger 's words as urging or inviting any person to engage in the conduct of the forceful elimination of Australian troops and their defeat in Iraq .
There would certainly be an arguable case sufficient to place the evidence and surrounding circumstances before a jury .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 16
The penalty remember is a possible 7 years in jail .
Now you may not be a Pilger fan , but would you really want to silence him like that ?
Our legal advice does not of course say this is certain , but the breadth and the vagueness of the proposed new offences is part of the danger .
The inevitable consequence of the Bill will be to stifle the making of those statements , or even the reporting or repetition of them by others legitimately involved in public debate on such issues .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 16
But how could the new laws reach beyond the person who makes the seditious comments , to criminalise the media outlet that puts them to air ?
According to our legal advice :
If a journalist or producer of a television programme invited such a commentator onto a program knowing that such comments were likely to be made and directly or indirectly invited those comments by directed questions ... the producers of the program ... could be equally exposed .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 19
So in our hypothetical case , Tony Jones and Lateline could be charged .
Now before you say " but no sane jury would convict them for that " , check what Sunday Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt wrote about Pilger 's comments at the time .
It was n't , he said , just Pilger who was the traitor and the enemy in our midst , it was also the ABC , who gave his views a platform .
Traitors in our fight for survival Andrew Bolt On Wednesday Pilger appeared on ABC TV's Lateline to promote his noxious views .
This apologist for terrorists - this moral pygmy - is ... welcomed into an ABC Studio and promoted by SBS ...
Not all the enemies of our civilisation are Islamic or foreigners .
Many are people we pay to defend our culture , but , we find , betray it instead .
— Sunday Herald Sun , 14 March 2004
We could of course have chosen other examples .
Like this snippet from the SBS Insight program , which features the radical Melbourne Cleric , Sheikh Omran :
Reporter :
Is it a good Muslim 's duty to go and fight the coalition forces for jihad in Iraq at the moment ?
Sheikh Mohammed Omran : I would say yes .
— SBS TV , Insight , 30 October 2003
Our advice is that Omran 's comments would be likely to be found seditious as " urging " assistance to the enemy .
There is a high likelihood that clause 80 .
2 ( 8 ) has application ... the suggestion that it is indeed one 's duty might well be capable of satisfying the requirement of urging in the proposed amendments .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 16
Now while we have no truck with what Sheikh Omran is saying , we do take the view that 's it better that we know what he 's thinking and saying , rather than driving views like his underground .
Or alternatively making him a criminal martyr .
Our advice is that SBS 's liability would depend on the context in which Omran 's comments were broadcast .
Far more vulnerable to prosecution will be media outlets like Islamic web sites .
It would be easy to see how opinion or comment by others ( published , for example , on a Muslim or other ethnic media resource ) could be seen to be endorsing " seditious " opinion by its mere publication .
— Senior Counsel advice to Media Watch , pg 18
We do of course believe it 's crucial that we have laws that criminalise the incitement of violence and terrorism .
We have them already .
There 's also a case that the government is right , that the old laws of sedition are out of date .
But it 's crucial that laws which inhibit the right to free speech should be carefully drafted and much debated , or they 'll do more harm than good , especially as according to the Bill there 's no sunset clause on these new offences .
You can read the full legal opinion that we commissioned on our web site .
And offer your own opinion .
Until next week , good night .
Eating a very low - calorie yet nutritionally balanced diet is good for your heart .
Studying heart function in members of an organization called the Caloric Restriction Society , investigators at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that their hearts functioned like the hearts of much younger people .
The researchers report their findings in the Jan. 17 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .
Ultrasound examinations showed that the hearts of people on caloric restriction appeared more elastic than those of age - and gender - matched control subjects .
Their hearts were able to relax between beats in a way similar to the hearts in younger people .
“ This is the first study to demonstrate that long - term calorie restriction with optimal nutrition has cardiac - specific effects that ameliorate age - associated declines in heart function , ” says principal investigator Luigi Fontana , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis and an investigator at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita , Rome , Italy .
Research on mice and rats has shown that stringent and consistent caloric restriction increases the animals ’ maximum lifespan by about 30 percent and protects them against atherosclerosis and cancer , but human study has been difficult because the caloric restriction lifestyle requires a strict diet regimen , both to keep the total number of calories low and to insure that people consume the proper balance of nutrients .
The researchers studied 25 calorie - restricted individuals who had voluntarily been consuming a very low - calorie diet for an average of six years ( consuming about 1,400 to 2,000 calories per day ) .
They ranged in age from 41 to 65 .
The study compared their heart function to 25 age - and gender - matched individuals who ate a typical Western diet ( about 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day ) .
In Western countries , heart attacks and strokes are responsible for about 40 percent of all deaths .
Cancer causes about another 30 percent .
According to Fontana , deaths in both groups can be attributed to what scientists call secondary aging .
That ’s the term used to characterize health problems that result from conditions such as high cholesterol , diabetes , high blood pressure and other preventable conditions that contribute to premature death .
A healthy diet and regular exercise can reduce risks from secondary aging .
But this study suggests calorie restriction with optimal nutrition can do even more .
Normal aging causes a decline in cardiac performance .
Before it pumps blood to the rest of the body , the heart ’s left ventricle fills with blood in a two - phase process .
The first phase , which fills the ventricle in healthy hearts to about 80 percent capacity , is a passive , suction - mediated mechanism called early ventricular filling .
The second phase is more active because the heart ’s atrium contracts to completely fill the ventricle with blood .
As we get older , less blood gathers during the passive , diastolic phase , so the atrium has to work harder to increase the amount of blood it forces into the ventricle .
“ This decline in diastolic function is a marker of primary aging , ” Fontana says .
“ Diastolic function declines in most people as they get older , but in this study we found that diastolic function in calorie - restricted people resembled diastolic function in individuals about 15 years younger . ”
It may even be possible that eating a very low - calorie , nutrient dense diet reverses declines in diastolic function .
People in the study averaged only six years on the diet , but their hearts looked 15 years younger .
So Fontana says it ’s possible that the diet has a rejuvenating effect .
He notes that most study subjects had parents , grandparents or siblings who suffered heart attacks or strokes , making it unlikely that their genetic makeup is a contributor to the unusual healthiness of their hearts .
In the case of one subject , both parents and younger brother currently take medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol .
Some subjects actually took medicine for high blood pressure themselves before they started on caloric restriction .
Fontana and colleagues previously have found that people on the very low - calorie diet have low blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides , blood pressure scores equivalent to those of much younger individuals , a lower risk of developing diabetes and reduced body fat .
These markers indicate less secondary aging .
In this study , Fontana ’s team found that markers of inflammation indicative of primary aging were much lower in the caloric restriction group .
Their serum levels of a pro-inflammatory molecule called tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFa ) were significantly lower .
They also had less C- reactive protein ( CRP ) .
In addition , they had lower amounts of a substance called transforming growth factor - beta ( TGFb ) , a molecule that both helps reverse inflammation and activates cells called fibroblasts to produce collagen .
If , for example , you cut yourself , your body will work to repair the damage by activating fibroblasts to produce collagen and make scar tissue to heal the wound .
Fontana says the low levels of TNFa , CRP and TGFb , combined with evidence of “ younger ” hearts in people on caloric restriction , has led his research team to hypothesize that inflammation may play a key role in the aging process .
“ Our hypothesis is that low - grade , chronic inflammation is mediating primary aging , ” he says .
“ It ’s not the only factor , of course — aging is a complex process .
But we found less inflammation in these people — less TNFa , C- reactive protein and TGFb — as well as a more flexible ventricle in their hearts . ”
Overweight and obese people also tend to have higher levels of inflammation than lean people .
In this study , those on caloric restriction had about 7 percent total body fat .
The control group had about 25 percent body fat .
“ It ’s very clear from these studies that caloric restriction has a powerful , protective effect against diseases associated with aging , ” says co-investigator John O. Holloszy , M.D. , professor of medicine .
“ We do n’t know how long each individual will end up living , but they certainly have a longer life expectancy than average because they ’re most likely not going to die from a heart attack , stroke or diabetes .
And if , in fact , their hearts are aging more slowly , it ’s conceivable they ’ll live for a very long time . ”
Members of the Caloric Restriction Optimal Nutrition Society try to consume between 10 and 25 percent fewer calories than average Americans while still maintaining proper nutrition .
Fontana says that ’s a very important point .
People on this type of diet do n’t simply consume less food .
“ Caloric restriction does not mean eating half a hamburger and half a pack of French fries and drinking half of a sugary beverage , ” he says .
“ These people have very good nutrition .
They eliminate calories by eating nutrient - dense foods . ”
He says caloric restriction tends to resemble a traditional Mediterranean diet , which includes a wide variety of vegetables , olive oil , beans , whole grains , fish and fruit .
The diet avoids refined and processed foods , soft drinks , desserts , white bread and other sources of so - called “ empty ” calories .
But Fontana and Holloszy do n’t believe that caloric restriction is for everyone .
Instead , they recommend a moderate reduction in calories , combined with moderate , regular exercise .
“ If you change the quality of your diet by increasing the servings of nutrient - dense food and reducing — actually , it would be better to slowly eliminate — all of the servings of ’ empty ’ calorie foods , you improve your chances of living a healthier and longer life , ” Fontana says .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -
Tax breaks benefiting buyers of sports - utility vehicles fly in the face of a good energy policy and are costing American taxpayers billions of dollars a year , according to a report from Rep. Edward Markey .
" It is incredible that the Bush Administration and Republican Congress can be so blind as to leave these tax loopholes in place while our dependence on Middle East oil soars , the price of gasoline spikes , and our soldiers are mired a war in the Middle East , " said Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts .
The study , which includes estimates from the Joint Tax Committee of Congress and focuses on two policies favoring the purchase heavier vehicles over smaller models , showed that the tax breaks will cost $ 2.6 billion next year and $ 15.7 billion over the next 10 years .
The first break is the exemption light trucks and minivans get from the Gas Guzzler Tax , a levy imposed on autos rated below 22.5 miles per gallon .
As an example , the report said an Audi station wagon that gets 20.5 mpg incurs a $ 1,300 tax , while a 15.8 mpg Jeep incurs no penalty .
Markey also criticized a policy that allows businesses to purchase SUVs and write off most or all of the cost of the vehicle on their income taxes in the first year .
That amounts to a subsidy of almost $ 600 million a year , and $ 4.1 billion over the next 10 years , he said .
" This makes no sense .
Congress is using the tax code to generate artificial demand for inefficient vehicles in the automobile marketplace , " said Markey , who introduced a bill aimed at eliminating both tax breaks for SUVs .
" Regardless of whether we ever ramp up and modernize the minimum fuel economy standards , providing these out - of - date tax incentives that reward the purchase of inefficient vehicles just make things worse , " he added .
Meanwhile , demand for the so - called gas guzzlers has fallen off steadily in recent years , a blow to domestic automakers that depend heavily on the full - size vehicles for profits .
Truck sales at General Motors GM , - 2.04 % plunged 31.2 % in July , while Ford's F , - 0.82 % fell 43.8 % .

The decline led Ford to slash production 21 % in the fourth quarter .

“ You ’re just not going to get access to the whole range of the scene , ” said John Peterson , a senior computer scientist at Adobe who helped develop Photoshop .
The problem , quite simply , is that the data image editors need is not captured by cameras , even if the image was saved as a RAW file , which holds more data than a conventional JPEG photo .
The concept of H.D.R. photography is fairly simple .
It starts with a photographer harvesting every bit of difference in brightness by taking several different photos of the same scene , with large exposure differences between them .
Software then sorts through the resulting images , which range from underexposed views that are nearly black to washed - out overexposures , to calculate the full dynamic range of the view .
Using that vast amount of data , it then constructs a single , high dynamic range photo .
At least that ’s the theory .
While the actual practice can be highly automated , it is slightly more complicated .
While Adobe did not invent the idea of H.D.R. , it popularized it by making it a feature in Photoshop CS2 , the $ 650 professional version of its program introduced last year .
( H.D.R. is not part of Photoshop Elements , the considerably less expensive consumer version of the program . )
Mr. Dejesus uses PhotomatixPro , which is available for $ 100 from a French company , HDR Software ( www.hdrsoft.com).
And a German programmer , who prefers to call the process full dynamic range photography , sells a program called FDRTools for $ 53 ( www.fdrtools.com).

It wasnt so long ago that most people , if they thought about politics at all , tended to categorize themselves as either liberal or conservative .
And most of those people considered themselves to be conservative rather than liberal , by a margin of more than two to one .
For most of the past 50 or so years , labeling oneself a conservative meant proclaiming that one believed in a smaller , less - intrusive federal government , the hope for a balanced budget , lower taxes , and even the hope , if dim , that the national debt might someday be paid off .
Traditional conservatives also believed in a strong military establishment that would be ready to defend the nation against an attack from foreign shores , but would not be sent off on expansionist excursions into foreign lands .
Above all , conservatives traditionally have had respect for , and have advocated comportment with , the Constitution .
But the prevailing model of conservatism today centers on and defers to the persona of the president , having little regard for the literal words of the Constitution , while subordinating the concept of checks and balances to the presumed duties and prerogatives of the commander in chief .
These wartime conservatives are imbued with a messianic confidence that the United States is charged by heaven with bringing the world virtuous democracies that will help less - enlightened peoples enjoy the marvelous values , lifestyles , and overall culture that befit us here at home .
Moreover , messianic conservatives in doing these good works hold themselves justified in being oblivious to world opinion .
They walk and talk with a swagger , and are ready to get tough whenever and wherever any person or nation appears ready to challenge their imperious policies .
These new - model conservatives even argue that domestic spying without a court order is acceptable and that torture is all right if needed to accomplish their ends .
Party has trumped principle .
To publicly question the war - time actions of the commander in chief brings quick censure , as in not supporting our troops  or as in helping the terrorists .
As Paul Craig Roberts puts it , like the Brownshirts of Nazi Germany , these conservatives take personally any criticism of their leader and his policies .
To be a critic is to be an enemy .
You re either with us or against us .
Pope John Paul II decried this pervasive and destructive attitude as  the ideology of force . 
Other ways in which traditional conservatism has changed is seen in the way federal spending in the past few years not only has gone unquestioned but has actually been abetted .
And its not only ever - growing military spending that encounters indifference but domestic spending as well .
Under the purview of a supine , nominally conservative Congress , federal spending has broken all bounds .
New social programs are adopted unquestioned .
New agricultural subsidies are championed .
Civil liberties , the fundamental driving force of the American revolution , now are dismissed as a casualty of war , something not to be worried about , and the mention of which exposes a lack of backbone and grit in the protester .
But in spite of their mindless acceptance by modern conservatives , these attributes of bloated government do not represent traditional conservative ideals .
It appears that the angry , power - hungry conservatives of today may be losing their grip on Washington , just as the neoconservatives and their discredited foreign policies are fading from the seat of power .
Empires imposed by force on others do not live forever and puppet governments are eventually overthrown .
Runaway public debt , sooner or later , must be either repaid or repudiated , likely in the collapse of the value of the dollar .
Civil liberties , once so easily and thoughtlessly surrendered , will be harder by orders of magnitude for our children and grandchildren to reclaim .
All of these failed policies can be laid at the feet of todays ruling conservatives .
If this is what conservatism has become , deliver me to libertarianism .

MANHATTAN , Kan. —
Thousands of students from Saudi Arabia are enrolling on college campuses across the United States this semester under a new educational exchange program brokered by President Bush and Saudi King Abdullah .
The program will quintuple the number of Saudi students and scholars in the United States by the academic year ’s end .
And big , public universities from Florida to Oregon are in a fierce competition for their tuition dollars .
The kingdom ’s royal family — which is paying full scholarships for most of the 15,000 students — says the program will help stem unrest at home by schooling the country ’s brightest in the American tradition .
The State Department sees the exchange as a way to build ties with future Saudi leaders and young scholars at a time of unsteady relations with the Muslim world .
But some officials say efforts to fast - track educational diplomacy with Saudi Arabia could use additional scrutiny .
Clark Kent Ervin , a former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , said the U.S. government has yet to ensure proper safeguards are in place to do effective background checks on all applicants .
Administrators at Kansas State University , an agricultural school surrounded by miles of prairie grass , say the scholarships are a bonanza for public education .
“ The Saudi scholarship program has definitely heightened our interest in that part of the world , ” said Kenneth Holland , associate provost for international programs .
“ Not only are the students fully funded , but they ’re also paying out - of - state tuition . ”
Kansas State administrators say common misperceptions about the oil - rich nation make it crucial to create a tolerant environment for Arab and Muslim students , who have been singled out for scrutiny since the September 11 attacks .
Before then , Saudi visa applicants were allowed to bypass the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh by submitting their applications to preapproved travel agencies , which forwarded them onto the consulate for approval or rejection .
Three of the 15 Saudi September 11 hijackers used that program , dubbed “ Visa Express , ” to enter the United States .
“ Since then , everything has changed , ” Saudi Embassy spokesman Nail Al - Jubeir said .
“ There are long lines to wait for a visa .
Once they get in to a university here , they are checked and rechecked . ”
In 2002 , Congress mandated that the DHS create the “ Visa Security Officer ” program in consular offices in Saudi Arabia .
That would bump up security by allowing counterterrorism officials to check visa applications against lists of known or suspected terrorists , Mr. Ervin said .
That same year , Congress also instituted the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System , or SEVIS , which monitors all foreign students ’ activities — including where they live , whether they go to class and whether they finish their studies .
All foreign students are tracked on that program , which Mr. Holland said made him feel “ very comfortable . ”
Kansas State boosted efforts to court Saudi officials in the past year , flying administrators and department heads to the Saudi Embassy in Washington .
It ’s paid off : Last month about 150 Saudi students started classes there , each funded to the tune of about $ 31,000 .
Mr. Al - Jubeir said 90 percent of the Saudi students the State Department has registered for the fall semester in the United States also will get such scholarships .
“ This is a critically important bilateral relationship , ” said Tom Farrell , a deputy assistant secretary for academic programs at the State Department .
“ It ’s an opportunity to increase understanding of Saudi Arabia for the United States and of the United States for Saudi Arabia . ”
As Kansas State students enjoy a string of home football games this month , they also are preparing for the campus ’ first celebration of Ramadan , the Muslim holy month .
“ We really want to make this special .
We ’re going to truck in halal food from Kansas City , ” Mr. Holland said .
“ The Saudi government is trying to place the students in a variety of institutions across the country , but where you get the competitive advantage is how you treat the students when they get here . ”
Marwan Al - Kadi , who was active in the Muslim student association while he studied industrial engineering at Kansas State , said efforts to raise awareness about religious diversity have helped the new influx of students feel comfortable .
“ Sometimes people ask me if I ride a camel to campus .
They do n’t even realize how many cities we have in Saudi Arabia , ” Mr. Al - Kadi said .
“ I want to use the education to go back and work for my father ’s company . ”
Allan Goodman , president and chief executive officer of the Institute of International Education in New York , said the new bilateral agreement is a “ tremendously positive ” step toward person - to - person diplomacy .
“ These 15,000 students will really jump - start education , and that will be a great addition to the kingdom , ” Mr. Goodman said .
“ At its base , it ’s about mutual understanding . ”

I ’ve gotten about thirty speeding tickets in my short life , but I have zero tickets on my record .
That ’s because no matter how formal the processes may seem , when it comes to law enforcement , you are still dealing with human beings with hearts and minds just like yours .
Appeal to them as such , and you will be amazed by the results .
Advertisement
Although I am a law student , I employed this advice before I ever went to law school , and my education has only reinforced these theories .
My approach is n’t foolproof legal advice - it ’s simply my experienced opinions with a little law mixed in .
That said , here are my secrets to getting out of a speeding ticket ordered chronologically , from the point of being pulled over to your final options in the courtroom .
Note :
All of this advice assumes that you are merely breaking traffic laws .
If you ’re trafficking a kilo of crystal meth ... well , if you traffic meth , you ’re probably not reading Lifehacker .
So read on , non -meth - heads .
Advertisement
Blue lights ... you ’re getting pulled over
1 . Get your attitude right .
Fighting with the police officer never increases your chances of leniency .
You want him to like you .
Prepare to achieve this goal .
2 . Turn your car off , and turn the interior lights of your car on .
Place your hands at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel and remove your sunglasses or hat .
Some people even advise you to place your keys on the roof of your car as a sign of total submission .
Never , ever get out of the car .
Advertisement
The whole point of this is to take any unnecessary tension out of the encounter .
You want the officer to be comfortable .
Imagine the types of people and the dangers that most officers have had to deal with .
Be just the opposite .
3 . Be very polite and do exactly what the nice cop with the big gun says .
Save your pleas until after the basics are finished .
Many officers will never speak to you until after they ’ve done the basics .
It ’s almost a litmus test for jerk drivers .
Advertisement
4 . Once the officer has gotten your information , ask him politely if you may speak to him about your violation .
If you know you broke the law , admit it vehemently and tell the officer that he was completely right for pulling you over .
Honest officers will admit that there is a lot of pride in police work , and , if you can sufficiently satisfy the pride factor , sometimes officers do n’t feel it necessary to punish you any further .
The better you make the officer feel ; the more likely he ’s going to like you enough to let you go .
Advertisement
5 . Ask to see the radar then ask a few questions .
Many jurisdictions require that the officer allow you to see the radar .
Do n’t press it if the officer says no because that ’s what a courtroom is for .
But , at least ask , then ask a few more questions to show that you are watching .

You might ask , “ When was the last time your radar gun was calibrated ? ” or “ Where were you when you clocked my speed ? ” or “ Were you moving when you clocked my speed ? ”
Do not ask these in an argumentative tone or sarcastic , know - it - all way .
All that will do is make the pride in the officer fight you harder .
Advertisement
6 . Plead your case .
Once you ’ve gone over some basics with the officer and developed a temporary rapport , ask for mercy .
Make it sincere and let the officer know that it ’s a big deal to you .
Resist all urges to fight and get angry and simply beg as much as your dignity will allow .
But , there is no reason to grovel .
Advertisement
7 . Leave the scene as a non-memorable , nice person .
If the officer did n’t let you go on the scene , then you want him to never remember you .
Your next steps are in a more legal setting , and the less the officer remembers you , the better .
Usually , officers only remember you if they want to remember to show you no mercy .

You ’ve gotten a ticket , but you still want out
8 . Call the officer at work .
Ask politely if you can arrange a time to meet with the officer to talk to him or her about a ticket you got recently .
Usually , officers will readily meet with you , the taxpayer , and this meeting has gotten me out of many tickets .
Advertisement
But , do n’t go to the meeting and just say , “ Will you let me out of this ticket ? ”
You better have a story or some reason to motivate the officer to let you out .
That ’s just up to you , but just be really nice and try to bridge that officer - civilian gap with a personal story and plead for mercy .
The more the officer can identify with you , the more likely he is to want to show you mercy .
Remember always , the officer has full authority to drop your ticket , so remember how important he is in this process .
Treat him and pursue him as the gatekeeper to your freedom .
Do n’t be scared , though .
You have a right to try to talk to the officer .
You pay his salary .
Advertisement
9 . Write a letter to the officer .
Even if you met with the officer , it ca n’t hurt to write him a letter pleading your case to him .
Write it professionally , succinctly , and include complete contact information .
I ’ve even gone so far as to offer alternative punishment .
Although that alternative was n’t accepted , the officer was pretty surprised at my tenacity , and it motivated him to let me off the hook .
He could tell that I really did care about this one ticket .
Advertisement
Make the ticket a bigger deal to you than to him , but you have to carefully do this in a professional , civil way .
Anything else , and you ’re playing with fire .
10 . Repeat calls and letters to the judge and / or the prosecutor .
If the officer wo n’t listen to you , feel free to contact the judge that will preside over your case .
Also , find out who the prosecuting attorney will be and call him at his office .
They are just people , and the worst they can say is “ no . ”
You have nothing to lose at this point .
Plead your case to either of them , but do not be a pest and be consistently apologetic for the lengths to which you are going to get out of your ticket .
You must be sincere , or do n’t bother going at all .
Advertisement
In steps 8 - 10 , you stand the risk of being labeled a nuisance or a troublemaker .
If you get this impression too much , then bail out with apologies .
But , do not be afraid to at least try to talk to the officials face - to - face .
They are , after all , public servants , and you are that public .
The court is your friend
11 . Follow all court guidelines .
Make the court clerk your best friend .
Call the clerk often , and address him or her by first name .
You want to make all court employees ’ jobs as easy as possible .
Also , you do not want to miss any deadlines .
Advertisement
12 . Delay .
Once you ’ve gotten to know the clerk , ask for as many continuances ( delays of your trial ) as you can honestly ask for .
Do not lie , but do plead for continuances to delay your trial date as long as possible .
The farther you are out of the officer ’s memory , the better .
I have heard of one case where the case was continued so long that the ticketing officer had transferred ... case dismissed automatically .
Advertisement
13 . Ask for alternative punishment .
Usually , your primary concern is keeping your ticket off your insurance .
Many times , court clerks have the authority to let you go to driving school and keep the ticket off your record .
Sometimes you have to pay court costs and the ticket , but at least your insurance premiums are n’t going up .
This completely depends on the court .
Advertisement
You ca n’t handle the truth !
14 . Understand your trial and your rights .
If you got a ticket , you have been accused of a crime .
The ticketing officer signed a sheet of paper swearing that you broke a certain traffic law , and he saw you do it .
That sworn statement is called an affidavit , and most tickets say that at the top .
Do n’t get nervous , though ; it ’s just a misdemeanor .
Advertisement
First , you ’ll have a hearing where you plead guilty , not guilty , or some other plea .
Then , you ’ll have your trial where you plead your case .
Then the judge decides your fate .
It ’s really not scary at all , and you have every right to participate fully in this process no matter how much you are intimidated .
15 . Show up to your first court date and plead anything but guilty .
Whatever you do , show up to your first hearing on time and dressed decently .
It ’s probably not a good idea to wear a suit , though .
In most traffic courts , you ’ll look silly .
If you really want to know , go scope out the court ahead of time to see what to wear to blend in best .
Advertisement
You ’ll then be asked “ what you plead . ”
Pleading not guilty is a safe bet , although there are other pleas ( e.g. nolo contendre ) that have strange consequences in some courts .
In some courts , a plea of nolo contendre has the strange effect of making your ticket just disappear to the court ’s files .
You ’d want to talk to a local lawyer about that one , though .
Most of the time , just politely say , “ I plead not guilty , your honor . ”
You ’ll be assigned a court date , and spend the next few weeks repeating steps 8 - 13 .
This is your second chance before the big day .
Advertisement
16 . Go to court and duke it out .
If all else has failed , you should then go to your trial .
Do not miss this out of fear , or you will definitely be found guilty .
For instance , if the officer does n’t show up , for any reason , you ’re automatically out of the ticket .
This is not unheard of .
( Editor ’s note : this is not always the case , and while it can happen , it ’s never a guarantee .
See our article on traffic myths for more information . )
Advertisement
Also , you may be able to talk to the officer or prosecutor before trial and cut a deal , just like the real convicts do on TV .
If the officer is nervous about his case against you , he might let you off .
This just depends on your case , but at least ask .
Advertisement
The trial is pretty simple .
The prosecution will present their case against you .
You get to respond and call witnesses if you want , and then the prosecution rebuts you .
You can not screw this up .
At the very worst , you ’re found guilty , and you ’ve lost nothing .
Do not be scared to do this .
It is your right , and you should claim it .
17 . Suck it up , or fight on .
The judge will rule on you ... guilty , not guilty , or some other punishment .
You either take it or appeal it to the court of appeals .
Rarely would it be financially wise to appeal a traffic decision , but that is up to you .
And you do have the right .
Advertisement
Chances are , you let it die here .
Try to make friends with the officer and prosecutor for next time , though .
18 . Suck up ... err , I mean write more letters .
It ca n’t hurt to write the officer and prosecutor a letter telling them how nice they were and easy to deal with .
Also , copy this letter to the mayor and the chief of police , and make sure you show the cc : at the bottom of the letter .
That ’s your investment in next time .

Rage against the machine ( without all the rage )
This stuff is n’t rocket science .
You ’re just dealing with people and trying to get them to see things your way .
You have very little to lose , and it ’s a fun way to get to participate in the very government under which you live .
I encourage all of you to employ all these steps in a friendly , civil way .
Forget everything you ’ve learned about courtrooms and lawyers and cops , and just go in there as a human being .
It ’s your right , and it can really be fun and exciting .
Think of it as your own personal crusade , and , if you push on , you will be amazed at how easy it is to find justice .

Slow it down there , speedy .
This is not legal advice .
I am not a lawyer , but I am a law student .
These are generalized discussions of life experiences , and any legal statements are simply journalistic opinion and fact .
If you ’ve got real problems , remember everything you ’ve learned about lawyers , and go hire one .

Just take a look .
Waves are freezing as they flow .
Vast deposits of personal information sit in databases across the internet .
Terms used in phone conversations have become the grounds for federal investigation .
Reputable organizations like the Catholic Worker , Greenpeace , and the Vegan Community Project , have come under scrutiny by FBI " counterterrorism " agents .
" Data mining " of all that information and communication is at the heart of the furor over the recent disclosure of government snooping .
" U.S. President George W. Bush and his aides have said his executive order allowing eavesdropping without warrants was limited to monitoring international phone and e-mail communications linked to people with connections to al - Qaeda .
What has not been acknowledged , according to the Times , is that NSA technicians combed large amounts of phone and Internet traffic seeking patterns pointing to terrorism suspects .
" Some officials described the program as a large data mining operation , the Times said , and described it as much larger than the White House has acknowledged . " ( Reuters )
Combining a data mining operation with the Patriot Act 's power to access information makes it all too easy for the federal government to violate the Constitution 's prohibition against unreasonable search .
Ars Technica has an article ,
The new technology at the root of the NSA wiretap scandal , that describes the ease with which widespread wiretapping can now be implemented .
It quotes Philip Zimmermann , the creator of the PGP encryption software :
" A year after the CALEA [ Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ] passed [ in 1994 ] , the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major U.S. cities .
This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped .
In previous years , there were only about a thousand court - ordered wiretaps in the United States per year , at the federal , state , and local levels combined .
It 's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls , much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time .
The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all , searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker 's voice .
If the government does n't find the target in the first 1 percent sample , the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent until the target is found , or until everyone 's phone line has been checked for subversive traffic .
The FBI said they need this capacity to plan for the future .
This plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in Congress .
But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda . "
It used to be you had to get a warrant to monitor a person or a group of people .
Today , it is increasingly easy to monitor ideas .
And then track them back to people .
Most of us do n't have access to the databases , software , or computing power of the NSA , FBI , and other government agencies .
But an individual with access to the internet can still develop a fairly sophisticated profile of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens using free and publicly available resources .
Here 's an example .
There are many websites and databases that could be used for this project , but few things tell you as much about a person as the books he chooses to read .
Is n't that why the Patriot Act specifically requires libraries to release information on who 's reading what ?
For this reason , I chose to focus on the information contained in the popular Amazon wishlists .
Amazon wishlists lets anyone bookmark books for later purchase .
By default these lists are public and available to anybody who searches by name .
If the wishlist creator specifies a shipping address , someone else can even purchase the book on Amazon and have it shipped directly as a gift .
The wishlist creator 's city and state are made public on the wishlist , but the street address remains private .
Amazon 's popularity has created a vast database of wishlists .
No index of all wishlists is available , but it remains possible to view all wishlists by people of a particular first name .
A recent search for people named Mark returned 124,887 publicly viewable wishlists .
For an all inclusive search by name , you could compile a comprehensive list of first names and nicknames from the baby names databases available on the internet .
Armed with this list , and by recording the search results for each first name , it is possible for you to retrieve the vast majority of public wishlists on Amazon .
For the purposes of this exercise , only a single name was chosen  a common male name that returned over 260,000 wishlists .
I 'm not going to divulge what name was actually used .
Let 's pretend it was " Edgar , " in honor of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover .
Before writing a script to download all the 260,000 " Edgar " wishlists , I confirmed that my actions would not violate Amazon 's Conditions of Use .
I also checked the robots .
txt file which contains a list of directories Amazon requests not be traversed by scripts .
User wishlists are not in this list , nor did the actions to be taken violate the conditions of use .
I started by doing a wishlist search for people named " Edgar " and got back a page linking to the wishlists of the first 25 matches .
The url looked something like this :
http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/search.html/?encoding=UTF8&type=wishlist&field-name=edgar&page=1
Two variables extracted from the above url are of particular note :
field - name=edgar
page=1
Changing " edgar " to " george " , would generate the first page of matches for people named George .
Change ' 1 ' to ' 2 ' and you 'd get matches 26 through 50 instead of 1 through 25 .
Using a simple 6 - line shell script and the popular wget command line tool , I configured two computers on two different DSL connections to begin downloading all 260,000 wishlists in increments of 25,000 .
Each group of 25,000 wishlists took about four hours to download , for a total download time of less than one day .
Each wishlist is located at an address like this :
http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/?encoding=UTF8&type=wishlist&id=1DBHU3OCV72ZW
1DBHU3OCV72ZW is the wishlist owner 's unique Amazon identification number .
I made up the one you see here .
By directing wget only to download pages at urls similar to this one , and by incrementing the search page from 1 to 10,400 , it is possible to download all 260,000 wishlists without user intervention .
Using a pair of 5 - year - old computers , two home DSL connections , 42 hours of computer time , and 5 man hours , I now had documents describing the reading preferences of 260,000 U.S. citizens .
I downloaded all the files to an external 120 GB Firewire drive in UFS format .
The raw data occupied little more than 5 GB .
I initially wanted to move all the files into a single directory to facilitate searching , but as the directory contents exceeded 100,000 items , the speed became glacially slow , so I kept the data divided into chunks of 25,000 wishlists .
Next comes the fun part  what books are most dangerous ?
So many to choose from .
Here 's a sample of the list I made .
Feel free to make up your own list if you decide to try some data mining .
Send it to the FBI .
I 'm sure they 'll appreciate your help in fighting terrorism .
Keywords
Michael Moore .
The fringe left .
Rush Limbaugh .
The fringe right .
Ralph Nader .
Greenpeace .
Because frankly , we all know there 's only one sort of person who would want a " Greenpeace : Standing Up for the Earth " 2006 Calendar .
Torah .
Quran & Koran .
Like the Catholic Worker and Greenpeace , the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has also been the subject of FBI investigations .
Bible .
Sure , a lot of books use " Bible " in the title , but I cast a wide net .
What harm are a few false positives ?
My Amazon seller ID is attached to these links .
If I get any interesting statistics on how many copies of On Liberty , etc. , are sold as a result of this article , I 'll post them in a follow - up .
If I get a call from the FBI , I 'll let you know that , too .
To search for specific books , I used ISBN numbers , for the rest , keywords .
All the search terms were saved to terms.
txt , one term per line , for use with grep :
ls - 1 | xargs grep - HiFof / Volumes / UFS/terms.txt > / Volumes/UFS/matches.txt
This command searches all wishlists in the current directory for the terms in terms.
txt , then saves the results to matches .
txt .
Results are stored one per line , in the format :
filename : keyword
Now that I have a list of which keywords appear in which wishlists , I can sort them .
I created a new folder " results " and within it created subfolders for each search term .
The TCL script below creates links ( similar to aliases or shortcuts ) for each matched file , and stores the links within the new subdirectories :
#!/usr/bin/tclsh
set fdgrep [ open " / Volumes/UFS/matches.txt " " r " ]
while {![ eof $ fdgrep ] } {
gets $ fdgrep line
set mylist [ split $ line :]
if {[llength $ mylist ] >
1} {
lappend mylist [ string toupper [ lindex $ mylist 1 ] ]
if {![ file exists " / Volumes / UFS / results / [ lindex $ mylist 2 ] / [ lindex $ mylist 0 ] " ] } {
exec ln / Volumes / UFS / wishlists /[ lindex $ mylist 0 ] " / Volumes / UFS / results / [ lindex $ mylist 2 ] / [ lindex $ mylist 0 ] "
}
}
}
Now , for example , the folder called " Greenpeace " contains every wishlist with that term .
Another folder named " Rush Limbaugh " contains the wishlists of all the those interested in reading Rush .
On an aside , if you want to delete all the files beginning with the word " search " in a 25,000 - file directory , the correct line is : find .
- name ' search * ' - print0 | xargs - 0 rm
This line deletes all the files : find .
- print0 - name ' search * ' | xargs - 0 rm Good thing I had backups .
There 's also a bug , in grep 2.5.1 that corrupts output when grep is run with both the - i and -o flags .
Version 2.5.1 - 1 , available through the Fink project , fixes this problem .
One curiousity revealed by this project is that there are quite a few people who show up for multiple books .
Reading On Liberty and Build Your Own Laser , Phaser , Ion Ray Gun and Other Working Space Age Projects ?
We really should have a special list for you .
Here are the books , along with the numbers of people interested in reading each :
The first match for " Bible , " ironically , was a wishlist containing The Cannabis Grow Bible : The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use .
Right person .
Wrong list .
Another match was for The Linux Bible : GNU Testament .
With Nader , I foolishly searched for last name alone .
Thus , there are quite a few hits for The Lemonader along with the correct results .
If some results look suspiciously low , it 's probably because in many cases I searched for a specific ISBN while the book is available in multiple formats .
Only the first page of each user 's wishlist was downloaded .
Books are always added to the front of the wishlist which pushes older titles off the first page , so there is also a slight bias in favor of newer books .
It is possible for users to associate a shipping address with their wishlists , so that others can order them gifts .
Though the full address is hidden , city and state remain visible .
I already have first and last name .
With this information , I can do a Yahoo People Search to obtain an exact street address and phone number .
Viewing the wishlists that contained Apple I Replica Creation , I found that all four provided the user 's city and state .
Of these four , one was a common name that produced multiple hits in his town , two were unlisted ( although one of them was in the Intelius database which I opted not to pay for ) , and the final individual was present on Yahoo People .
So I sent him a signed copy and thanked him for his interest .
Thanks to Google Maps ( and many similar services ) a street address is all we need to get a satellite image of a person 's home .
Tempted as I was to provide satellite images of the homes of the search subjects , it just seemed a bit extreme even for this article .
Instead , I opted only to pinpoint the centers of the towns in which they live .
So at least you 'll know that there 's somebody in your community reading Critical Thinking or some other dangerous text .
City and state were extracted using a regular expression to create a file for each book containing the locations of its readers .
Locations were stored one per line , in this format :
Sunnyvale:CA
Salt Lake City : Utah
Reston : Virginia
South Hadley : MA
Nevada City :CA
Walnut Creek:CA
Eagle Nest:NM
Memphis:TN
North Hollywood :CA
Seattle : WA
…
Using the free Ontok Geocoder service , I was able to quickly convert city and state to latitude and longitude coordinates .
Ontok uses the public domain TIGER / Line data available from the U.S. Census Bureau to perform its conversion .
It took less than an hour to convert all locations from city and state to longitude and latitude :
-122.035011 , 37.369011
- 111.903656 , 40.696415
-77.341591 , 38.968300
- 72.574860 , 42.259102
- 121.013496 , 39.262192
-122.063980 , 37.906521
- 105.263031 , 36.555302
- 90.045448 , 35.148762
- 118.377838 , 34.173100
-122.329430 , 47.605701
…
Google has released their Maps API , so a map of these locations can be embedded in this article .
The API is simple .
Plotting each point requires only three lines of code :
var point = new GPoint ( - 122.035011 , 37.369011 ) ;
var marker = new GMarker ( point ) ;
map.addOverlay( marker ) ;
This plots all of the locations on a satellite image of the United States that can be zoomed in to house level .
Here are a few interactive samples :
Readers of 1984 .
Readers of the Torah .
Temporarily removed due to high volume .
Temporarily removed due to high volume .
You .
The map pinpointing you ( your local ISP , actually ) requires a good bit of on - the - fly processing , so if the server is exceptionally busy it may not load correctly .
In the future , I may make more sophisticated maps using additional data .
Maybe a map that includes all the books in the 260,000 wishlists ?
Simply searching for any book would present a map of the United States showing the locations of all the people interested in reading it .
All the tools used in this project are standard and free .
The services , likewise , are all free .
The technical skills required to implement this project are well within the abilities of anybody who has done any programming .
The network connection used to download these files was a standard home DSL connection .
The computer that processed the data was a 1.5 GHz PowerBook G4 .
The operating system is Mac OS X 10.4 , though everything could have been done just as easily with Linux ( and probably with Windows ) .
Not a penny was spent in the writing of this article , just 30 hours of time .
This is what 's possible with publicly available information , but imagine if one had access to Amazon 's entire database - which still contains every sale dating back to 1999 by the way .
Under Section 251 of the Patriot Act , the FBI can require Amazon to turn over its records , without probable cause , for an " authorized investigation . . . to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities . "
Amazon is forbidden to disclose that they have turned over any records , so that you would never know that the government is keeping records of your book purchases .
And obviously it is quite simple to crossreference this info with data available in other databases .
On a final note , the FBI is now hiring computer scientists to implement a project that sounds very similar to what I just did :
" Currently , the FBI is strengthening systems engineering in order to tie new systems together architecturally and ensure that standards for custom and packaged applications are enforced , and it needs engineers to accomplish this goal , the agency said .
" The FBI is also focusing on data warehousing as well as federated search technology , which allows a single search query to be deployed across a number of databases , regardless of whether those databases belong to the same protocol or platform .
" ' Warehousing has been very successful , yet enterprise extraction , translation and loading processes must be fine - tuned , ” the FBI said .
“ Data engineers are needed to model legacy databases for federated search and participate in legacy transition planning . ' " ( Computerworld )

IT PAYS to be sceptical about the significance of opinion polls .
Depending on what questions the pollsters ask , and how , the most ridiculous or startling results may be generated .
But some polls throw up genuinely disturbing information .
According to one conducted for the BBC and released on Thursday October 19th , nearly a third of respondents ( some 27,000 people were questioned in 25 countries ) consider the use of torture acceptable under certain circumstances .
Another published last November by the Pew Research Centre found that nearly half of all Americans think torturing terrorist suspects could , at times , be justified .
Those results tallied with other Pew polls of the past few years .
Divining the significance of such data is not easy .
The various pollsters , for example , apparently left it to respondents to define what they meant by torture .
But the results are morbidly fascinating and give clues as to why some people are more willing to contemplate torture than others .
Although a clear majority , worldwide , opposes even the occasional use of torture , there are significant groups willing to say they favour it .
Those with an especial fear of terrorism seem most inclined to support its use .
Thus 53 % of Israeli Jews , according to the BBC poll , would allow terrorist suspects to be tortured for the sake of trying to get information that could save innocent lives .
( Only 16 % of Israeli Muslims would agree . )
Large minorities in the Philippines , Indonesia , Kenya and Russia — where terror attacks have also repeatedly claimed lives — would also tolerate its use .
But fear of terrorists is not the only factor .
General attitudes to human rights count , too .
Thus in many places where the death penalty is outlawed , as in the European Union , few would consider the use of torture even in extreme circumstances .
In Britain and Spain , each the site of a large terrorist attack in the past couple of years , only a small proportion would contemplate it .
In contrast in terrorism - free China , where authorities use the death penalty with enthusiasm , more than a third of those questioned say torture might also be ok .
Ignorance apparently matters too .
Last year 's
Pew survey showed that the general public in America is far more enthusiastic about the occasional use of torture than are security experts , academics or military leaders .
It is tempting to conclude that experts who may have a better idea whether torture is likely to prove useful are less inclined to support its use .
But evidently some do believe that it , or something close to it , could be useful for states fighting terrorists .
Israeli security officials say they have prevented terrorist attacks with information gleaned from “ coercive interrogation ” of suspects .
On October 17th George Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act which ( though he denies it would sanction torture ) allows CIA investigators to use tough , physical , interrogation methods against terrorist suspects .
According to Amnesty International , the torture and ill - treatment of prisoners continue to be recorded in many countries .
Those who think it could be useful may not , therefore , be swayed by moral or legal arguments .
All big human - rights agreements concluded since the end of the second world war contain absolute bans on torture , with no exceptions .
No domestic system officially allows it .
Nor can anyone be sure they are only torturing the guilty .
Argentina 's junta , for example , justified the use of torture against leftist groups that led to the execution of thousands of innocent people between 1976 and 1983 .
A more telling argument , instead , may be that torture is often counterproductive .
A desperate prisoner may say anything to bring his pain to an end , leaving interrogators with useless or distracting information .
In addition , governments using torture are likely to provoke popular resentment and more embittered opponents .
France 's brutal methods against those fighting for independence in Algeria ended up dividing French domestic opinion and strengthening its enemies .
Routine abuse of Palestinian prisoners by Israel 's security service , Shin Bet , did nothing to dissuade Palestinian fighters and suicide bombers .
Even America 's closest allies say they are appalled by treatment of terrorist suspects that amounts , too often , to something near to torture .
In too many cases , it seems , terrorist suspects are subjected to cruel treatment not for the sake of obtaining information , but for the purposes of punishment or humiliation .
The Americans said the dam had to be taken to prevent Saddam Hussein from destroying it as part of a scorched - earth policy , though there is no indication that Mr. Hussein ever had such a plan .
It was a firefight at the dam , in fact , that initially put it at risk .
After discovering that the poorly maintained dam was damaged in the fighting , a sergeant in an Army civil affairs unit flew to the site and worked with the Iraqi engineers to keep the dam functioning .
During a multimillion - dollar repair project by the Army Corps of Engineers , the dam ’s turbines were rehabilitated .
In addition to generating electricity , the dam also serves as a headquarters for the Marine battalion that is charged with securing the Haditha area and is home to a small contingent of troops from Azerbaijan who are helping the marines guard the structure .
For the Purrfect Angelz , it was a stop on a tour that also took them to bases like Al Qaim and Taji .
The dancers , former cheerleaders , calendar models and aspiring actresses , have an active schedule in the United States , much of which consists of events for motorcycle riders .
By design , the routines at Haditha are a bit tamer than the biker fare .

“ We want to make it more about talent than being risqué , ” Tanea Brooks said .
“ We are not going to boost every part of the morale . ”
Her credits include a three - year stint as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader , a role in a country music video , “ Honky Tonk Badonkadonk ” by Trace Adkins , and a turn as quarterback for the New York Euphoria , one of the teams that established the Lingerie Football League , in which models played football dressed in underwear .

Next Prius to offer 94 mpg ?
The next Toyota Prius will offer an astonishing 113 mpg , according to a report in the U.K. 's AutoExpress magazine .
( Note : 113 mpg in the U.K. is equal to 94 mpg here in North America ) .
" The whole electrical system has been redesigned to improve economy " said a Toyota engineer was quoted as saying .
" We are working on a prototype that runs solely on the electric motor in slow traffic , but switches to engine and motor drive when higher speeds are needed . "
The 0 - 62 mph time will also be improved by more than a second , according to the report , bringing it to well under 10 seconds .
Much of the improvement can be attributed to the use of lithium - ion batteries instead of nickel - hydride units .
The lithium - ion batteries are smaller , lighter , and have greater electrical output .
Economics Of Abundance Getting Some Well Deserved Attention
from the about - time dept
If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property , it is the action of the thinking power called an idea , which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself ; but the moment it is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of every one , and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it .
Its peculiar character , too , is that no one possesses the less , because every other possesses the whole of it .
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me .
That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe , for the moral and mutual instruction of man , and improvement of his condition , seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature , when she made them , like fire , expansible over all space , without lessening their density in any point , and like the air in which we breathe , move , and have our physical being , incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation .
Inventions then cannot , in nature , be a subject of property .

It 's great to see Chris Anderson getting lots of attention for his recent talk on " the economics of abundance , " because it 's exactly the type of thing that a lot of people have been discussing for a while -- but still has n't permeated the mainstream .
In fact , it 's quite similar to the talk I gave at the Cato Institute back in April in discussing why certain people seemed to have so much trouble grasping the economics of the digital age .
Basically , it 's the problem that occurs when people focus too hard on the idea that economics is the study of resource allocation in the presence of scarcity .
That only makes sense when there 's scarcity -- and in digital goods , scarcity does n't exist .
Dave Hornik has a wonderful post about Anderson 's talk while Ross Mayfield is also discussing how he 's come to realize that the economics of scarcity does n't apply digitally .
Now , if we stuck with the focus on " scarcity , " then I should be upset that these two are basically repeating the " idea " I discussed back in April .
Those who keep harping on the importance of " property " and love to say that you can " steal " content might even say that this idea was " stolen . "
That , obviously , is ridiculous .
These are basic ideas that we have all realized is fundamental and a truth of economics .
And , it 's hardly a new idea ( which is why my one quibble with Anderson 's own post is his decision to call the idea of the economics of abundance a " radical attack " ) .
Mayfield talks about those who helped him realize it , from Jerry Michalski to Howard Rheingold .
In the comments to that post , Julian Bond brings up the ideas of Buckminster Fuller and and Alan Cooper .
In my case , the inspiration came from many different people , including the teachings of Alan McAdams ( my old mentor and professor ) and the writings of Brian Arthur ( who focused on " increasing marginal returns " rather than diminishing ones ) and even back to Thomas Jefferson , who famously said :
So , no , it 's not a new idea at all -- and yet , many people still do n't seem to want to understand it .
They do n't believe that the free market can function with a lack of scarcity .
It 's understandable why that could make some uncomfortable -- but , it 's a fundamental misunderstanding based on this desire to force scarcity where there is none , just so economics can continue to be the study of scarcity .
It 's this inability to get rid of that scarcity thinking that 's holding back a number of developments these days , and the more people who realize this and the more people talking about this , the better .
And it is fitting with the theory of abundance .
The more abundant this discussion is , the more likely people will grasp it .
And , it 's especially exciting that someone like Chris Anderson is pitching it , because of his ability to take complex economic ideas and make them easy to understand , while getting people to listen .
Hopefully , this is just the beginning of a widespread discussion about this topic .

Mini FAQ
Q : What is Metamath ?
Q : How can I ask questions or discuss Metamath - related topics ?
A : The Metamath Google Group [ retrieved 22 - Sep - 2020 ] mailing list is being used for discussion about Metamath .
If you have questions , that is a good place to ask them .
( The AsteroidMeta [ retrieved 22 - Sep - 2020 ] wiki was used for many older Metamath discussions , but is no longer available .
Archived discussions such as this one can be found on archive.org . )
Q : Where do I start ?
A : Read Sections 1 , 2 , and 3 of the Metamath Proof Explorer .
Then look at a few proofs in Section 4 to make sure you understand how they work .
Knowledge of mathematics can be helpful , although it is n't strictly necessary to be able to mechanically follow the proofs on this site .
If you want to start acquiring a higher - level understanding , a nice independent introduction to logic is Hirst and Hirst 's A Primer for Logic and Proof [ retrieved 27 - Sep - 2017 ] ( PDF , 0.5 MB ) ; compare its axioms to ours .
Wikipedia has an overview of set theory [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] .
The video series " Introduction to Higher Mathematics " by Bill Shillito [ retrieved 27 - Sep - 2017 ] may also be helpful .
You can experiment with simple proofs in the Metamath Solitaire applet .
To actually create real metamath proofs , you 'll want to download a tool .
A common tool is mmj2 .
David A . Wheeler produced an introductory video , " Introduction to Metamath & mmj2 " [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] .
Q : Will Metamath help me learn abstract mathematics ?
A : Yes , but probably not by itself .
In order to follow a proof in an advanced math textbook , you may need to know prerequisites that could take years to learn .
Some people find this frustrating .
In contrast , Metamath uses a single , simple substitution rule that allows you to follow any proof mechanically .
You can actually jump in anywhere and be convinced that the symbol string you see in a proof step is a consequence of the symbol strings in the earlier steps that it references , even if you do n't understand what the symbols mean .
But this is quite different from understanding the meaning of the math that results .
Metamath alone probably will not give you an intuitive feel for abstract math , in the same way it can be hard to grasp a large computer program just by reading its source code , even though you may understand each individual instruction .
However , the Bibliographic Cross - Reference lets you compare informal proofs in math textbooks and see all the implicit missing details " left to the reader . "
Q : Who is the intended audience for Metamath ?
A : Metamath is not for everyone , of course .
A person with no interest in math may find it boring or , optimistically , might find a spark of inspiration .
Professional mathematicians may view it as a curiosity more than a tool - they need to do things at a high level to work efficiently .
On the other hand , Metamath can appeal to those who enjoy picking things apart to see how they work .
Others may like the absolute rigor that Metamath offers .
Someone new to logic and set theory , who is still developing the mathematical maturity needed to follow informal textbook proofs , may find some reassurance in Metamath 's step - by - step breakdown .
And anyone who appreciates the austere elegance of formal mathematics for its own sake might enjoy just casually browsing through the proofs for their aesthetic appeal .
Q : I already have an abstract mathematics background .
How can I grasp the key ideas in a Metamath proof more quickly ?
A : On the web page with the proof , look at the little colored numbers in the Ref column .
The steps with the largest numbers are usually the ones you want to look at first .
The steps with smaller numbers are typically logic " glue " to tie them together .
The colors follow roughly the rainbow colors as the statement number increases , so that the largest numbers tend to stand out from the others .
With a little practice , this feature , together with the gray indentation levels showing the tree structure , should help you figure out the " important " steps so that you could write down an informal version of the proof if you wanted to .
( By the way , it 's best not to use the colored numbers to reference theorems in an archived discussion , since they change when new theorems are inserted at an earlier point in the database . )
Q : What does the Metamath language look like ?
A : The precise technical specification of the language is given in Section 4.1 ( p. 112 ) of the Metamath book and is about 4 pages long .
A simple example is given in Section 2.2.2 ( p. 40 ) .
Compare this source screenshot with the generated web page .
But you do n't have to know or even look at the language if you just want to follow the proofs on these web pages .
The metamath program and mmj2 are the main tools for working with the Metamath language .
As an indication of the language 's simplicity , Raph Levien independently wrote the remarkably small mmverify proof verifier in Python .
He writes , " I find the whole thing a bit magical .
Those 300 lines of code , plus a couple dozen axioms , effectively give you the building blocks for all of mathematics . "
Bob Solovay wrote a nicely commented presentation of Peano arithmetic in the Metamath language , peano . mm , that is worth reading as a stand - alone file .
Q : What other programs have been written for the Metamath language ?
A : Over a dozen proof verifiers for the Metamath language have been written and are listed at Known Metamath proof verifiers .
Also , several proof languages have been based on Metamath , and the software and other documentation for these can be found under Metamath - related programs .
Q : How confident can I be in the proofs ?
A : You can be extremely confident that the proofs follow from their axioms .
All reasoning is done directly in the proof itself rather than by algorithms embedded in the verification program .
Computer verification programs never get tired and rigorously check every step .
There is the risk that a verifier has a programming bug , but this is countered by the Metamath language 's small size ( this simplicity reduces the likelihood of such bugs ) and by using multiple independently - implemented verifiers ( since it is unlikely that all verifiers will have the same kind of bug ) .
For example , the Metamath Proof Explorer is routinely checked by 4 independent verifiers : metamath ( a C verifier by Norm Megill ) , mmj2 ( a Java verifier by Mel O'Cat and Mario Carneiro ) , smetamath - rs ( a high - speed Rust verifier by Stefan O'Rear ) , and checkmm ( a C++ verifier by Eric Schmidt ) .
In addition , the databases are public and can easily be inspected ; the hypertext links in generated proofs make it especially easy to move from one theorem to the next .
Metamath enables an extremely rigorous form of peer review .
Q : Why is it called " Metamath " ?
A : It means " metavariable math . "
See A Note on the Axioms .
Metamath should n't be confused with metamathematics ( occasionally abbreviated metamath , metamaths , or meta math ) , which is a specialized branch of mathematics that studies mathematics itself , leading to results such as Gödel 's incompleteness theorem .
An expert in the latter is called a metamathematician , so to avoid confusion one might use " metamathician " for someone knowledgeable about Metamath .
Q : Are there other sites that formalize math from its foundations ?
A : Another project that aims to rigorously formalize and verify math is Mizar [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] .
It is intended to appeal to professional mathematicians and requires a certain mathematical maturity to be able to follow its proofs .
It tries to mimic mathematical proofs they way they are normally published , whereas Metamath shows you every little detail .
Some other well - known interactive theorem provers are HOL Light [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] , Isabelle [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] , and Coq [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] .
There are a few languages based on or derived from Metamath , e.g. , Raph Levien has developed a related language called Ghilbert [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] that strives to improve upon Metamath by guaranteeing the soundness of definitions and providing features useful for collaborative work .
Freek Wiedijk wrote an interesting collection of notes [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] comparing several mathematical proof languages .
His book , The Seventeen Provers of the World [ retrieved 4 - Aug - 2016 ] ( PDF , 0.6MB ) , compares the proofs that the square root of 2 is irrational in 17 proof languages , including Metamath ( theorem sqrt2irr ) .
The Metamath 100 page shows metamath 's progress in Formalizing 100 Theorems ( a challenge set of theorems for math formalization systems ) .
Unlike most other systems , Metamath attempts to use the minimum possible framework needed to express mathematics and its proofs .
Other systems do not consider that aspect necessarily important , and their underlying computer programs can be large and complex in order to perform mathematical reasoning at a higher level .
Metamath 's proofs are often quite long compared to those of other systems , but they are completely transparent with nothing hidden from the user .
All reasoning is done directly in the proof itself rather than by algorithms embedded in the verification program .
Metamath is unique in this sense , offering an alternative approach for those attracted to its philosophy of simplicity .
Q : How can I contribute to Metamath ?
A : We 'd be delighted to get your contributions !
The Metamath community has a large set of inter-related projects , so you first need to determine which specific project you want to contribute to .
Here are some common cases :
If you 're contributing to " set.mm " ( the set of proofs which starts from ZFC set theory axioms and shown in the " Metamath Proof Explorer " ) , the recommended approach is to use its GitHub repository at https://github.com/metamath/set.mm

How does the United States count the cost of at least 11 million immigrants living and often working outside the law ?
For business groups - now urging a path to citizenship or other legal status for such workers - it 's the lower cost of a head of lettuce , new home construction , or a restaurant tab , because these people will do the work that Americans wo n't .
For local officials across the country - no longer just those near a border - it 's the strain illegals pose to schools , hospital emergency rooms , law enforcement , and other social services , driving municipal budgets deep into the red .
For illegal immigrants and their supporters - rallying by the hundreds of thousands around the country in the run-up to this debate - the issue is freedom from fear .
But one of the most pervasive costs of a broken immigration system , acknowledged by all sides , is the cost of deception .
" Today 's immigration policy is almost founded on lies , " says Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies .
" It presupposes lying by almost everyone involved . "
Bringing honesty to the system without deporting millions and jeopardizing major sectors of the US economy is the tough task before the Senate Judiciary Committee , as its 18 members struggle toward consensus on a new strategy for immigration reform .
Senate majority leader Bill Frist has set Tuesday to begin debate on the topic .
That means the Judiciary panel has one last day - Monday - to work out a comprehensive plan , including a new guest worker program and a path to citizenship for those already working illegally .
If it fails , Senator Frist will introduce his own plan Tuesday , which , like the House bill , aims only to gain control of US borders .
Pro-immigration demonstrators , meanwhile , are expected to rally at the Capitol Tuesday , following a 500,000 - strong rally for illegal - immigrant rights in Los Angeles , and other protests in Denver , Phoenix , Milwaukee , Chicago , Philadelphia , and Tucson , Ariz .
Organizers say they 'll march in 30 more cities before the Senate vote next month .
Last year , the immigration debate on Capitol Hill was overshadowed by the Minutemen - an armed civilian posse out to stop illegal border crossings .
But the prospect of congressional crackdown on illegal immigrants , including the enforcement of penalties against employers who hire them , is drawing record numbers of immigrants into the streets , with a powerful coalition of business , church , and union groups behind them .
Their message :
These are good people who work hard , pay taxes , and should not be treated as felons .
" Polls show that people do recognize the value of immigration , including illegal , " says Peter Schuck , a professor at Yale Law School in New Haven , Conn .
" On the other hand , it is a violation of law , and people have just found strategies to live with it . "
For employers who hire illegals , that means not looking too closely at documents .
Only three employers were fined for hiring illegals in 2004 , down from 417 in 1999 , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office in August 2005 .
" It 's a dysfunctional system that breeds disrespect for the law , " says John Gay , senior vice president of government affairs and public policy at the National Restaurant Association and a co-chair for the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition .
" Many employers see this as a game :
If they ask people to provide proper documents , they leave . "
Restaurants that knowingly violate the law , he adds , gain an unfair advantage .
Not only is there a disincentive because there is no enforcement of the law , but if employers examine someone 's documents too closely , they can be pursued by the Justice Department for employment related discrimination .
" We are digging ourselves into a hole by turning a blind eye to illegality , " says Jared Bernstein , director of the Living Standards Program at the Economic Policy Institute .
" All kinds of unintentional consequences surface when you do that , including paving the wayfor armed vigilantees on the border . "
One of the most toxic issues in the debate is whether the flood of immigrants , especially the 500,000 undocumented workers who enter the country each year , are driving down prospects for low - skilled Americans .
A new report by the Center for Immigration Studies finds that states with the largest increase in immigrants also saw larger declines in natives working .
" This is n't just some parlor game for economists : Low - skill native workers are hurt by flooding the market with immigrants , " says Mr. Krikorian .
Another point of deception in the system is the limited enforcement the nation 's immigration laws .
" We do n't allow state police making traffic stops to ask about a driver 's legal status , " says Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R ) of Alabama , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" What does that tell you about how serious we are about enforcing our immigration laws ? "
Last week , business owners in Costa Mesa , Calif. , called on the City Council to suspend a new policy that allows police to enforce federal immigration laws , which they say are hurting business .
Nearly every state has proposals pending to address illegal immigration .
" This is a justice issue :
You can't have 11 million people being vulnerable and exploited , " said Joshua Hoyt , executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights , in a conference call after Chicago demonstrations last week .
" There is a politicization of this issue in the immigrant community in a way that has not happened in the past , " he added .
Summary :
The relative popularity of a site 's pages , the number of visitors referred by other sites , and the traffic from search queries continue to follow a Zipf distribution .
About 10 years ago , I showed that the popularity of a website 's pages followed a power law .
Briefly stated , a few pages on a website were extremely popular , a larger set was moderately popular , and the vast majority constituted the " long tail " of low - traffic pages .
Mathematically , the Zipf curve is a straight line on a double - logarithmic diagram , when we plot pages with their popularity rank on the x - axis and their number of hits on the y - axis .
The old analyses showed that this same distribution also described both the number of incoming references to a website from other sites and the outgoing traffic from a company 's employees .
Do these findings continue to hold today ?
The Web is now 2,200 times bigger , so traffic patterns might have changed .
I decided to find out .
Page Popularity
The following chart shows useit.com traffic during a recent eight - week period .
Each dot represents one page , and the pages are sorted by popularity .
The most popular page ( the homepage ) got 261,024 pageviews .
For the most popular 350 pages , the empirical data follows the theory remarkably well .
Thereafter , however , the data trails off and the next 700 pages have less traffic than predicted .
Also , in theory , there should have been about a quarter - million additional pages with low traffic , but I simply have n't gotten around to writing that much .
The small insert in the upper right shows the equivalent diagram from my analysis 10 years ago .
It 's uncanny how closely it resembles the new data .
In particular , the old curve also trailed off toward the end and was missing a vast number of low - traffic pages .
The end of the " long tail " is absent from both diagrams because the sites have n't accumulated enough old content to have the expected number of low - traffic pages .
Instead , they have a drooping tail .
It might take hundreds of years for a site written by a single person ( or even a single marketing department ) to accumulate a quarter - million pages .
Incoming Traffic from Other Sites
The next diagram shows the number of visitors referred to useit.com through links from other websites during the eight - week period .
Each dot represents one external site .
In this case , the empirical data hugs the theory 's red line all the way down to the x-axis .
The difference here is that there 's no lack of other sites that might link to useit.com , and a huge number of these sites are low - traffic blogs that only occasionally refer individual users .
The chart 's one obvious exception to the theory is that the site that referred the most visitors accounted for many more visits than predicted .
Google ( depicted as an extra- large dot ) referred 257,040 visitors ; in theory , it should have referred only 52,479 .
Google is five times as popular as the theory predicts , but this phenomenon could fade as other search engines catch up .
Only time will tell .
Also , while Google is disproportionally important , when taken together , the other 35,631 referring sites accounted for 35 % more traffic .
Clearly , it 's not a good idea to focus only on # 1 .
Search Engine Queries
To find useit.com , users employed a total of 110,399 different queries across various search engines .
Of these queries , 83 % were used only once during the eight - week period .
The top 10 queries accounted for 10 % of the total traffic , so each one of these queries is obviously more important than those that brought only one visitor .
Taken together , however , the single - use queries accounted for three times as much traffic as the top 10 queries .
This statistic shows the folly of focusing search engine optimization solely on a few high - performing queries .
Your site must be found when users enter relevant queries -- and the possibilities are typically vast .
The following diagram shows the distribution of search engine queries , sorted by the number of incoming users who arrived after searching for that string .
This chart shows roughly the expected distribution , but with a hump for queries # 5300 .
In other words , queries in the middle range are more important than the theory predicts .
Sample queries in this range include response time , open link in new window , teenagers , site maps , eye tracking , and link color .
Useit.com is not particularly focused on any of these topics , which is why they 're not at the top of the list .
For each query , however , I have at least one good related article .
In general , my site covers a broad range of topics in some depth , which is probably why it has this hump of mid-range queries with extra traffic .
As we proceed down the list of query popularity , the queries become longer and longer .
The following diagram shows the number of query words for each of the first nineteen groups of a thousand queries .
( That is , queries # 1-1,000 are first , followed by queries # 1,001 - 2,000 , and so on through queries # 18,001 - 19,000 . )
Single - word queries were fairly common among the first thousand queries ( i.e. , those that generated the most traffic ) , but drop off quite quickly .
Conversely , four - and five - word queries are rare among the most popular queries , but are a big proportion of queries starting at about # 7,000 .
This shows the importance of considering longer queries in your search engine marketing : Multiple - word queries are the best way to capture the vast range of user interests .
In this case , long queries in the # 7,000 traffic range included radio buttons and check boxes ( five words ) and horizontal scrollbar in html ( four words ) .
In 10 Years , Almost No Change
In comparing the new data with data from 10 years ago , the biggest finding is that the curves look almost the same .
Several measures of Web traffic followed a Zipf curve in 1996 , and they still do .
The two exceptions are both search related :
A single search engine is disproportionally popular .
Is this a temporary fluke or a fundamental change in the Internet 's fabric ?
Check back in 10 years !
Users today enter more long queries .
( I discuss this trend in more detail in my course on Fundamental Guidelines for Web Usability . )
Mainly , though , the big patterns of Web use remain remarkably robust .
This is explained by the same phenomenon that dictates the long - term durability of usability guidelines .
In both cases , conclusions are independent of changes in technology or fashion .
Rather , they are due to the fundamental nature of human behavior .
Knowing that a single distribution describes these many forms of Web use can help you analyze your own log files : plot your statistics on a log - log scale and see if they fall on a straight line .
If yes , your site follows the theory .
If no , see where you deviate :
In the head , the middle , or the tail ?
Above or below the prediction line ?
Any deviations help you understand ways in which your traffic is different than the norm .
These insights may also help you spot opportunities for growth .

Act , Structure - Bitch Break So Miss Dara tells met that a traditional screenplay has 3 acts .
The first act sets up the conflict ; the second , intensifies the conflict and the third , resolves ( gulp ! ) the conflict .
We begin with an “ inciting incident ” .
In our case that would be the absolute boredom our heroine feels for life : she fucking hates it .
She ’s putting one beautiful foot in front of the other .
She ’s Cinderella .
She has n’t my bunions .
She has n’t my skinny , long toed feet .
She has beautiful , unbony feet .
The kind of feet you might want to suck if you were that kind of person .
She sighs .
The man .
Hm. Hi .
Yah , it ’s been a few days – I was n’t scattered however , just busy .
I ’ve got to bring home my bacon and that will probably come from things other than this story , as much as I enjoy writing it .
" A Great Story Tells Us " ...
Ok , working from the screenwriter ’s workshop I was at a few weeks ago , I ’m examining my story .
1 . “ A great story tells us :
a . How a person succeeds or fails ( character )
b. To grow and change ( arc )
c. Within the context of the conflict that is unfolding ( plot )
d . From the writer ’s point of view ( theme ) ” ( 1 )
How a person succeeds or fails :
My writer is going to fail to write a novel .
She is going to sketch everything out , but at the end , fail to bring it all together .
Bam !
Blast – like Chernobyl .
She is going to fail because she lacks confidence .
Because her depression , loneliness , feelings of loss and confusion overtake her .
She is scattered .
She can not finish things .
The man is going to fail as well .
The alien – she will fail because she “ is ” the writer .
The Missing Plot Plot – that is something I have to work on .
It ’s essential to a story yet I do n’t have one .
What will be the plot ?
I guess there is the plot of the author writing the story .
She could complete the story or not .
Or something could happen to her – like Chernobyl – that prevents her from completing the story .
Of course , she could literally get drawn into the story , or the story ’s characters could get drawn into her life .
Or something else entirely .
Fiction – yah , it ’s pretty great that way .
What about the man , the toad and the alien ?
Should I nuke em ?
Do I want to write about the man with all the sores on his body ?
Or the lonely alien ?
Or the toad ?
What about the mushrooms I said I wanted to write about ?
Do I have to choose my plot now or can I just start writing and see where I go , later , once I ’m done my research ?
I guess some sort of plot outline would be good .
I definitely like the author part .
It ’s easy to write and does n’t require much imagination .
This is important to me : I ’m pretty ordinary and thinking up imaginative things is work .
Quotes from People Who Lived Around Chernobyl at Time of Disaster Ok , back to the evacuation .
From reddit.com thread ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/86i8l/picture_tour_of_cherno...):
“ I grew up about 100 mi from there .
I remember when the evening news announced there was a " minor " incident and showed a very brief image of smoke rising in the distance .
It did n't seem like anything serious ... at least my father was n't worried .
Fuckers covered it up .
And only started admitting what really happened when radiation was reaching Western Europe .
Then they offered free apartments and other perks for those who wanted to go and clear up the mess .
Many who took the offer did n't need apartments when they got back -- they headed straight to the hospital and then to the cemetery .
I heard stories of people being cooked alive , their meat was falling off they bones , yuk !
I also remember my mom's plants on the balcony died that summer .
I do n't know how much dosage we all absorbed .
Getting to Know
Theme , cont .
I guess my purpose is to shine a compassionate light on depression , loneliness , feelings of loss and confusion .
My purpose is to state that these states of being will always be with us .
In the case of Chernobyl , is there any doubt that lost men and confusion caused the accident ?
I do n’t know if they were depressed and lonely , but surely the accident caused depression and alienation among many , many people who ’s lives were destroyed by the whims of a government and officials they had little control over .
Does anyone deny them the right to be sad , and alienated ?
Lost ?
Confused , if they had been trusting in the basic goodness of other people , as many people around me seem to be ?
Why should I not be allowed to be depressed and / or alienated ?
Why should I be expected to bring lightness and frivolity to meetings and socials ?
Because I ’m fair skinned , blue - eyed and blond ?
Because I ’m tall and thin ?
Because you think that because I meet the beauty ideal for women , I must have it all ?
Because I meet that beauty ideal , I must be ( imprisoned by ) it ?
Getting to Know
Theme I should probably write two entries this morning : one for last night and one for tonight .
Tonight , I ’ll be at a sleep over with the performing arts troupe I joined .
I ’d tell you more about the troupe , but this novel is about me .
Theme – Er , I added about ½ page to yesterday ’s work that I ’ll include in today ’s word count .
I ’m feeling a bit sick , by the way .
Sure hope I do n’t have H1N1 .
Hello to you ,
Theme !
I need to do an entry and three - quarters this eve , it seems .
Yesterday , I went to a writing workshop .
It was for screenplay writing but since I ’m about to start a documentary , and have been working on another video project , it seemed a good idea .
Also , I need to practice my social skills cause my work is extremely non-social , making it hard to interact with clients and potential clients .
Dara , the woman leading the workshop , told us that we need to know what our theme is .
We have to know what our theme , plot and characters are ; ie .
we need to describe them with intention .
She gave us tools ; ie .
questions to answer and story arcs and timelines to follow , to help us describe our characters and tell our story with intention .
She said that the raw draft is always kind of a mess – that its purpose is to just get the basic elements down and that after that , we analyze what we are trying to say and recreate the characters , plot and story arcs to best say it .
So let me pull up my weird little outline again ( I ’ll use the updated one ) : The Evacuation People were not evacuated from Pripyat , Chernobyl and the surrounding areas until 36 hours after the explosion .
Other areas took weeks , months and even years before they were evacuated .
The explosion occurred on Apr. 26 , 1986 , at 1:23 am. 400 times more fallout was released than at Hiroshima .
336,000 people were resettled .
The accident was largely the result of testing an emergency cooling system .
To be continued ..
Chernobyl , Pripyat and Slavutych Compared Tonight ’s task : Chernobyl , Pripyat , Slavutych and area before the accident , during and afterwards .
Chernobyl is a town , about 800 years old , about 14.5 km from the Chernobyl Disaster plant .
The city of Pripyat was built along with the power plant , starting in 1970 , to house the plant workers .
Slavutych was built post disaster to house the evacuated people of Pripyat .
Pripyat , on the bank of a river of the same name , Pripyat , is closer to the Chernobyl plant than Chernobyl , while Slavutych , on the Dnieper River , is 45 km east of Chernobyl .
Chernobyl , at the time of the blast had 14,000 inhabitants ; Pripyat , 50,000 .
Slavutych , as of 2005 , had 25,000 inhabitants .
Chernobyl is in the Zone of Exclusion .
Of the 400 people who refused to leave / went back to their homes , about ½ of them are from and / or in Chernobyl now .
They mark their houses with signs stating “ Owner of this house lives here . ”
Outline Review and More Research Today , I ’ve updated “ Too Broad Outline to Specific Outline and Work Plan ” , Nov. 6 09 ’s entry .
I added “ Pripyat , Slavutych and area ” to the “ Describe Chernobyl , item c ” .
It now reads : “ Chernobyl , Pripyat , Slavutych and area before the accident , during and afterwards . ”
Also , I will try to write a page a day , but will be lenient with myself when research takes more time than I planned .
Research is a good thing ; something many people view as time wasting , but facts , ideas and knowledge are healthy food for imagination .
A lot of people view vegetables as basically , a waste of time also .
Stupid people .
I also think I will add a plot outline .
I ’ve got the theme of me , the author , being a lost , lonely , confused and depressed woman , but how is this author going to become part of the story ?
How is she going to interact with the man , the alien and the toad ?
I ’ll finish my research first , though .

OpenSSH cutting edge
Federico Biancuzzi interviews OpenSSH developer Damien Miller to discuss features included in the upcoming version 4.3 , public key crypto protocols details , timing based attacks and anti-worm measures .
Could you introduce yourself ?
Damien Miller : I am one of the developers of OpenSSH and OpenBSD .
I have been working on OpenSSH since starting the project to port it to other platforms ( initially Linux ) back in 1999 , but found myself working more and more on the native OpenBSD version of OpenSSH and on the OpenBSD operating system itself as time went on .
I also maintain a couple of other free software projects , most notably a collection of NetFlow tools ( pfflowd , flowd and softflowd ) .
The upcoming OpenSSH version 4.3 will add support for tunneling .
What type of uses is this feature suited for ?
Damien Miller : Reyk and Markus ' new tunneling support allows you to make a real VPN using OpenSSH without the need for any additional software .
This goes well beyond the TCP port forwarding that we have supported for years - each end of a ssh connection that uses the new tunnel support gets a tun ( 4 ) interface which can pass packets between them .
This is similar to the type of VPN supported by OpenVPN or other SSL - VPN systems , only it runs over SSH .
It is therefore really easy to set up and automatically inherit the ability to use all of the authentication schemes supported by SSH ( password , public key , Kerberos , etc. )
The tunnel interfaces that form the endpoints of the tunnel can be configured as either a layer - 3 or a layer - 2 link .
In layer - 3 mode you can configure the tun ( 4 ) interfaces with IP or IPv6 addresses and route packets over them like any other interface - you could even run a dynamic routing protocol like OSPF over them if you were so inclined .
In layer - 2 mode , you can make them part of a bridge ( 4 ) group to bridge raw ethernet frames between the two ends .
A practical use of this might be securely linking back to your home network while connected to an untrusted wireless net , being able to send and receive ICMP pings and to use UDP based services like DNS .
Like any VPN system that uses a reliable transport like TCP , an OpenSSH 's tunnel can alter packet delivery dynamics ( e.g. a dropped transport packet will stall all tunnelled traffic ) , so it probably is n't so good for things like VOIP over a lossy network ( use IPsec for that ) , but it is still very useful for most other things .
Some companies have included crypto features in their hardware , for example Intel included a PRNG in some chipsets , and VIA bundled a full hardware set of crypto functions in its recent CPUs .
How and when can OpenSSH take advantage of specific types of hardware like these ?
Damien Miller : OpenSSH depends on OpenSSL for cryptographic services and therefore depends on OpenSSL to take advantage of hardware facilities .
On OpenBSD at least , this support is seamless - OpenSSL has hooks to directly use Via Padlock instructions ( which are amazingly fast ) or go via the crypto ( 4 ) device to use co-processors like hifn ( 4 ) or ubsec ( 4 ) .
On other operating systems , OpenSSL needs some application support to tell it to load " engine " modules to provide access to hardware services .
Darren Tucker has posted patches to portable OpenSSH to get it to do this , but we have n't received any test reports back yet .
Why did you increase the default size of new RSA / DSA keys generated by ssh - keygen from 1024 to 2048 bits ?
Damien Miller : Firstly , increasing the default size of DSA keys was a mistake ( my mistake , corrected in the next release ) because unmodified DSA is limited by a 160 - bit subgroup and SHA - 1 hash , obviating the most of the benefit of using a larger overall key length , and because we do n't accept modified DSA variants with this restriction removed .
There are some new DSA standards on they way that use larger subgroups and longer hashes , which we could use once they are standardized and included in OpenSSL .
We increased the default RSA keysize because of recommendations by the NESSIE project and others to use RSA keys of at least 1536 bits in length .
Because host and user keys generated now will likely be in use for several years we picked a longer and more conservative key length .
Also , 2048 is a nice round ( binary ) number .
Do you plan to add any other algorithm to generate / exchange keys ?
For example , why did n't you include an implementation of ECC , used by the NSA ?
Damien Miller : ECC ( Elliptic Curve Cryptography ) has some speed and key size advantages , but there are two impediments to use using it .
First , no ECC key exchange method has been specified for the SSH protocol .
This is n't too much of a problem as the protocol has a great extension mechanism that allows us to define new methods without breaking other implementations or having to go begging to the IANA for a number reservation .
The second reason is more of a killer : many ECC methods are patented .
The NSA made the press recently for licensing these patents , something that we have neither the means nor the desire to do .
There are ECC methods that are not patented , but the whole area is a minefield that we do n't really want to navigate .
Also , some of the ECC methods that are patented are the optimizations that give ECC its performance advantage .
On modern machines , the key exchange is n't much of a delay anyway and can often be avoided by using the connection multiplexing support that has been in openssh - 3.9 ( reusing the one SSH connection for multiple commands , file transfer or login sessions ) .
The recent version 4.2 " added support for the improved arcfour cipher modes from draft - harris - ssh - arcfour - fixes - 02 .
The improves the cipher 's resistance to a number of attacks by discarding early keystream output " .
Could you tell us something more ?
Damien Miller : Remember that RC4 is a stream cipher ; generating a stream of random - looking bytes ( based on the key you feed it ) that you XOR with the data that you want to encrypt .
Fluhrer , Mantin and Shamir found that this early keystream can be correlated with the original key .
This unfortunate property may be used to construct an attack that recovers the original key .
In its strongest form , this attack is devastating ( it is the basis of the 802.11 WEP crack for example ) - fortunately the use of RC4 in the SSH protocol has been better engineered , but it still needed to be fixed .
An easy and computationally cheap way to avoid this attack is to simply discard this early keystream .
These new cipher modes discard the first 1.5 KB of keystream .
This does n't slow down the cipher at all , and so these modes are recommended for people who want to use a faster , but weaker cipher than AES .
I.e. use these in favour of the original ' arcfour ' cipher .
A future release of OpenSSH will probably remove the old method from the default list of accepted ciphers .
GFS : Fundamental Paradigm Shift or One - off Oddity ?
As regular readers know , I believe that the current model of enterprise storage is badly broken .
When I see something that blows that model away I like to learn more .
In particular , I assess the marketability of the innovation .
So a cool technology , like GFS or backup compression , makes me wonder if and how customers would buy it .
This article offers a 100,000 foot view of GFS by way assessing its commercial viability .
If you want a technical article about GFS , I can only recommend The Google File System by Ghemawat , Gobioff , & Leung , from which this article draws heavily .
The Wikipedia article , oddly , is n’t very good on GFS ( as of 5 - 16 - 06 ) .
If you do n’t have a BS / CS or better you ’ll likely find Ghemawat et. al. a slog .
Probably worthwhile .
Good for temporary relief of insomnia .
Google From Space
GFS is one of the key technologies that enables the most powerful general purpose cluster in history .
While most IT folks lose sleep over keeping the Exchange server backed up for a couple of thousand users , Google ’s infrastructure both supports massive user populations and the regular roll out of compute and data intensive applications that would leave most IT ops folks gibbering in fear .
How do they do it ?
Partly they are smarter than you .
Google employs hundreds of CompSci PhDs as well as many more hundreds of really smart people .
Partly it is their history : impoverished PhD candidates can’t afford fancy hardware to build their toys , so they started cheap and got cheaper .
And finally , being really smart and really poor , they rethought the whole IT infrastructure paradigm .
Their big insight : rather than build availability into every IT element at great cost , build availability around every element at low cost .
Which totally changes the economics of IT , just as the minicomputer in the ’ 70s , the PC in the ’ 80’s and the LAN in the ’90 ’s all did .
Only more so .
When processors , bandwidth and storage are cheap you can afford to spend lots of cycles on what IBM calls autonomic computing .
With the system properly architected and cheap to build out , it scales both operationally and economically .
All that said , Google has n’t done anything unique with their platform that other people had n’t already .
They just put it together and scaled it to unprecedented heights .
Note to CIOs : it is n’t going to take your users long to notice that Google can do this stuff and you can ’t .
Your life is n’t going to get any easier .
GFS From Low - Earth Orbit
Despite the name , GFS ( not to be confused ( although how exactly I do n’t know ) with Sistina ’s GFS – maybe we should call it GooFS ) is not just a file system .
It also maintains data redundancy , supports low - costs snapshots , and , in addition to normal create , delete , open , close , read , write operations also offers a record append operation .
That record append operation reflects part of the unique nature of the Google workload : fed by hundreds of web - crawling bots , Google ’s data is constantly updated with large sequential writes .
Rather than synchronize and coordinate the overwriting of existing data it is much cheaper to simply append new data to existing data .
Another feature of the Google workload is that it mostly consists of two kinds of reads : large streaming reads and small random reads .
As large reads and writes are so common , GFS is optimized for sustained bandwidth rather than low latency or IOPS .
As multi-gigabyte files are the common case , GFS is optimized for handling a few million files , so , doing the math , a single GFS should be able to handle a few petabytes of active data .
All this is built on very cheap components whose frequent failure , given the size of cluster , is expected .
The system monitors itself and detects , tolerates , and recovers quickly from component failures , including disk , network and server failures .
GFS From An SR - 71 Blackbird
A GFS cluster consists of a single master and multiple chunkservers , and is accessed by multiple clients .
Each of these is typically a dirt - cheap Linux box ( lately dual 2 GHz xeons with 2 GB ram and ~ 800 GB of disk ) .
Files are divided into chunks , each identified by a unique 64 - bit handle , and are stored on the local systems as Linux files .
Each chunk is replicated at least once on another server , and the default is three copies of every chunk ( take that RAID - 6 fanboys ! ) .
The chunks are big , like the files they make up : 64MB is the standard chunk size .
The chunkservers do n’t cache file data since the chunks are stored locally and the Linux buffer cache keeps frequently accessed data in memory .
If , like me , you thought bottleneck / SPOF when you saw the single master , you would , like me , have been several steps behind the architects .
The master only tells clients ( in tiny multibyte messages ) which chunkservers have needed chunks .
Clients then interact directly with chunkservers for most subsequent operations .
Now grok one of the big advantages of a large chunk size : clients do n’t need much interaction with masters to gather access to a lot of data .
That covers the bottleneck problem , but what about the SPOF ( single point of failure ) problem ?
We know the data is usually copied three times — when disk is really cheap you can afford that — but what about the all - important metadata that keeps track of where all the chunks are ?
The master stores — in memory for speed — three major types of metadata :
File and chunk names [ or namespaces in geekspeak ]
in geekspeak ]
Mapping from files to chunks , i.e. the chunks that make up each file
Locations of each chunk ’s replicas
So if the master crashes , this data has to be replaced pronto .
The first two — namespaces and mapping — are kept persistent by a log stored on the master ’s local disk and replicated on remote machines .
This log is checkpointed frequently for fast recovery if a new master is needed .
How fast ?
Reads start up almost instantly thanks to shadow masters who stay current with the master in the background .
Writes pause for about 30 - 60 seconds while the new master and the chunkservers make nice .
Many RAID arrays recover no faster .
The last type of metadata , replica locations , is stored on each chunkserver — and copied on nearby machines — and given to the master at startup or when a chunkserver enters a cluster .
Since the master controls the chunk placement it is able to keep itself up - to - date as new chunks get written .
The master also keeps track of the health of the cluster through handshaking with all the chunkservers .
Data corruption is detected through checksumming .
Even so , data may still get pooched .
Thus the GFS reliance on appending writes instead of overwrites ; combined with frequent checkpoints , snapshots and replicas , the chance of data loss is very low , and results in data unavailability , not data corruption .
GFS RAID
They do n’t call it that , but StorageMojo.com cares about storage , and I find this part particularly interesting .
GFS does n’t use any RAID controllers , fibre channel , iSCSI , HBAs , FC or SCSI disks , dual - porting or any of the other costly bling we expect in a wide - awake data center .
And yet it all works and works very well .
Take replica creation or what you and I would call mirroring .
All the servers in the cluster are connected over a full duplex switched Ethernet fabric with pipelined data transfers .
This means that as soon as a new chunk starts arriving , the chunkserver can begin making replicas at full network bandwidth ( about 12MB / sec ) without reducing the incoming data rate .
As soon as the first replica chunkserver has received some data it repeats the process , so the two replicas are completed soon after the first chunk write finishes .
In addition to creating replicas quickly , the master ’s replica placement rules also spread them across machines and across racks , to limit the chance of data unavailability due to power or network switch loss .
Pooling and Balancing
Storage virtualization may be on the downside of the hype cycle , and looking at GFS you can see what simple virtualization looks like when built into the file system .
Instead of a complex software layer to “ pool ” all the blocks across RAID arrays , GFS masters place new replicas on chunkservers with below average disk utilization .
So over time disk utilization equalizes across servers without any tricky and expensive software .
The master also rebalances replicas periodically , looking at disk space utilization and load balancing .
This process also keeps a new chunkserver from being swamped the moment it joins the cluster .
The master allocates data to it gradually .
The master also moves chunks from chunkservers with above average disk utilization to equalize usage .
Storage capacity is reclaimed slowly .
Rather than eager deletion , the master lets old chunks hang around for a few days and reclaims storage in batches .
Done in the background when the master is n’t too busy , it minimizes the impact on the cluster .
In addition , since the chunks are renamed rather than deleted , the system provides another line of defense against accidental data loss .

Suppose you could save five lives by taking one - what would be the correct thing to do ?
Such ethical dilemmas provide classic " experiments " for philosophers .
Here the Magazine presents four such quandaries and asks readers to vote on what they think is right .
[ Magazine note : apologies but we have had a technical hitch with the votes .
We 've replaced the vote modules , and will add those already cast to the totals . ]
Like scientists , philosophers use experiments to test their theories .
Unlike scientists , their experiments do not require sophisticated laboratories , white - robed technicians or even rodents .
They occur in the mind , and start with ' What if ...'.
These " thought experiments " help philosophers clarify their understanding of certain concepts and intuitions .
In the field of ethics , thought experimenters typically present a dilemma , examine the most popular " intuitive " response and then show the implications for real - world issues .
But such experiments are rarely tested on large numbers of people .
So to reach a larger group , here are four typical experiments .
Readers are invited to vote on how they think they would act in each case .
Here is a well - known example : 1 . THOMSON'S VIOLINIST
One day , you wake up in hospital .
In the nearby bed lies a world famous violinist who is connected to you with various tubes and machines .
VOTE RESULTS
Do you have an obligation to stay connected ?
Yes 30.62 %
No 69.35 %
3765 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
To your horror , you discover that you have been kidnapped by the Music Appreciation Society .
Aware of the maestro's impending death , they hooked you up to the violinist .
If you stay in the hospital bed , connected to the violinist , he will be totally cured in nine months .
You are unlikely to suffer harm .
No one else can save him .
Do you have an obligation to stay connected ?
The creator of the experiment , Judith Thomson , thinks the answer is " no " .
It would be generous if you did , she claims , but there is no obligation to stay , even if that means the violinist will die .
So how is this bizarre scenario related to the real world ?
Thomson used the experiment to show that a pregnant woman need not go to full term with her baby , as long as she had taken reasonable steps to avoid getting pregnant .
It is thus a " pro-choice " argument .
The violinist represents the baby , and you - in the hospital bed - play the role of the mother .
If you think unhooking yourself from the violinist is acceptable , but aborting an unwanted foetus is not , what are the moral differences between the two cases ?
In both situations , you could save a person by bearing a great burden for nine months .
One major flaw with thought experiments , especially in ethics , is that they are rarely tested on people .
The sample size is minuscule .
The philosopher will simply assume that most people think that one option is right ( or wrong ) .
Philippa Foot , a renowned British philosopher , believed that if a doctor , about to save a patient 's life with a large dose of a scarce drug , was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of five patients each in need of one fifth of the drug ( without which death would be certain ) , then the doctor should give it to the five .
It is , after all , better to let one person die than five .
Elizabeth Anscombe , another prominent philosopher , disagreed : " There seems to me nothing wrong with giving the single patient the massive dose and letting the others die " .
As these assumptions about people 's intuition are central to the arguments of many philosophers , and as these assumptions can be tested , why not do so ?
2 . THE RUNAWAY TROLLEY CAR
One of the most famous thought experiments in ethics is " the runaway trolley " .
It aims to clarify how we should distinguish right from wrong .
Here is the scenario with two well - known variations .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you flip the switch ?
Yes 76.85 %
No 23.15 %
3814 Votes Cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion A runaway trolley car is hurtling down a track .
In its path are five people who will definitely be killed unless you , a bystander , flip a switch which will divert it on to another track , where it will kill one person .
Should you flip the switch ?
3. THE FAT MAN AND THE TROLLEY CAR
The runaway trolley car is hurtling down a track where it will kill five people .
You are standing on a bridge above the track and , aware of the imminent disaster , you decide to jump on the track to block the trolley car .
Although you will die , the five people will be saved .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you push the fat man ?
Yes 26.88 %
No 73.12 %
20320 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion Just before your leap , you realise that you are too light to stop the trolley .
Next to you , a fat man is standing on the very edge of the bridge .
He would certainly block the trolley , although he would undoubtedly die from the impact .
A small nudge and he would fall right onto the track below .
No one would ever know .
Should you push him ?
Philippa
Foot would say that everyone ( " without hesitation " ) would choose to flip the switch in the first trolley case , but that most of us would be appalled at the idea of pushing the fat man .
The philosophical puzzle is this :
Why is it acceptable to sacrifice the one person in The Runaway Trolley Car but not in The Fat Man case ?
Can it ever be morally acceptable to kill an innocent person if that is the only way to save many ?
Should some actions - such as deliberately killing innocent people against their wishes - never be done ?
The last thought experiment explores this idea : 4 . THE CAVE EXPLORERS
An enormous rock falls and blocks the exit of a cave you and five other tourists have been exploring .
Fortunately , you spot a hole elsewhere and decide to let " Big Jack " out first .
But Big Jack , a man of generous proportions , gets stuck in the hole .
He can not be moved and there is no other way out .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you blast Big Jack out ?
Yes 74.12 %
No 25.88 %
19377 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
The high tide is rising and , unless you get out soon , everyone but Big Jack ( whose head is sticking out of the cave ) will inevitably drown .
Searching through your backpack , you find a stick of dynamite .
It will not move the rock , but will certainly blast Big Jack out of the hole .
Big Jack , anticipating your thoughts , pleads for his life .
He does not want to die , but neither do you and your four companions .
Should you blast Big Jack out ?
If the roles were reversed , what would you advise your trapped companions to do ?
Thought experiments , although abstract , possibly implausible and open to different interpretations , can have important repercussions on the way we think and act as individuals .
They raise thorny questions about morality in medicine , war , politics and indeed in everyday life .
Is there a difference between killing someone and letting them die ?
Are consequences all that matter , or are there some things we should never do , whatever the outcome ?
By pointing out inconsistencies in our thinking , or simply encouraging us to reflect on issues we usually ignore , they can sharpen our intellect and enrich our moral lives .
They also make for great conversation topics at the dinner table or at the pub .
But be warned : you may lose friends as a result .
And stay away from caves and bridges .

I feel sorry for the five people .
Not only have they had a runaway trolley hurtling towards them but also got trapped in a cave .
What a day !
Laura Kingdon , Cwmbran Surely the answer to the runaway trolley depends on the people involved .
If it were the choice between five 90 - year - olds and a single 20 year old , it would be right to save the 20 year old who , in probability , had longer to live than the others put together ?
Or what if those five were criminals and the other was a volunteer worker ?
Joanthan Kelk , Dalry , Scotland
It 's interesting to compare this with the Iraq war - was it right through intervention to kill as many people as we have in order to save a far greater number that were dying and would continue to die under the regime .
Usually people seem to say , no , as it is us pushing the fat man , despite the fact that five people arguably died through our inaction .
Brian , England
In the case of the Runaway Trolley Car , I would definitely NOT flip the switch .
The end does n't always justify the means .
Jenny , Leeds
In the examples given we must assume that all involved people are equal .
However , would it be right , good or efficent to kill one superior person to save four lesser people ?
I do not of course mean by race or any such thing but by worth to the whole .
If the one person was a brilliant doctor developing a cure for cancer , would you divert the trolley towards him to save four ?
What about ten ?
Fifty ?
A thousand people crammed onto a train car packed with explosives ?
Chris Fox , Derby I 'd use the dynamite to blast the trolley off the rails and then hook the violinist up to the fat man .
Robin , Edinburgh Thomson 's violinist is not the same principle as abortion .
If you choose to disconnect yourself you are in essence withdrawing treatment , that is refusing to intervene to save the life of someone who would otherwise die .
In an abortion you 're choosing to deliberately end the life of someone who would otherwise live .
Kate I would like to point out a problem I have with the direct application of the violinist thought experiment , as presented above , to the case of abortion .
In the experiment , if the violinist chooses to stay connected , they need have nothing to do with the violinist once the nine months have elapsed .
If a woman is pregnant , and chooses to keep the baby , they will have to bring the baby up - with important consequences for her life , that of the baby , and that of those close to her - or give the baby up for adoption - which again is likely to affect her strongly and will certainly affect the baby .
Suzanne Aigrain , Cambridge
If the violinist were my son or daughter I would not hesitate to stay connected .
( Maybe when they recover they will keep their rooms tidy to show their gratitude ! )
Jack , Coventry Cave Explorers : I am a caver , and I can assure you that the smaller six people definitely would NOT let Big Jack out first - he'd be forced to go last in order to avoid the very situation described ...
Jane , Epsom
It 's your birthday .
Four of your friends together buy you one lottery ticket as a present .
You win £ 5 million .
Do you share the money with these friends , who only spent £ 0.25 each on your birthday present ?
Jagdip Singh Ajimal , Manchester
These situations in reality are n't as black and white as a yes or no answer - different people will respond differently and for different reasons , and no one is necessarily right or wrong .
However , in reality getting involved in choosing who survives will likely get you sued or arrested !
Hannah , Wokingham I really enjoyed the puzzle dilemmas , but I thought that the five people should die in the runaway trolley car as it's their fate ; flipping the switch would be intentional murder .
Also , if I was n't there to flip the switch they would have died anyway - so its all fate !
Ayelee , London
You can only flick switches if you have a perfect understanding of the future , otherwise you might save a serial killer or kill a Nobel peace prize winner .
It is an infinitely unpredictable world and philosophical conundrums cannot take account of this .
As for Big Jack , he 's history , primal instincts would take over from philosophy , the only decision to make is where to put the dynamite .
Julian , Shrewsbury
Would you injure Rooney and put him out of the world cup , or would you rather Gerrard and Lampard and Terry all were injured ?

Snake shows its colours
Enlarge Image
Researchers from Germany and the US discovered the water snake 's chameleon - like behaviour by accident when they put it into a dark bucket .
The environmental group WWF , which supports conservation work in Borneo , says wildlife in the region is threatened by deforestation .
It believes the newly described snake may exist only in one river basin .
Found in the Kapuas river in the Betung Kerihun National Park in Kalimantan ( the Indonesian portion of Borneo ) , it belongs to the Enhydris genus of rear - fanged water snakes and has been named E. gyii .
It is about 50 cm ( 18 inches ) long , and venomous .
Bucket research
The discovery of the ' chameleon " snake exposes one of nature 's best kept secrets deep in the heart of Borneo
Stuart Chapman , WWF
It was Dr Auliya , a consultant for WWF , who discovered serendipitously its colour - changing capacity .
" I put the reddish - brown snake in a dark bucket , " he said .
" When I retrieved it a few minutes later , it was almost entirely white . "
The reasons why it has evolved this attribute are unclear .
The chameleon , possibly the animal kingdom's most famous colour - changer , is believed to alter its hue depending on mood and temperature .
In the last 10 years , more than 350 new animal and plant species have been discovered on Borneo .
" The discovery of the ' chameleon ' snake exposes one of nature 's best kept secrets deep in the heart of Borneo , " said Stuart Chapman , WWF 's international coordinator for the island .
The environmental group warns that the home of the new snake is threatened , as Borneo 's forest cover has declined from 75 % in the mid-1980s to about 50 % today .

“ A company parking lot is just really cheap real estate , ” Mr. Schwartz said .
Mr. Schwartz rose to the chief executive position less than six months ago with a mandate to reverse the decline Sun has experienced since the end of the dot - com boom .
And computing experts suggested that the mobile data center was a gamble that could pay off .
“ What an out - there idea , ” said David A. Patterson , a computer scientist at the University of California , Berkeley , who has worked closely with Sun and with Mr. Hillis .
“ You could convert your warehouse into a modern data center . ”
Mr. Schwartz said the mobile data center would be attractive to customers that need to expand computing capacity quickly .
Sun will lease as well as sell the systems , and Mr. Schwartz said the entire system is recyclable .
On Monday , he gave a reporter a tour of the prototype system , which sits in a container case adjacent to a Sun office building here , connected to two large fire hoses for water cooling and 500 kilowatts of redundant power .
Painted black with a lime green
Sun logo , the system can consist of up to seven tightly packed racks of 35 server computers based on either Sun ’s Niagara Sparc processor or an Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices .
The system includes sensors to detect tampering or movement and features a large red button to shut it down in an emergency .
Once plugged in , it requires just five minutes to be ready to run applications .
Sun has applied for five patents on the design of the system , including a water - cooling technique that focuses chilled air directly on hot spots within individual computing servers .
The system , which Sun refers to as “ cyclonic cooling , ” makes it possible to create a data center that is five times as space - efficient as traditional data centers , and 10 percent to 15 percent more power - efficient , Mr. Schwartz said .
Picture it :
On election day in some future year , a presidential candidate ends up with the most popular votes but not enough electoral votes to win .
It 's a repeat of the 2000 election in which one contender , Democrat Al Gore , took the majority of the national popular vote , while the other , Republican George W. Bush , clinched the most electoral college votes and , hence , the presidency .
But this time there 's a twist :
A bunch of states team up and give all their electoral college votes to the nationwide popular - vote winner , regardless of who won the most votes in their state .
Then , the candidate who garners the most citizen votes in the country moves into the White House .
Legislative houses in Colorado and California have recently approved this plan , known as the National Popular Vote proposal , taking it partway to passage .
Other states , too , are exploring the idea of a binding compact among states that would oblige each of them to throw its electoral votes behind the national popular - vote winner .
At issue is the nation 's presidential election system governed by the electoral college .
Established by the US Constitution in 1787 , the system has occasionally awarded the presidency to candidates who could n't muster the most votes nationwide , as happened in 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , and 2000 .
While an amendment to the Constitution could change or eliminate the electoral college , battleground states and small states would probably oppose any change that would leave them with less influence .
Indeed , since the system 's inception , numerous efforts to amend it have been defeated .
Instead , reformers have turned to the interstate compact , saying it would be constitutional because agreements between states already exist .
The compact is designed to take effect only if states representing 270 electoral votes approve the compact legislation , giving those states majority control of the electoral college .
The result :
The " compact " group of states would be able to determine a presidential election .
The plan is supported by electoral reform activists and a bipartisan advisory group including former GOP Rep.
John Anderson ( a presidential candidate in 1980 ) and former Sen. Birch Bayh ( D ) .
They say the compact would allow long - ignored states to get attention again in presidential campaigns .
The current system has " just taken a lot of states off of the presidential map , " complains Rob Richie , executive director of FairVote , a nonpartisan organization based in Maryland , which supports the compact .
The compact proposal passed the California Assembly on May 30 with all but one Republican opposing .
It awaits a vote in the state Senate and , if it passes , approval or rejection by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) , who has n't publicly expressed an opinion about it .
Colorado's Senate approved the plan in April with bipartisan support , but it has not advanced because the legislative session there has ended .
Five GOP
Assembly members are pushing a popular - vote bill in New York , and legislators in Missouri , Louisiana , and Illinois have introduced bills .
Advocates hope to put the legislation before every state by 2007 , says Mr. Ritchie .
Meanwhile , several newspapers have come out in favor of the plan , including The New York Times , which calls it an " ingenious solution . "
But in California , GOP Assemblyman Chuck DeVore derisively refers to the proposal as a way to " amend the Constitution without amending the Constitution . "
" It 's like cheating , " says Mr. DeVore , who predicts that the plan would force candidates to campaign primarily in urban areas with large populations to win the popular vote .
Under the current system " we discourage regional candidacies and basically force people who are running for president to have a message that resonates with the vast middle of America , " he says .
DeVore supports a system that would allocate some of a state 's electoral votes based on the popular vote in congressional districts , an approach that exists in Nebraska and Maine .
All other states and the District of Columbia award all their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who gets the most votes in their state .
It takes 270 electoral votes out of 538 total votes in the college to win the presidency .
That total equals the number of members each state has in both houses of Congress , with the District of Columbia getting three of its own .
The electoral college system is " distinctly American , " says Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the University of California , Riverside .
In US history , there have been about 700 failed proposals in Congress to change the electoral college system , according to the Office of the Federal Register .
" It 's safe to say that there has been no aspect of what the founders worked up in Philadelphia that has received more criticism than the electoral college , " says historian Rick Shenkman of George Mason University .
If any state approves this new proposal , legal challenges are inevitable , Bowler says .
But he figures there might be a way to dampen enthusiasm .
" You could say the French elect their president directly , " he says .
" I 'm thinking that will get people running away from any support :
If the French do it , is it really right for the US ? "
[ Editor 's note :
The original version contained a paragraph that misstated how the proposed system would work . ]
The common argument in favor of the Military Commissions Act ’s restriction of habeas corpus is summed up by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist :
We do n’t want ( terror suspects ) to have everyday rights of American civilians right here .
These are war criminals .
There ’s really no other argument in support of it that comes even close to sounding sane , though there are of course a plethora of rephrasings out there ( such as the rhetorical “ Do n’t you want the government to be able to stop terrorists ? ” ) .
There are half - arguments , of course .
They tend to involve phrases such as “ This does n’t apply to US citizens ! ” or “ It ’s only for enemy combatants ! ”
They all boil down to one simple fact : supporters are working on the assumption that , somehow , it will only apply to people who are guilty .
The problem with that , of course , is that the Great Writ ’s entire purpose and the whole necessity for its existence is bound up in one single , simple aim :
The Writ of Habeas Corpus exists only to ensure that we have the right guy in custody .
One must wonder why the hell the government needs to deny accused terrorists access to the courts under a Writ of Habeas Corpus if the accused are actually guilty .
If they ’re guilty , the court proceeding that results from the serving of such a Writ should determine that — or , more to the point , should determine whether there ’s sufficient reason to even believe the accused is guilty to an extent that warrants detention and investigation .
If a Writ of Habeas Corpus leads to a decision that the accused is in fact not being held justly , the person should damned well not be held any longer !
That wrongly accused person should receive an apology and a ride home .
That person should never have been detained in the first place .
Mistakes happen , but they are not solved by ensuring that we cannot discover whether or not a mistake has been made .
The Military Commissions
Act in no way improves the ability to pursue a “ war on terror ” by suspending habeas corpus .
All it does is sweep mistakes under the rug and ensure that those who are wronged in pursuit of the specter of security will only continue to be wronged indefinitely , and nobody can do anything about it .
It seems impossible that those Senators and Representatives who voted for this , or that the President who will be signing it into law on the 17th , even for a moment considered the likelihood that they might think differently of this if they did not currently hold public office .
In short , the simple truth of the Writ of Habeas Corpus is that all it does is help sort the good guys from the bad guys , to the benefit of the good guys , and suspending it in whole or in part for those literally or effectively detained on US soil in no way benefits anyone at all except those whose errors destroy the lives of innocent bystanders and should be brought into the light of public scrutiny .

Shanghai grows at a dizzying rate
Greater Shanghai has a population that has passed 20 million .
The sprawl of Mexico City is estimated to house another 20 million .
And Mumbai too .
These cities are bigger than many industrialised nations .
And they are growing at a dizzying rate , sucking in workers from rural areas .
Sociologist Professor Richard Sennett believes the rise of these cities is changing their relationship with the countries they are in .
He is one of a number of academics carrying out research into the evolution of cities .
Economically , many of the world 's great cities are already divorced from their nation - states , with their main streams of investment come from other great cities .
" The most important place to London is New York and to New York is London and Tokyo , " Prof Sennett says .
" London belongs to a country composed of itself and New York . "
Anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity
London Mayor Ken Livingston
Shanghai has so much power and autonomy it has been described as effectively a city - state , within China only in geography .
And on Thursday London Mayor Ken Livingstone was handed a raft of new powers over planning , housing and the environment .
He joked : " Having been to Singapore and seen how successful it was I think anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity , with its own foreign and defence policies thrown in . "
And Ivan Massow , who has twice tried for Mr Livingstone 's job as first a Conservative and then Labour hopeful , has long campaigned for the capital to be given a " fair share of the national cake " .
" It will cost £ 2 billion to fix the Tube and £ 1.5 bn to benefit from the effects of the 2012 Olympics , yet [ Londoners ] subsidise the rest of the UK to the tune of £ 20 billion a year . "
Sister cities
There are many British people who already find London a strangely foreign place .
And when the London - centric media views the rest of the country , it has a pronounced tendency to view it through a prism of life in the capital .
Migrants move with their work
Prof Sennett says the inequalities between London and other British cities will only increase .
And with the economic and demographic gulf widening , it will soon be even harder to accept that London has more in common with Sheffield than Shanghai , with Preston than Paris .
It all has echoes of Europe 's great tradition of city states , from Ancient Greece through Renaissance Italy and pre-1870s Germany .
One thing that sets London apart - and puts it in the same bracket as the other mega-cities - is its attractiveness to immigrants .
Prof Sennett paints a picture of an intensely entrepreneurial class of economic migrants on a global travelator around swelling cities , moving Shanghai to London to New York .
Many have no moorings and an ambivalent attitude towards the country outside their host city .
But there are signs for hope , such as the national sense of loss over the 7 July bombings .
Prof Sennett concludes : " I do n't think people can really do without national unity .
It is culturally unsustainable . "
Capitalise on London 's success : Prof Sennett 's views make sense .
It is therefore important that a successful growing London continues to receive government investment for key infrastructure to maintain its position as the most productive area in the UK and Europe .
James Gardner , London
I no longer see London as part of my country , it 's economy , cultural make up , wealth and outlook are totally divorced from anything I recognise as British in any sense .
Ceebe , West Mids
No matter how developed they become , cities will always be reliant on the surrounding country for natural resources .
People have to eat , need gas for their automobiles .
No amount of economic development can change that simple fact .
Lance , Berkeley , California
The time is fast approaching when cities like Manchester and Birmigham need to have much greater freedom and control of their " city regions " in order to prosper .
The English " city regions " have much less in common with smaller cities and towns in the mainly shire counties and consequently need a different form of government .
A " city region " mayor as in London is probably a sensible first step but in any event change must surely come .
Doug Hardy , Manchester
So London subsidises the UK to the tune of £ 20 bn a year ?
Surely this is fair recompense for the non-financial subsidies ( workers , graduates , know - how etc ) the rest of the UK supplies to London thus enabling it to generate so much wealth .
Or what about the billions in Scottish oil revenue that floods into the wider UK economy and , hence , London's .
I 'm not arguing over whether any of this is right or wrong but simply pointing out that there are non-financial economic measures as well .

One life
Lawrence Koomson is a doctor living and working in London .
On the face of it , he seems no different from any other young man but Lawrence has a secret .
At 33 , he has never been through puberty .
He 's never had a spot .
He 's never had an erection .
And he 's trapped in the body of a 12 - year - old boy .
But this all changed in April 2005 , when he began treatment to bring on puberty .
The thought of treatment scared Lawrence
Lawrence has Kallmann 's syndrome , a rare condition affecting predominantly men , but also women .
A small area in the brain called the hypothalamus cannot work properly causing a hormonal imbalance .
For men like Lawrence , this means his body does n't produce testosterone , which prevents puberty being triggered .
Another characteristic of Kallmann 's syndrome is an absent sense of smell .
Having Kallmann 's syndrome can lead to extreme difficulties , especially during adolescence , when all one 's peers are going through puberty .
And the consequences of delayed puberty and not becoming sexually mature naturally has a far - reaching impact on sufferers ' lives .
In essence he's got the testosterone levels of a one - year - old so we 've got quite a lot of catching up to do
Professor Pierre Bouloux
" We 've tested Lawrence 's blood testosterone levels and the results make for quite interesting reading , " he said , before the treatment .
" The reference range for men Lawrence 's age would be a testosterone level between 9.9 and 27.8 .
" Lawrence 's level is less than 0.5 .
In essence he's got the testosterone levels of a one - year - old so we 've got quite a lot of catching up to do .
" In terms of penile length we 're talking about a resting length of about four centimetres , and for a chap of Lawrence 's size that shows that development has n't occurred as yet . "
With treatment , it 's hoped Lawrence will grow body hair , his voice will break , he 'll develop body muscle and sexual organs and for the first time will experience sexual desire .
36 - hour erection
The treatment consists of six implants in the buttock , which release 200 milligrams of testosterone over six months .
He will be dependent on implants for the rest of his life .
Professor Bouloux has treated more than 300 patients over the last 15 - 20 years .
" In extreme situations , I 've seen people not being able to handle the testosterone treatment , developing erections lasting hours and hours , and in one case up to 36 hours .
" There 's no script for this , we got to see what happens and navigate a safe course to give Lawrence a level which will put him in a normal range . "
It happened today .
I was so scared I was n't sure if it was going to or not going to .
I had an erection !
Lawrence Koomson
" The thought of treatment makes me feel a bit frightened or scared because I do n't know what 's going to happen .
I might have the urge to have sex when I do n't want to have sex !
" I feel excited - it 's something I 've never been through before .
I 'll grow a beard and I 've always wanted to see how I 'll be with a beard and you know I 'll get more muscle , so I think the ladies are going to love the new me ! "
Lawrence received his long awaited implants in April 2005 .
The next day , he was glued to the mirror watching and waiting for changes .
What will happen first ?
A spot ?
An erection ?
Or signs of a beard ?
Dating was a whole new world
" It happened today .
I was so scared I was n't sure if it was going to or not going to .
I had an erection !
" It really woke me up !
It lasted 10 - 15 minutes .
I was happy !
I wanted to call the doctor but it was too early in the morning . "
For the next six months , Lawrence went through puberty .
As the massive implant of testosterone began to take hold of his body , Lawrence started to feel sexual attraction to women for the first time .
He also experienced all the usual teenage distractions - surfing internet chatrooms looking for female company , even mobile phone porn .
It was all new territory for him .
" I 'm resisting that push into the teenage world , " he said .
" I have to behave more responsibly , much more responsibly .
Not only am I not a teenager .
Also , there 's the very fact that I 'm a medical doctor and I have to behave more responsibly than that . "
Novice
Moral conflicts aside , as Lawrence made tentative steps into the scary world of dating , the disappointments started to stack up .
Most men make their first advances towards women at an age when it does n't really matter but at 33 years old , Lawrence found out that the stakes were high .
He shyly arranged his first date over the internet and suggested a trip to the cinema , but baulked when he found out that she wanted to go clubbing .
I 've really missed out on two decades of life and I need to catch up
Lawrence Koomson
" I 'm too much of a novice to go into all that .
I could n't allow myself , for me I 'm not mature yet to do that - I can't do that , not yet . "
But mature enough or not , the opportunity to live a grown man 's life was not something Lawrence was going to let slip by .
" I 've really missed out on two decades of life and I need to catch up . "
One life - Male , 33 , Seeks Puberty , is on BBC One at 2235 GMT on Tuesday 6 December
Your comments :
This is really one of the " mistakes " of nature .
I can imagine the ordeal Lawrence has gone through .
Thanks
God however , that the treatment is a simple surgical procedure with a very promising prognosis .
There are other very complicated neurohormonal , genetic and congenital abnormalities that can be highly debilitating .
Thanks to the recent advances in the medical profession .

I wish Lawrence all the best , puberty can be very trying to all and to go through it at 33 wont be easy but I think he will be fine and is mature enough to get through it .
I hope he meets someone who will take things slowly .
Sarah , Bracknell
I also suffer from the syndrome .
As a teenager I found it very difficult and could not understand why I was the way I was .
This programme will be great for other suffers , I 'm glad that more people will be able to now see what my life has been like !
Ian , Newbury Park , Essex
I am 56 years old and I was diagnosed with Kallmann 's Syndrome over 30 years ago .
I still have testosterone injections every three weeks .
I attended the endocrine clinic at St Bartholemew 's Hospital .
My wife and I were not able to have children and I have since had to have surgery on my testicles .
I will be most interested to see the program .
Mike , Milton Keynes
Kat seems unaware that Lawrence 's inability to have an erection is a separate symptom from his missed puberty .
Erections do not begin at puberty ; most boys are capable of having them from birth onwards .
Kelly Mouser , Upminster , Essex
What a brave man Mr Lawrence is .... Puberty is never an easy time ....
But to go through it at the age 33 .... I wish him all the best .... May his journey be a smooth one ....
Chris Ley , Shaftsbury Vermont U.S.A .
Wow !
It seems that everyone does take puberty for granted although many teenagers complain when puberty first starts , they should bear in mind Lawrence .
Thankfully , there is treatment and Lawrence will now experience what every other teenager experiences .

Scientists searching for the origin of HIV , the global pandemic infecting more than 40 million people , believe they have finally tracked its original source to two colonies of chimpanzees in a corner of Cameroon .
The finding represents the culmination of a 10 - year hunt for the source of the pandemic and provides a crucial link between HIV , which causes Aids in humans , and the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) , a strikingly similar virus that infects monkeys and chimpanzees .
Researchers believe that south - east Cameroon is where the virus first jumped from chimpanzees to humans before HIV infection began spreading among people as far back as the 1930s .
At the time , HIV , which destroys the immune system leaving those infected vulnerable to myriad diseases , was difficult to diagnose .
Carried by people travelling along the rivers , it spread unnoticed to Kinshasa , where the first human epidemic began to grow .
Researchers at Nottingham University joined scientists in Montpellier and Alabama to search for signs of the virus in 10 chimpanzee populations throughout Cameroon , where SIV was known to be circulating .
Cameroon is home to two different subspecies of chimpanzee , separated by the natural border of the Sanaga river which slices the country into north and south .
North of the river , tests on chimpanzee faeces found no traces of SIV , but it was present in colonies immediately on the southern side .
As the search for the source of HIV moved further south , researchers located two colonies , living deep in the south - east corner of the country near the Ngoko river bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Tests on chimpanzee faeces here revealed an SIV strikingly similar to the HIV that causes Aids in humans .
In some communities they detected SIV specific antibodies and viral genetic information in as many as 35 % of chimps .
" For us , this is really the last piece of the puzzle , " said Paul Sharp , a professor of genetics at Nottingham University .
" This is where it probably all started .
We 've got these viruses in south - east Cameroon , which are so close to HIV , and it 's difficult to envisage there could be any which could be closer . "
The research appears in the journal Science today .
" There was a nagging doubt that chimps had picked it up from monkeys , because monkeys carry the virus and chimps sometimes eat them , " he added .
" We did n't know for sure if humans picked up the virus in parallel from the same type of monkey .
No one had really shown if there was a reservoir of this virus out there in the wild . "
Researchers have various theories on how the virus jumped to humans ; the most widely held view is that hunters became infected when they caught and butchered infected chimps .
SIV appears to cause no outward signs of illness , so hunters would not have known if they were catching infected animals .
" When people hunt chimpanzees they tend to butcher them on the spot and then there 's a lot of blood flying around , " said Prof Sharp .
" If the hunter has any open wounds then , that 's an opportunity to get infected .
" Chimps and humans are extremely similar genetically , but here we have a virus that is seemingly harmless in chimps , jumps into humans and suddenly causes Aids . "
Researchers believe the virus infected humans some time before the 1930s and was gradually spread by river travel .
All of the rivers in Cameroon run into the Sangha , which joins the Congo river running past Kinshasa .
Trade along the routes could have spread the virus , which slowly built up in the human population .
For SIV to cause a pandemic in humans , it must have first mutated into a form that could readily be picked up from infected chimpanzees .
Then it adapted until it was infectious enough to be passed from person to person .
The first clearly identified case of Aids reported in the United States was in 1981 , though it seems an African American teenager died of it in St Louis in 1969 .
Epidemiologists who have studied the growth of the pandemic suggest that by the 1960s about 2,000 people in Africa may have had HIV , which was as yet unnamed .
By 1980 , closer to 1 million people were infected , and the virus was named a year later .
OF the 40 million people living with HIV now , more than two - thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa , which is also home to 77 % of the women with HIV .
Last year , there were nearly 5 m new HIV infections , 4.2 m among adults and 700,000 in children under 15 .
In the same year , there were 3.1 m deaths from Aids , more than half a million of whom were children .
Identifying the source of the HIV pandemic is more than filling in a missing link in the disease 's progression .
Understanding how the virus infects chimpanzees , and why it does not appear to cause disease in such a similar genetic species , could unveil useful clues about how the virus works in humans and which crucial changes happened to the virus when it made the leap to humans .
Joe from scalability.org points to an interesting article .
Apparently , ATI is moving into the field of stream processing .
In this post , I will tell you a little about what stream processing is , what your graphics processor has to do with it and also what problems I see with it .
But let me start by having a little fun with their announcement :
ATI has invited reporters to a Sept. 29 event in San Francisco at which it will reveal “ a new class of processing known as Stream Computing . ”
Wow .
Looks like they invented a whole new paradigma .
Or maybe not ?
I guess some smart guys in Stanford have been into stream processing for almost ten years now .
And I bet they were n’t the first ones either .
Ok , so stream processing is not entirely new and I will stop giving their poor marketing people a hard time .
It is expected that ATI will reveal a product called Firestream , which enables stream processing on their graphics cards .
The concept behind that is called GPGPU , or General Purpose Graphics Processor Units .
And this is where it gets really exciting .
In fact , it gets so exciting that a colleague of mine did a seminar ( in German ) on the topic with some very motivated students last semester – and this is basically where I learned everything I am going to tell you next .
Therefore , please take everything I will tell you here with a grain of salt , as I am certainly NOT an expert in this field .
You probably know that your graphics adapter has a lot of power ( at least you may know that it eats a lot of power , but that ’s a different , although related , story : P ) .
Modern GPUs have a complexity ( measured in transistors ) that rivals , if not surpasses the complexity of your CPU .
And it gets even better : while your CPU has to be able to do a whole lot of things , the GPU specializes on a very narrow task : it takes a huge amount of triangles and some textures , applies some relatively small operations to the triangles ( in its so called vertex shaders ) , splits them up into pixels , applies some more operations ( this time in the pixel shaders ) and spits out a whole lot of pixels for your viewing pleasure .
I can almost hear you scream in pain if you know your way around graphics programming and have to listen to this very gross oversimplification of the graphics pipeline , but since I am not an expert in this field and I expect most of you are n’t either , I will leave it at that : D. Feel free to flame me in the comments - section .
No dependencies are involved when applying the shader - operations and therefore you have many of them that can work in parallel ( which is good , because that makes the operations described above really , really fast ) .
Now , how does stream computing fit into the picture ?
Let ’s say you have a huge amount of data and want to apply the same operation to each element .
Maybe in the game of life .
Or if you want to simulate a waterfall .
Your CPU is not really well suited for that task , because it can only process one element at a time .
Your graphics adapter on the other hand is a perfect fit : just feed these data into the graphics pipeline ( turning them into a stream of data , which is really just a one - dimensional array ) and program the shaders with the appropriate operations ( called kernels in this context ) and the GPU will happily crunch through the data , using all its data - parallel processing power .
And because that ’s what it can do best , it will do so fast .
Really fast .
We have seen speedups of 30 in a simple experiment with matrix multiplication done by one of our students , but of course your results may vary .
Unfortunately , the story has downsides as well .
If you think parallel programming is hard , then programming GPGPUs is hell :( .
At least that was my personal conclusion after listening to some of the experiences made by our students .
Although there are some higher level languages available ( e.g. Sh or Brook ) , you basically need to be a graphics expert anyways to program in them .
You will also trip over countless bugs , as well as limitations of your particular graphic adapter that you never had to think about before .
And it gets even worse :
Because all the fun is happening on the graphics adapter , there is no way to access main memory !
Therefore , all the additional data you may need have to be converted into textures somehow , which can then be read by your kernels .
Very strange , if you ask me .
Your data may also not have any dependencies inside the stream , because the data is worked on in parallel by the different shaders on the GPU .
And finally , expressing your algorithms in a streamy way is not an easy task , when you look at the limitations sketched above .
I will even go as far as to say that most known algorithms and data structures today are not usable at all for stream processing and new ways to express them have to be found upfront .
A very rewarding task for a research project , but not so good when you want to utilize it in a product and your boss is bugging you with a deadline .
A very pessimistic outlook so far .
But maybe ATI has something more than just hardware up at its sleeves .
Some kind of Stream Building Blocks would be nice ( kind of like what the Intel Thread Building Blocks are trying to do for threads ) .
Or a language that abstracts away at least some of the hardware specifics and raises the level of abstraction considerably .
And actually works .
And if it ’s not ATI , maybe somebody else manages to make GPGPU - programming at least achievable without loosing all your hair beforehand ; ) .
I want to close this post with a citation from a commercial for a large tire - manufacturer , which I find very fitting in this context :
Power is nothing without control .
I am hoping at least some people at ATI worry about control as much as about power .

In economics there is a norm that authors are listed alphabetically .
The norm is surprisingly strong and deviations are punished .
On my first paper with Eric Helland we tossed for first authorship , I won , and we noted the names were listed in random order .
Believe it or not , Helland ’s tenure committee grilled him on this point and as a result we switched to alphabetical ordering on all our subsequent papers .
Citation counts , however , are historically assigned only to the first listed author and later listed authors are often buried under the et al. monster .
Do you think these effects are too tiny to matter ?
Take a look at the Yellow Pages and see how many firms choose A - names , AA - names , and AAA - names .
Even more surprisingly , a new paper ( free , working version , Winter 06 , JEP ) demonstrates that these effects have important consequences for careers in economics .
Faculty members in top departments with surnames beginning with letters earlier in the alphabet are substantially more likely to be tenured , be fellows of the Econometrics Society , and even win Nobel prizes ( let ’s see , Arrow , Buchanan Coase… hmmm ) .
No such effects are found in psychology where the alphabetical norm is not followed .
I ’m delighted that my young co-author , Amanda Agan , has a great career ahead of her but if Helland wins the Nobel I am going to be very annoyed .
It ’s time to end the tyranny of the alphabet !
The AER should announce a name randomization policy unless authors otherwise instruct .
Barring that , I wish henceforth be known as Alex Abarrok .
How To Better Engage Your Readers
The best way to engage anyone is to ask them questions about themselves .
Most people have one favorite subject in common and that subject matter is " me...me...me...me...me...me " .
Is n't that your favorite subject ?
I was fortunate to have one of the companies I worked for early in my career force me to go to what I thought was one of the most lame sales training courses called " Dale Carnegie " .
After all , I was 20 something and I knew all I needed to know ... right ?
Wrong !
I think you find that out when you hit 30 something ... you know , not knowing as much as you thought you knew .
Though I was forced to go to this training class I thoroughly hated , I chose to make the best of it and take away as much information as possible .
After all , I was there .... they were there and I did n't have a choice .
So , when life hands you lemons , make lemonade .
One of the greatest gifts I took away from that sales training coarse was reading the book " How to win friends and influence people " By Dale Carnegie .
I highly recommend this book to any person who will take the short amount of time it takes to read it , it will change you and your relationships .
It will help you understand that people simply want someone to take interest in " their stories " , what is going on in " their lives " and that taking an interest in other people really is the number one way to build better relationships .
On that note , I would like to encourage you to add questions to your blog posts to better interact with your readers .
There are many simple questions you can ask as you close out your blog posts , here are a few ideas :
1 . How will this information help you ?
2 . How do you plan to use this information ?
3 . How else might I be of assistance to you with the information I have provided above ?
4 . What experiences have you had that may add to the discussion ?
5 . After reading what you read , what is your commitment to implementing in your own blog or website ?
I will close by having you think back to the last social gathering you were at and recall if most of your conversations were about you or the person / people you were conversing with .
Which of those conversations were most interesting to you ?
How often were you engaged in " interesting " conversation where you were learning about someone else , what they do , etc .
If you are the type of person who finds yourself learning about others during conversations , I bet those people think you are a GREAT conservationist !
I love the old saying " you have two ears and one mouth .... remember to use them accordingly " .
I really am interested in your thoughts and opinions and truly wish to know how you plan to use this in your next blog post , networking event or sales call .
Thank you for taking your time to visit and hope you find the information useful .
I hope to help you learn everything you want and need to know about blogging .

Blog Marketing - why blogging IS marketing
I recently came across a situation where one of my clients was told by his business consultant that his blog was for one purpose only .
To educate people and share good information .
My client was told that his blog should not be used for " marketing purposes " and I tend to disagree .
If your blog is n't to be used for " marketing " , then what is the purpose in having it ?
Now do n't get me wrong , educating people and offering jasminlive visitors valuable information is crucial to the success of your blog , but factoring self promotion and marketing is also important .
You have to find good balance in your blog to make sure you are educating your readers , after all that is what most people are looking for when they read blogs , they want information and providing valuable information will keep them coming back for more .
My recommendation to you when creating a blog post is to educate FIRST and market second .
If you approach your posts by marketing first , you will most likely loose the interest of your readers within a few moments .
The best way to use your blog as a marketing tool is to provide valuable information with hyperlinks directly to your product pages where people can take action with the product or service you are offering .
It serves three purposes :
1 . Blogs create fresh content which is what " Googlers " want and what Google wants to provide .
2. Leads potential clients to the place to take action .
3 . Create links throughout your site or from your blog to your site , which helps with your quest to work with Google .
How To Name Your Blog
For those who wish to get started on blogging , whether it be to make money or to keep in touch with family and friends , trying to figure out what to name your blog can be one of your biggest challenges .
I have an easy solution to what many find to be a big " road block " to moving forward .
If you want people to be able to find your blog via the Internet Search Engines like Google , the fastest and easiest road there is to find a domain name for your live jasmin blog that matches what people are searching for related to your subject matter .
If you have read earlier posts on how to get found on Google , you understand that the Google algorithms are programmed to help people searching on Google to find the most relevant results .
Typically , the most relevant results to any search would be a domain name that matches the search term ... right ?
You may be asking yourself how exactly you figure what people are searching for ... and again ... pretty easy to figure out ... IF you know where to look .
Google has a " keyword tool " I like to use to help me figure out what to name my websites and blogs , which I STRONGLY encourage you to utilize before you name your blog or register your domain name .
The best way to use this tool is to type in different search terms that match the desired subject of your blog .
You will see a list of results with numbers that indicate the search volume for each term .
Your best bet is to find a term that has the highest number of search volume and try to buy a domain name to match it .
To give you a good example , I will use one of my most recent clients , " Moore 's Martial Arts " in Livermore , CA .
Moore 's does n't currently have a website or domain name for the school located in Livermore , so we are starting from scratch .
The steps I went through to find the " perfect " domain name are as follows :
I search using the keyword tool for terms that included Livermore martial arts .
Martial arts being the most generic term I could think of to describe what they do .
Upon doing my research , I found that there are close to 600 searches each month for the term " Livermore Martial Arts " .
When you consider the amount of search volume for that particular keyword , it would make great sense to see if I can obtain the domain name " Livermore Martial Arts " , which is exactly what we did .
IMPORTANT NOTE :
It is important for me to note that just because I have identified a great domain name that matches the search term , it in no way guarantees this website will make it to the front page of the search engines .
What helps get you to the front page of the search engines is good content that is relative to the term you wish to be found for .
It is also VERY important to submit your site to the search engines by submitting your site map .
No site map ... no search results .
Should you build your own blog or hire someone
The question of the day ... Should I try to build my own blog site or should I hire a professional ?
Let 's go over the advantages and disadvantages of both ...
Do It Yourself :
If you create your own blog , it will take time away from whatever it is keeps you busy now .
Building your own blog without the help of a professional designer and the assistance of what to include / not include could keep your blog from reaching its full potential .
If you consider yourself to be pretty " techy " and like this sort of thing , I encourage you to dig in and get your fingers " dirty " , if indeed you will actually follow through , the key here being ... will you actually follow through and get it done ?
By creating your own blog , you are in control and do n't have to depend on someone else to make changes and updates that are often needed on any live sex chat website .
You created it , so you know how to change it , update it or fix it if need be !
If you do n't happen to have an eye for what looks good and create your own blog , you may get visitors to your blog that " bounce " the second they arrive because your blog is n't inviting or looks cluttered .
If you do decide to create your own blog , we do encourage you to create a custom look and feel to your web blog and the easiest program to do that is Artisteer .
It requires NO PRIOR web design knowledge or experience and could not be more user friendly .
It is a great program and they do offer a free demo .
Visit this link for a full video tutorial on how to use the program .
The tutorial shows you how to build a simple , but completely custom blog theme in 5 minutes !
Yes , the video is 5 minutes with no outtakes or secret shortcuts .
The whole blog template is built in 5 minutes .
Hire A Professional :
Hiring a professional to set up your blog in most cases is a one - time fee because once a blog is set up it is done .
I have many clients who hire me to do exactly this because they either do n't have the time or just choose not to do it themselves .
It is not that time consuming for someone like myself that has done it many times and very cost effective if you have the funds available .
Feel Free To Contact Me For a Quote .
A professional will most likely set up your blog to match your company website or be able to integrate your company logo by using design software that you may not be familiar with .
As mentioned above , check out Artisteer and the tutorials to see if this is something you simply wish to take on yourself .
It really is easy with a little video training !
Hiring a professional will require a small investment , but typically when you have some " skin in the game " you are more likely to follow through with the actual blogging .
Your blog will need to have some structure to it and a professional will obviously have more insight in to creating that structure .
NOTE : If you do choose to hire a professional to create your blog site , make sure that your agreement includes training on how to log in , create blogs , and manage the site .
There is n't a lot to managing a blog other than adding " blogs " ( content and articles ) regularly , but you will need some guidance to get you started .
If your designer does n't include training , you are strongly encouraged to " pass " and find one that does .
As you can see there are benefits to both .
You may possible wish to try designing and creating your own blog if you feel you have the time to do so .
If you find you are n't succeeding at it , then hire a professional .
What have you got to lose !
It is also important to subscribe to this blog because I offer ongoing tips on how to add " widgets " and plug ins on how to make money with your blog and stay consistent with it !
Secrets To Being Found on Google
There are lots of techniques and a bit of a science to getting your website found on Google .
I am going to do my best to explain some of the most simple and basic things to increase rankings .
If the information I have given you here does n't do the trick , it is best to hire a professional .
Hiring an SEO Company that knows what to do and NOT do will help you .
You must follow Google 's rules if you want to play in their " sand box " .
Getting your website to page one of Google is like hitting PAYDIRT , IF the search term you rank for is a term people other than yourself are searching for .
I have heard more times than I can tell you , " my website comes up on page 1 ! "
Yes it comes up on page one , but only when you type in some " long tail search term like " online printing companies located in Dublin , CA " .
I am willing to bet that my printing company PrinterBees would come up somewhere on page one for this term without any effort .
Just a hunch as it would be the most " relevant result " for that search .
" Long tail search terms " like stated wo n't help your cause , and you do n't want to focus on a search term you will never stand a chance of ranking for like " printing " or " mortgage " , which is very generic and highly competitive .
For my printing business , it would be crazy for us to think we could get the term " business cards " as a newer online business .
Because we print business cards for companies like Keller Williams , Century 21 , ACN , Herbalife , Mona.vie and specialize in real estate printing or real estate marketing these would be good terms to focus on and not as competitive .
While they do n't have the traffic and the search volume that a term like " business cards " would have , it will help us gain popularity when we rank and improve our Google Ranking which will in turn help us rank for more popular terms moving forward .
Because I really do want you to see that what I am explaining here really does work , I encourage you to " Google " the terms I have listed above so you can see that we really do rank on page one of those particular search terms .
At the time of writing this article , we are working on other terms to improve our rankings .
Those terms are " bookmark printing " , " print bookmarks " , " online printing ' , " business card printing " , " door hanger printing " , color flyer printing " , " hang tag printing " , " save the date magnets " and a few others that I can't think of at the moment .
Feel free anytime to check our progress , I feel the best way to teach is to lead by example .
A few words about Google and why Google matters so much to your success on the Internet .
Think of Google as a librarian , a really busy librarian !
This particular librarian sends you business .... lots of business and you are n't even required to pay a fee for all the business the librarian sends you !
It is all FREE !!!!
( Yes , you can do pay per click , but why when you get traffic for FREE )
We all use Google because we can pretty much always find what we are looking for when we " google " something , right ?
Would you keep using Google if every time you went to search for something , you did n't find what you were looking for ?
Not a chance !
So , if Google wants us to keep coming back , and they do ... they have to consistently give us good and relative results or we will find a new " internet librarian " to help us .
The only way that Google can continue to give " googlers " accurate search results is if we , as website owners / webmasters do a good job of communicating to Google exactly what our websites are about and help Google to understand what categories our websites should be filed under .
If Google is n't clear where your website should be indexed , it is most likely just sitting out there in cyberspace not accomplishing anything for you other than being printed on your business cards , fliers , banners , postcards or other printed materials you use to market your business .
Your marketing efforts in this day and age should include some sort of Internet marketing plan and if it does n't , you will be eventually left behind , sorry to say that , but it is true .
The Internet has well over 2 BILLION searches done on it every month and if you think your services or business offerings are n't being searched , you are definitely still living in the early 1990's .
This video produced by Google in late 2008 helps to explain how to " speak Google " , get ranked on Google and more importantly how NOT to spam the search engines and lower your rankings .
Google wants you to succeed and they will give you very specific instructions if you just listen to what they have to say and more importantly FOLLOW THE RULES .
Lesson one :
GET A BLOG !!!
I know I sound like a broken record , but I would n't keep mentioning it if it were n't so important .
Lesson Two :
Blog !
Your blog will do you absolutely no good , if you do n't actually blog on it .
If you do n't feel it is something you can keep up with , hire someone to blog for you .
Blogging is really what will help your rankings and is the fastest and easiest way to accomplish " getting found on Google " .
One of the things that Google " spiders ' ' look for as they crawl the Internet is new / fresh content .
Blogging = new and fresh that is also the most current .
Lesson Three :
When you blog , make sure that you use the keywords you wish to rank for in your blog AND that they link either to a page on your blog / website or to another blog post to create internal links in your website .
This is also called " deep linking "
Getting Indexed on Google Lesson Four :
Use the social media networks like YouTube , FaceBook and Twitter to name a few .
You also will want to create your own YouTube channel and make sure to name your videos according to the key words you want to be found on .
I encourage you do to " podcasts " and post them on YouTube to create links to your site .
A great product for doing video pod casting is the " flip " hi definition digital video recorder .
It is about the size of a deck of cards , does great videos and comes with software that allows you to upload straight to YouTube .
What could be easier .
Using the social media networks creates links to your site .
An example of some of the social networks which should be on your radar are listed below this article .
Clicking on them will also allow you to bookmark this article which will help other people find it .
Getting Indexed on Google Lesson Five :
Mixed media -
What the heck is " mixed media " ?
Mixed media is the use of text , images , video and sound and your blog .
Your blog is the perfect place for mixed media type content .
One of the most important things to remember with your images or anything media related is to NAME THEM PROPERLY .
This is so important , so I will say it again ... NAME YOUR MEDIA FILES PROPERLY .
You are probably asking ... how do I name them properly ?
First let 's examine what NOT to do .
If the images in your website have names like " banner1.jpg " how does this help Google know what your website is about ?
Files not named properly tell Google a whole lot of nothing !
What if you named your images like we do on Printerbees .
On our " business card printing page " , the images have names like " business -card-printing.jpg " or " color- business - card- printing.jpg " .
When Google comes across these images , what do the file names tell Google about our website ?
It helps Google to know we are in the business card printing business .
One of the simple things often forgotten and overlooked is the use of " alternative text " also knows as " alt tags " , these tags that are always an option when you add in an image to your website or blog .
The " alt text " tags help people who are reading websites without downloading graphic images like on cell phones or donâ€˜t automatically download images know what the images are .
Using alt tags also gives
Google one more clue of where to index your site !
Every clue you give Google helps your cause .
Lesson Six :
Naming your pages :
How you choose to name your HTML web page files and blog posts is very important .
Every clue you can offer Google helps " your cause " .
For your Word Press blog , make sure take advantage of your ability to use the " permalink " editing option , right below where you title your article to make sure it matches your content OR gives Google the proper hints about what you website or blog is .
For your HTML pages , use all lower case letters to name your pages AND used a " - " between any words .
I have had make many repairs to the names of my own files from making this mistake many times .
Remember , always in lower case AND no spaces in your files name , always dashes .
Same goes for naming your images or anything else which will find its way to the Internet on your website .
Lesson seven :
Proper tagging :
When creating your website or blog , it is important to have proper " title tags " , ." meta description tags " , " meta key word tags " , and " Robot .
Tags " .
I know it sounds overwhelming , but with blogging it is super easy and very helpful if you wish to rank .
Again , it gives
Google the clues it needs to know where to " index " you .
This is what they all mean :
" Title Tags " -
The title of the page within the site or blog .
Make your title tags relative using the information above .
It is also what shows up as the title of your page or site on the search engine listing .
While putting your company name may seem important , you may consider leaving it out if it wo n't encourage someone to " click " .
" meta description tag " - This is a SHORT , did I mention " short " description of what the web page is about and should include your keywords .
If you make your description too long , it could end up counting against you ( I will explain this part in future lesions ) , so use your words wisely and this can end up being the description that shows under the page title in the Google search results so it should also be a good " heading " that captures the persons attention who is reading it when they find your site in the Google Index .
Also , make sure it includes your most important keywords .
" meta key words tags " - this is a list of words that best describe the subject of your website to the search engine .
The list should not be too long .
Did you hear me ???
The list should NOT include too many words .
Keep your code clean and precise , it works in your favor .
" Robot tags " - Your robot tags tell the search engine if the search engine spiders should crawl the page or NOT crawl a particular page .
You are probably asking yourself why you would have Google NOT crawl one of your pages .
Well , the answer is simple , the fast Google can crawl your site , the relevant pages of your site , the better .
There is no reason to have Google " follow " your companies " Contact Us " page for instance .
That particular page most likely has nothing on it that will improve your chance with Google , so why have the spiders crawl that page .
You want them in and out as past as possible .
To have the spiders crawl the page , use the word " follow " , to keep the spiders from crawling a page , use the tag " no follow " .
You will see this option in Word Press , for HTML pages , you need to manually add them in .
When it comes to getting found on Google , on of the most important step is submitting a site map to Google .
In order for Google to know your blog is up and ready for business , you must invite the spiders to " crawl on by " by submitting a site map .
Your site map tells
Google what pages are on your site and gives the spiders a " map " of where to crawl .
A site map also helps the spiders crawl your site fast , fast is important !
I personally use Google XML Sitemap .
I found it easy to install and set up , and I like it because it is automated .
This handy little " widget " keeps Google updated on new posts , pages , etc .
This site was being indexed on Google in just a week after submitting my site map via the plugin Google XML .
Though your site may not be " ranking " , you can find out if Google even knows your site / blog exists by typing your blog URL blog address in the Google search bar .
The Contact Form 7 plugin is also a great tool I have implemented on my own site so I can easily be contacted or asked questions on blogging , search engines , Google , etc .
I found it very easy to add in to the site .
Adding a plugin for people to bookmark your articles on sites like " Delicious " , share them via email or " digg " them on the " Digg " social network is very important .
Adding this sort of plugin to your blog site will help spread the word .
It is really important to getting found on Google because it creates links in to your site .
These are just a few on this great list of 20 I have tried myself and encourage you to check out the list .
It is a great list and any of these plugin's can be installed right from the " Add New " menu item under the Appearance section of your side menu .
Time Saving Tips for Blogging and Affiliate Marketing
RoboForm - I use Roboform all day , every day and it saves me so0 much time and frustration !
With RoboForm , I am able to keep track of all my passwords , website links , affiliate sites I belong to and so much more .
I keep all of my information on a flash drive that is with me at all times .
I also keep a back up of it in my Drop Box in the event I loose my drive and then I always have access to my website addresses , log ins and passwords from anywhere in the world .
Drop Box -
Can
I tell you how many times I have been saved by my faithful dropbox , which costs me all of about $ 9 / mo ?
Dropbox keeps a copy of files on your hard drive out on the Internet and available from anywhere in the world !
At a seminar yesterday , we needed a Power Point Presentation that was n't with us badly .
No Problem !
Pulled up Drop Box , opened the file and was editing it within about 1 minute .
If my hard drive were to crash , while it would SUCK big time ... I would n't have the stress of having lost all of my data , because there is an exact copy of it out on the Internet in my Drop Box account .
I also love that it is fully automated !
A spreadsheet - if you do n't have Roboform -
If you get tired of logging in to my affiliate sites to get the same link codes over and over , keep them in a spreadsheet , and make sure to save it in your Drop Box .
I personally use the " safe notes " feature in Roboform , because my Roboform is always up and then I do n't have to keep opening files .
When I get a new link code that I know I will want to use again , I copy and paste it in to my Roboform .
All the links are all in one place and I just copy and paste from there .
My recommendation would be to use Microsoft Works , because every windows machine comes with it and you can open it anywhere , even when using a computer that does n't have MS Office .
Make sure to note the expiration dates of any of your link codes so you can update them when necessary .
Artisteer - Generate Your Own Word Press themes in Artisteer .
I have mentioned this blogging tool several times because I use it so frequently .
I can create a custom theme in less than 5 minutes if I am in a hurry .
I can also get really creative and spend as much time as needed to get it just perfect .
You need absolutely NO PREVIOUS DESIGN EXPERIENCE to use this tool and it is super user friendly and easy to learn .
I have created videos to help you learn even faster .
Quick Press -
Have you read a great article or had a great thought , but did n't have the time to write a complete blog ?
I use the Quickpress feature in Word Press to make notes to myself about blogs I want to write .
I write some notes , save it as a draft and come back it to later so I do n't loose my thought or idea .
If it is going to be a good blog post , it will still be a good blog post two days later !
I wrote this particular blog post as a draft that I came back to later when I had the time to complete my thoughts on it .
Ring Central Phone and Fax - Ring Central is a time saver for bloggers or any small business owner .
This is the service that we use for PrinterBees that makes it " appear " we are in an office location vs. working from a home office .
You have the ability to create extensions for different departments that can all ring to one number , you can accept all of your faxes through Ring Central , to the same number .
All faxes come in through your email and they come through on a PDF so you do n't even have to worry about misplacing pieces of paper and they are very easy to forward to the person who needs to deal with it .
Mob Software : The Erotic Life of Code
An Essay in First Person by
Richard P. Gabriel & Ron Goldman
Let ’s rock !
I ’ve got good news :
That way of hacking you like is going to come back in style .
Over the years I ’ve despaired that the ways we ’ve created to build software matches less and less well the ways that people work effectively .
More so , I ’ve grown saddened that we ’re not building the range of software that we could be , that the full expanse of what computing could do to enhance human life , to foster our creativity and mental and physical comfort , to liberate us from isolation from knowledge , art , literature , and human contact is left out of our vision .
It seems that high - octane capitalism has acted like an acid or a high heat to curdle and coagulate our ways of building software into islands that limit us .
But like survivors , we ’ve managed to make these islands homes .
We ’ve found the succulent but bitter fruit that can sustain us , the small encrusted or overfurred creatures we can eat to survive , the slow - moving and muddy streams from which we drink against the urge to spit it out .
Being survivors , we can make do with little .
But how little like life is such an existence .
So gloomy .
Bitter and depressing .
Deeply conflicted .
The way out requires just one thing from us a strange , frightful thing something slant .
It is this : Find a way to fight our fear of death .
First , though , the gloom .
Feel it .
Maybe there are n’t too many in this audience old enough to recall the early attempts at putting capsules and rockets into space .
What most people remember are the many successful launches in the 1960s and ’ 70s where astronauts first were launched into space but not into orbit ; then there was a series of orbital flights , then forays near the moon , then a moon landing , and finally the boringly routine trips gathering rocks and dust , playing golf and goofing off .
This is the way to do engineering , many say .
Large teams superbly coordinated producing success after success .
Software should be like this , they say .
But these folks do n’t remember these other scenes :
One rocket lifted up about a dozen feet , fell over , then accelerated horizontally toward a launch building ; another lifted up a few hundred feet and started spinning in a Yeatsian gyre before being blown up remotely ; others simply exploded somewhere in the sky .
Once I viewed an unnarrated series of these explosions , one after another in nothing less than a ballet of destruction and failure .
NASA began operation on the first of October , 1958 .
Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space on the fifth of May , 1961 , launched on the tip of a Redstone rocket .
On the twenty - first of July , 1961 , Gus Grissom became the second American in space , also launched by a Redstone rocket .
And on the twentieth of February , 1962 , John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth , launched by an Atlas rocket .
Up until Alan Shepard ’s launch into space , the Redstone rocket had experienced failures including launchpad and downrange explosions 23 times the last failure was 2 months before Shepard ’s flight .
My favorite failure took place on the twenty - first of November , 1960 , when the Redstone ’s engines shut off 1 second after ignition :
The rocket lifted off a couple of centimeters , and then sat down with no significant damage .
Between Alan Shepard ’s flight and Gus Grissom ’s , there was a Redstone failure .
Atlas rockets experienced 36 failures before John Glenn ’s flight one occurred the day after Glenn went into orbit .
We like to think we can simply imitate a mature engineering practice and get the same results .
As if a Little League baseball team could watch the New York Yankees and say , " hey , let ’s just imitate them we ’ll win all the time ! "
But success requires fundamentals , and we do n’t have them .
The highlights of NASA ’s history represent a false view of even a mature engineering practice .
The early days of major American rocketry were filled with failures , some of them disasters .
To get to the moon , we needed crashes and endless fiddling .
Why do we think that software practice , still in its infancy , can do better ?
Software is full of failure , and will be until we can learn how truly to build it .
Fear of failure is fear of death .
In fear of failure , we seek order .
The Mob Introduced
The Oxford English Dictionary defines " mob " this way , among others :
A multitude or aggregation of persons regarded as not individually important .
 Oxford English Dictionary , Second Edition , definition 4a , part 2
Let me say it plainly :
We know how to produce small portions of software using small development teamsup to 10 or so but we do n’t know how to make software any larger except by accident or by rough trial and error .
Because the software we ’re trying to build is too massive it is simply too difficult to plan it all out , and we have no idea how to coordinate the number of people it takes .
Every piece of software built requires tremendous attention to detail and endless fiddling to get right .
In response to this problem we have clung to fads : structured and object - oriented programming , UML , software patterns , and eXtreme Programming .
We grasp for mathematics or engineering to come to our rescueperhaps even the law :
By requiring licenses for our developers maybe we can force improvement in software making .
It just wo n’t happen it ’s like those rockets :
We simply do not know how to get massive software off the ground without crashing and endless fiddling .
But we do n’t accept that .
The way out of this predicament is this simple :
Set up a fairly clear architectural direction , produce a decent first cut at some of the functionality , let loose the source code , and then turn it over to a mob .
The Commerce of the Creative Spirit
Ever compare poetry to newspaper articles ?
Maybe poetry is n’t for everyone , but everyone can see there is a difference in quality , in beauty , in its appeal to humanity .
One is daily news ; the other is " news that stays news " ( Ezra Pound , " ABC of Reading " ) .
Poetry is constructed , is it not ?
In fact , are n’t all creative acts the result of deliberately envisioned , carefully planned work by single individuals ?
This passage by the poet and playwright Harold Pinter is typical of how poets envision :
The thing germinated and bred itself .
It proceeded according to its own logic .
What did I do ?
I followed the indications .
I kept a sharp eye on the clues I found myself dropping .
The writing arranged itself with no trouble into dramatic terms .
The characters sounded in my earsit was apparent to me what one would say and what would be the other ’s response , at any given point .
It was apparent to me what they would not , ever , say , whatever one might wish ....
When the thing was well cooked I began to form certain conclusions .
The point is , however , that by that time the play was now its own world .
It was determined by its own engendering image .
" The Gift , " page 144
... created by the single individual ?
Writers learn by workshopping .
Every night across the country , writers sit in groups of 3 to 20 , reading and critiquing each other ’s work .
Not only are these professional writers but amateurs who simply want to improve their diaries .
Steven Levy said this in " Hackers " :
Years earlier , Buckminster Fuller had developed the concept of synergy the collective power , more than the sum of the parts , that comes of people and / or phenomena working together in a system and Homebrew [ a Bay Area computer club in the 1970s ] was a textbook example of the concept at work .
One person ’s idea would spark another person into embarking on a large project , and perhaps beginning a company to make a product based on the idea .
Or , if someone came up with a clever hack to produce a random number generator on the Altair , he would give out the code so everyone could do it , and by the next meeting someone else would have devised a game that utilized the routine .
" Hackers , " Steven Levy , page 218
... built as the result of detailed plans ?
Christopher Alexander said this :
Let us start by seeing how the great cathedrals , Chartres and Notre Dame , were made within a pattern language ....
There were hundreds of people , each making his part within the whole , working , often for generations .
At any given moment there was usually one master builder , who directed the overall layout ... but each person in the whole had , in his mind , the same overall language .
Each person executed each detail in the same general way , but with minor differences .
The master builder did not need to force the design of the details down the builders ’ throats , because the builders themselves knew enough of the shared pattern language to make the details correctly , with their own individual flair ....
We imagine , because of the distorted view of architecture we have learnt , that some great architect created these buildings , with a few marks of the pencil , worked out laboriously at the drawing board .
The fact is that Chartres , no less than the simple farmhouse , was built by a group of men , acting within a common pattern language , deeply steeped in it of course .
It was not made by " design " at the drawing board .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " page 216
... but software is different , right ?
Donald Eastlake said this in 1972 about the creation of the Incompatible Timesharing System at MIT :
The ITS system is not the result of a human wave or crash effort .
The system has been incrementally developed almost continuously since its inception .
It is indeed true that large systems are never " finished " ....
In general , the ITS system can be said to have been designer implemented and user designed .
The problem of unrealistic software design is greatly diminished when the designer is the implementor .
The implementors ’ ease in programming and pride in the result is increased when he , in an essential sense , is the designer .
Features are less likely to turn out to be of low utility if users are their designers and they are less likely to be difficult to use if their designers are their users .
 Donald Eastlake , 1972 , quoted in " Hackers , " page 127
The Swarm
In " The Lives of a Cell , " Lewis Thomas wrote about termites building arches :
Termites are even more extraordinary in the way they seem to accumulate intelligence as they gather together .
Two or three termites in a chamber will begin to pick up pellets and move them from place to place , but nothing comes of it ; nothing is built .
As more join in , they seem to reach a critical mass , a quorum , and the thinking begins .
They place pellets atop pellets , then throw up columns and beautiful , curving , symmetrical arches , and the crystalline architecture of vaulted chambers is created .
It is not known how they communicate with each other , how the chains of termites building one column know when to turn toward the crew of the adjacent column , or how , when the time comes , they manage the flawless joining of the arches .
The stimuli that set them off at the outset , building collectively instead of shifting things about , may be pheromones released when they reach committee size .
They react as if alarmed .
They become agitated , excited , and then they begin working like artists .
" The Lives of a Cell , " Lewis Thomas , ( New York : Viking . 99 1974 ) , p. 13 .
One of the remarkable discoveries of recent times is that complex behavior by a group of individuals requires only that each individual follow simple rules , and the collective behavior of the group can display facets and filigrees nowhere apparent in those rules .
Here are three simple rules :
Each individual shall steer toward the average position of its neighbors .
Each individual shall adjust its speed to match its neighbors .
Each individual shall endeavor to not bump into anything .
With a group of individuals each following these rules , we observe the simple but beautiful and graceful flocking patterns of birds and schools of fish .
Simulation is the main tool of complexity investigation .
One of the better known simulations is " Sugarscape , " which became noted over the past 5 years by revealing that complex societal behavior could emerge from a small number of individual behavioral rules alongside simple genetic characteristics .
This is the setup : a simple 2 - dimensional grid , a population of individuals initially spread randomly over the squares .
Each square can be occupied by only one individual .
Some squares contain sugar , which the individual can collect and consume .
In the initial setup , an individual can move and see a certain distance .
Movement costs energy regulated by metabolism .
An individual scans the horizon for sugar and goes to the square with the most of it while avoiding squares with other individuals .
Individuals can hoard sugar .
Each cell in the grid has a sugar capacity , and sugar can " grow back " at some rate after it is harvested .
If we place two large piles of sugar in the grid , the population splits in two and feeds as if each pile were covered by a swarm of ants .
If we introduce seasons during which the density of sugar moves according to time , we ’ll see the population migratesimply as a result of the simple rules and their interaction through individuals with the environment .
Of course , because not all individuals are the same they are created with a distribution of traits such as metabolism rate , visual acuity , and collection capacity some fare less well than others .
Some become fat and live forever ; others starve , having been born in sugarfree badlands .
The next step is to add some simple mechanisms for evolution and social networking : mating and genetic exchange , meme exchange , actor status , affinity for similar agents , repulsion from different ones , and conforming .
Each of these is expressed as simple , local rules .
The general principle for complexity design is this :
Think locally , act locally .
When inheritance is added the ability of a parent to pass on its sugar hoard to offspring visual acuity decreases and the gap between the rich and the poor widens dramatically .
Cultural transmission and diffusion behaviors emerge .
By creating varieties of sugar , economic behavior can be studied .
Fads , norms , and fashions emerge .
Isolated areas become closed societies .
Adding combat - related rules creates wars and power struggles .
Is this eerie ?
Silly ?
Important research ?
Or just so - what ?
Such phenomena point to an interesting locale in complex systems the border between order and chaos .
Chaos is unpredictability : Combinations that might have lasting value or interest do n’t last the energy for change is too high .
Order is total predictability :
The only combinations that exist are the ones that always have the energy for stability is too high .
Stuart Kauffman , formerly of the Santa Fe Institute , wrote :
It is a lovely hypothesis , with considerable supporting data , that genomic systems lie in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos .
Were such systems too deeply into the frozen ordered regime , they would be too rigid to coordinate the complex sequences of genetic activities necessary for development .
Were they too far into the gaseous chaotic regime , they would not be orderly enough .
 " At Home in the Universe , " page 26
and
... cell networks achieve both stability and flexibility ... by achieving a kind of poised state balanced on the edge of chaos .
 " At Home in the Universe , " page 86
Between order and chaos , interesting and unexpected combinations come about and last long enough to have repercussions .
Trends can be observed .
Patterns emerge .
The connection to poetry is remarkable :
One way to look at poetry is that release the wild imagination of Whitman and Garcia Lorcais reined in by restraint : requirements of form , grammar , sentence - making , echoes , rhyme , rhythm .
Without release there could be nothing worth reading ; the erotic pleasure of pure meandering would be unapproached .
Without restraint there cannot be sense enough to make the journey worth taking .
Poetry is at the margins of understanding , in the fractures of our reality , in the space between order and chaos .
Listen for a minute to Federico Garcia Lorca at the end of the poem " Scream to Rome , " written in New York around 1930 :
Meanwhile , meanwhile , oh ! , meanwhile ,
the blacks that take out the spittoons ,
the boys that tremble beneath the pale terror of the directors ,
the women drowned in mineral oils ,
the crowd of hammer , violin , or cloud ,
will scream although their brains may blow out on the wall ,
will scream in front of the domes ,
will scream maddened by fire ,
will scream maddened by snow ,
will scream with their heads full of excrement ,
will scream like all the nights together ,
will scream with a voice so torn
that the cities tremble like little girls
and the cities of oil and music break ,
because we want our daily bread ,
flower of the alder and threshed tenderness ,
because we want to be fulfilled the will of the Earth
that gives its fruits for all .
This is a poem of duendeneither angel who dazzles but hovers above nor muse who whispers and dictates .
Duende is a force that dares us when we empty ourselves , approach ourselves to see truly ; taunts us into being serious ; battles order .
All that has black sounds has duende .
Garcia Lorca says :
The duende ... is a power , not a work .
It is a struggle , not a thought .
I have heard an old maestro of the guitar say , " the duende is not in the throat ; the duende climbs up through the soles of the feet . "
Meaning this :
It is not a question of ability , but of true , living style , of blood , of the most ancient culture , of spontaneous creation .
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 49
Garcia Lorca says the duende
will not approach at all if he does not see the possibility of death
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 162
and
we only know that he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass , that he exhausts , that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned , that he smashes style .
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 51
Fear of failure is the fear of death , the fear of duende .
Christopher Alexander said ,
All of the Japanese arts recognize that , finally , you have to meet the fear of death in order to do anything landscape painting , flower arrangements , and so on .
" Christopher Alexander : The Search for a New Paradigm in Architecture , " Stephen Grabow , page 86
Allen Ginsberg said that to be a poet you must abandon fear of failure by
... abandoning the glory of poetry and just settling down in the muck of your own mind ...
" The Gift , " page 145
When you do this when you do battle with the duende you might find a gift , a gift of talent or insight that will make you think , " Did I say that ? "  " Did I do that ? "
Gifts like this are worth cultivating , even in the software world .
Lewis
Hyde wrote this in " The Gift " :
So long as the gift is not withheld , the creative spirit will remain a stranger to the economics of scarcity .
Salmon , forest birds , poetry , symphonies , or Kula shells , the gift is not used up in use .
" The Gift , " page 146
Duende , poetry , and perhaps life itself and life in our works of artifice are denizens of the boundary between order and chaos .
When we look too deeply into chaos for inspiration , we find only nonsense ; when we look too deeply into order for completion and closure , we find only the botfly of boredom and the disease he carries : failure and deathlike morphology .
Such an interesting place is the border between order and chaos that
Dee Hock coined a word for it : chaord .
His work from the mid-1960s has focused on how to replace outworn hierarchical , command - and - control organizations and what to replace them with .
Command - and - control systems are based on the need for control , predictability , and order , things that Stuart Kauffman says have no real place in biologically based systems .
What is needed is the vigor at the border of chaos and order .
Dee Hock reasoned that if organizations based on biological principles were to replace traditional command - and - control systems , then the basis for the self - organization and emergent behavior of a group of people would have to be the same as what forms the similar basis in life : a genetic code .
In the Sugarscape simulation the genetic code is represented by local rules of behavior .
A rule of behavior is like a principle .
If a group shares the same principles ( Dee Hock figured ) then they would be able to work in emerging concert without the need for command and control .
But nothing can be built without a purpose , some idea of what to build .
Dee Hock was trying to construct a system that would accomplish the electronic exchange of value that is , money .
To build this , he needed to build an electronic infrastructure a network and accompanying software and an organizational infrastructure that would carry out the exchange of money the electronic transfers promised .
Because Dee Hock took seriously the motto , " think locally , act locally , " he intuited that the best organizational concept for such an undertaking would move decisions as close as possible to those who feel their effects .
The result was known as Visa International , and it still exists today , though not entirely in the same form .
Dee Hock ’s ideas should sound very familiar .
Building a cathedral is the shared purpose , and the builders from the master builder down to the most insignificant member of the mob engaged in its construction knew the elements :
Nave , aisles , transepts , the great rose window in the west end , and the chapels round the east end .
The builders shared a set of principles the common pattern language .
Alexander said :
But still the power and beauty of the great cathedrals came mainly from the language which the master builder and his builders shared .
The language was so coherent that anyone who understood the language well and devoted his whole life to the building of a single building , working at it slowly , piecemeal , shaping all the parts within the common pattern language , would be able to make a great work of art .
The building grew slowly , magnificently , from the impact of the common pattern language from which it was made , guiding its individual parts , and the acts which created them , just as the genes inside the flower ’s seed guide and then generate the flower .

The Changing Face of Software
Founding assumptions can echo for decades .
In software we have suffered especially from such echoes .
From the earliest days of software from the mid-1950s a particular view has prevailed of what software is and why it is created that now or soon will make doing our work intolerable .
Computing practice was first developed as a branch of computability theory based on a particularly inhospitable set of mathematical constructs : group and semi-group decidability , Thué and and other transformational systems , recursive function theory , lambda calculus , and Turing machines , to name some .
In mathematical terms , these constructs are equally expressive , universality being the touchstone of expressiveness .
With this set of blinders firmly in place , there is no difference between any of these models , and the same logic is applied with equal blindness to programming languages .
Early computing practices evolved under the assumption that the only uses for computers were military , scientific , and engineering computation along with a small need for building tools to support such activities .
We can characterize these computational loads as numeric , and the resulting computational requirements as Fortran - like .
Early attempts to expand the realm of computing such as John McCarthy ’s valiant attempt with Lisp and artificial intelligence , Kristen Nygaard ’s similarly pioneering attempt with Simula , Doug Englebart ’s intriguing attempt to expand our usage options , Alan Kay ’s later attempt with Smalltalk , and Alain Colmerauer ’s attempt with Prolog were rebuked .
The very architecture of almost every computer today is designed to optimize the performance of Fortran programs and its operating - system - level sister , C. Further , attempts to consider neuron - based , genetic , or other types of nonstandard computational models were soundly rejected , snubbed , and even ridiculed until the late 1980s .
Programming languages have hardly shown one scintilla of difference from the designs made in the first few years of computing .
All significant programming languages are expressively , conceptually , and aesthetically equivalent to Fortran and assembly language .
In fact , what it means to program is hopelessly outdated .
Early models persist .
In 1960 , one generally coded up a single program , linked its parts together in a monolithic , monochronic puddle of behavior and dataeverything brought together in one place at one time , everything made consistent by tools that ensure such consistency .
Software development methodologies evolved under this regime along with a mythical belief in master planning .
Such beliefs were rooted in an elementary - school - level fiction that great masterpieces were planned , or arose as a by - product of physicists shovelling menial and rote coding tasks to their inferiors in the computing department .
Master planning feeds off the desire for order , a desire born of our fear of failure , our fear of death .
How can we tolerate these indignities ?
The frustratingly simple answer is the universal nature of programming languages the fact that one can program in any one of them what can be programmed in any other .
We are able to clever our way out of any programming box .
The more difficult the task , the more pride we can take in the accomplishment .
We are loathe through either our natures or our upbringing to admit that the programming tasks we are called upon to do are too hard with available tools or that better tools would improve our lives .
We cannot easily see that we are boxed into a corner by the assumptions of our ancestors as correct as those assumptions were or seemed to be at the time .
The reality today of programming ’s needs are so far off from that early view that we really should be belly - laughing .
Until recently , the model of software creation and use held that programmers put together software behind closed doors and people used it only after copies had been distributed on floppy disks and CDs , or by downloading .
This view of software distribution is being overturned by the concept of performing software .
In this notion , software is created whichever way makes sense , but its only executing incarnation is on a single or a few machines connected to the Net , and its users connect to that machine or those machines to use it .
On the horizon is an obvious tipping point beyond which there is just one , immense distributed system made up of a large number of performing programs that interact with each other .
Such future distributed systems will have been built by vastly diverse , dispersed , and different - minded people and massive numbers of them .
Each such system will never go down , cannot be recompiled from scratch , and can never be in total version coherence .
Even in monolithic systems we find the same thing .
For every major operating system , there are people who absolutely demand and rationally require the newest backwardly incompatible features , and others who absolutely and rationally require the oldest features to remain as they are forever .
A simple example can be found in the Java ( tm ) language and Jini( tm ) Technology .
Jini is a simple distributed computing model based on the Java programming language .
Among other things , it was intended as a model for services small bits of functionality to discover each other dynamically and create a network of interoperating program parts .
These services could be housed within devices physically separate computing platforms as far as Jini is concerned .
Because such a model is new , the definition of each service is likely to require a maturation period , in which an initially immature service is defined and released , with perhaps numerous improvements subsequently being released .
Service definitions are specified by Java interfaces : API ’s , in other words .
The natural way for a community of service developers to work is to start with a provisional service definition and move through a series of improvements , culminating , perhaps , in a ratified service definition residing in the net .
jini package .
Jini quite cleverly handles this in some cases because the implementation of the service comes along with the device , but the Java interfaces may not match very well .
Perhaps they will not obey even the Java binary compatibility rules .
There are no mechanisms within Java to handle mismatched interfaces .
There are not even any mechanisms to migrate an interface from one package to another .
This is a problem of interface evolution and simple renaming .
If it ’s true that software systems must be living systems , our views on the static construction of programs need to be updated .
Indeed , there are some programming languages that can handle this form of interface evolution , modeled on similar mechanisms in the database world ( so - called schema evolution mechanisms ) , but these languages are not looked on favorably .
One of the languages that supports schema evolution for classes operates by allowing developers to specify repair code that scampers about when an unrepaired instance is found and repairs it .
Even though the designers of this system did n’t think of it this way , this is a clearly biological approach to the problem : a swarm of small repair agents fixing up code on the fly to make it work when the context of its operation has changed .
Every single programming language we have including Javais predicated on the physicists ’ model of figure it out , code it up , compile it , run it , throw it away .
All our computing education is based on this , all our methodologies , all our languages , environments , tools , attitudes , mathematics , prejudices , and principles are based as solidly and firmly on this rock as Gibraltar is based on the stone it rests on .
Many if not most development headaches come from precisely this model headaches that programming language theorists ridicule .
Every attempt to define a language to handle this or a computing device to make it simpler is met with laughter and rejection .
And all this in the face of the fact that the reality of programming must be based on precisely the opposite assumptions :
Everything changes , every version is necessary , evolution happens .
Resource Limits
The history of computing is rife with resource limitations to the extent that there was an attempt at a theory in the 1970s to explain intelligence and other human - level performances using " resource - limited computation . "
We have labored under three types of resource limitations :
Until the 1990s we did not routinely use computers with much more than a few dozen mips and 48 megabytes of RAM .
We typically run development projects undermanned by a factor of 2 or 3 and schedules about 50 % too short .
We typically underspend per unit time by a factor of 2 or 3 .
Because of this we ’ve managed to build only very small pieces of software , and even those are horribly error - ridden .
Because of the apparent need to constantly innovateor obsolete hardware and to renew ourselves creatively , and because development has been done primarily in a landscape riddled by many isolated islands of similar or identical activities , we have , over the last 40 50 years , written the same code over and over .
How many versions of Unix do we need ?
Do we really need the few dozen that we have ?
How about a text editor more advanced than Emacs ?
Are Word , Excel , and Powerpoint really the best possible programs in those categories ?
We ’ve built these programs many times , and we do n’t get particularly better at them .
We have gotten OK at building cathedralsonly we are building the same dozen or so over and over again .
Our patterns are too limited and focused on efficiency , our vision outworn ; sources of new language have dried up , and it ’s as if we are caught in a delirium of mere rephrasings .
However , the commercial software community has developed one particular response to resource limitation : a fevered , workaholic approach to software development error prone , hectic , family - destroying , health - degrading , night - haunting .
If you are undermanned by a factor of 2 , add a second 8 - hour workday per physical day .
If you are operating under a schedule 50 % too short , add in another 32 hours per week by working weekends .
Then pray for luck or push back on features and quality .
Scarcity breeds a commodity or exchange economy .
Until almost 1980 , there were essentially no markets for software .
Before 1980 , most computers were owned by companies and used for " large tasks . "
When computers were commoditized , the resource limitations inherent in software development became an opportunity for exploitation , and any relief to those limitations meant less wealth to go around .
Draw your own conclusions .
Order and Modular Parts
Programming language designers made one important breakthrough in being able to program effectively given insane resource limitations : the modular partcall it subroutine , procedure , function , method , or class .
The idea has two parts :
Create a piece of code that performs some computation .
Create a way to run the code in several contexts .
The first of these is the code that will be used over and over .
Typically , what this code does depends on the local context .
The second of these serves two purposes :
One is to provide a way to inform the modular part about the local context ; and the other is to provide a sort of description of the modular part this is conveyed primarily by the modular part ’s name , but its arguments can sometimes provide additional descriptions , particularly for methods .
Modular parts seem like the ideal of order : Construction is uniform , expectations are identical , fear is quashed , calm reigns because things rarely change in a fixed landscape .
As I implied before :
Why are we continually writing the same software over and over ?
The Ariane 5 disaster says a lot about software development recall , it was the European Space Agency rocket that self - destructed after its engine nozzles all swiveled into an extreme position , causing the rocket to veer abruptly , rupturing the links between the booster and the core stage , which caused the rocket to self - destruct .
The failure has been analyzed thoroughly by both the ESA and software professionals , with most of the discussion focusing on uncaught exceptions , best - effort results , and the foolishness of simply shutting down a system as a reasonable approach to failure .
But the failure was caused by software adopted without adaptation from the Ariane 4 .
The decision was made to reuse the code by Ariane 5 software developers and designers who had too much confidence in code that had proved successful many times in the past .
I quote from the report concerning a special feature which continued to run a calibration routine 50 seconds into the flight :
The same requirement does not apply to Ariane 5 , which has a different preparation sequence , and it was maintained for commonality reasons , presumably based on the view that , unless proven necessary , it was not wise to make changes in software which worked well on Ariane 4 .
 Paris , 19 July 1996 " ARIANE 5 : Flight 501 Failure Report by the Inquiry Board , " The Chairman of the Board : Prof. J. L. LIONS
The failure , therefore , had something to do with the use of modular parts : failing to look specifically at the requirements for the new system and assuming that a similar module for a different system which was well - tested under real conditions should be trusted unless proven otherwise .
If we look at ourselves literally as systems we notice soon enough that although we are each made of very similar parts , we are not made of modular parts .
Arms look like modular parts , but they are n’t .
Each is custom grown for the person who hosts it .
Within each person ’s genetic code is the knowledge of how to grow an arm in place , custom fit to the body being created concurrently .
Moreover , we already seem to know this in some aspects of mainstream programming .
A database may seem like a modular part , but it is n’t .
A database is created by taking off - the - shelf genetic coding in the form of a database system .
Then we reckon up schemata defining how the data will be laid out , and we add data to made a database .
Let ’s listen to Christopher Alexander on the topic of modular parts :
The details of a building cannot be made alive when they are made from modular parts ....
And for the same reason , the details of a building cannot be made alive when they are drawn at a drawing board .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " pp. 460461
Modular parts :
Maybe they are n’t so wonderful .
The real problem with modular parts is that we took a good ideamodularity and mixed it up with reuse .
Modularity is about separation :
When we worry about a small set of related things , we locate them in the same place .
This is how thousands of programmers can work on the same source code and make progress .
We get in trouble when we try to use that small set of related things in lots of places without preparing or repairing them .
Who Can Be Programmers ?
Computing practice and theory is based on the very hidden and hard - to - reveal assumption that engineers , mathematicians , and computer scientists are the only ones who will write a program or contribute to a software system .
When the computing age began , no one but scientists and the military even remotely conceived of the utility of programs and programming .
Today , almost every business and human pursuit is built on computing and digital technology .
Artists , craftspeople , writers , fishermen , farmers , tightrope walkers , bankers , children , carpenters , singers , dentists , and animals depend on computing , and most of the people I mentioned want to have a say in how such software works , looks , and behaves .
Many of them would program if it were possible .
The current situation might feel fine to some of you , but suppose all computing were based on the needs of tightrope walkers ?
Hard to imagine ?
What we ’ve created was hard for them to imagine .
Literature of Code and Teaching
Fast - lane capitalism has created a nightmare scenario in which it is literally impossible to teach and develop extraordinary software designers , architects , and builders .
The effect of ownership imperatives has caused there to be no body of software as literature .
It is as if all writers had their own private companies and only people in the Melville company could read " Moby - Dick " and only those in Hemingway ’s could read " The Sun Also Rises . "
Can you imagine developing a rich literature under these circumstances ?
Under such conditions , there could be neither a curriculum in literature nor a way of teaching writing .
And we expect people to learn to program in this exact context ?
When software became merchandise , the opportunity vanished of teaching software development as a craft and as artistry .
The literature became frozen .
It ’s extremely rare today to stumble across someone who is familiar with the same source code as you are .
If all remnants of literature disappeared , you ’d expect that eventually all respect for it as an art form , as a craft , as an activity worthy of human attention would disappear .
And so we ’ve seen with software :
The focus is on architecture , specifications , design documents , and graphical design languages .
Code as code is looked down on :
The lowest rank in the software development chain is " coder " right alongside QA drone and doc writer .
We find little or no code education .
Typically a student will write a few dozen small programs over the course of an undergraduate education , and perhaps he or she will work on a larger programsuch as a compiler with a small group of students .
At that point , the student is ready to become a professional programmer .
Little or no mentoring is done after that , and if the student becomes a proficient programmer , it is due to luck and hard work , in that order .
Birth of Mob Software
A few years ago , the open source community posed a significant question a question which has been drowned out in debates over licensing and the politics of open source .
The question was :
What if what once was scarce is now abundant ?
Hidden in the premises of open source is the belief that perhaps it ’s acceptable to waste programmer time .
Moreover , there are no time limits to open - source projects .
With lots of people looking at the source code , it ’s easy to see how the quality of the resulting code could be a little higher .
And with hackers always desperate to prove themselves wizards , it ’s easy to see how " customer support " could be a little better .
Because the open source proposition asked the crucial first question , I include it in what I am calling " mob software , " but mob software goes way beyond what open source is up to today .
What I ’m talking about is the kind of swarming activity we see exhibited by social insects , a kind of semi-chaotic self - organizing behavior in which numerous small acts of repair with a common goal in mind can lead to quickly built , complex , and massive creations .
Mob software is different it explores the space of possibilities .
It includes users during design .
It is highly incremental , focusing on repair rather than master planning .
Mob software takes coding out of the closet and makes code literature .
It is based on gifts .
Mob artifacts include massive software , built by the multitudes .
It never goes down , it is never totally stable but is stable in the aggregate .
It is flexible in the extreme .
Anyone can add to it .
Mob - software artifacts adapt , evolve almost .
It is living while all the software we have now almost all of it is dead - dead - dead .
Mob software is the technical software community finally coming to grips with the duende .
Open source is only some of these things , but it provides our first view into mob software , so let ’s talk about open source for a moment .
By now we know about quite a few mostly successful open - sourceor baby mob software projects : Linux which has won a number of awards for customer support and artistry Mozilla , Jikes , Emacs , GCC , Apache , Perl , Python , sendmail , and BSD .
The Early History of Open Source
Sadly ?
Happily ?
Oddly ?
well , open source and the mob approach is just not a new idea .
A great deal of software development before the 1980s took place in conditions similar to those propounded by the open source folks .
If your organization owned a computer , you had a copy of the source code for many of its systems .
Back in the 1960s and ’ 70s , PhD dissertations in computer science and especially in artificial intelligence contained the source code for the program described in the dissertation .
In 1962 , the Lisp 1.5 Programmer ’s Manual contained the mysterious , almost gnostic , Lisp code that implemented Lisp .
Though mostly obvious to mathematicians , this Lisp in Lisp took several decades for computer practitioners to get their heads around .
Throughout the 1960s and ’ 70s , and even into the 1980s , it was relatively common to exchange source code .
The nascent Internet called at the time , the Arpanet was created in order to make computing facilities available to researchers around the world , and to exchange files including source code .
One of the first net - based " open source " projects was Maclispa PDP - 10  based simple Lisp that became one of the dominant Lisp dialects in the 1970s .
Originally developed at MIT under ITS , it was ported to several other popular PDP - 10 operating systems by a group of about 10 volunteers who donated their time and worked on the code partly at their own locations and partly over the Arpanet .
Developers who earned the respect of the principal maintainers of Maclisp at MIT were given the authority to edit the sources on MIT ’s computers and to build Maclisp there .
Similar activities took place : Languages , environments , planning systems , natural - language understanding systems , game - playing programs , games , text editors , compilers , graphics programs , window systems , typesetting systems just about anything you can think of was written this way , though on a smaller scale because there were hundreds of computers on the Arpanet , not the nearly 100 million we have on the Internet today .
In the 1980s , it became apparent there was money to be made by writing and selling software , and that a premium might be had for being clever about it .
Although software patents were first tried about 10 years earlier , they became increasingly popular during the 1980s until the 1990s , when the intellectual property grab came to resemble the Oklahoma land rush .
At that point , except for academic projects and the activities of the Free Software Foundation under the eclectic oversight of Richard Stallman , software source code essentially disappeared .
The Dictionary
Mob development the creation of software by a loosely coupled group of volunteers seems a thoroughly contemporary phenomenon , based on the free outlook of the 1960s , a kind of fallout of free love and hippiedom I mean , just look at the proponents of this approach : anti-establishment Marxists who believe in free software , who call themselves " hackers " ; people with scruffy hair , who do n’t exactly work for a living , people who attend Star Trek conventions and think science fiction is both high literature and true science .
However , the idea is a bit older .
On Guy Fawkes Day , 1857 , Richard Chenevix Trench , addressing the Philological Society , proposed to produce a new , complete English dictionary based on finding the earliest occurrences of each of the English words ever in printed use .
That is , the dictionary would be constructed by reading every book ever written and noting down exactly where in each book a significant use of every word occurred ; these citations would be used to write definitions and short histories of the words ’ uses .
In order to do this , Trench proposed enlisting the volunteer assistance of individuals throughout English - speaking countries by advertising for their assistance .
Over a period of 70 years , many hundreds of people sent in over 6 million slips with words and their interesting occurrences in thousands of books .
This resulted in the Oxford English Dictionary , the ultimate authority on English , with 300,000 words , about 2.5 million citations , 8.3 citations per entry , and in 20 volumes .
Compare this with the best effort by an individual Samuel Johnson who , over a 9 - year period , using the same methodology and a handful of assistants called amanuenses , produced a 2 - volume dictionary with about 40,000 words and in most cases 1 citation per entry .
As we look at these two works , Johnson ’s dictionary is a monument to individual effort and a work of art , revealing as much about Johnson as about the language he perceived around him , while the OED is the standard benchmark for dictionaries , the final arbiter of meaning and etymology .
Why Mob Software Works
Mob software works by involving a multitude of developers who are passionate about the software being constructed because it is important for them .
Mob software projects do not generally have deadlines , but efficiency is gained by more eyes , hands , and minds being applied to the work in general , fewer major releases are required to get to the same level of functionality and quality .
To get an idea , whereas a large software project by conventional standards might have 250500 developers , a mob software project can have thousands or tens of thousands of developers who are not only actively working on the software but using it every day under a variety of conditions .
Moreover , these developers span a range of talents almost no employer could afford to hire .
Further , these developers typically include some individuals who have remarkable abilities along with astounding disabilities they might not even be employable .
Among the main volunteers to the OED project was Dr. William C. Minor , a brilliant etymological worker who , during his entire 30 or so year involvement with the OED , happened to be locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane , where he suffered hallucinations that kept him awake all night most nights and where he eventually mutilated himself in the most horrific manner .
Once incarcerated , he was never entirely outside immediate and confining care .
Yet he was acknowledged as one of the most important contributors to the project .
Monolithic Development
Some might think that my claim that we do n’t know how to do massive software is exaggerated , that we do know and it ’s called SEI Level 5 , the highest maturity rating .
And the story that explains how things should work is not the one about the OED but the one about space shuttle software .
Lockheed Martin Corporation employs a Level 5 software group that puts together the shuttle software .
This software seems large , and it is written by a deliberate process .
Let ’s look at this .
The software is not very bigonly 420,000 lines of code .
This is not massive software it ’s off by a factor of 10 or 100 .
The software is monolithic , an unrealistic model for future systems .
The software was developed over a 20 - year period by a group of 260 people .
These numbers imply that each line of code has had 25 person - hours of attention , and that each person has been responsible for a little over 1600 lines of code  25 pages .
$ 700,000,000 was spent to develop this code , or about $ 1700 per line .
Further , the software had been completely specified in pseudo - code agreed to beforehand .
The task of a programmer in this regime is to translate pseudocode to actual code .
But , all this work does buy NASA only 1 error in each of the last three releases of the code .
Because we cannot afford to have deaths in the space program , the cost and effort are worth it .
The cost amounts to making each subroutine a career - long research project .
Twenty years , 8 hours a day , studying and eliminating errors from 1600 lines of code .
The mob -software theory is that this project needed 26,000 programmers , not 260 .
The job could have taken less than a year , probably with better quality , and a lot cheaper .
Better quality because the range of talent that could have been brought to bear would have been tremendously greater , and cheaper because most of the work would have been a gift .
( Motivating volunteers who cannot be users takes a culture of gift - giving we do n’t have yet . )
We cannot afford to inch our way up the learning curve , 1600 lines at a time .
We need to get things done fast while doing some learning along the way .
Gift and Commodity Economies
To understand what the open source and mob software movements are trying to do , it helps to make a distinction between a commodity economy , to which we are accustomed in a capitalist society , and a gift economy .
In a gift economy , gifts are exchanged , forming a bond based on mutual obligation :
In the simplest form of gift exchange , when one person gives a gift to another , the receiver becomes obligated to the giver , but not in a purely mercenary way rather , the recipient becomes very much like a member of the giver ’s family where mutual obligations are many , varied , and long lasting .
More sophisticated forms involve more than two parties in fact the cosmos may become involved .
A person may give a gift with the realistic expectation that someday a gift of equal or greater use value will be received , or that the recipient will pass on a further gift .
Sacrifices and many religious ceremonies are gift - economy based .
In an open - source project , the gift of source code is reciprocated by suggestions , bug reports , debugging , hard work , praise , and more source code .
Gift economies are embedded within non-economic institutions like kinship , marriage , hospitality , artistic patronage , and ritual friendship .
The bond is so like flesh and blood that the Greek gift economy persisted alongside a vigorously growing commodity economy for several centuries .
A gift has both economic and spiritual content .
It is personal .
In giving a gift the goal is to become as empty as possible .
In " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris wrote the following :
The aim of the gift economy is accumulation for de-accumulation ; the gift economy is above all a debt economy , where the actors strive to maximize outgoings .
The system can be described as one of " alternating disequilibrium " where the aim is to never have debts " paid off " but to preserve a situation of personal indebtedness .
 " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris
In a typical gift exchange situation , a patron would provide food and shelter to a poet in exchange for poems about the patron .
If you look at this exchange closely in the terms in which it was made , you can see it as a trade of life sustenance for memory after death .
Moreover , each would enjoy the company of the other at the dinner table , and in many cases the wit and eloquence of the poet would be a further gift to the patron and by the patron to his guests .
Notice that in this hypothetical exchange , the gifts are tangible and their value resides in how they can be used :
Food is used for sustenance and a poem is used to memorialize the patron in speech before death and in script after .
The gifts are thus inalienable their value cannot be separated from their identity .
In a commodity economy , the value of an item is abstracted into some other sort of object whose intrinsic value is unrelated to its " purchasing power . "
For gold coins this characterization makes less sense than it does for paper money , which is the ultimate abstraction : Paper money is completely real and yet unrelated to what it abstracts so much so that it is possible through the medium of paper money to make a completely fair trade between otherwise incommensurate things , such as 500 cotton candy cones for one handgun through the alienable intermediary of $ 500 .
In a commodity economy , money is an alienable object exchanged by independent transactors .
In such an economy there is no need for the poet to sit at the patron ’s dinner table , and in fact , the poet may have many anonymous and alien patrons who find the work fulfilling or not .
More than that , the poems the patron receives provide nothing personal to the patron at all , and the term " patron " inherently makes no sense whatsoever in this casealien patrons are merely donors .
Most importantly , the commodity economy let ’s call it capitalism depends on scarcity .
Its most famous law is that of " diminishing returns , " whose working requires a fixed supply .
Scarcity of material or scarcity of competitors makes high profit margins .
It works through competition .
The gift economy is an economy of abundance the gifts exchanged are inexhaustible , consisting of ritualized friendship and hospitality .
The gift and commodity economies have co-existed for millennia , generally with the most intimate relationships governed by gift , not money .
Tribes based purely on gift economies will barter and exchange money for goods with outsiders .
A healthy Western family operates on a gift economy .
For mob software to succeed in communities that include corporations , the source - code gift - based economy needs to thrive alongside the commodity economy hovering on its boundaries .
The following quote illustrates the difficulty of co-existence as observed in 6th century BC Greece .
In it , the Greek word xenia means " a bond of solidarity manifesting itself in an exchange of goods and services between individuals originating from separate social units . "
( Gabriel Herman , quoted in " Economy of the Unlost , " page 13 ) :
For whereas money is concerned to change the status quo , gifts aim to sustain it .
The profound conservatism of a gift economy secures its own continuance and moral prestige in two ways :
First , by derogation of all that is not gift .
We can see a deep distrust of money , trade , profit , commerce , and commercial persons pervading Greek socioeconomic attitudes from Homer ’s time through Aristotle ’s .
" Commodity exchange was not an acceptable activity for a Greek . "
[ " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris ] ...
At the same time , a gift economy likes to project its functions onto the cosmos ... as if the rules of xenia represent the way things are for gods and men .
" Economy of the Unlost , " Anne Carson
In the gift economy , the most empty individual is the wealthiest , being the most likely to receive gifts , while in the commodity economy , the richest individual is the wealthiest , being the most likely to receive further riches .
Trying to reconcile these two economies today will be tough because the gift economy must encroach on the commodity economy , not the other way around as it has always been .
Listen to Lewis Hyde :
... the exploitation of the arts which we find in the twentieth century is without precedent .
The particular manner in which radio , television , the movies , and the recording industry have commercialized song and drama is wholly new ....
The more we allow such commodity art to define and control our gifts , the less gifted we will become , as individuals and as a society .
The true commerce of art is a gift exchange , and where that commerce can proceed on its own terms we shall be heirs to the fruits of gift exchange : ... to a creative spirit whose fertility is not exhausted in use , to the sense of plenitude which is that mark of all erotic exchange , to a storehouse of works that can serve as agents of transformation , and to a sense of an inhabitable world an awareness ... of our solidarity with whatever we take to be the source of our gifts , be it the community ... , nature , or the gods .
But none of these fruits will come to us where we have converted our arts to pure commercial enterprises .

Xenia involves emptying one ’s self , and along with this emptiness comes the duende and with it risk - taking , creation , diversity .
The Chilean poet , Pablo Neruda , connected xenia and the duende in this story from his childhood in the southern frontier of Chile :
I looked through the hole [ in the fence ] and saw a landscape like that behind our house , uncared for and wild .
I moved back a few steps because I sensed vaguely that something was about to happen .
All of a sudden a hand appeared a tiny hand of a boy about my own age .
By the time I came close again , the hand was gone , and in its place there was a marvellous white toy sheep ....
I went into the house and brought out a treasure of my own : a pine cone , opened , full of odor and resin , which I adored .
I set it down in the same spot and went off with the sheep ....
Maybe this small and mysterious exchange of gifts remained inside me also , deep and indestructible , giving my poetry light .

Hooray for Literary Theory
The postmodern life is one of stories and personae .
Literary theory the study of how literature and art , in some cases , works forms one set of techniques for understanding the parts of our lives in common with technology .
One favorite concept is topos .
" Topos " is a term used in poetics and can be defined this way :
a conventionalized expression or passage in text which comes to be used as a resource for the composition of additional texts
 The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics
" Topos " literally means a place or location in Greek , and a topos is a place from which similar stories can be woven .
An example from literature is the Garden of Eden .
Anyone in a Western Judeo - Christian culture asked to tell a story about the Garden of Eden would likely come up with a story that was consistent with the " vision " of creation the Garden of Eden presents .
Topoi we ’re already familiar with include the shared purposes needed to build a cathedral or one of Dee Hock ’s chaords .
The Mob Effect Can Take Over , and Unexpected Plenitudes Ripen
The open - source community asked one question and answered it in a provocative way .
They asked : " What if what once was scarce is now abundant ? "
With their licenses they have found a gate through which some of us have passed .
Christopher Alexander said one very important thing that is relevant to us today :
And yet the timeless way is not complete , and will not fully generate the quality without a name , until we leave the gate behind .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " page 529
It is only when we forget the ideas behind building something wonderful that we can actually do the building that makes things wonderful .
Time and again I ’ve heard poets and musicians talk about the letting go required to make true art or music .
The battle to let go is the battle with the duende .
It leads us to the place where order meets chaos , where the phase transition between stability and flexibility makes things happen .
Unfortunately , the open - source community is extremely conservative , focusing solely on the need to build up slowly a parallel open infrastructure next to the proprietary ones already in place .
They are working on an operating system ; development tools like compilers , development environments , version control systems , and bug tracking systems ; web servers ; e-mail and other communications tools ; a desktop ; productivity tools ; web browsers ; and a small host of suchlike .
The image I have is of hackers encamped just outside a stone gate , carefully but joyfully building , well , cathedrals , just like those within the town .
From a long distance , they appear huddled by the gate as if frightened by what may lie beyond in the unknown .
It is a slightly bitter image .
Their philosophy is to build up a single reliable layer .
Although the classic open - source licenses permit forking , it rarely happens because a fork is a failure there is a right place to go and a right thing to build .
The design center is whatever the hacker community likes , because the motivation is to create a world of open source that companies can never take away from them .
It ’s a matter of liberation , and that ’s why it can be hard for companies to launch successful open - source projects .
One difference between open source and mob software is that open source topoi are technological while mob software topoi are people centered .
The Jini topos speaks of a world of " simply connect " and " spontaneous networks " accompanied by a set of home , office , and automobile scenarios derived from this topos .
The concepts of " simply connect " and " spontaneous networks " address how people relate to the technology .
The Jini topos was highly effective and created a thriving community and associated technology as hoped along with thriving E - Speak , UPnP , and SOAP communities and associated technologies .
Jini was one of the first explicitly mob-software projects .
The Apache topos speaks of web servers and technology for making them effective .
Consequently , while Jini projects tend to fan out creating new services for people to use , Apache projects tend to focus on adding web server functionality and adopting related technologies such as Java Server Pages , servlets , and XML .
Open - source projects tend to be convergent : Each project is aimed at a particular artifact in the end .
Mob - software projects tend to be different :
The goal is to build variety and diversity so that competitive forces and natural selection in the user realm can take over .
Both open - source and proprietary software projects are internally highly ordered :
In both cases there are only a few developers in core teams ; in open source , there is a halo of occasional or opportunistic developers who chip in work , fix bugs , and make small changes .
Proprietary projects are tightly managed by command - and - control systems ; open - source projects have small core teams led by module owners who are strict gatekeepers .
Both open - source and proprietary commercial software projects populate the world in an orderly fashion .
Proprietary software projects rationally pick and choose what products to make based on business goals , and hope scarcity does n’t kill them before they finish .
Open - source projects pick and choose what to build based on technological needs and desires , and fear scarcity of interested people .
Rarely in either regime is the flash of duende followed by natural selection as strong as we ’d hope for as strong as in a living system .
Mob software is about the boundary between order and chaos where life emerges and thrives .
What is it like , the landscape of mob software ?
Picture this :
All devices that include computing elements are connected , and their collective software forms one large system .
Pieces and chunks of this system sometimes go down or disconnectlater they might rejoin .
The collective software works together even though its parts exist in multiple versions of different ages .
Taken in the large , the software is continuously being upgraded and downgraded .
Some parts of the software are performance only ; other parts are private copies .
Almost all the source code for this massive systemestimated in the billions of lines of code is available under a license that grants total recombination rights :
Any fragment of source code can be used for any purpose .
Companies dip into this pool to collect pieces and parts to build custom software for their own use .
Doing this reduces their development costs to a fraction of what they once were .
Following the precepts of xenia , these companies , for the most part , return their custom code to the pool .
Other companies dip into this pool to create niche software ; they augment their businesses by supporting this software and helping their clients .
The foibles of modular parts are minimized because each potential part is scrutinized and accumulates usages and annotations about its applicability and limitations .
The part becomes productized , more like a library than a one of a kind ; its size and scope is adjusted in short , it evolves from many uses and public scrutiny .
Unlike a stray bit of code which needs to be inspected and understood before it is reused , its constant and varied use provides confidence .
Customization is easy .
Ordinary people trade and share customizations as easily as they trade and share recipes and thank - you - note templates .
Customizations are largely data and schemata which are used to generate customized programs just as databases today are so generated .
Many companies do customizations for various segments of the population who pay modest amounts for it .
Special interest groups perform customizations for their members specialized versions of software are created for the disabled , the exceptional , different vocations , and for different work and play situations .
These customizations are not merely cosmetic , but go deep into the software .
The variation in user interfaces for the same application is wider than the difference between punched cards and virtual reality .
The end - user has been brought into the design process , creating a whole new range and variety of business opportunities .
No more are interfaces designed for the hypothetical " average " person .
Each person can have his or her own interface without imposing on an overworked development team .
Programming is mostly a process of adaptation partially automated by swarms of small bots that perform tasks such as interface evolution .
All software development takes place on the common corpus of source code by a mob of volunteers and developers paid by companies who reap benefits from the source base .
Developers work primarily on projects of particular interest to them .
Allowing people to choose their domains of expertise encourages artistry and craftsmanship .
Mentoring circles and other forms of workshop are the mainstay of software development education .
There are hundreds of millions of programmers .
The literature of code and its study spawns a passion for beauty and diversity in software which combined with a deep interest in user experience sponsors a creativity heretofore rarely observed in software development .
Risk - taking and a willingness to open one ’s eyes to new possibilities and a rejection of worse - is - better make an environment where excellence is possible .
Xenia invites the duende , which is battled daily because there is the possibility of failure in an aesthetic rather than merely a technical sense .
These developments arise from the organization of the community built around source code .
This community has no fixed organization , nor is there a standard or typical way to work within it .
Projects spring up , fork , spawn other projects , mutate , continue on , shut down ; experimentation is encouraged ; rarely are standards set , but when they are , the process is adapted to the situation while respecting the basic rights of community members .
Like Dee Hock ’s chaords or the Jini Community , new parts of the organization are designed by its participants as needed , the design being informed by principles and pattern languages .
Rights , principles , and ethics for both individuals and corporations are encoded in these community principles and pattern languages .
The community has a culture similar to the current open - source culture , but it is much more accepting of users , especially novice usersit’s as if the spirit of xenia has raised to the highest status everyone with a stake in the community .
Users participate in design at all levels of scale , and projects are begun specifically to address the needs or wants of a particular user community .
Moreover , experimentation and risk - taking emerge from the individual small acts of the community acting as a group mind .
Because a basic infrastructure has already been laid down , the freedom to pursue new ideas has become possible .
Resource scarceness created by artificial boundaries no longer exists , and in an era of abundance , excess thrives .
Users and others create a new project by creating a topos for it this is very hard work .
By expressing a shared purpose , the topos , when honed and turned , becomes the attractor for developers to join in building its vision , in making it real .
The topos as a story - making story attracts and provides room for experimentation and variation beyond what the initiators envisioned .
Forces That Get Us There
This sounds fantastic I mean , it sounds like a fantasy .
But a fantasy like this happened within the last 10 years , and another is under way .
The World Wide Web was first envisioned as a way to publish and cross-reference scientific papers .
It was based on some of the least attractive technology ever to come down the road .
If , somehow , it were possible to limit our view to web pages created by technologists and technology lovers computer company sites , open - source sites , online computer ’ zines we would observe mediocrity , homogeneity , and bland .
Let ’s face facts :
As artists , we ’re good programmers .
But the technology was accessible to real people , and the Web grew almost boundlessly .
Many sites are unbelievable : sites by artists , writers , galleries , glass blowers , urban diarists , monasteries , punks , the Vatican , architects , people with weird pets , pornographers , gnostics , stores , and children .
We have cameras : Iguana Cam , Madagascar Hissing Cockroach Cam , Naked Molerat Cam , Corn Cam , and a range of cams best left imagined .
The lesson is simple :
When opened up to real people , technology can blossom .
The world envisioned by technologists is limited and flat , like the world of dog breeds when compared to the real diversity of species the world affords .
Under way is open source , demonstrating it is possible to do high - quality and effective , yet wildly distributed development with small snips of self - organization and freely available source code .
As companies join open - source projects over the next few years , communities increasingly will be built that include end - users of all stripes , and as desktop open - source systems are built , there will be increasing pressure brought to bear by the end - users for better usability , realistic customizability , and participation rights .
Performing software will put pressure on software development philosophy , and practitioners of performing software will more quickly see that we need to consider version maintenance and schema evolution applied to software modules .
As the code literature grows , we can start a literary discipline based on it and begin teaching code artistry once again a literature of source code , user interfaces , and execution performance .
When we do this we ’ll find that the durability , utility , and beauty of our software begins to take off until it is n’t silly to consider it a literature .
Economic sea changes do n’t come that often and we ’re in the middle of one right now .
Art , publishing , and music businesses are all changing , as are our ideas on copyright and intellectual property .
The economic exploitation of artists and writers is relatively new , and perhaps it wo n’t survive the drift back to the gift economy we ’re witnessing .
The names are silly , but for every Metallica against online sharing there ’s a Limp Bizkit in favor .
Stephen King is directly publishing on the Web .
Many of my poet and fiction writer friends are self - publishing or at least self - promoting and self - distributing using Amazon and all the rest .
This change is happening in the software world too , with some major computer companies heavily into open source .
As in 6th century BC Greece , we may end up with a hybrid of the gift and commodity economies find ways to adapt .
I ’ve spoken of gifts , swarms , mobs , repair , biology , failures , and the duende .
Mention of master planning , software process maturity levels , modular parts , mathematical reasoning , and all the other trappings of mainstream software development were either snide , sarcastic , demeaning , or insulting .
Software skill is a gift from an unknown and unknowable source perhaps the skill is an artistic talent , perhaps there are parts of the process of writing software that can be taught .
We can never move forward we can never move forward while the bulk of software work is done in secret and while wholly inadequate resources are given to it .
Currently , almost all software development work is carried out in a way that cannot result in beautiful , living , adaptable artifacts .
Unlike our friends in the built world , we just started to populate the landscape with beautiful software neighborhoods when the air hand of the commodity economy moved in like William Levitt ’s bulldozers and assembly - line house stampers .
The first Levittownonce called Island Trees was a postwar innovation in low cost housing in which a potato patch on Long Island was turned into the first mass - produced housing tract .
After the foundation was laid , specialized crews would descend on each lot one after another so fast that 18 houses were completed in the 8 to noon shiftone could say they used an especially brutal and efficient pattern language .
Many lamented the approach .
Peter Bacon
Hales wrote of the criticism :
The accusations against Levittown from the first focused on its relentless homogeneity , the cramped quarters of its interiors , and the raw , unfinished quality of its landscape .

Architects , artists , and even some computer scientists have used Levittown as an example of how modernism belief in reductionism and the ultimate value of the machine can lead to the deathlike morphology of late 20th and early 21st century life , the unimaginably dulling effect of sameness and inhumanity on ordinary lives .
I might have argued that , being made of nothing but modular parts laid out on curved roads , Levittown metaphorically epitomized what I find frightening and discouraging about contemporary software design and construction .
Postwar Americans needed affordable housing near jobs to raise the first wave of baby - boomers , not unaffordable aesthetics .
The houses were snapped up while trucks hauling tools and pulling trailers carrying bulldozers drove away toward their next project .
The architects , designers , builders , and developers did not care to learn from their projects , and the United States experienced an unending string of housing projects ever since that imposed a planned living experience on people bent more on living than on planning .
Levittown relied on wood framing , but many other projects cast their designs literally in concrete .
The Pruitt - Igoe apartments in St. Louis won architectural awards in the mid-1950s for low - cost housing design .
But the two complexes were simply steel and concrete highrise warrens in the mold of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier who said
a house is a machine to live in
" Cities of Tomorrow , " Peter Hall , page 205
and
the design of cities is too important to be left to the citizens
" Cities of Tomorrow , " Peter Hall , page 207
Seventeen years after being completed , the Pruitt - Igoe complex was dynamited , creating a vacant lot still mostly vacant , signaling the beginning of the postmodern era .
So in 1951 , the designers of Levittown designers just like us watched as families poured in to begin life in the carefully planned and constructed warrens relentlessly devised according to modernist principles of machine love .
The world , however , did not wait , but soon observed what followed on .
Nature , the Levittown community , and the duende did not care about the master plan :
The bulldozed landscape began to sprout trees and shrubs , and over a period of years as economic realities changed , the community developed a sense of innovation , and its inhabitants a control of their own destinies .
Not being trained as architects or builders did not faze them .
They thought locally and acted locally .
The community , through small acts of repair , transformed a homogenized and orderly Levittown into a place deserving the name Island Trees .
Customization , additions , remodels , landscaping , disorder the community , acting as a multitude or aggregation of persons regarded as not individually important as a mobmade Levittown over .
Let me finish by again quoting Peter Bacon Hales , art historian from the University of Illinois at Chicago , who wrote the following for the mob-infested World Wide Web :
The raw , new quality of the landscape , too , did n’t seem so awful to new renters and ( a little later ) owners , who knew that the trees and grass would quickly grow , and who understood the Levitt salesman ’s pitch promising opportunities to personalize the interior and exterior of your Levittown house .
Life [ magazine ] ran a contest , seeking the best - decorated Levittown house , and the winner was a rather startling red- themed Mandarin - Revival Sino - Asian extravaganza .
Over time , Levittown houses changed character , as their occupants rose in status and in economic wealth , and as families expanded and community standards of innovation and growth trickled from the home - improvement seminars at the Community Center and later the High School , out into the Saturday projects and summer vacation plans of Levittown residents .
Today ’s heterogeneous Levittown is a testimony to the resilience of the community ....
